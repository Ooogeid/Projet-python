1
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:36,035
You can't just barge in here like...

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,263
What did I tell you two
about talking to lawyers?

3
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:41,947
No, we didn't! We didn't!

4
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:43,959
You don't think I know
what goes on in my town?

5
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,003
When I tell you
not to do something...

6
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:52,551
Sit down!

7
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,472
Don't do it.

8
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,126
Now, get me the other hand.

9
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:03,396
Please don't. Please.

10
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,732
I swear, we didn't do anything.
Please! We didn't do nothing.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,179
The rich and powerful
take what they want.

12
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:15,893
We steal it back for you.

13
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:26,919
Sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

14
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,717
We provide leverage!

15
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,592
Season 3 Episode 6
<i>The Studio Job</i>

16
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:39,849
- I'm sorry. I'm still a bit shook up.
- That's all right.

17
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,309
- I got it.
- That's all right.

18
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:44,562
Thank you.

19
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:48,097
So, your brother...
Now, will he ever play again?

20
00:01:48,222 --> 00:01:50,551
Doctors say he'll be lucky
to move his fingers again.

21
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:53,266
Music was his life.

22
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:55,573
What Kirkwood did
was more than wrong. It was...

23
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,866
It was cruel.

24
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:01,829
Now, this guy Kirkwood
you said he has a reputation

25
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,540
for doing these kinds of things.
So why would you work for him?

26
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,709
He owns a record label, Mr. Ford.

27
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:07,710
So?

28
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,186
Put it like this.

29
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:13,938
The day I was born,
my mama said I looked at her, smiled,

30
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:15,843
and asked:
"Which way to music city?"

31
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,304
- He was your shot at stardom.
- Right.

32
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:21,644
He hired us to write songs
for other artists.

33
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,330
His more established artists.

34
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:26,771
It was good money, plus royalties.
And we thought we'd hit the jackpot.

35
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,817
- But when it came time to pay...
- He showed you the fine print.

36
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,109
Exactly.
He charged us rent to park in his lot.

37
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,532
He charged us for the pens we used.

38
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:36,034
He owns our publishing.

39
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,460
So the only difference
between Kirkwood and the majors

40
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,663
is that the majors use lawyers
to do their dirty work.

41
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,386
And our songs were good.

42
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:43,732
And they did well.

43
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:46,662
And before you knew it, he owed us
hundreds of thousands in royalties.

44
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:50,148
- You ever confront him?
- Instead of paying us,

45
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,788
he offered to record our own album
in his studio. No charge.

46
00:02:52,996 --> 00:02:55,257
And he said he was gonna get us
a spot on "Saddles & Spurs".

47
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,886
- "Saddles &Spurs", what's that?
- A big music festival in Memphis.

48
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:01,622
- All right. So, what happened?
- When he heard the album,

49
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:05,157
he decided it was too good to waste
on a couple of unknowns.

50
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,436
So he stole it!

51
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,443
The devil may have gone down to Georgia,
Mr. Ford, but he lives in Memphis

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,954
Mitchell Kirkwood. Record producer
and CEO of Kirkwood Records.

53
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,238
Now, here's a fun fact.

54
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,616
He started off his career as an artist.
Does anybody remember this?

55
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:37,672
I say we take him down
for that alone.

56
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:39,120
Critics agreed.

57
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:41,553
It's probably
why he never released another single.

58
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:44,675
He took all the money he made
and funneled it into his record company.

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,935
And judging by the number of lawsuits
filed and dropped within days,

60
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,688
I'd sait's not his first time forcing
somebody to settle out of court.

61
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,766
- Does he have a criminal record?
- None.

62
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:55,317
He carved out a nice little kingdom
in the country-music world.

63
00:03:56,558 --> 00:03:58,908
He stole Kaye Lynn's music.
He stole her money.

64
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:02,173
- He took over their publishing.
- Yeah, but we're gonnget it back.

65
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:05,123
I understand how to steal money,

66
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,829
but how do you steal music?

67
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,593
It's called a digital master.

68
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:12,339
It's high-quality, multi-channel,
studio-recorded, mixed, and engineered.

69
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:15,883
Price to produce: hundreds of thousands,
sometimes millions.

70
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,217
Now, this building right here...
Kirkwood records, Memphis, Tennessee.

71
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,965
Now, inside this building
is a hidden safe

72
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,386
that contains these digital masters,
one of which has Kaye Lynn's music on it.

73
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:28,714
- So it's a smash and grab.
- Not exactly.

74
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,656
'Cause we have to make sure
she gets back the money.

75
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,549
And a little extra
for hospital bills.

76
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,202
Making sure that he can't come
after them. That wouldn't hurt.

77
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:38,930
A fiddle game.

78
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,908
- Parker!
- I don't know how to play the fiddle.

79
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:48,045
Actually we're not gonna play a fiddle.
No. We're gonna sell one.

80
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,290
For a hell of a lot more
than it's worth.

81
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,393
- Y'all have a good night.
- Thank you very much.

82
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:16,695
Mr. Kirkwood!

83
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:18,322
Hello, Kelly.

84
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,784
Who is at my table?

85
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,581
- The computer said you canceled!
- Does it look like I canceled?

86
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,540
- But the computer...
- Go ahead.

87
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,099
Say it again.

88
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:38,196
Say something else
about the computer.

89
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,674
I'll put a table together
right away.

90
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,014
Kirkwood's on his way over.

91
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,980
Oliver, pour from my bottle.
Make it a double.

92
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:03,529
Why don't you put it
on my tab, there?

93
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,897
You're Mitch Kirkwood, aren't you?

94
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:08,003
Yes.

95
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,781
<i>Parker, I'm on my way
to the sound booth.</i>

96
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:33,642
Let's see
what our friend likes to listen to.

97
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:38,063
Most played: Brooks & Dunn.

98
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,447
I need tickets for Brooks & Dunn.
You got that, Parker?

99
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:09,219
You're not supposed to be in here.

100
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,040
Tell me about it, buddy.
Why are you here?

101
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,265
I work here.

102
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,446
Flippin' fantastical.

103
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:18,686
They call me on my night off
And gone and double-book it.

104
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,774
Better call the main office.
Find out what's going on here.

105
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,322
Please do, skipper.
'Cause if I got to work tonight,

106
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:27,312
then I need to find somebody to take
this Brooks & Dunn ticket off my hands.

107
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:32,546
You know what? I am starting to remember
something out having the night off.

108
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:35,496
Don't you think you should go on
and double-check that, butter britches?

109
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,539
I definitely remember now.

110
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,707
Really?

111
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:41,668
Think you can find somebody
to take this ticket off my hands?

112
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:43,741
I think I can find somebody.

113
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:46,175
Hot diggity dadgum. Let me...

114
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,858
Get you this...

115
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:51,011
Brooks & Dunn ticket, so...

116
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:01,438
Spick-and-span.
There it goes, right there.

117
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,733
Yes, it is. I must have dropped it.
Been there the whole time.

118
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:06,401
Whole time.

119
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:08,488
All right, thanks.

120
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,739
All right, you were right, man.
Give me a t-shirt.

121
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,555
I'm not gonna lie to you.

122
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,730
Being rich?

123
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,828
That'll get you the chicks.

124
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:19,977
- Here you go, Mr. Kirkwood.
- But you add to that, being famous?

125
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,568
I tell you...

126
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:26,362
I have the opportunity to turn down girls
prettier than this damn near every day.

127
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,967
That's really something.

128
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:34,595
Now, why would you
just stop at one song?

129
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,558
Same reason you manage musicians.

130
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:40,256
Why be the cow
when you can be the farmer?

131
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,981
Tell me about this kid you got.

132
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,226
His name is Kenneth Crane. Right?

133
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,562
Now, a couple of years ago,
we took his best song,

134
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:50,831
we put it on a demo tape,
and we sent it out everywhere.

135
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:53,508
Two days ago, this european lady,

136
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,638
she offered $25,000
for the rights to that song.

137
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:58,880
$25,000?

138
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, what did you say to that?

139
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,551
Well, that's the thing.
I didn't know what to say to her.

140
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:08,803
You know? And she's sitting right
over there waiting on an answer.

141
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,308
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

142
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,496
Do you know her?

143
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:19,197
No. No. Not

144
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,556
Not really,
but I tell you what I will do.

145
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,730
I will go over there for you...

146
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,398
Talk to her, see if I can't...

147
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,651
- Get her to show her hand.
- That's amazing. You would do that?

148
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:31,948
Hell yes, I would do that.

149
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,282
Local boys got to stick together.

150
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:43,957
Let the fiddle games begin?

151
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,211
Yeah. I'm still a little unclear.
Where, exactly, is this fiddle?

152
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,176
It just walked through the door.

153
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,535
- What are you looking at?
- Don't!

154
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,075
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

155
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,226
I startled you.

156
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,069
You're a cat burglar.
That's what you do.

157
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:15,831
- Yeah, since I was 10 years old.
- Don't...

158
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:17,118
Really?

159
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:20,300
Maybe not, but this is
the first time I've startled you.

160
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,788
- He's nervous, Parker.
- <i>I'm not nervous.</i>

161
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,031
- I thought you said you could sing.
- I can sing. I just... I didn't...

162
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,843
Realize there was
gonna be this many people.

163
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:31,446
You are nervous.

164
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,007
Relax, man.

165
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,593
I told you. I got you.
Say something.

166
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,439
- I don't speak on command, Hardison.
- Perfect.

167
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,881
Now, I rigged my laptop
to record your comm.

168
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,986
Now, this means that
I can alter your pitch

169
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,115
from anywhere to make you
sound like darth Eliot...

170
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,426
<i>I don't speak on command, Hardison.</i>

171
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,001
- To spencer smurf.
- <i>I don't speak on command, Hardison.</i>

172
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:56,029
- Don't ever do the smurf thing again?
- Right.

173
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:59,754
So, the software takes
the frequency of your voice,

174
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,629
and it matches it
to the key of the song,

175
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:03,787
then uses a fourier transform
to correct the pitch

176
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,331
and sends the tuned audio out
through the bar's speakers.

177
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:07,958
What does that mean?

178
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,978
That means that, for tonight,
Eliot has perfect pitch.

179
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,812
You ever wonder how britney spears
sounds so good on her tracks?

180
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:17,092
Well, this is it...
except mine's is in real time, baby.

181
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,261
Who did you just refer to as "baby"?

182
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:24,016
It's like the universal term of "baby".
How old are you?

183
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:33,480
All right.

184
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:36,820
- Where is he?
- I'm sorry?

185
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:40,177
Beautiful girl like you couldn't
possibly be sitting here all alone.

186
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:41,584
Where is he?

187
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,786
This must be that southern
charm I've heard so much about.

188
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,140
Mitchell Kirkwood.

189
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:52,059
I seem to have stolen your table.

190
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,130
You must be a very important man.
Should I know you?

191
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:58,800
They give one of these to just about
anybody who happens to own the place.

192
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,110
I will let you make it up to me...

193
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:03,138
by allowing me
to give you the nickel tour.

194
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,790
And I won't even charge
you the nickel. Come on.

195
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,272
Virginia. Virginia Ellington.
My things gonna be safe here?

196
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:14,070
At this table, they will.

197
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:41,551
Worcester studios.
How may I direct your call?

198
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,688
Are you nervous?

199
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:04,908
That song...
You're going out there to sing?

200
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,536
That's the only thing
my brother and I have left

201
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,674
that Kirkwood hasn't
stolen or destroyed, and...

202
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,953
- if I lose it...
- You're not gonna lose it. All right?

203
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,927
We're gonna get you your money,
we're gonna get you your music back.

204
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:18,088
I promise you.

205
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:21,853
How can you be so sure?

206
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:25,887
'cause this is what we do.

207
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:35,480
You still having trouble
with that bridge?

208
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,987
No. I think...

209
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,359
Let me...
Let me show you.

210
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:43,215
When you strum...

211
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:46,172
Just do this, all right?

212
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:47,541
So...

213
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,085
"G".

214
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,145
Right.

215
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:54,832
- You have "D".
- "D".

216
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,072
Right.

217
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,089
- You got "G" again.
- "G".

218
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:04,176
"A" minor.

219
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:06,864
- Now the "G".
- "G". From the top.

220
00:14:12,878 --> 00:14:15,923
- Good. That's right.
- That's right.

221
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:20,415
How do you feel when you play?

222
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:23,990
I think...

223
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,072
I think I got it.

224
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,437
See, that's your problem.

225
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:33,177
You're thinking...

226
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:35,743
about how to play the song.

227
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:38,274
And I'm asking you:

228
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:41,046
"How do you feel when you play?"

229
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,174
You ever been in love?

230
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:46,468
Once.

231
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:47,962
How'd it end?

232
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,056
I made her a promise that if she ever
needed men that I'd be there for her.

233
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,682
What's wrong with at?

234
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:56,019
Because I made the same promise
to the United States government.

235
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,771
And I found out...

236
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:01,036
You can't make that promise
to me than one person.

237
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,401
That feeling?

238
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:05,785
Right there?

239
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,199
Hold on to that,
and you'll do just fine.

240
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:15,705
- All right. Here you go.
- What is it with thicity and ribs?

241
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,292
- Why don't you try one and find out?
- No. I couldn't. I just...

242
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,784
- Mr. Kirkwood.
- Excuse me.

243
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:24,923
She's a record executive
from England.

244
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,758
Okay, Hardison. How are we doing?

245
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,637
- Ready when Eliot is.
- <i>Tell me something.</i>

246
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:34,891
Why would a star like k-gent send
you all the way here from London

247
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,511
to sign an unknown
unsigned country singer

248
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,705
and give him $25,000
for a song on a demo tape?

249
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,271
Congratulations, Mr. Kirkwood.
You've impressed me.

250
00:15:44,396 --> 00:15:46,913
- And I'm not easily impressed.
- I didn't think you were.

251
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:49,828
- You gonna tell me how you did that?
- I want you to tell me first.

252
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:50,953
Right now.

253
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:52,909
It's very simple.

254
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:56,079
Box of demos, lying around t studio,
waiting to go to the rubbish.

255
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,960
K-gent picks one up.
Who knows why?

256
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:02,958
Next thing we know, he's sampled one
of the tracks on his new album.

257
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,458
And you came here
to offer the kid $25,000

258
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,716
before he realized
he had won the lottery.

259
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:09,966
Something like that.

260
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:16,958
Hi, I'm Kenneth Crane.

261
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:21,014
And I'm gonna sing a song...

262
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,395
I'm gonna sing
a song I wrote about...

263
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:24,941
The road not traveled.

264
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,971
- Nate, something's wrong.
- All right. What is it?

265
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,403
The system's not working.
Something's wrong.

266
00:16:58,528 --> 00:16:59,726
No, it's fine.

267
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,979
No, it's not fine. I'm looking at it.
It is not correcting his voice.

268
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,910
That's because
it doesn't need correcting.

269
00:17:24,114 --> 00:17:25,752
You know who he sounds like.

270
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:30,946
Don't let the manager leave.

271
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:56,256
I think you and I need to talk.

272
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:04,661
How'd I...

273
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:06,561
How'd I do?

274
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:08,708
That was amazing!

275
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:31,930
Hang on.

276
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,262
Mr. Kirkwood wants to see you.

277
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,250
He knows where I am.

278
00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:47,976
Or you know...

279
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:50,604
I could go to him.

280
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,640
Eliot, how soon can you get here?

281
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:02,742
- On our way, Nate.
- You!

282
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,671
You lied to me.

283
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:09,123
This is for tomorrow night.

284
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,936
You offered, what?

285
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:13,513
$25,000?

286
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:16,923
I happen to know that you would pay
half a million dollars for that song.

287
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:20,176
Fortunately for me,
he doesn't know that.

288
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:23,438
Fortunately for you, his manager
and I happen to go way back.

289
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:24,806
We did 4h together.

290
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:27,559
It's a cowboy thing.

291
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,734
Why don't you let me see if
I can't nudge the deal along for you?

292
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:34,918
And what would you want, exactly?

293
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,861
I'll think of something.

294
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,746
You two work out together?

295
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,250
I'm just gonna leave my card
and get going here.

296
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,898
<i>Listen, I gotta go take
care of my musician.</i>

297
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:56,773
<i>You know how artists get.</i>

298
00:20:57,512 --> 00:20:58,339
<i>Sit down!</i>

299
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:05,938
Nate, I'm on my way!

300
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,419
Get in here!

301
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:12,044
Who do you work for?

302
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,814
Forever 21! Don't hit me!

303
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:18,902
I'm not gonna...
What are you doing here?

304
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,375
I just want your autograph.

305
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,348
Tried to leave,
so I'd get a little rough.

306
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:35,460
They got into a fight, these guys.

307
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,197
Something about reps versus sets.

308
00:21:37,322 --> 00:21:39,464
To be honest,
I wasn't really paying attention.

309
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,488
That is how you run a fiddle game.

310
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:57,939
I don't even know
how to begin to thank you.

311
00:21:58,064 --> 00:22:00,818
And that's just 10% of it. Tomorrow,
he's taking Eliot into the studio,

312
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,592
- we'll get you the other 90%.
- And while Eliot's in the studio,

313
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:05,949
Parker will get into the safe
and grab the masters.

314
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:08,767
Eliot's the fiddle!

315
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,829
What's she doing back there?

316
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,980
She's trying on her costume.

317
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:16,334
We sold Eliot to Kirkwood.
I totally get this.

318
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,658
Supposed to be some hot shot producer.
Works for k-gent.

319
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:25,527
And he came all this way just
to produce one song?

320
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:26,702
I guess so.

321
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,249
Now, listen.

322
00:22:28,374 --> 00:22:30,723
Anything he wants, you get.

323
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,867
Understand?

324
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:32,992
Anything.

325
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:42,151
Welcome to Kirkwood records.

326
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,455
I'm JC.

327
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,834
Anything you need,
you just let me know.

328
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,116
First of all, my man, real quick,
lose the attitude.

329
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,243
Second of all, yes, it's her.
Breathe.

330
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:51,912
I'm okay.

331
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,470
If I could get you
to fill out these visitor badges...

332
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,130
Did you just look her in the eyes?

333
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:04,424
I don't think I was.

334
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,741
Chill with the attitude!

335
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:08,011
Don't raise your voice!
Did they not tell you nothing?

336
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,138
You know who you in front of?
Think about it.

337
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,146
Iceland. Pop star. Figure it out.

338
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:15,136
Click it together. Bells and whistles.
Give me something!

339
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,269
Bjor...

340
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:22,859
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

341
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:26,029
Is the duck? Good.
Woman, for real. Get up in here.

342
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,781
Mommy, real quick.
I hope, for your sake,

343
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,827
that you was not about to say
what I think you was about to say.

344
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:34,829
I don't think I was.

345
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:37,799
What I'm gonna need you to do
is just roll up out of here, cuz,

346
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:40,602
'cause you messing up the aura.
We was cool. We was vibing.

347
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:42,834
Great.

348
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:46,045
I'm gonna get going
on that paperwork.

349
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:49,302
You do that.
So I can start recording this hillbilly.

350
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,430
I crossed an ocean, a pond,
and a creek to get here.

351
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:55,058
Eliot, you got an ETA?

352
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,977
Yeah. I'm almost there.
But I think somebody's following me.

353
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,605
Do some Eliot-fu on 'em.
What happened to...

354
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,273
<i>"This is what I do"?</i>

355
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,985
I don't think
that's gonna work this time.

356
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:13,756
I been meaning to tell you,
this Kenneth Crane?

357
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:15,661
He is blowing up on twitter.

358
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,206
He's got a fan page.
It's a pretty good picture, too.

359
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,833
<i>That's the problem. I can't have
my picture out there like that.</i>

360
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,635
Contrary to what y'all may believe,

361
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,137
I do not control everything
that happens on the internet.

362
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:27,392
There's a price on my head
in three different countries,

363
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:29,358
and I'm fairly certain
a fatwa was issued!

364
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:31,296
<i>You are so vain, man.</i>

365
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:35,618
Boom. There. Fan site. No.
But you know what?

366
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:38,136
When you get back,
we gonna have us a serious conversation

367
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:40,291
about the difference
between caution and paranoia.

368
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:43,031
When you've done the things I've done,
there's no such thing as paranoia.

369
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:50,471
Seriously?

370
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:52,073
For breakfast?

371
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:01,076
What, did Kirkwood
just walk in or something?

372
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,551
How'd he find us?

373
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:05,024
There's probably not
a lot of five-star hotels in Memphis.

374
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:07,824
You should probably
justact the part, ride this out,

375
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:09,743
be in character.

376
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,570
You should probably
storm off about now.

377
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:15,304
I thought I'd givet another beat.

378
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:17,976
Okay, then.

379
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,406
Perfect.

380
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,895
The other man in Memphis
I'd like to slap.

381
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,235
Just relax now, little filly.

382
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,326
I am perfectly aware
that you went behind my back

383
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:30,338
to get the rights to that song.
So let's just cut to the chase.

384
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,821
What do you want?

385
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:34,293
Mr. Crane arrived just a moment ago.

386
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,997
He's just setting up
in his studio now.

387
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,205
- All right. Let the magic begin.
- You're not joining them.

388
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:44,375
And risk being tainted?

389
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:45,710
By what?

390
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:47,013
Exactly.

391
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:50,855
Which way to the meditation temple?

392
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,404
You know, we do have a few rooms.

393
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:57,406
Just...
Actually, right this way...

394
00:25:57,531 --> 00:25:59,265
That way's great, too.
That's perfect.

395
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,686
Parker's on the loose,
but there are a lot of unfriendlies.

396
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:05,688
<i>Which is exactly
why we have cover stories.</i>

397
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,211
How's Eliot?

398
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,901
He's good. He's about to record.
So he took his comm out.

399
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:15,031
Too much clutter.

400
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:17,116
You ready, man?

401
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,109
All right.

402
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,879
Hold up, man. It's a little pitchy.

403
00:26:30,543 --> 00:26:32,398
It's just a scosh.

404
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:33,633
A little pitchy.

405
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:38,603
Not enough clutter.

406
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:41,849
It's pitchy.

407
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,613
In that very same spot, right?

408
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,646
It's a little pitchy.

409
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:48,419
Hold up, man.

410
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:50,335
Hang on, man.
Let me get into the song.

411
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,164
Did you practice your warbles?
Just put a smooth it out. Like...

412
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:10,057
Water! Hurry!

413
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:17,635
How's it going, parker?

414
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:20,137
I don't think
I'm being weird enough.

415
00:27:21,231 --> 00:27:22,665
Somehow I doubt that.

416
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:26,076
Okay, sugar, I got your water.

417
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,878
This isn't from an iceberg!

418
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,285
I don't think we have that here.

419
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,814
Fine.

420
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:46,526
Just...

421
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:48,499
Bring me some champagne.

422
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:08,365
Listen to me, man.
Say "pitchy" one more time.

423
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,396
Say "pitchy" one more time
and see what happens.

424
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:12,738
I don't even think that word means
what you think it means.

425
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:13,622
"Pitchy".

426
00:28:13,747 --> 00:28:15,234
- Define it.
- You define it.

427
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,999
I don't have to define it!
I'm not saying it every five seconds!

428
00:28:18,124 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm sorry. I can't...

429
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,182
I lost you. I can't hear you.
I'm sorry...

430
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:26,420
Maybe the safe is off-site.
I've looked everywhere.

431
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:35,963
Isn't the recording studio
supposed to be soundproof?

432
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:37,645
Yeah, completely.

433
00:28:44,492 --> 00:28:47,187
Here's the master
from the Kenneth Crane session.

434
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:03,657
I don't understand.

435
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:07,671
You just paid $ 100,000
for the rights to that song,

436
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,456
and you're just gonna
give them to me for free.

437
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,810
That's just about
the lay of the land.

438
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:17,094
You must want something.

439
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:22,009
I would like you to forget that you
ever heard the name "Kenneth Crane."

440
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,022
Why would I do that?

441
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:26,150
I'm thinking about getting back
into the spotlight,

442
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:29,218
and I don't think there's anything
that would jump-start a career any more

443
00:29:29,343 --> 00:29:32,561
than having a song of yours sampled
by a major rap superstar.

444
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:35,934
You're gonna steal Crane's song
for yourself?

445
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:39,485
How are you gonna get him
to go along with that?

446
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:42,704
I wasn't exactly gonna give him
a choice in the matter.

447
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:47,618
I guess there is one more thing
that you can do for me.

448
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,431
Stop asking questions.

449
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,530
Talk to me.

450
00:29:56,903 --> 00:29:58,492
We have a little problem.

451
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:01,173
- <i>What kind of problem?</i>
- The guy who's buying our fiddle?

452
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,317
He thinks he is the fiddle.

453
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:06,225
Yes, sir.

454
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,230
I'll take care of that first.

455
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:18,107
You're not done yet?

456
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,608
He's doing one for him.

457
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:21,402
I found it.

458
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:26,296
Let's see.

459
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,810
Got it.

460
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:32,853
This is that song Kirkwood did.

461
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:36,500
This is the original master.
Why is the artist's name blacked out?

462
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:46,051
Come with me.

463
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:03,235
Try telling this guy that.

464
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:12,828
Get up.

465
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,083
So, this is the original recording
of the song

466
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,877
that made Kirkwood famous.

467
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,806
And this is the recording
he released to the video.

468
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,442
- It's not the same.
- Which one is Kirkwood?

469
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,963
That's just it. Neither.

470
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:47,290
It's the same song,
just with a pitch adjustment.

471
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:49,182
Then, who's singing the song?

472
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:54,078
I am matching
a voice print right now.

473
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:57,825
Where's Eliot?

474
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,072
Got it. Boom.

475
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:10,083
Jesse Jenkins.

476
00:32:10,374 --> 00:32:12,818
All right. That's why Kirkwood
never recorded a second song.

477
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:14,458
He didn't record the first one.

478
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:16,350
Kirkwood paid him off?

479
00:32:16,972 --> 00:32:19,270
I don't think so.
Jenkins sued him.

480
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,605
Copyright infringement,
harassment, fraud.

481
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,582
The whole nine, but...
those charges weren't formally dropped.

482
00:32:24,707 --> 00:32:27,111
- They went to court?
- <i>Not exactly.</i>

483
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:28,779
Any other guesses?

484
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:37,324
Jenkins was killed.
Circumstances were suspicious.

485
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:39,517
Kirkwood was implicated
but never charged.

486
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:40,874
<i>Dead on. How'd you know?</i>

487
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:44,503
<i>Because he is about to do
the exact same thing to Eliot.</i>

488
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:56,660
Let's go! Now!

489
00:33:05,435 --> 00:33:07,976
All right. Good.
I do love it when a plan comes together.

490
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:14,825
Yeah, but where's the tape?

491
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:18,287
I think I may have left her tape
in the deck.

492
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,874
- Unbelievable!
- Where are you going?

493
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,745
When they find Kaye Lynn's tape, they
gonna want to ask her some questions.

494
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,504
We know they don't ask
questions nicely, do they?

495
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,256
Damn it, Hardison!

496
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:37,848
You okay?

497
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:40,971
The festival director just called.

498
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:44,063
Kirkwood took my spot
in the showcase.

499
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,440
He's gonna sing my brother's song.

500
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:49,506
And you told me you were gonna get
our money and our songs back,

501
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:52,392
but all you did was lose
the only thing I had left!

502
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,706
Come with me. Trust me.
What's the plan?

503
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:04,500
Come back to the hotel.

504
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,344
We're rework the approach.
Hit him hard in a couple of days.

505
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:09,201
Kirkwood's getting ready
to sing this song

506
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:11,173
in front of the who's
who of country music.

507
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,965
It's too late to stop him tonight.

508
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,861
No, I hacked into his truck's
navigation system. He's on the move.

509
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,471
- It's game over.
- <i>Eliot,</i>

510
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,598
if he plays that song
in front of those A&R's,

511
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:22,452
- I'll lose it forever.
- <i>Eliot, it's too late.</i>

512
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:25,295
Help don't help,
but don't tell me it's too late!

513
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,355
Put that on.

514
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:36,031
Sometimes,

515
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,796
you don't get a second chance
to get it right.

516
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,877
- Why not?
- Rule of life.

517
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:44,493
But that's exactly what we do.

518
00:34:44,618 --> 00:34:46,041
We change the rules.

519
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:57,052
Where's Kirkwood right about now?

520
00:35:08,616 --> 00:35:10,482
We got three blocks, Jesse. Go on.

521
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,608
Go!

522
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,194
- I can't move.
- Give me the CD.

523
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:19,651
All right, come on, girls!
Get out of my...

524
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:22,032
I'm trying to get somewhere.
Get out of here!

525
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:28,022
<i>Eliot, I used your fans
to stall Kirkwood.</i>

526
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:29,773
<i>I bought you like two minutes.</i>

527
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,844
- We're here.
- <i>Is Kirkwood there?</i>

528
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:42,055
I don't see him.
Wait.

529
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,177
He just walked in.

530
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,086
Got it.

531
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:59,573
- All right. A few more minutes.
- <i>Eliot, I'm sorry.</i>

532
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,346
We did everything we can.

533
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,794
Maybe not everything.

534
00:36:50,596 --> 00:36:53,116
- Surprised to see me?
- Why would you say that?

535
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:55,059
You tried to kill me.

536
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:57,714
Same way you killed Jesse Jenkins.

537
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:03,387
You're unstable, Kenneth.

538
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,357
And I'd really like to help you...

539
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,753
If you'd let me.

540
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:18,189
You think I'm gonna confess to
a murder in a roomful of microphones?

541
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,002
If I was that stupid,
I never would have gotten away with it.

542
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,198
<i>Let's put an end to amateur night</i>

543
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:32,441
<i>and give a warm welcome
to Mitchell Kirkwood!</i>

544
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,756
<i>How about it?</i>

545
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:05,302
<i>She's wonderful! Isn't she?</i>

546
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:09,221
<i>The same way you killed
Jesse Jenkins.</i>

547
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,983
<i>You think I'm gonna confess to
a murder In a roomful of microphones?</i>

548
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:16,603
<i>If I was that stupid,
I wouldn't have gotten away with it.</i>

549
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:23,276
You think I'm gonna confess to
a murder In a roomful of microphones?

550
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:26,294
- <i>If I was that stupid...</i>
- And you make fun of earbuds.

551
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:30,367
That was a...

552
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,385
That was a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
Very funny joke. I'll be right back.

553
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:36,875
How about that?
Give it up for her.

554
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:43,547
Let me explain something to you.
Next time you hit somebody in the stomach

555
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,661
and you want 'em to stay down.
You gotta hit him in the solar plexus!

556
00:39:52,084 --> 00:39:53,300
See the difference?

557
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,397
Easy, buddy.

558
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:05,669
This is a number
where you can reach me at.

559
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:07,946
All right. Just a sec.

560
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:14,084
There's a lot of A&R's
who want to meet with me.

561
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:16,091
Thank you. For my brother, too.

562
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:18,373
For what?
It was all you.

563
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,834
Thank you for keeping your promise.

564
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:22,586
Speaking of that...

565
00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:29,176
That's yours.
That's for your trip to Nashville.

566
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:33,221
You can come with me, you know.

567
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,058
You're a natural-born country star
if I've ever seen one.

568
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,102
Maybe the next Johnny and June?

569
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,335
Some roads,

570
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:57,294
you start going down,
you can't turn back, and...

571
00:40:58,078 --> 00:41:00,247
I'm about 10 miles down
one of those right now, so...

572
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:01,603
Excuse us. Kaye Lynn?

573
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,644
I sound like a bad country song.

574
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:08,932
I have some folks
I'd like for you to meet.

575
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:10,634
We have so many ideas for you.

576
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:21,155
Ready?

577
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:27,026
How'd you take
those two guys out by yourself?

578
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,184
- They got into a fight.
- How'd you do it?

579
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:31,803
- Can't say it any plainer.
- You're not gonna tell me.

580
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:33,812
And where were you
when all this going on?

581
00:41:33,937 --> 00:41:37,399
What? I was getting notes
from Kaye Lynn on my performance.

582
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:40,605
- How were you?
- No complaints.

583
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,073
Excuse me, sir?

584
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,254
All right.
This is the last one, sweetie.

585
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,131
I just wanted to know
what time it was.

586
00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:51,303
Yeah, I know.

587
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:55,134
It's late.
Go home. It's past your bedtime.
