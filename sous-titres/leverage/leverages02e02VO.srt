5
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:19,354
He's yours. Hands up, son!

6
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:32,061
- Yeah!
- You got him. Come on!

7
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,310
Stay with him, Mark! All right!

8
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:53,316
Mark?

9
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,532
Mark? Son!

10
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,850
Find your feet, now.

11
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,312
Thataboy, Mark!

12
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:13,081
Cover up, Mark!

13
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:21,081
Cover up, Mark!
Cover up, son!

14
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:24,222
Get out of there,
Mark!

15
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:30,667
Get off!

16
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:35,905
Mark, can you hear me?

17
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:39,381
Stay with me, Mark.

18
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:40,398
Mark!

19
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:43,569
Get the paramedics!

20
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:46,174
Hang on.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,000
Stay with me, Mark.

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,781
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

23
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:56,022
We steal it back for you.

24
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:04,004
And sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,068
We provide...

26
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,199
leverage.

27
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,249
Somebody drugged his water.

28
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:19,424
It's an old boxing trick.

29
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,951
He couldn't defend himself, and... -

30
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,849
He's still in the hospital.

31
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,412
Mark was undefeated.

32
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:35,352
A couple days before the fight,
Rucker told him to take a dive.

33
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,888
I thought, Rucker was your son's manager.

34
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:38,889
He was.

35
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:44,004
But with Mark being the favorite,
he got great odds on tank, so...

36
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:45,305
we fired him.

37
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,007
And I guess that news
didn't go over so well, huh?

38
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:50,208
Rucker ain't a man used to
hearing "no" around here.

39
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,644
You must have known that Rucker
was gonna try something during the... -

40
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,429
During the fight. Something dirty.

41
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,069
I never thought he'd take it this far.

42
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,623
Besides, we couldn't pass up that purse.

43
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:04,299
It's five grand. That's the biggest
payday we've ever seen.

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,478
See, I lost my job when the plant closed.

45
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,600
Mark gave up his wrestling scholarship
to come home and help out.

46
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:13,820
So he poured asphalt all day,
and he trained all night.

47
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:16,263
Only reason we can afford
the hospital is 'cause of Jonny.

48
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,808
Jonny? The ring doctor.

49
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,223
He's my cousin.

50
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:24,981
Mark was real good, Mr. Ford.

51
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,623
He had a shot,...

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,259
a real shot, at moving up in the sport.

53
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,690
Now, Jonny says he'll never fight again.

54
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:37,724
That's Jed Rucker.

55
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:40,738
He runs a homegrown mixed martial
arts league here in nebraska.

56
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,696
They have a very strong
wrestling tradition here, so...

57
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,057
the talent pool is pretty deep.

58
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,752
Wrestlers have a good base
for a blended training approach.

59
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:51,973
They can go from that to jujitsu, kickboxing, judo.

60
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,439
Rucker promotes fights.

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,258
And manages fighters, taking
a cut every step of the way.

62
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:00,587
Yeah, you know, plus he's not above
fixing bouts, as the Howorths found out.

63
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:03,469
We've dealt with some lowlifes,
but when I heard about this guy...

64
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,308
that was a nice takedown.
Good ground and pound.

65
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:08,918
He's a little sloppy in a closed guard,
but it's a solid armbar.

66
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,541
I mean, you can tell
this guy's a wrestler.

67
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,828
This ain't the UFC,
but these guys got skills.

68
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,923
- Hardison, where did you get these?
- Online.

69
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,448
They're viral videos.

70
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,903
See, Rucker doesn't have a TV deal,
it's pretty much a bare-bones operation.

71
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,661
You call this a sport?

72
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,557
Yeah, this is a sport.

73
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:26,531
These are some of the best-conditioned
athletes in the world. Are you kidding me?

74
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,847
It's about precision, technique, skill.

75
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:31,629
Like cockfighting.

76
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:35,576
It's not a cockfight. All right? Let me show you
something, Hardison. Come here. Can I borrow you?

77
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:38,115
All right. Square up.
Remember what I showed you?

78
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,266
Are you...

79
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,201
There's three phases to an MMA --

80
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:45,774
To an MMA fight, okay?

81
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:46,979
One, striking.

82
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:51,717
Nice. Next is grappling - The takedown.

83
00:04:52,302 --> 00:04:53,312
Exactly.

84
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:57,413
All right. The third one is jujitsu. Okay,
try to isolate a joint. That's good.

85
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:59,431
That's a textbook armbar, Parker.
Put some pressure on there.

86
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,643
- Like this?
- There you go. Or you can go for a choke hold.

87
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:02,632
She got to be choking me.

88
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:04,241
- Remember that thing that I showed you?
- Oh, yeah. The choke.

89
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:07,192
Lock that in. All right. You don't have to
hold the arm. See, that's a triangle choke.

90
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:11,168
That's nasty. Puts pressure on his
carotid artery, and the guy will submit...

91
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,032
- by tap out.
- Eliot, I'm tapping! I'm tapping!

92
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:16,905
- These fights are won by inches, I'm telling you.
- I can't breathe!

93
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,566
- All about leverage.
- Yeah,...

94
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,444
- it looks really painful.
- It is painful!

95
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:23,755
No TV deal, you said, huh?

96
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:27,762
Hardison, what are this guy's
 other interests, this Rucker guy?

97
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:30,819
- Seriously, you ask me a question right now...
- I'll take that.

98
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,761
Yeah, rotary club, golf membership.

99
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:34,385
- Golf, huh?
- Help me!

100
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:37,509
Yeah. I mean, this guy's like
a 1950s sitcom character.

101
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,593
He plays a weekly game
with the local businessmen.

102
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:42,184
In fact, last year,
he won the club championship.

103
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:44,635
- Did he? Hmm.
- Let me go!

104
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:47,384
- I guess it's...
- She's killing me!

105
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:49,894
...it's time to hit the links.

106
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,908
I'm cool.

107
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,819
Just let me go real quick.

108
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:59,743
I'm sorry, Mr. Rucker. The pro shop
says your fourth is on his way.

109
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:02,455
He's from out of town and
apparently got stuck in traffic.

110
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:05,676
I'm really sorry. These things happen.

111
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:08,874
Sorry, boys! Late night.

112
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,742
What do you feed these gals from nebraska?

113
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:14,683
Viagra-frosted corn flakes or what?

114
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,298
Can we get started?

115
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:21,614
Sure, sure. Let's get started.
What are you playing for here?

116
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,133
Huh? Oh, come on, now.

117
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:27,233
We got to make this pitch-and-putt
a little bit more interesting, huh?

118
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:30,692
We usually do $100 Nassau, a press a side.

119
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,418
- Mr... -
- Wells. Bill wells.

120
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,302
Yeah. A hundred bucks, huh? Yeah,...

121
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:37,993
well, I tell you what.
As exciting as that sounds,...

122
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:40,511
how about we up it to two grand.

123
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:44,400
Oh, come on. Come on. Don't tell me
you're scared by a little action here.

124
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,174
I'm sure that ford dealership and...

125
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,400
right here, meat packing plant over here,...

126
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,969
you had some good years, didn't you?

127
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,474
What is it you do?

128
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,365
- I run a gym.
- Oh.

129
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,985
Pilates or yoga?

130
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,009
What do you say, Omaha?
Just me and you? Hmm?

131
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:05,602
Your buddies here
can loan you the cash.

132
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:10,013
I won't need no cash,
Mr. Wells. Two grand it is.

133
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:14,166
Front nine, back nine - Eighteen. $6,000 total.

134
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:15,428
Sound good?

135
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,346
All right. Let's do it.

136
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,875
Good luck.

137
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:38,941
Now, this is what you'll be playing.

138
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:41,971
I replaced the core with
a torus of high-density polymer.

139
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:44,642
When it spins, it creates a gyroscopic effect.

140
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:49,642
You could hit this thing with a garden hoe and
it would fly straighter than an army parade.

141
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,537
Whoo, look at that.

142
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,438
What are those initials for?

143
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,273
You know what that means?

144
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:03,693
Quite a shot.

145
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,015
Nice shot.

146
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,849
Now, this is what Rucker will be playing.

147
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,090
It's got thermal nanotech
inside - Like RFID chips,...

148
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:18,278
but ones that heat up and allow me to redistribute
the energy upon impact from the club head.

149
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,420
I can bend it like beckham, baby.

150
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:47,799
Boy, you hate to see that, don't you?

151
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,750
Yes, I do. Come on. Let's play.

152
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:12,793
Hey!

153
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:14,549
Come on!

154
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,284
Watch yourself.

155
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:46,703
Hardison.

156
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,968
It's downhill, right?

157
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:51,919
Yes, keep going 7 inches, man.

158
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:55,617
Oh, geez.

159
00:09:58,523 --> 00:09:59,721
Hey!

160
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,193
Well, you know, not bad for a practice round.

161
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:04,364
Time to settle up, Omaha.

162
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:08,114
What are you - What's all this?

163
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:09,927
You know, I didn't expect
much from you yokels,...

164
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:11,381
but, what, are you welshing?

165
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:14,171
Hey, I'm not gonna welsh, Mr. Wells.

166
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,776
I just must have dropped my wallet.

167
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:17,803
- Must have dropped your... -
- Look for my wallet.

168
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:20,112
What is... - You know,
I've heard all kinds of thing.

169
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:23,088
But listen, I'll tell you what.
I'm staying at the Derby Hotel.

170
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,890
Pay me tomorrow. No checks.

171
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,620
Guy never missed a shot.
It was unbelievable.

172
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:37,195
His name's Wells.
He's staying at the Derby.

173
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:38,592
Ginny works the front desk there.

174
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:41,813
Yeah, why don't you give her a call.

175
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,881
I want her to see if she
knows why he's in town.

176
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:54,553
And see how he got a
tee time at the club. I mean,...

177
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,932
what are we, the local muni now?

178
00:10:56,933 --> 00:11:01,343
All right, work it out!
Work it out! Come on, now!

179
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,266
Look at this, here.

180
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:06,719
That's it.

181
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,183
Pick it up.

182
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:09,722
Lazy bastard.

183
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:11,406
Son of a bitch.

184
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:19,010
Oh, there. Hey, there, Omaha.

185
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,011
Hey.

186
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:22,526
Yeah, it's not that
I don't trust you, it's just... -

187
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,697
Well, I don't trust you.

188
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,093
What is it you said you were doing
in Lincoln again, Mr. Wells?

189
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,265
Business.

190
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,585
- And what business is that?
- Well,...

191
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:36,202
right now, betting against Nebraskans
is proving pretty profitable.

192
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:37,387
Am I right?

193
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,038
Yeah, I guess you are.

194
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,647
I'm just saying. Is that my money?

195
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:44,888
Yeah, this would be yours.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,470
Have a good day.

197
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,709
I want to close at 11:00 tonight.

198
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,017
Come here.

199
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:01,997
Look who's still here.

200
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:05,779
- Who's he talking to?
- He's a walk-in.

201
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,912
You want to keep an eye on the Wells guy?

202
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:11,437
Not Wells. I want you to keep
your eye on that other guy... -

203
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:12,588
the fighter.

204
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:27,235
Sorry for not properly introducing myself.

205
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:29,016
Name's Jed Rucker.

206
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:32,785
Welcome to the Rucker fighting method.

207
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:41,956
Tommy.

208
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:46,339
Wait!

209
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,623
Now, that's it. Enough.

210
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,570
Get over there.

211
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,006
And who the hell are you?

212
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:26,802
Uploading video now.

213
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,688
Got it.

214
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:33,007
See, Online video websites,
they track viewer hits by IP Address...

215
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:35,300
so the trick is to just spoof a bunch of IPs,...

216
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,563
then...

217
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:39,661
write a script that lets you
browse the video page...

218
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,359
via the proxy list and...

219
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,720
That's great. We got a feed on
the security camera at the gym?

220
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:47,661
Yeah, yeah. The feed's on the TV.

221
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:50,438
Oh, well, how come we're not
hearing it? Where's the audio?

222
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:51,694
We got audio?

223
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:52,787
Huh? No.

224
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:54,683
Oh, but the earbuds work.

225
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:56,347
<i>Room service. Can I help you?</i>

226
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:57,821
Yeah, no, I can't eat this. I'm sorry?

227
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:59,774
Everything on my plate is yellow.

228
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,736
<i>- It's chicken-fried steak.</i>
- It's what? Chicken-fried steak?</i>

229
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:03,580
<i>- Yes.</i>
- No, let me just tell you, all right.</i>

230
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,797
Meat should never be used as an adjective.

231
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:07,307
Sophie, how's he doing?

232
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:09,576
How's he doing?

233
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:12,046
He's about to set the hook.

234
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,778
It's a hell of a welcoming
committee you got here.

235
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,476
Oh, that? Yeah. We put all
the newbies through that.

236
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:27,346
We call it the gauntlet.

237
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:29,598
I can see you've had some training.

238
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:33,002
- Some.
- And Wells - What, he's your manager?

239
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,821
He runs a league out of South Dakota.

240
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:36,158
South Dakota?

241
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,434
- There's no athletic commission there.
- That's the way he likes it.

242
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:41,854
Kind of under-the-radar. Action's raw.

243
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:44,163
Lot of amateurs trying to
make a name for themselves.

244
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:46,754
So, so, what's he doing here?

245
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,027
No, you... - Don't worry, son.
You can talk to me.

246
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:52,758
I can make it worth your while.

247
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:57,088
He's here looking for talent.
You know, some fresh blood.

248
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,094
Why?

249
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,466
I don't know.

250
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:04,506
He sent me here to see if I could
spot anybody worth poaching.

251
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:05,698
Is that right?

252
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:06,957
Look, I...

253
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:10,564
All I know is that he has a meeting
with some woman tomorrow...

254
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:13,815
and I got to find guys before then.

255
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:16,619
So, he has a meeting? Here?

256
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,374
Hm, that's interesting.

257
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:23,085
Come up to the office. We'll have a drink.

258
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,008
Here you go.

259
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:27,521
Thanks.

260
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,169
So,...

261
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,765
tell me...

262
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:32,606
what's her name?

263
00:15:33,206 --> 00:15:37,126
I'm supposed to pick her up from the airport.

264
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:41,502
She's coming in from L.A.

265
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,593
Miss Debbie Dreiling.

266
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:53,135
Dreiling-produced TV special Drwas Boffo Ratings

267
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:54,676
She's a producer.

268
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:57,172
Dreiling Event Sets Pay-per-view Record

269
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,708
Wells is working a TV deal.

270
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,570
- He found the stories.
- Okay. Now trip the news alert.

271
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,629
So, come fight for me.

272
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,147
I can't.

273
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:25,307
What's he paying you, three-and-threes?

274
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:26,638
Five-and-fives?

275
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,007
- You under contract?
- Sort of.

276
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:31,991
I owe him money.

277
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,210
So you're his grunt.

278
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:37,074
- You're working it off.
- I collect debts, you know.

279
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:40,811
Work security, bust noses.
Sometimes he lets me fight.

280
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:43,078
Well, let me tell you something.

281
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,109
This wells is an idiot.

282
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:47,932
It's a real waste of talent.

283
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:50,374
See, most of these guys,...

284
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,615
they're pieces of meat,...

285
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:55,015
like the cows they butcher at work.

286
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:57,072
But they come to my gym
every night 'cause they think...

287
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:59,665
if they work hard enough
and fight hard enough,...

288
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,463
that they can make it to Vegas.

289
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:02,938
And the UFC.

290
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:05,149
And energy-drink contracts.

291
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,146
And that's the dream I sell them.

292
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:11,458
They listen to me because
I can take that dream away.

293
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,643
Now, you... -

294
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:15,097
You're different.

295
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:19,648
You fight like something's
trying to get out of you.

296
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,065
So, tell me.

297
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:26,518
How much you owe Wells?

298
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,075
You can trust me.

299
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,320
I'm here to help.

300
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:32,188
Hardison, his financials.

301
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:35,260
I know, I know. I told you
back home, it's all a big mess.

302
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,240
No, come on. I need
something now. I mean, he's... -

303
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:40,744
His money's all over the place. Just give
me a minute to plow through this, man.

304
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:43,018
Okay, Eliot. Eliot, say,...

305
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,111
20 grand.

306
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,416
- 20 grand.
- Well, I can swing that.

307
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,349
I can even bump someone off my next card.

308
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,869
You'll be fighting within days.

309
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,000
But I'll need something in return.

310
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:55,375
I'll need you to bring this Miss...

311
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,552
Debbie Dreiling to me.

312
00:17:57,983 --> 00:17:59,663
Before Wells.

313
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:02,655
Now, you do that,...

314
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,876
and I'll get you out.

315
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:08,450
I'm starving.

316
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:12,831
I found these in the minibar.

317
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:16,748
"Pork Rinds"?

318
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:19,014
How do you peel a pig?

319
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,221
Well, this guy, he just... -
he give me the creeps.

320
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,860
We've gone up against
rougher dudes than this before.

321
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:27,324
I know. But it's this whole
treating people as commodities.

322
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:29,171
This whole barbaric sport.

323
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:32,830
Hey, don't lump these guys in with Rucker.
All right, he's not what the sport's about.

324
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,401
Eliot, this "sport" is about two guys
beating the crap out of each other.

325
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:39,468
MMA fighters act with more respect
than any other athlete I've seen.

326
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:42,172
- Yeah, they're "braveheart." I get it.
- No, you don't.

327
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:45,341
These guys don't fight because they
like hurting other people, all right.

328
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,821
They fight to gain some sort of control:

329
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:50,933
Over their opponents, over their
environment, over their lives.

330
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:53,095
Have you seen this town? Huh?

331
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,497
The farms are drying up.

332
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:57,261
The only stores are bail
bondsmen and pawn shops.

333
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,826
And there's nothing
they can do about it.

334
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:02,806
So, yeah, they get in the ring and...

335
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,057
try not to let it all suffocate them.

336
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,250
And it's about two guys beating
the crap out of each other.

337
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,670
I'm not saying that this bill wells is a liar.

338
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:23,552
It's just that he overpromised.

339
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:25,335
What are you telling me?

340
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:28,335
That he doesn't have the
product that he says he did.

341
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:31,215
Sweetie, I think you may be
operating on some misinformation.

342
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:33,252
I'm just in town to produce a show.

343
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:36,423
But you're also here closing
a TV deal with Wells and,...

344
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:38,434
I'm guessing, a pay-per-view package.

345
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:41,151
But the thing is, he doesn't
have what you need.

346
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:45,422
And that's why he's
trying to steal my fighters.

347
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,618
Excuse. I'm gonna... - I got to take this.

348
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,879
Say what you're saying is true.

349
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,863
What exactly are you telling me?

350
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:57,034
That you don't need him.

351
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:59,161
He's a middleman.

352
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:04,435
- You need me.
- My, my. What a little shark you are.

353
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:08,101
Are you sure we didn't have
lunch at the ivy last week?

354
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:10,647
Just trying to make you feel at home.

355
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:13,728
Little midwestern hospitality and all.

356
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:16,628
You hungry?

357
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:19,455
Because they serve a mean
chicken-fried steak here.

358
00:20:19,456 --> 00:20:20,478
No.

359
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,502
I'm fine.

360
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:30,247
Well, bottom line is, you need good product.

361
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:33,726
What event are you here to produce?

362
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:34,786
On it.

363
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:36,870
There's a tractor pull in grand island,...

364
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,732
a livestock show in council bluffs...

365
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:43,023
White people doing other white things...

366
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:46,460
Sophie, there's a Trianna concert in Omaha.

367
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,472
Trianna?

368
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,264
She's that teenybopper kid's star.

369
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,671
She's got a show on that kid's network.

370
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:53,690
Trianna.

371
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:55,780
At the Mid-American Palace?

372
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:58,581
That's a hot ticket. So let's
say you've got Trianna... -

373
00:20:58,582 --> 00:21:00,250
Yeah, right. Enough. Enough's enough.

374
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,530
I'm sorry. Monkey boy here was supposed
to take you to the hotel. It didn't happen.

375
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:07,829
All right, sweetie. I was just catching
up with the local welcome wagon.

376
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,281
Yeah, all the more reason I'm sorry.

377
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,531
Well, I really enjoyed our conversation.

378
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:14,364
Perhaps we can continue it
at the concert later?

379
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:17,332
- Pardon me?
- Turns out I'm going to the big show.

380
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,853
Maybe we could meet up there.

381
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:23,082
Of course. Definitely.

382
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:27,617
Well, I look forward to it.

383
00:21:28,398 --> 00:21:29,647
Mr. Wells.

384
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,747
Trianna? Really?

385
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:40,002
Hey, man, look. You're lucky I didn't
give you a monster truck rally...

386
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,744
- on an Indian reservation.
- Now what?

387
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:45,225
To hook this guy, we have to
convince him Sophie's the real deal.

388
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:46,573
How are we gonna do that?

389
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:49,094
Let's go steal us a concert.

390
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:59,933
So, look, the concert's already televised,...

391
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:03,005
so all we got to do is show
Rucker a TV production truck.

392
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:06,113
- We're in charge.
- That means clearing out the real director.

393
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:08,759
Yeah, he's coming in from L.A.
Network's flying him in.

394
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,145
Come on! Come on!
Give me something! Come on!

395
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:13,598
Is this gonna take long?

396
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,460
No. Two shakes. Are you in a hurry?

397
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,027
Even half a bar... - what?

398
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:19,619
Yes. Hurry.

399
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:22,224
Does anyone in this backwater
hellhole know what that means?

400
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:25,796
You're a director, right?
What was your name again?

401
00:22:25,797 --> 00:22:28,302
What? It's Laurence. Todd Laurence.

402
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:32,123
Well, listen, Mr. Laurence.
See, I wrote a script...

403
00:22:32,124 --> 00:22:33,844
- Huh?
- Yeah.

404
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:36,590
It's about a limo driver
who solves mysteries.

405
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:38,467
Till his wife leaves him for --

406
00:22:38,468 --> 00:22:40,216
- For the love of god!
- ...the best part:

407
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:43,120
The feed store manager. Right?

408
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,136
- His wife,...
- Yeah...?

409
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:47,727
- tramp... -
- Hey, hee-haw,...

410
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,695
move the car! Okay?

411
00:22:58,406 --> 00:22:59,926
What was that?

412
00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:02,670
Lug nuts.

413
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:17,523
So, I'm Todd Laurence?

414
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:29,825
Ladies, please, look. For the last time,
I am not the tailback for the cornhuskers. Go!

415
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,747
I don't even know what a cornhusker is.

416
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:33,498
What about the crew?

417
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:36,723
Remote units are always crewed locally, so they
never would have met the director, anyway.

418
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:37,822
Right.

419
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:41,917
That's two handhelds
on stage, two steadicams,...

420
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:44,036
three slashes, two robos, and a beauty.

421
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:46,807
Yeah, that's 10 cameras in total.

422
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,761
Thanks. There's a reason Fightingnet...

423
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,051
turned to me to find a package
to launch their channel.

424
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:52,839
And that's what you want from Wells?

425
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,558
He's giving me programming. Yes, the UFC
is booming but the fans want more.

426
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,560
Real guys in real fights.
That's what Wells is giving me.

427
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:01,952
That's what he says he's giving you.

428
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:04,699
- Now, who's paying for all this?
- My production company.

429
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,375
Costs us around $500,000.

430
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,838
And for that, trust me, you get the best.

431
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,054
Like our director here.

432
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:13,097
Camera three!

433
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:14,593
Move off of her!

434
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:16,786
She's hideous. The chick is packing, trust me.

435
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:19,667
Trianna doesn't have any pretty fans?

436
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,853
Todd Laurence ain't happy.
I'm not happy. This is some bull.

437
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:26,193
Seriously, guys, I thought we were running
a professional show here, people.

438
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:27,819
Run that back. Give me a replay.

439
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,060
I'm sorry. Did I stutter?

440
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:33,093
You heard the man!
Give him some replay!

441
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:35,239
In exchange, we get
the pay-per-view profits.

442
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,219
With Wells' fights, we'd start small.

443
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,140
Maybe 10 bucks a buy.

444
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,503
Well, that's a quarter
of what the UFC charges.

445
00:24:41,504 --> 00:24:44,041
Well, you need to be competive in this economy.

446
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:48,667
Fightingnet thinks we'd get
500,000 viewers, conservative.

447
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:51,203
- That's about...
- That's $5 million.

448
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:52,326
Is that a year?

449
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,626
Sweetie, no.

450
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:55,729
$5 million an event.

451
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,372
We'd do five, six a year.

452
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:59,253
So just so we're clear.

453
00:24:59,254 --> 00:25:02,343
You spend $500,000 to make $5 million?

454
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:05,452
It's called deficit financing.
It's how TV works.

455
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:07,607
And all you need is a product?

456
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,796
Well, that's what they are: Products.

457
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:13,301
You get the girls with Trianna,
you get the boys with MMA.

458
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:15,401
And there's always another
fresh-faced princess...

459
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:18,183
ready to go through the
singing/dancing mill in Florida.

460
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,498
Occasionally, we let one be a lesbian.

461
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:23,089
Keeps the press on their toes.

462
00:25:23,384 --> 00:25:25,064
- I want in.
- Oh!

463
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:27,439
It's not that easy, sugar.

464
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,823
I have an agreement.

465
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:31,072
Agreement? The man's a fraud.

466
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,394
That's why he's here,
trying to steal my fighters.

467
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:35,476
But guess what. I already
stole his best fighter,...

468
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:37,405
and have him slotted into a card this week.

469
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:41,113
But Wells has already agreed
to put up half my production costs.

470
00:25:41,114 --> 00:25:44,754
Well, how's this? I'll put up all of it.

471
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:45,912
Sweetie,...

472
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:48,581
you're talking half a million
dollars of your own money.

473
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:51,340
No, no, no. That's not gonna work.

474
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,862
Well, look, you said it yourself,...

475
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:55,582
you need product,
and that's what I've got.

476
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,111
You and I, we understand
each other. We think alike.

477
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:02,235
And I've got an equity line
on my gym I can tap.

478
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:04,896
You'll have the money tomorrow.

479
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:10,859
Well, then, call me when you
have your funds together.

480
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,030
I'll bring the paperwork.

481
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:18,043
- Did you get all that?
- Got it.

482
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,293
Great job.

483
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:23,133
We should be on our way home
by this time tomorrow.

484
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:24,884
You sure about that?

485
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:28,451
And you checked the other place, too?

486
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:30,482
No one's heard of him?

487
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,233
Either of them?

488
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:35,838
Yeah, all right. Thanks, Jimmy.

489
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:37,985
Jed?

490
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:41,918
Oh, start printing up the posters. I want a
good crowd when fightingnet comes down.

491
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,524
- Jed, listen.
- Also, call logan at the bank,...

492
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:45,432
- and have him start up the paperwork.
- Jed!

493
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,791
Remember my cousin Jimmy in South Dakota?

494
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:48,618
Sure, I do.

495
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:51,227
He knows every promoter
and manager in the state.

496
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:53,384
Never heard of Bill Wells.

497
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:54,569
Is that right?

498
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,456
Also, Ginny says someone came by
to visit Wells at the hotel.

499
00:26:58,457 --> 00:26:59,834
You know who it was?

500
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:00,835
Who?

501
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:02,118
Jack Howorth.

502
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:07,685
Mark's father. The kid
Tank beat up the other night.

503
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:09,082
They're setting me up.

504
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,480
Want me to call the police?

505
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:12,832
No. No police.

506
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,723
Let's show them how we deal
with con men in Nebraska.

507
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:25,578
Hey.

508
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:27,901
Saw this in town.

509
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:30,076
Oh, yeah. It'll be a good gate.

510
00:27:30,077 --> 00:27:32,171
Lot of interest in the new boy.

511
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,825
The message boards are blowing up.

512
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:36,699
He's gonna fight tank here.
Tank, come here.

513
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,014
I want you to meet Debbie Dreiling.

514
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:41,675
She's gonna make us all rich.

515
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:45,973
Now, this is a lot of money.
I need to know it's in good hands.

516
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:47,338
You're making a good bet.

517
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,937
I want to know I'm making a great bet.

518
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:51,923
So, where are your partners?

519
00:27:51,924 --> 00:27:54,686
Waiting for you to blow me off?

520
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:56,665
I'm sorry, I don't know what you... -

521
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,215
Well, let me tell you what.

522
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:01,732
Alex's cousin Jimmy is in
the fight scene in South Dakota.

523
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:06,003
And guess what -
He's never heard of Bill Wells.

524
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:10,681
Sweetie.

525
00:28:11,353 --> 00:28:13,539
I think you're getting a little paranoid.

526
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,314
So you think you can come to my town, huh?

527
00:28:16,315 --> 00:28:18,733
Us country bumpkins, right?

528
00:28:18,748 --> 00:28:21,363
'Cause all we can do is kick ass.

529
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:25,144
I'll show you what us ass-kickers will do.

530
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:27,593
All right. Leave her alone.

531
00:28:27,594 --> 00:28:30,674
Oh, Look who's here. Wells.

532
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:33,238
So, where's the rest of your crew?

533
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:35,872
- In the getaway car?
- Yeah, all right.

534
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:39,100
Parker, Hardison, break it down.
We're out of here. Come on.

535
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:41,599
Oh, you talk in a wire, huh? Pretty fancy.

536
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,630
Yeah, nothing but the best for you, Rucker.

537
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:46,358
Yeah, well, we're not all frauds.

538
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,428
People do want to see you fight.

539
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,123
So why don't you take on Tank here?

540
00:28:51,124 --> 00:28:53,619
I got five seconds to kill out of my day.

541
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,070
No, no, no. Not here, Tank.

542
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,434
But, you know, you're probably right.

543
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,915
We've seen what you can do.

544
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,414
But that's the thing.
You know, see, you're favored.

545
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:06,288
So I'm gonna need you to take a dive.

546
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:07,575
Come on.

547
00:29:07,973 --> 00:29:11,523
Fine. Go back to L.A. Or wherever.

548
00:29:11,628 --> 00:29:13,602
It's a shame you won't be here next month,...

549
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:17,033
when Jack Howorth's house goes on fire.

550
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:22,352
Or in six weeks, when Mark has a car accident.

551
00:29:22,353 --> 00:29:25,993
But you won't be around for any of that.

552
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,176
- I'll do it.
- You don't have to do anything.

553
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:30,427
Yeah, I do.

554
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,319
And then you lay off the Howorths.

555
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,058
You do what you have
to do and they'll be fine.

556
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,391
But I'm betting it all on Tank here,...

557
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:40,613
so it can't look like a fix.

558
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:43,274
And feel free to use the gym.

559
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:47,642
We don't want anybody
to think you're not ready.

560
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:56,081
What?

561
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,802
What was I supposed to do?
It was cousin Jimmy.

562
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:00,621
He's right. We couldn't
have planned for that.

563
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:02,060
Look, you know what I can do?

564
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:05,172
I can re-task a satellite,
I can get a level 3 NSA clearance,...

565
00:30:05,173 --> 00:30:08,560
- but I can't hack a hick.
- All right, it doesn't matter.

566
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,683
- What do we do now?
- We can move the Howorth.

567
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,287
We're not moving the Howorths.

568
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:14,367
All right? This is their home.
That means something to people here.

569
00:30:14,368 --> 00:30:16,108
Yeah, we can't babysit them forever.

570
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:18,553
We've taken out bigger
players than this. You know,...

571
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:20,011
there's got to be some way...

572
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:22,467
- something we can...
- No, no!

573
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:23,804
I take the dive.

574
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:24,999
You sure?

575
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:26,073
Give me some time, okay?

576
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:29,382
I've found some funny business in Rucker's
accounts. I can move some things.

577
00:30:29,382 --> 00:30:33,271
Forget the fact that we just got
beat by barney fife, all right?

578
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:39,642
This is the right move. Tactically it's
the right move. You all know that.

579
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Hey.

580
00:30:55,681 --> 00:31:00,346
Listen, you don't have to do this, you know.
Nate's gonna come up with something.

581
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:03,213
I'm losing a fight, Sophie.
I'm not diving on a grenade.

582
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:04,386
I'll be all right.

583
00:31:04,387 --> 00:31:07,116
Yeah, I know. I'm not talking physically.

584
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,431
I think my ego can handle it.

585
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:12,820
Look, you told me that it's about control,...

586
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:16,532
about knowing that you're
never gonna be the victim.

587
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:19,963
And that's what keeps you going, right?

588
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:27,844
You think I'm upset 'cause I got
to let this guy kick my ass?

589
00:31:28,602 --> 00:31:30,912
I learned a long time ago,...

590
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,680
you can't control the violence.

591
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,250
I can take the punishment.

592
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:37,893
That's what I do.

593
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:44,495
What I need to control is not out there.

594
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:46,983
It's here.

595
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,395
Always.

596
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:10,729
<i>Tank!</i>

597
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,740
<i>Tank!</i>

598
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:36,412
All right, Tank. Go for his ribs. All right?

599
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:39,989
Engel!

600
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:42,424
- Did you place that bet?
- Yeah.

601
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:45,554
Wasn't easy.  No one local would
handle that kind of action,...

602
00:32:45,555 --> 00:32:47,680
so I had to lay it off on a
bunch of different bookies online.

603
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:50,970
Well, that's fine. At least I can't
get ripped off by one guy.

604
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,451
Are you sure you want to bet it all?

605
00:32:53,452 --> 00:32:54,928
What if this guy doesn't go down like he said?

606
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:56,850
Don't worry. He'll go down.

607
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,777
I've got an insurance policy.

608
00:32:58,778 --> 00:32:59,826
Tank!

609
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:03,996
Don't go easy like you did on that last guy.

610
00:33:03,997 --> 00:33:09,807
I want you to teach him a lesson
and break every bone in his body.

611
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:30,003
So, your friend knows
to stick to the plan, right?

612
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:32,076
He goes down, and I collect on my bet.

613
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,947
And you leave the Howorths alone.

614
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:38,443
And you get the hell out of my town.

615
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:42,155
All right. Listen to me. Listen to me.

616
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:45,536
You make it look good,
but not too good, all right?

617
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:48,960
Don't make it go past the second round.

618
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,106
Let's go!

619
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:53,870
Ready?! You ready?!

620
00:33:53,905 --> 00:33:55,137
Get it on!

621
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:22,653
<i>Tank!</i>

622
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:35,613
- What the hell is he doing?
- You told him to make it look good, didn't you?

623
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:50,291
Come on, now! Reel him in!

624
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,433
You drugged him, didn't you?

625
00:35:09,434 --> 00:35:12,855
Why?! He already said he'd go down!

626
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:19,735
What makes you think I would trust a bunch
of lying grifters to keep their word?

627
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:24,392
Get the doctor, Parker. Now.

628
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:26,039
No need. It'll be over
in a couple of minutes.

629
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,260
Oh, my... - You don't get it, do you?

630
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:31,530
Eliot's not like other fighters.

631
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:33,243
He doesn't play games.

632
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:36,644
He fights to survive, that's his training.

633
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:37,779
Break it up!

634
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,628
It takes all his control
not to kill somebody.

635
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:44,668
You've just made him more dangerous.

636
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:47,889
You've taken the safety off the gun.

637
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,395
Break it up!

638
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,920
Come on, now! Break it up!

639
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:13,055
Come on. That's enough.

640
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:15,632
Come on. Let go of him.

641
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:18,083
That's enough. Get off him.

642
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:22,612
Yeah, we need a doctor here.

643
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,361
Easy. Easy does it.

644
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:27,884
Tank!

645
00:36:40,337 --> 00:36:42,078
All right. Everybody out.
Come on, come on. Let's go.

646
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,883
Hey, Lookit. Get everyone
out of here now. Out!

647
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:47,701
- Come on, everybody!
- Let's go! Get out!

648
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:51,383
Everybody get out of here. Come on.
Keep it moving. We're closing soon. Come on.

649
00:36:51,384 --> 00:36:53,137
Fight's over, people!

650
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:55,548
Go! Everybody out! Come on.

651
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:57,143
- What the hell just happened?
- What the hell are you doing?!

652
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:59,168
- You could have killed him!
- You know how much you just cost me?

653
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:00,046
I'm gonna make you pay.

654
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:01,773
- Make me pay, huh?
- We had a deal!

655
00:37:01,774 --> 00:37:03,784
Hey, listen to me!

656
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:05,548
Tank is dead!

657
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:13,171
- No. No, wait.
- You killed him.

658
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:16,059
- Wait a second, doc. Look, are you sure?
- There's nothing I can do.

659
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,331
- Listen to me! He could just be out!
- I've got to call the police.

660
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:20,598
No police! Listen to me! Listen... -

661
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,207
Listen, we can work this out.
Keep it in the family.

662
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,470
- I'll make it worth your while.
- There were hundreds of witnesses,...

663
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:28,470
plus we've got a dead body.
What am I supposed to do about that?

664
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:30,871
And also, we ain't family.

665
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:34,542
All right. All right.
You're right. You're right.

666
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,373
You call the police,...

667
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:38,027
and I'm gonna... -

668
00:37:38,163 --> 00:37:41,523
I'm gonna call the athletic commission.

669
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,594
- What are you doing?
- Where's tonight's gate receipts?

670
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:47,659
What?

671
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,529
- The gate receipts!
- In the safe, as usual.

672
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:53,873
You're running? Why?

673
00:37:53,924 --> 00:37:56,212
This was an uninsured,
unsanctioned fight.

674
00:37:56,213 --> 00:38:00,483
I could be on the hook
for millions in liability.

675
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:02,750
There's probably gonna be
a manslaughter charge,...

676
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:04,360
and I could be an accessory.

677
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:06,483
I'm not taking the fall for that.

678
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,567
Besides, none of this is
worth anything anymore.

679
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:11,695
- Wait.
- Get out of my way!

680
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:12,696
Jed!

681
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:28,061
- Parker, you got him?
- Yep.

682
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:29,109
He's gone.

683
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,801
- You plant the transmitter?
- Wired to his gps.

684
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,528
Looks like he's headed to Iowa.

685
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:43,036
Make the call.

686
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,733
- What's going on?
- Just give me a sec.

687
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:49,606
- Doc, You got Tank, right?
- Yeah. Oh, he'll be fine.

688
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:53,013
- Should come around in a few minutes.
- Wait, wait. He's not dead?

689
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:55,916
Succinylcholine. It's a mild paralytic.

690
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,368
It only works for a few minutes.

691
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,167
Yeah, it was just enough to scare off Rucker.

692
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:00,445
So Eliot...

693
00:39:00,446 --> 00:39:03,453
No, no, no. We found the drugged
water bottle before the fight,...

694
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:04,921
switched it out with a clean one.

695
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:08,407
Rucker's not too original when it comes
to this kind of thing, apparently.

696
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:10,134
So, Jonny, you were in on this?

697
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:12,706
Mr. Ford and his friends
came and asked me for help.

698
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:17,234
I told him around here,
we always stand up for our own.

699
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:18,315
Where's Rucker?

700
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:22,126
Oh, the Iowa State Police just got a tip
that a fugitive is headed into their jurisdiction.

701
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:26,187
And I'm pretty sure crossing state lines
with a bag full of cash won't look too good.

702
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:29,819
Especially when they find
the little surprise in his trunk.

703
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,847
I need guns.

704
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:35,917
$6,000 worth.

705
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,779
And one of those.

706
00:39:39,506 --> 00:39:41,545
Like I said, I can explain the money.

707
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,716
I can explain the money.

708
00:39:44,597 --> 00:39:47,532
Oh, yeah? How do you explain this?

709
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:50,348
- Those are not mine! Those are not mine!
- Come on, buddy.

710
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,310
- I don't know how they got there!
- All right, get in there.

711
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:54,420
- Somebody put them there. Somebody... -
- Watch your head.

712
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:56,919
That should hold him off until
the IRS gets down here.

713
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,348
The IRS?

714
00:39:58,368 --> 00:40:01,385
Yeah, the money that Rucker
makes from these fights?

715
00:40:01,386 --> 00:40:03,411
Well, it's all in cash.

716
00:40:03,412 --> 00:40:06,293
Yeah, and he wasn't too good
about reporting that income.

717
00:40:06,294 --> 00:40:08,039
Hardison, his financials.

718
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,710
His money's all over the place. Just give
me a minute to plow thorough this, man.

719
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:15,018
Just give me some time. I've found some
funny business in Rucker's accounts.

720
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:18,020
All we had to do was flag the
government about the tax evasion.

721
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:20,483
Rucker won't be coming back
to town anytime soon.

722
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:25,185
He doesn't have anything to come back for.
He literally bet the whole house on Tank.

723
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:26,749
So all that money's gone?

724
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,204
Well, you see, not exactly.

725
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:32,579
Engel? Did you place that bet?

726
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
Yeah.

727
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:37,105
Wasn't easy.  No one local would
handle that kind of action,...

728
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:42,498
so I had to lay it off on a
bunch of different bookies online.

729
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:45,159
Where's your cousin Jimmy now?

730
00:40:47,424 --> 00:40:49,730
You took a hell of a pounding.

731
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:54,705
We should get you a CT scan.
You could have internal bleeding.

732
00:40:54,706 --> 00:40:57,885
You let yourself get hammered
like that on purpose?

733
00:40:57,886 --> 00:41:00,678
That's a hell of a lot of punishment to take.

734
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,499
That's what he does.

735
00:41:05,415 --> 00:41:06,693
So, with Rucker out of the picture,...

736
00:41:06,693 --> 00:41:09,788
management of this gym and
all the fighters... - It's all up in the air.

737
00:41:09,788 --> 00:41:11,338
You guys could use a fresh start.

738
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:14,279
They just need a little direction.

739
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:18,457
I mean, the place could use some
spit and polish, but it's solid.

740
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,213
You might not be able to fight
anymore, but you know the sport.

741
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:24,905
You know what it means to commit
to something. So, what do you say?

742
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:26,749
Take a stab at running this joint,...

743
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,125
the right way?

744
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,285
Plus, you know what? You'll have
some seed money from Rucker's bet.

745
00:41:31,286 --> 00:41:32,799
I mean, enough to get you started.

746
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,526
Let me get this straight.

747
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:37,537
You guys want me to be in charge?

748
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,195
Of all this?

749
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:40,953
Of all the guys?

750
00:41:40,954 --> 00:41:43,109
They're fighters. Like you.

751
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:47,030
You treat them that way, and you'll be fine.

752
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:50,519
What do you say, son?

753
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:55,244
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

754
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,637
If we moved those heavy
bags out of the way,...

755
00:42:04,638 --> 00:42:07,619
we could make room for a video station.

756
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,063
- Put some mats down, get some grappling dummies.
- That'll work.

757
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:13,164
Pork rind?

758
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:15,744
They're actually pretty good.

759
00:42:16,924 --> 00:42:18,027
You sure?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
