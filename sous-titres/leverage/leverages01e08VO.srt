1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,600
-

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,400
They said there was no way
to link the fertilizer

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,400
In the water
to ashley's death.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Because of her
pre-Existing condition.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,600
She had
a thyroid condition.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,800
But that had nothing to do
with her lungs, her heart.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,800
And they found these...
masses in her chest,

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,100
And...

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,500
Our doctor testified,

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,500
But genogrow trotted out
all these experts...

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,900
Who were paid to say exactly
what haldeman wanted them to.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,700
It's not
about the money.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,200
I mean,
people like haldeman,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,500
They need to know that
they can't get away with this.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,000
They need to pay.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,900
The problem is, our attorney
doesn't think we can win.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,100
Burden of proof.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,200
You need evidence that
genogrow knew

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,100
What could happen

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,100
If the fertilizer was
leaked into the water supply.

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,000
We've been trying to get access
to their research reports,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,100
But their lawyers
keep stonewalling.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,100
Trade secrets,
they said.

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,100
Means they're hiding something.

25
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,300
Means there's a smoking gun.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,800
And we are gonna
find it.

Bonsoir.
La soir?E est ici, non?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Excuse me?

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,300
Ze rave party is here?

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm afraid you're
in the wrong place, miss.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,000
This is
an office building --

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,700
You know,
where people come to work?

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,100
I work hard
ze dance floor.

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,700
I'm sure you do.

37
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,500
I don't understand.

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,500
My pgs c'est ne marche pas.
Is -- How you say is,

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
Is broken.

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,200
- You help mich?Le?
- Yeah. Sure. Absolutely.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,000
C'est completement cass?.
Nothing. There is no signal.

42
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,200
Allen haldeman, c.E.O.
30th floor.

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,700
You see?

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,500
You know, i used to
work with ham radios

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,600
- When i was a kid.
- Ah, bon?

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,600
You are good with
your hands, i think.

47
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,300
Oui.

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,700
You are my hero.

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,700
They're locked down --
Security timer.

50
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
We need a key card.

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,500
And i hate to say it,

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,700
But you know who
we could really use --

53
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,500
Don't even say his name.
I don't want it spoken aloud.

54
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Target's on
the 30th floor.

55
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,700
You don't really
expect us to --

56
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,800
Great.

57
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,200
Another key card.

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm gonna kill him.

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Not if i get to him first.

60
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,800
Okay, parker.
Let's try.

61
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Go!

62
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,700
Yeah, buddy!

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,700
Damn it!

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,400
Got it.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,300
Corner office.

66
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,000
So, we're looking for
some kind of paper trail?

67
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,400
Safety studies,
research data

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,900
Anything that proves they knew
the fertilizer was unsafe prior to releasing it.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Come on, come on.

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,800
I'm going as fast
as i can, okay?

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
This thing's taking
forever to boot up.

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,900
Hello?
Hey, hey, hey!

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,100
Hey, guys.
W- What's up?

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,000
Where are you?

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm at the office.
What happened --

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,000
There was a thing --
M- My electricity went out.

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
I swear,
when i see you --

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400
My electricity, man --

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
You're not listening.

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,500
I'm out of options
at this point.

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,900
We got company.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What?

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,700
Okay, i'm hacking into
their security system.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
Visual range
in 10 seconds.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,400
Nine

86
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I'm in. I'm in.

87
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,500
- Eight...seven...
- ????

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,300
Six... five...

89
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,100
Parker!

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,900
- ...Four...
- ???

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
- I know. I know.
- ...three...

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,700
- Guys?
- ...two...

93
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,000
It's haldeman.

94
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,200
We're gonna get slammed once
those epa subpoenas are executed.

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,300
If i don't do something now,
i'm gonna lose the company.

96
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,900
It's all on
that caymans flight.

97
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,800
All the assets, everything.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,400
Yes, the 1209.
Takes off in an hour.

99
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,900
Look, i need someone i can trust
to keep an eye on this for me.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So i need to know...

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Are you that guy?

102
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,800
Good.

103
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,600
Good.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
Hardison,
you get all that?

105
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,300
Assets and a flight
to the caymans?

106
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,500
He's liquidating.

107
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,400
Firewalling.

108
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,900
He's gonna bankrupt
the agricultural division.

109
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,000
If that part of the company
ceases to exist,

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
It'll become
a mess of creditors.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,500
Wiping out any chance
our clients have

112
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
At winning
the civil suit.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
We got to get
on that plane.

114
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,200
Boss, he said
it leaves in an hour,

115
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,700
And the airport's
clear across town.

116
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,400
Even if traffic's good,
we're still --

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
These people killed a kid,
all right?

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,500
They killed
abunch of kids.

119
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,400
There's no way in hell we're gonna
let them get away with it.

120
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,500
We are going to
get on that flight.

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,600
All right.

122
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,100
So, what are we
waiting for?

123
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,500
How does she do this?

124
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't even ask anymore.

125
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,400
Don't bother with the stairs.
I got you a ride down.

126
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,700
Is, um, how you say, um...
is far from here?

127
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,500
Far from -- No.
Not very far at all.

128
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,700
See, this is us
right here.

129
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,100
- And my house --
- Your house?

130
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,300
Hardison, we need those tickets.

131
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm working on it.

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,000
All right, i got two seats
in first class.

133
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Okay, sophie and i
will take those.

134
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,900
What i.D.S
have you got on you?

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
Let's see...

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,400
We got,
peter davison,

137
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,900
Sylvester mccoy,
and i have a tom baker.

138
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,200
Yeah.I have a baker.
Sarah jane.

139
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,900
Perfect. I now pronounce
you man and wife.

140
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,100
Now go on
and kiss that bride.

141
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
And now for you,
eliot.

142
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,200
Hardison,
i don't need a ticket.

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,700
I got an air marshal badge.

144
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,400
What if there's already
a marshal on the plane?

145
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
There's only one air marshal
per every 100 flights.

146
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
I know that's good for us,
but i so wish i didn't know that.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
One authority figure's good.
Two's better.

148
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,100
Parker, you're about
to get a day job.

149
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,500
Hello?

150
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,200
Hi, yeah,
sorry to bother you, ma'am,

151
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,500
But i'm calling from
the westchester animal control.

152
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,200
We just got a felis catus
in here by the name of fidget.

153
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,700
Oh, my god -- Fidget!
Is he all right?

154
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,400
Yes, he's fine, ma'am.
He's fine.

155
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
But you might want to
get down here quick as you can.

156
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,300
We can only hold unclaimed animals
for a certain amount of time before...

157
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,600
...you know.

158
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
Okay, i'll, uh,
i'll be right there.

159
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Just keep an eye on him, okay?
I'm on my way!

160
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,200
I'm sorry!
I'm in a rush --

161
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Kitty emergency.

162
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,700
How did you both know
there'd be an extra uniform in the bag?

163
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,500
Everyone knows flight attendants
are required to carry extra uniforms

164
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
In case they get called
to work unexpectedly.

165
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,600
Or if something happens to the one
that they're already wearing.

166
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,400
How does
"everyone" know that?

167
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,800
- Worked airport security.
- Slept with a flight attendant.

168
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,900
What? We needed luggage.
Lost and found.

169
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,300
You didn't check
the bag first?

170
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,700
We were in
a bit of a hurry.

171
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,200
Yeah. Cuffs are his.
Whip's mine.

172
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,000
Second honeymoon.

173
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,500
Let's see what we can learn
about nathan ford today.

174
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,000
Online poker?

175
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,600
Online chess?

176
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,500
Sudoku.

177
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
Crossword.
What...

178
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Damn. Somebody needs
to get laid.

179
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,500
Hardison.

180
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
What's up?
Yeah?

181
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,800
Are you in my chair?

182
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,300
N- No, i -- I'm not --
I'm not in your --

183
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,600
I'm at a desk --
Mydesk -- In my office,

184
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
W- Waiting on your call

185
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,600
So you can tell me
what i can do to help you

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,700
A- And the team, boss.
What's up?

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,500
- You can stop now.
- Appreciate it.

188
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,300
I need you to go back
to genogrow.

189
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,300
What for?

190
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,800
The assets
are on the plane.

191
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
We grab the money,
give it to the client.

192
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
They don't even need
to go ahead with the lawsuit.

193
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
We are taking
this company down.

194
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,300
Not this lawsuit,
not the epa -- Us.

195
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,400
And i need you to finish
what we started.

196
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,600
Find the smoking gun.

197
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm on it.

198
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
- And, hardison?
- Yeah?

199
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't forget to
turn off my computer.

200
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Well, how in the hell...

201
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,800
???

202
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Thank you.

203
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,900
There's, um,
there's two in here.

204
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,200
That's my husband.

205
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,400
???

206
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,900
I'm in coach.

207
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
Hey. Sorry i'm late.

208
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Who are you?
Where's becky?

209
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,700
She got promoted.
Did you not get the e-Mail?

210
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,900
She got promoted?
She only started a few months ago.

211
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
She must really know
how to pick 'em.

212
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,100
A few more layovers,and she'll be
piloting one of these things, huh?

213
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay, so, um...

214
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,100
If we're gonna play
"happy family,"

215
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,000
We should, you know,
really get our background straight.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,100
Let's keep it simple --
Use our own backstory.

217
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,900
Our wedding day
is the day we met.

218
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,100
Which means we've
been married for

219
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
- 8 years.
- 10 years.

220
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,500
You don't remember
when we met.

221
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,000
No, of course i do.
I was just rounding it off.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,200
By subtracting
two years?

223
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,100
Is this
gonna be a thing?

224
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,700
A couple of years.

225
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,700
Place the mask over your mouth
and nose and breath normally.

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,900
In the event of a water landing,

227
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,300
Your seat cushion can be used
as a flotation device.

228
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
But let's face it,

229
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
If this thing goes down
in the water,

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,700
More than likely
the impact will kill you.

231
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,200
Please take a moment to locate
the nearest emergency exits.

232
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,600
Because if this plane's on fire,

233
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,000
You're gonna want
to get out quick.

234
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,100
Jet fuel burns
at over 1,000 degrees.

235
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,300
That's hot, folks.

236
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
All right, nate.
We're here. Now what?

237
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, well,

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
First we have to figure out

239
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,300
What we're looking for
and who's got it.

240
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,000
Then we have to steal it

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,900
And get it off the plane
without anyone noticing.

242
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,500
And we have to do that
before the plane lands in...

243
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,000
51/2 hours.

244
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,900
So...

245
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,300
Business as usual,
then.

246
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,700
??????

247
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,300
???????

248
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,300
Would you
like a drink, ma'am?

249
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,900
Nothing for me,
thanks.

250
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,200
Anything for you,
sir

251
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes.
Some orange juice.

252
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,700
And a splash of vodka

253
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,000
Excuse me

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What?

255
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,100
I was just hoping that
i could get a ginger ale.

256
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,300
Yeah, i'll get to you
in a minute.

257
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,000
It's just that i have
a nervous stomach,

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,300
So if you wouldn't mind...

259
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,700
There's a system.

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,700
I'm not feeling very well

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,100
If you're gonna hurl,
use this.

262
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200
Okay.

263
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,900
Hi, there.

264
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,200
??????

265
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,200
Why can we still
hear her, anyway?

266
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,800
I thought these things
would stop working once

267
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,100
We were in the air.

268
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,000
You're welcome.

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,900
And if you're curious,

270
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,500
I hacked it from the
plane's wi-Fi connection

271
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,300
And piggybacked
our signal onto it.

272
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,300
The comms will work as long as you guys
stay on this side of the atmosphere.

273
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,400
Hardison,
where are you?

274
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
About to head in.

275
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,000
What's your plan?

276
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,500
Do you need parker
to walk you through --

277
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,200
Don't worry about it.
I got this.

278
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,900
Hola, se?Or.
Tengo los koi.

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,300
Los pescados que me diste --
D?Nde los ponga?

280
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,200
- What?
- Muy, muyexpensive.

281
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,500
You know, fish --
Muerte, muerte, mi muerte.

282
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,000
The fish, man --
Sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle.

283
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,100
And, you know,
i go. I go. Gracias. Gracias.

284
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,800
Hey, just make sure you check
in with the receptionist!

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,900
- What?
- Nothing.It's just...

286
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,600
I could've sworn i saw
a maintenance guy get in that elevator.

287
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,600
A- A maintenance guy?
Wow. Real nice.

288
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
I bet you think
we all look alike.

289
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,700
That's not what i meant.

290
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,500
You know what --

291
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,700
If i have to go to one more of
those damn sensitivity seminars,

292
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,600
I know
who i'm blaming.

293
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,100
No, no, no.

294
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,800
I know
who i'm blaming.

295
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,900
- It's not what i meant.
- I blame you! You!

296
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,200
This is impossible.
It could be anyone.

297
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,000
Not anyone.

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,600
We can rule out the elderly,
anyone with kids, everyone under 25.

299
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,700
I count 14 possibles
here in coach.

300
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,100
Yeah, and six more
in first class.

301
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,500
If haldeman's entrusting
his assets to a courier,

302
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,300
I'm guessing he's gonna pay
for the extra leg room.

303
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,500
So we should focus
on carry-On.

304
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,700
No one checks
bags full of cash.

305
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,800
Might not be cash.

306
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,400
What's it gonna be,
parker? Gold bars?

307
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,900
They don't exactly
travel well.

308
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
No, parker's right.

309
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,500
We could be looking at
traveler's checks or bearer bonds

310
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,100
- Anything that packs light.
- Got it.

311
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,600
Can i help you
with something?

312
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,400
Watch the movie.

313
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,900
Excuse me.

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Could i have
a ginger ale, please?

315
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,200
You've already had two.

316
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,600
I know. It's just --
It's like a placebo effect.

317
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,700
It's not really working,

318
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,900
But it makes you
feel better anyway.

319
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,400
Yeah? So, when's that
supposed to kick in?

320
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
Look.

321
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,800
Flying isn't really all that scary
when you think about it.

322
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,700
I mean, there are a lot more
likely ways to die than on a plane

323
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Car crash, house fire,
electrocution, drowning,

324
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,700
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

325
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, the fact is,
death haunts us every day.

326
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,900
No matter where we are.

327
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

328
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,800
A little bit
of turbulence there.

329
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Yeah. A little bit.

330
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,700
I know i got you --
Got you all rumpled.

331
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm fine.
I'm really fine.

332
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
I'm not so good on planes.

333
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,700
Me neither.

334
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,400
- Here's your bag.
- Thank you so much.

335
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,300
You know what
that reminded me of?

336
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,700
Yes -- Paris.

337
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,600
What?

338
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,300
It wasn't paris.
It was tuscany.

339
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,100
Are you sure?
No, i could've sworn it was paris.

340
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,900
It was tuscany.

341
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,500
It's a thing now,
isn't it?

342
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,700
Yeah.

343
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,800
????

344
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,200
???

345
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,000
Let me tell you

346
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
I have been working
my butt off on this account.

347
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,100
But steve -- No,

348
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,800
He's just sitting back,
waiting for me to fail.

349
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,700
So he can swoop in
and save the day.

350
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,500
I swear, it's like he's a rogue
and i'm a mage

351
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,600
And we're part
of the same guild,

352
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,200
But secretly, he's at work with
the alliance to undermine us.

353
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
- For the horde.
- For the horde.

354
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,100
You play
"world of warcraft?"

355
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,500
You kidding? Did you get
the new expansion pack?

356
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,800
Woman, i was up all night.

357
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Now, look, i mean
"burning crusade" was great,

358
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,400
But this new one
is mind-Blowing.

359
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,100
Hardison.
You bailed on the job

360
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,800
Because you were up
all night playing a game?

361
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,900
First off, "game" is
hardly adequate, okay?

362
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Have you even gotten into
haldeman's office,

363
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,500
Or have you found a way
to screw that up, too?

364
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,700
I'll figure
something out.

365
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,600
You can't skate by
on talent and luck forever.

366
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,000
The meeting's starting, sir.

367
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
What meeting?

368
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,300
See, the world is a 24/7/365
process-Centric marketplace.

369
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm talking e-Commerce,
e- Vector, e-Management.

370
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,200
But genogrow? I mean, frankly,

371
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm a little concerned
about our future.

372
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,100
And i'm not the only one.
Am i right, frank?

373
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,600
Right on, brother.

374
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,000
People, it is time for us
to repurpose, rescale, reconceptualize.

375
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay, we will take this company

376
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,500
And turn it into an assertively
dominant catalyst for change.

377
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,300
Let's make tactical supply
chains sexy again, people.

378
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,600
Who's with me?

379
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,000
My man.
You're a believer.

380
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,600
You are a believer, sir.
I like --

381
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,000
Y- You all right, dave?

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Seafood burrito --
It was a bad call.

383
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Steve, my man,
you know what?

384
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,400
Can you take over for me?
I appreciate that. Thank you.

385
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:42,000
Everybody, i'm gonna just handle that.
I'm gonna be back after...steve.

386
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Well, come on, steve.
I don't have all day.

387
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
Right.

388
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,300
Hatbox full of euros,

389
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,700
Pouch of uncut diamonds,
and a stolen stradivarius.

390
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,100
Now, i've never
lifted one of those.

391
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,600
- Parker...
- This is insane.

392
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,500
Between the four of us,

393
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,300
We've found millions
of dollars of merchandise.

394
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,700
None of it
belongs to genogrow.

395
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,500
Cayman islands --
Thieves holiday.

396
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,200
Go for the tan,
stay for the tax shelter.

397
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,800
Haldeman's not the only
bad guy doing business there.

398
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,300
Guys, i got something.

399
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,600
I've been cross-Checking
the flight's passenger manifest

400
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,300
With genogrow's
company roster.

401
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
I got two hits

402
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,000
Dan erlick, head of security,
ex-Navy seal.

403
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Been with the company
the last six years.

404
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,800
And marissa devins,
an accountant.

405
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,000
She's only been with the company
about 10 months.

406
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,100
Weird thing is,
they're not seated together.

407
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,100
I mean,
erlick is in first class,

408
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,600
The accountant's in coach.

409
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Well, it could just be
a coincidence

410
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,300
They're on
the same flight.

411
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,500
Then how come both seats were paid for
by the same corporate credit card

412
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,400
At the exact same time?

413
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,000
Divide and conquer.

414
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,200
Okay, erlick's in first class.

415
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,500
Sophie and i will take him.
Seems likely he's our guy.

416
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,300
Parker, stay with the accountant,
just in case.

417
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,800
Nate, can we at least
take the diamonds?

418
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,500
Sophie...

419
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,400
Sending their photos
to your phones now.

420
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,600
Okay.

421
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,500
- Is there a problem?
- No.

422
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,700
- Oh, hey.
- Wow, thank you.

423
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,800
So, how you feeling?

424
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,100
- A little bit better.
- Good.

425
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,700
So, uh, if you hate flying,
why do it?

426
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,300
Oh, this isn't by choice.
This is a business trip.

427
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,600
To the caymans?
Wow.

428
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,200
Who's picking up the tab?

429
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Genogrow industries.

430
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, i think i heard
someone else on board

431
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,700
Saying they worked there --
A dan something.

432
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
I don't know.

433
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,100
They didn't tell me
anyone else was going.

434
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,300
But again,
nobody tells me anything.

435
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,100
If i was important to you,
you'd remember.

436
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,400
They're just
stupid details!

437
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,100
It doesn't mean
you're not important!

438
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't yell at me.

439
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,200
- It just means
- I just don't think you...

440
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Oh, yeah, go on.
Yeah, walk away.

441
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,100
Like you always do.

442
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,200
- You okay?
- Yeah.

443
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,300
Sorry about that.

444
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,500
Let me buy you
a drink.

445
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,000
No, no, no.
I shouldn't.

446
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,800
Well, maybe just a glass
of what you're having.

447
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,100
Was that your husband?

448
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,400
For now,
anyway.

449
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,700
Dan erlick.

450
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,700
Nice to meet you,
dan erlick.

451
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,700
Nice to meet you.

452
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,100
I hacked into
erlick's phone records.

453
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
And he did call haldeman
right before takeoff,

454
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,000
So your theory fits.

455
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,700
But?

456
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,400
But it's this accountant
that's got me curious.

457
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm standing outside
her office right now.

458
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,200
I think this woman knows
more than she's supposed to.

459
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,300
You know, when we heard that
haldeman had assets on the plane,

460
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,800
We assumed
it was currency.

461
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,600
But what if it wasn't?
What if it was a person?

462
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,100
Okay, but...
then that means...

463
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,000
That marissa devins is
the asset they're liquidating.

464
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,200
- I think???
- No way.

465
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,800
That woman's
already paranoid-Crazy.

466
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,000
We tell her there's
a bounty on her head,

467
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,300
And she's gonna lose it.

468
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
I think she has
a right to know.

469
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,100
Anyway, if haldeman's
going to this much trouble,

470
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,000
Then she must have
something --

471
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,300
Some information that could
help us help our client.

472
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,900
She's our smoking gun.

473
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,800
Okay.
Tell her.

474
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
- Don't say i didn't warn you.
- No, not you  eliot.

475
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
He's got a badge --
Makes the story more credible.

476
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,100
How much longer
do you think it's gonna be?

477
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,800
I mean, i know
it's only been three hours,

478
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,400
But maybe there's
a strong tailwind.

479
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,300
- Feels like we're going awfully fast.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

480
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,200
I'm a u.S. Air marshal.
Could you come with me, please?

481
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,100
- Okay.
- Thank you.

482
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,300
Sir, this is first class.
You're not --

483
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,600
Excuse me.

484
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,200
I need you
to tell me about genogrow.

485
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,100
Your boss is
a mr. Allen haldeman, right?

486
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,700
And he sent you
on this trip?

487
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,800
Yeah, a-After i noticed
some accounting irregularities

488
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,000
In our agricultural
chemistry division.

489
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,000
What kind
of irregularities?

490
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,400
Safety studies

491
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,600
One of the new fertilizers
that the company launched last year.

492
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
See, the checks were cut,

493
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,100
But there was
never any confirmation

494
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
That the studies
were actually completed.

495
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,800
And some of the payments
to the researchers

496
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,300
Were -- Well,
abnormally large.

497
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
And you brought this up
with haldeman?

498
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,300
And you brought this up
with haldeman?

499
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
He assured me
it was a process error.

500
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,100
That's why i'm here --

501
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
To audit the offshore accounts
and then correct it.

502
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
Hush money.

503
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,700
What?

504
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,000
Ms. Devins, those payments
were not made in error.

505
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,100
They were bribes.

506
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,100
He was trying to pay offthe researchers
so they would not testify.

507
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,600
What are you talking about?

508
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,800
- What the hell is going on here?
- The guy in 1d wants to kill you.

509
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,400
Ginger ale?

510
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,800
Just --

511
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,300
So it's a hit.
How does it lay out?

512
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,600
If i was gonna do it,

513
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,800
I'd have two guys
on the ground at the gate,

514
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,300
One guy on the plane
to make sure she gets off.

515
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Well, i think it's time
you introduce yourself??????

516
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,000
It was just an opinion.

517
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,800
You don't need
to jump down my throat.

518
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,300
You can't knock down an idea
without offering alternatives.

519
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
I don't know, steve.

520
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,800
I got to go
with cheryl on this one.

521
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,000
I mean, genetically engineered tomatoes
that's one thing.

522
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,900
- But carrot on the cob?
- Yeah.

523
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,000
That's gonna scare
some people, brother.

524
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,300
Thank you, dave.

525
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,800
<i>It's nice to know at least
someone around here respects me.</i>

526
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Is this about
that conference in omaha?

527
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,100
Hardison?

528
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,000
It was an accident,
and i totally apologized.

529
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,900
Yeah, boss?

530
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,000
I want haldeman's hard drive.
Grab it and get out of there.

531
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,000
I barely got him out of
his office the first time.

532
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,600
How am i supposed to --

533
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,900
- Loser!
- You seemed to like it at the time.

534
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,100
Just do it.

535
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
Do not fool yourself.
I would never --

536
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,400
G-Guys whoa, guys.
Let's not fight.

537
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,000
Especially
not on my birthday.

538
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,700
Oh, my god!
It's your birthday?

539
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,000
No one told us.

540
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,400
- Happy birthday, dave.
- Thank you.

541
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,300
Happy birthday.

542
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,700
Marissa,
you're being very brave.

543
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
- You think so?
- Yes.

544
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,800
Oh, good.

545
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
There's no need
to look so worried.

546
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,300
We're gonna take
good care of you.

547
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,700
Thank you.

548
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
Why don't we,
um...

549
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,500
Why don't we
stretch our legs, huh?

550
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,800
Take a --
Take a little walk.

551
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,500
- Okay.
- Relax.

552
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,000
Nice, deep breaths.

553
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,200
<i>You do not
want to go in there.</i>

554
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,300
Yeah?
Yeah.

555
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,100
Feeling a bit better?

556
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,500
- And this is you?
- Yeah.

557
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
- Good. Strap in.
- Okay.

558
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,800
Everything
is gonna be just fine.

559
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Okay.

560
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,200
Maybe not.

561
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,400
I found haldeman's laptop.

562
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
You know what?

563
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,300
He has a hidden compartment
right up under his desk.

564
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,800
It's actually it's pretty cool.
It's right up under

565
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,700
Hardison!

566
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,300
Okay, um,
i accessed his e-Mails.

567
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,300
A few hours ago,

568
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,000
He made a stop payment
on a fund transfer...

569
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,600
To dan erlick.

570
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,200
Erlick?
The guy we just took out?

571
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,300
The guy
eliot just took out?

572
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
And that's not all.

573
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,300
I ran some back trace on
a few phone calls haldeman made.

574
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,500
Any guesses to who?

575
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,100
How about
someone in the caymans?

576
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,800
Bingo.

577
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,500
Erlick's his head of security.

578
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,000
No reason why haldeman should be
talking to these guys directly.

579
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,200
Unless... marissa devins is not
the only one on that hit list.

580
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,300
<i>Haldeman is gonna take out
both of them.</i>

581
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
Getting rid
of the evidence

582
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,500
<i>And the guy in charge
of covering it up.</i>

583
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,400
Erlick's a pro.
He had a ceramic knife.

584
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
If anything
was going down,

585
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,400
He'd sniff 'em out
when he saw them coming.

586
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,700
How would
they do it?

587
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Easiest way --
Take 'em out in transit.

588
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,300
You mean bring down
the plane they're on?

589
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,800
<i>You mean bring down
the plane we're on?</i>

590
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,800
Yeah.

591
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,500
I'm usa air marshal.

592
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,700
I need you guys
to return to your seat, please.

593
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,300
Immidintly thank you.

594
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,000
There's no way. There's no way
haldeman would go this far.

595
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Billions of dollars,
decades of jail time.

596
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,300
Look, if you're right
about this,

597
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,500
We got to get this plane
on the ground right now.

598
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,000
- We have to tell the pilots.
- No, no, no, no. N-Not now, no.

599
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,700
We have to understand
what we're dealing with here.

600
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,000
How would you get
a bomb on the plane?

601
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,100
Cargo hold,

602
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,600
Post-Screening in erlick's bag
or the accountant's luggage.

603
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,500
Okay, parker,
i -- Parker, i need you --

604
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,400
All right,
we got to talk to erlick now.

605
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,100
Geez!

606
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,100
Hey!

607
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,000
When i knock people out,
they tend to stay knocked out.

608
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,400
Luggage tags.

609
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,400
What are you doing?

610
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,000
Medical emergency.

611
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Passenger left their
asthma inhaler in a checked bag.

612
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,200
???????

613
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
I don't understand.

614
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,800
Why do you need to know
what kind of bag i have?

615
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,300
Are you sure?
It's red with white flowers.

616
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm looking right at it.
There's nothing in it.

617
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,700
Same as erlick's.

618
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,800
Hey, parker.

619
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,400
You got your phone
on you?

620
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,600
Yeah.
Why?

621
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,300
Okay, now, is there anything
that looks like a computer interface,

622
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,700
Hooked up to
the plane's electrical system?

623
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,600
Yeah, i think so.

624
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Okay, good, good.

625
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,100
Now i need you to find the usb
port on the control panel

626
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,800
And connect the phone to it
using an a.V. Adapter.

627
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,900
Where am i supposed to
find an adapter?

628
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,400
Look around.

629
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,600
?????

630
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,200
What are you doing?

631
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,500
Well, i'm just remote-Accessing
a plane's electrical system from 3,000 miles away.

632
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,100
You know what --
If you were a geek,

633
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,800
You would be
really turned on right now.

634
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm just saying.

635
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,700
- Huh?
- "Huh" what?

636
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,200
O-Okay. I'm reading
an electrical spike.

637
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,800
Parker, do you see
anything around

638
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,900
That could be interfering
with the signal?

639
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,700
There's something.

640
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,600
Looks like it's tapping into
one of the conduits.

641
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Where are you exactly?

642
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,300
Radio air-Traffic control.
Let 'em know we're on schedule.

643
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,600
Might get in early
if this tailwind keeps up.

644
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,000
Parker,
the device you found --

645
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,300
Is it anywhere near
an orange box?

646
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Yeah.

647
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,000
Oh, god.

648
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,400
They tapped into
the black box.

649
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,600
No, no, it's not black.
It's orange.

650
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah, the black boxes --
They're orange.

651
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,900
Makes them easier to find
in the debris.

652
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,000
They've hacked into
the flight's computer,

653
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,600
Which means they have
access to the system

654
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,100
Which means they can spoof
the black-Box data all at the same time.

655
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,600
Crash the plane without
anyone knowing it was sabotaged.

656
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,900
Exactly.

657
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,400
Guys...

658
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,000
- Gentlemen --
- What are you doing?!

659
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,100
This area's off-Limits!

660
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,000
Listen to me!
I'm a u.S. Air marshal, okay?

661
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,500
This is tom baker.
He's an engineer.

662
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,200
He's a consultant
for the tsa.

663
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,500
Autopilot's
disengaged itself!

664
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,600
We're losing altitude!

665
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,000
Listen -- Someone has hacked
into the navigation system.

666
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
They're trying
to bring the plane down.

667
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,700
Hardison, we need you!

668
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I don't-I-I don't know,
nate. I don't --

669
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,900
I mean, i-I can override
the software attack,

670
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
But that means
we would have to restart

671
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,400
The flight's electrical system,
which i have no idea how to do,

672
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,100
Because my knowledge of
aeronautical engineering is kind of limited to

673
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,700
What i can pull off of google
in the next two minutes.

674
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,200
And, brother,
i don't -- I mean --

675
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Listen to me!

676
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,000
You can do this!
I trust you!

677
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,200
No matter how many times
you goof off or screw up,

678
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,900
You always come through
in the clutch.

679
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,600
You're the only guy i can count
on in a situation like this.

680
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,200
You know what?¡Ìyou...

681
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,900
You're right.
You're right. I got this.

682
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes! Yes!
Yes, you can!

683
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You're right.
You're -- I'm the man.

684
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,600
I'm the man. I got this.
I'm gonna do this.

685
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,900
Then do it already!

686
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,800
Okay, um...
parker, parker...

687
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,200
Can you sever all the wires between
the device and the black box?

688
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,600
I think so.

689
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,400
Yoke's nonresponsive.
It's like stirring cement.

690
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,100
- We need to reset now.
- Not yet!

691
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,800
No! Not yet!

Okay, now!

3,500!

711
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,100
Dive's too steep.
We're gonna have to set down.

712
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,500
Find me a runway.

713
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,700
Right there!

714
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,900
Sophie?

715
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,600

Yeah.
You?

You're gonna remember

719
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah.

Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

Baby! Unh!

Y'all cool?

- Yes,cool.
- Family. All right.

726
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,000
<i>Hey, i want marissa
off the plane now.</i>

727
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,500
Hardison, your guy's about to
find out the smoking gun isn't dead.

728
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,700
Get out of there.

729
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,400
<i>I have
the attitude problem?</i>

730
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,500
<i>No, brother, no, you got
the attitude problem, okay?</i>

731
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,200
<i>I gave my heart and my soul
to this damn company,</i>

732
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,400
<i>And this is
how you repay me?</i>

733
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
And on my birthday!

734
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,000
He was always
so thoughtful.

735
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,800
I never liked that guy.

736
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,600
You guys almost died
trying to help me.

737
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,000
<i>I wish
i could help you,</i>

738
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,600
But all the evidence
was in my office,

739
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,900
And haldeman
took it all.

740
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,300
<i>He didn't take it all.</i>

741
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,500
You promised me
this would be taken care of!

742
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,600
<i>Adi,my brothers.</i>

743
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,500
I wish there was some way
i could pay you back

744
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,400
For everything
you've done.

745
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,500
<i>Well, there is
something you could do.</i>

746
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,600
Testify.

747
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,200
<i>Genogrow c.E.O. Allen haldeman</i>

748
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,700
<i>Was indicted on conspiracy and
attempted-Murder charges today,</i>

749
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,200
<i>After a grand jury heard testimony
from an inside source.</i>

750
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,300
Man, i love it
when a plan comes together.

751
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,300
What?
I said i was sorry.

752
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,900
Hey, look,
it all worked out okay.

753
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,600
<i>I mean,
i was 3,000 miles away</i>

754
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,200
And still managed
to save all y'all lives.

755
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,600
You're welcome!

756
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,400
Ungrateful...

757
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,400
Well,
it took 10 years,

758
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,800
But we got
our first crash landing.

759
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,300
10 years.

760
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,200
Thanks for getting it
right this time.

761
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
You were right.

762
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,000
10 years ago,
i saw you the first time.

763
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,100
You were swiping a degas
from a collection in prague.

764
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,400
I saw you.
You saw me.

765
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,600
I ran.
You chased.

766
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,300
Then, two years later,

767
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,100
I caught up with you
in damascus.

768
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,700
<i>Caught you,
i should say.</i>

769
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,000
You turned around...
introduced yourself.

770
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,300
<i>And that's when i met
sophie devereaux.</i>

771
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,800
It'll be eight years
next month.

772
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,800
Well played.

773
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,400
Thank you.

774
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,100
I still don't understand how you can
mix up paris and tuscany.
