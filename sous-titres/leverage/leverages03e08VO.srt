1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:01,990
<i>And if you're just joining us,</i>

2
00:00:02,115 --> 00:00:05,419
<i>we're following New Hampshire police
at the pursuit of a stolen vehicle.</i>

3
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:09,052
<i>According to the reports, the driver
is a school teacher from Massachusetts,</i>

4
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,099
<i>not exactly our typical car jacker.</i>

5
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:14,639
<i>We've no confirmation on...
Wait a minute. Something's happening.</i>

6
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:16,513
<i>Driver, pull over!</i>

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,020
<i>Pull over now!</i>

8
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,436
Season 3 Episode 8
<i>The Boost Job</i>

9
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:26,567
- You're making a mistake.
- Sir, step away from the vehicule.

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,528
- Step away from the vehicle!
- It's a misunderstanding.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,046
- Face down on the ground!
- I didn't steal the truck!

12
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:34,575
- It's a misunderstanding.
- All the way down! All the way!

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,537
This is my truck. I didn't steal it.
I paid for it, all right?

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,873
Hold on.

15
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,889
Can we just talk for a second?
I didn't steal the truck!

16
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,495
The rich and powerful
take what they want.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,011
We steal it back for you.

18
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:05,523
Sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

19
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,342
We provide leverage!

20
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:14,448
I mean, if it wasn't my truck,
why was I making all those car payments?

21
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,135
Let me ask you something,
why'd you run?

22
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:19,165
I know. I shouldn't have.

23
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:20,823
But I panicked.

24
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:25,000
- But I didn't do anything wrong.
- You bought it used?

25
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,287
Yeah, from Penzer's a few months ago
for my landscaping business.

26
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,998
You can't really get by on just
a teacher's pay these days,

27
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:32,216
not with a family.

28
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,428
And how did you find out
it was stolen?

29
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,008
I went to a job in Nashua

30
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:40,175
and the "check engine" light came on,
so I took it to a mechanic,

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,314
and he tells me
that the truck's onboard computer

32
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,633
spit out a fishy vehicle
identification number.

33
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:47,221
So the vin number was
reported as stolen.

34
00:01:47,346 --> 00:01:49,275
I figured it was a mix-up
and took off.

35
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,917
Next thing I know, I'm the poster boy
for "America's most wanted".

36
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,316
I appreciate
you bailing me out, Mr. Ford.

37
00:01:58,441 --> 00:01:59,653
But what do I do now?

38
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,760
The cops seized the truck.

39
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:04,331
The bank says I still have
to make good on the loan.

40
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,126
The school suspended me
because of the pending criminal charges.

41
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:10,715
I keep thinking:
"How did this all happen?"

42
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,374
It's called car cloning. Thieves steal
a vehicle then go to another state,

43
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,512
where they find a car of the same make
and model and use its vin number.

44
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,250
Then, using those numbers,

45
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,017
they register the stolen vehicle
in the first state.

46
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,234
And since each state runs
its own vin database,

47
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:26,812
the hot car comes up clean.

48
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:29,214
Now, Paul Mantlo,
he had the bad luck

49
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:31,552
of wandering from Massachusetts
into new Hampshire,

50
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:32,985
where the vin was copied.

51
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,238
- And of buying a stolen car.
- Where'd he get the car?

52
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,010
Duke Penzer,
he's a former race car driver.

53
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:41,703
He parlayed some minor success
on the lower circuits

54
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,850
to start his own used-car dealership
out in Payden, Massachusetts.

55
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:50,337
<i>Hi, folks. I'm Duke Penzer.</i>

56
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:53,787
<i>In my racing days,
old Veronica here never let me down.</i>

57
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:56,480
<i>You come on down to the finish line
at Penzer automotive,</i>

58
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:59,255
<i>and we'll make sure
we don't let you down.</i>

59
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,601
He still runs laps on the weekends.
He tries to keep up his image.

60
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,947
I checked out some of his prices,
and they're sick.

61
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,773
20%, 25% below blue book.

62
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,817
It's easy to offer great deals
when your inventory's stolen.

63
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,861
How's he getting the cars?
He's not nicking them himself.

64
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:18,239
- Good question. I haven't found...
- He's the distributor.

65
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,861
The suppliers are
probably a car-theft ring.

66
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,996
That way,
cops trace a hot car to him,

67
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,469
he can say he got it
from someone who's long gone.

68
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:27,998
Besides, the scam falls
between state jurisdictions, so...

69
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,577
I was a car thief.

70
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:36,632
That's how I know.

71
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:39,649
All right.

72
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:42,795
So, Penzer is a big fish
in a small pond.

73
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,586
We need to muddy up the waters.

74
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,226
Hardison, you get us a base?

75
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,403
Art's Auto Sales.

76
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,605
A little mom-and-pop shop
down the road from Penzer's.

77
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,816
It's run by Art and Joy Bauer.

78
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:57,703
Been in the community for decades, but
Penzer's running them out of business.

79
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,613
They're on the verge of bankruptcy.

80
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:03,011
It gets awfully wet this time
of year in Payden, doesn't it?

81
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:04,298
And chilly.

82
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,555
Don't you think the Bauers
need a little sun and fun?

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,730
Little R&R?

84
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,711
Which is why, on behalf of
the American auto dealers association,

85
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:16,130
we'd like to honor you, the Bauers,

86
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,323
with this lifetime
achievement award.

87
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:22,452
As part of this prize, you'll receive
an all-expenses-paid trip to Tahiti!

88
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:24,680
Say Hawaii.

89
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,765
The tahitian reservation systems
are for crap.

90
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,145
I mean Hawaii!
For two whole weeks...

91
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,930
- <i>10 days.</i>
- 10 days.

92
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:32,955
Do you know what's going on?

93
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:35,740
But since we've already
laid off the staff,

94
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:40,189
at this point, shutting down for a couple
of weeks will actually save us money.

95
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:42,756
I'll pack my speedo.

96
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:46,755
All right, we're in.
Now what?

97
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:49,489
Now? Start your engines.

98
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,396
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

99
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,409
<i>Payden, Massachusetts'
very own Duke Penzer</i>

100
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,234
<i>now coming into pit row.</i>

101
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:14,444
1 min 10.36.

102
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,399
Not too bad considering
I got loose in turn three.

103
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,194
- Still a track record.
- Not exactly.

104
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,866
What are you talking about?
That was faster than my last run.

105
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,406
Both times were just beaten.

106
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,325
Somebody beat my record? Who?

107
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:35,834
What was his time?

108
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,922
- He beat your record by 15 seconds.
- What? That's impossible!

109
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:41,308
It is?

110
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,136
I meant 1.5 seconds.

111
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:50,265
- Sorry. I must've read that wrong.
- You think?

112
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:55,688
That was one
of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride!

113
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,613
Hey, there, junior.
What's with the jammies?

114
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:07,163
What do you got in that thing?
A supercharger?

115
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:09,938
Hell, I don't know.
My guys just picked this up somewhere.

116
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,997
I just figured I'd kick the tires.
What's that? A matchbox car?

117
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,176
What do you think, darling?

118
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:16,917
I think I want to go now.

119
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,702
Go? We just got here.

120
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm asking you if you think
I should buy these wheels.

121
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,314
- Veronica's not for sale.
- "Veronica"?

122
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,301
So Betty was the fast one.
Who knew?

123
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,319
- Look, mister...
- Lucas.

124
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,130
A.J. Lucas.

125
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:32,141
I don't know
who you think you are...

126
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,819
I think I'm the guy that just broke
your track record, if I'm not mistaken.

127
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,772
One good time trial
don't make you a racer.

128
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,208
Let's do it, kid. Let's mix it up.
Let's go! You and me, right now.

129
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,948
But I'll tell you what.
We're gonna do it old school.

130
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:48,825
I win, I get your car.
You win, you get my car.

131
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,055
Plus...

132
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,419
other considerations.

133
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:55,524
I doubt you could handle either.

134
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:59,077
Green flag... 15.

135
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:00,202
Excuse me.

136
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:04,339
- Yes, Mr. Penzer?
- Run along, Todd.

137
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,737
I changed the compression on the pistons
and opened up the valves.

138
00:07:09,132 --> 00:07:10,773
Should get about another 75 hp.

139
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,092
I think the left bank
is running a little lean.

140
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,933
I tweaked that.

141
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:18,312
Head looks good on the flux.
You'll get a better burn on your fuel.

142
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,272
How's the rest
of your research coming?

143
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,358
Good. I found out a bunch of the local
thieves work for a guy named Lefty.

144
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,986
- You know how to find him?
- Got some ideas.

145
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:29,235
When we're done here,
that'll be your priority...

146
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:30,991
infiltrate their gang.

147
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:35,579
All right. Now, look, man,
I just installed this.

148
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,671
You punch it to release
an oxidized chemical into the engine.

149
00:07:38,796 --> 00:07:42,047
It's my own little mix. It's kind
of like nitrous but three times the kick.

150
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:44,797
It's gonna turn your manifold
into pudding, so don't use it too soon.

151
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:48,425
Hey, man, I'm serious.
Don't mess my car up.

152
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:51,345
You know, we still got to find
a way to slow down Penzer.

153
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:54,473
I got you covered...
EMP cannon.

154
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,663
It emits a focused
electromagnetic pulse

155
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:00,416
that'll knock out all the electronics
in his car for 30 minutes.

156
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:11,504
This chick is toast.

157
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:15,050
I installed one
next to your rear exhaust.

158
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,496
It's the only place where it wouldn't
affect your car as well.

159
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:19,206
You show me how to trigger it.

160
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,788
You don't. I do.

161
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:23,196
I'll hit him from right here.
All I need you to do...

162
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:26,380
is get in front of Penzer,
line up so I can get a clear shot.

163
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,174
He'll just think he stalled.
30 minutes, his car is good as new.

164
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:30,918
All right. Let's do it.

165
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:36,765
You didn't get that?

166
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:39,481
"This chick is toast"?
It's "Ghostbusters".

167
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:40,934
I don't listen to you.

168
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,982
"Don't cross the streams"?
It's classic.

169
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,566
Push the car, man.

170
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:11,008
That all you got?

171
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,948
- You got to get in front of him.
- I know that, Hardison! I'm trying!

172
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,937
What's going on here?

173
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:06,548
Come on!

174
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:18,396
I'll send my guys
to pick up the car.

175
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,890
Rookie mistake.

176
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,169
All right. The mark is primed.

177
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,426
Hardison, Parker,
go find this Lefty.

178
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:29,751
Everyone else,

179
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,784
let's go steal us some cars.

180
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:51,946
Where the hell is everybody?

181
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:53,527
This place ought to be hopping.

182
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:55,904
- They're all at art's.
- Art's?

183
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,457
- They've got new management.
- Comfy?

184
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,787
- But it's the playoffs.
- It is about to be the layoffs.

185
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,833
Here. I checked them
out on the way in.

186
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:12,421
He's raffling off my car?

187
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:16,174
But on the bright side,
at least Mr. Carey's still here.

188
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:19,654
Great. We got Carey
doing his weekly looky-loo.

189
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,090
- We need paying customers.
- Yes.

190
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:24,695
- Todd?
- Yes, sir?

191
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:26,857
Is this...

192
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,438
a raffle ticket?

193
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:31,857
Yeah, it is.

194
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,734
- It's mine.
- Unbelievable!

195
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,068
Get off of Facebook!

196
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,787
Look at this.
There's no way he's making money.

197
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,727
Prices are only part of it.

198
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:50,601
He's got a new salesperson
who's unstoppable.

199
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:51,726
Who?

200
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:55,505
- Wait. I know her.
- She was at the track.

201
00:11:58,404 --> 00:11:59,968
All right, Sophie. You're up.

202
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:02,714
Look.
She's going after Mr. Carey now.

203
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,973
- Hi, there.
- That ought to cool her off.

204
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:08,100
Before you say anything,
I don't need any help. I'm just looking.

205
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:10,267
Of course.
I'm not gonna bother you.

206
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,660
I just have one little question.

207
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,525
Atkins or south beach?

208
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:17,110
What?

209
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,441
What diet are you on?
'Cause I can see your...

210
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:24,326
your belt is cinched too tight
and your shirt is a size too big.

211
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,578
You've lost what,
five, six pounds recently?

212
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,372
Seven, actually.

213
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:29,784
Seven!

214
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:33,377
Congratulations.
That is quite an achievement.

215
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:34,920
Thank you.

216
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,632
That requires so much discipline,
you know?

217
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:42,308
Denying yourself
all that sweet food,

218
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,742
all those tasty treats...

219
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,268
Now, you see her touch the car
when she says "sweet" and "tasty"?

220
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:53,184
She's making him link
those values to the car.

221
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,856
Neurolinguistic programming.

222
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,776
I couldn't do it.

223
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,026
I can't deny myself such pleasure.

224
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,844
You know, for me,

225
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:07,197
life is about seizing
opportunities, you know?

226
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,333
Live life to the fullest.

227
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,398
Drink too much wine.

228
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:13,208
Skinny-dip in the ocean.

229
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:15,460
Make love in a hammock.

230
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,213
Do you know why...

231
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,613
Just as an example.
Why driving this car

232
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:24,636
is like making love
to a beautiful woman?

233
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,639
Because I've never done
either before in my life?

234
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,475
What? A cute guy like you?

235
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,334
Now is your chance.

236
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:35,397
Just take a look.

237
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,899
Who knows where it might lead?

238
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,990
If Sophie did this full time, the auto
industry's troubles would disappear.

239
00:13:46,898 --> 00:13:49,714
- Is he signing a contract?
- I think he is.

240
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,399
I think he's crying.

241
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,085
There's the stall-out king himself.
How you doing?

242
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,212
Whatever.
I came back here to buy Veronica.

243
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,424
Sorry, I'm not gonna
give back my trophy.

244
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,094
- I'll give you $150,000 for her.
- Please. How about $300,000?

245
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,180
$300,000? That's ridiculous!

246
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,974
- Be reasonable.
- <i>Claro que si. Uno momento, por favor.</i>

247
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,457
- What is it, Skeeter?
- Mr. Lucas, you should take this call.

248
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:16,129
- It's our foreign friends.
- All right.

249
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,190
- <i>Uno momento.</i>
- Come here.

250
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,910
<i>Si?</i>

251
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:24,905
- I need you to sign off on this paper.
- Not now, honey. I'm busy.

252
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,899
The customer's ready
to write the check.

253
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,985
Now, did I hire you to look
pretty or ask stupid questions?

254
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,448
Come on, now. Move on.

255
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,371
<i>Si.</i>

256
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:38,084
He stole my baby.

257
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:40,420
I think I know how to steal his.

258
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:48,894
Could've done without the ass slap.

259
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,057
Yeah, just trying to sell the bit.

260
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:54,059
Sorry.

261
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,445
Hardison, Parker,
ball's in your court.

262
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,173
So, you stole this car?

263
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:04,053
Exactly how is this gonna
get us Lefty's attention?

264
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:06,404
Car thieves are territorial.

265
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,060
You bring a car like this
to a local chop shop,

266
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:11,518
every boost in town knows
there's a new player.

267
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,764
Also this is Lefty's car.

268
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:22,734
Yo, my man.

269
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,738
Heard you're the man to see
about chopping a car.

270
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,054
Maybe.

271
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:34,391
You jacked this car?

272
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:37,227
- This car?
- Yeah. How much?

273
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,104
Give me a minute.

274
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:42,684
Hello, Lefty.

275
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:44,917
Shouldn't be long now.

276
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,363
So...

277
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:51,908
Car thief...
How'd that happen?

278
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:54,348
Started when I was about 12.

279
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:56,535
I met this kid Kelly
in foster system.

280
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,628
He was about
four or five years older.

281
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:01,668
Taught me how to make a slim Jim,
how to use a jiggler key, you know.

282
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,420
What happened to Kelly?

283
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,215
We boosted a bait car.

284
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,010
He saw the cops coming and ran.

285
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,303
I never saw it coming.

286
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,013
He left you behind?

287
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,022
Never looked back.

288
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:19,023
Spent six months in Juvie
and never saw Kelly again.

289
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,108
All right. Here we go.

290
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,193
- So, how is this going down?
- They're gonna want us off their turf.

291
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,000
Wehave to convince them they need us.
It's not gonna be easy,

292
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,498
- and they might shoot you a little.
- What?

293
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:39,873
- You are spectacular.
- I beg your pardon.

294
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,241
As a salesman.

295
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:44,252
20 years in this business,
I've never seen a better closer, miss...

296
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:48,131
Bacich. Katie Bacich.
Thank you, Mr. Penzer.

297
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,143
Please, call me Duke.

298
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:52,052
Yes.

299
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:53,745
Spectacular.

300
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,473
Why don't you let me
buy you a drink?

301
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,591
I know the best spot in town.

302
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,187
- Mr. Penzer...
- Duke.

303
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,116
Duke, do me a favor.

304
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:07,692
Don't sell a salesman. I know
when I'm being set up for a pitch.

305
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Maybe so.

306
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,508
But don't you want to know
what I'm selling?

307
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,285
You picked the wrong car to boost.

308
00:17:17,743 --> 00:17:18,766
No, we didn't.

309
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:19,746
Lefty.

310
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:21,790
Who are you?

311
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,143
- I'm Danielle. This is major.
- What's up?

312
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:27,003
- We want to join your crew.
- We're full up.

313
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:31,494
You need us.

314
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:34,928
We stole your car, didn't we?

315
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,128
That? Anybody can steal that.

316
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,057
But nobody's dumb enough to do it.

317
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,214
Can anyone steal a car

318
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:45,146
that uses a laser-cut rolling-code
transponder key?

319
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,985
Impossible.
Those systems are unboostable.

320
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,456
We can do it...

321
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:55,115
In under two minutes.

322
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:57,524
All right.

323
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,274
Show me you can steal
an unstealable car.

324
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,018
Two minutes, or else.

325
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:09,347
Two minutes.

326
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:11,958
Don't break the window
or crack the steering column.

327
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,507
All right. Do your thing.

328
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:26,521
I have no idea
how to break into this car.

329
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,106
What?

330
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:30,984
It's new tech. Screwdriver
and a coat hanger ain't gonna cut it.

331
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,071
Once we get in,
I could probably start it,

332
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,575
but we got to get in.

333
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,990
And what, we get...
How are we gonna get in, Parker?

334
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:42,203
- Me? No.
- You can hack anything with a battery.

335
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,665
You now have
one minute and 30 seconds.

336
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:49,607
Look, you can do this.

337
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,780
- What's the hardware behind this door?
- The latch mechanism is connected

338
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:59,512
to an actuator. Send electrical signal
to the actuator, door unlocks.

339
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:02,891
- So the chip controls the signal.
- That's what you need the remote code.

340
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,113
I can send an rf signal,
but you said rolling code,

341
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:08,646
so that means billions
of combinations.

342
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,276
Ignore the distractions.
It's the first rule of the boost.

343
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:16,196
All right, look,
I can't crack the code,

344
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,742
but I may be able to confuse
the receiver.

345
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,534
I got it!

346
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:25,497
I got it. I got it.

347
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:28,792
All right. 15 seconds.

348
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,548
Transponder-equipped cars
have backdoor startup sequences,

349
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,671
an override.

350
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:39,511
It's like a cheat code for a video game,
so it should work.

351
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,379
Assuming they haven't changed
the sequence since I last did this.

352
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,019
I forgot how much fun this is.

353
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:52,912
Not bad.

354
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:56,674
All right. Bring this to my shop,
and we'll talk.

355
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:00,750
Keep an eye on them.

356
00:20:13,152 --> 00:20:15,444
So this is the best spot in town.

357
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,049
Absolutely.

358
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:21,215
This is the winner's circle.

359
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,932
Which is why
I want you to come to work for me.

360
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:27,767
I've already got a job.

361
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,227
I'll double your salary.

362
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,898
That's very generous,
but I'm not looking...

363
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,025
you're a tool to him.
Me?

364
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,070
I'm looking to build something.
And for that,

365
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,608
I need a partner.
Once he's gone,

366
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:44,159
I'll let you run that shop.

367
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:48,872
But you got to do something for me.
Tell me about his setup.

368
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:52,250
- How can he offer those deals?
- <i>Don't get too specific.</i>

369
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,968
Let him fill in the blanks.

370
00:20:54,606 --> 00:20:56,152
He works with...

371
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:58,433
Alternative suppliers.

372
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:00,049
Fleet sales?

373
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,145
Suppliers with...

374
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,599
minimal costs.

375
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:11,647
He's selling hot cars.

376
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,409
Good. He's figured out
the first part of the equation.

377
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:19,009
- Eliot, give him the rest.
- <i>Yeah, making the call now.</i>

378
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:21,830
Hello, officer? Yes, ma'am.

379
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,901
I'd like to report some unsavory
characters wandering around downtown.

380
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:31,403
They had tattoos, and I think
they were wearing gang colors,

381
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,358
and I'm pretty sure
they were speaking Spanish.

382
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,413
Yeah, I saw them walking around down
by Penzer's auto.

383
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,215
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:02,862
Chop shop, quick and dirty sales.

385
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,370
There's gonna be one, or two guys
in here cutting up their latest catch.

386
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:17,873
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

387
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,136
What's going on?

388
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:29,305
Trying to find out. Stand by.

389
00:22:31,928 --> 00:22:34,176
Got to scan
for alarm tracking systems.

390
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:38,147
Don't want cops zeroing in
on a radio signal we miss. It's clean.

391
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:44,195
Follow me.

392
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:49,206
You see,

393
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,684
selling cars doesn't have
to be some grubby little...

394
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:00,670
Son of a...

395
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,135
this is terrible.

396
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,929
Let me get my phone.
I'll call the police.

397
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:12,667
Don't call the police. I don't need
a bunch of deputy dawgs

398
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,213
snooping around here.

399
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,261
What?

400
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:20,607
You're working the same scam as A.J.

401
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,478
- You're just like him.
- No.

402
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:24,748
I am nothing like him!

403
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:33,119
It's Duke. Get me Lefty.

404
00:23:36,638 --> 00:23:37,638
Phone!

405
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,341
Over here is
your traditional chop shop.

406
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:46,382
We can strip a car and get its parts
to anywhere in the country in 24 hours.

407
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:48,634
They do vin cloning over here.

408
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,304
Clean a hot car and get it
a full set of papers in an hour.

409
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,889
What's that over there?

410
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:55,558
You know how everyone keeps
their registration

411
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,226
and insurance in the glove box?

412
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,771
We take those
and use them for identity theft.

413
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,368
Girls don't boost cars.

414
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,514
At least that's what
these guys keep telling me.

415
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:07,568
But you... you kicked ass.

416
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,449
That thing you did with your phone?
Can you teach me that?

417
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,475
Let's just go by the computers...

418
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:21,042
- Nate, did you get all that?
- Yes, I did.

419
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:22,919
It's a mall of crime.

420
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:26,047
Yes, I know.
But the plan does not change.

421
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,767
Why don't we just call the cops?

422
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:30,134
We've got more than enough
to bust these guys.

423
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,151
These guys are too careful.
They'd scatter before the cops got there.

424
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:35,475
Besides, closing down
the shop won't nail Penzer.

425
00:24:35,716 --> 00:24:37,099
No, we stick to our plan.

426
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:39,852
No, we catch them red-handed
planning something big.

427
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:42,183
<i>Sophie, did Penzer put 2
and 2 together yet?</i>

428
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,772
Doing the math now.

429
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:45,708
No. Shut up! Shut up!

430
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,443
I just want to know who did this.

431
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,189
We picked up a call
on the police scanner earlier...

432
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:53,616
some gangbangers
causing trouble near you.

433
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:55,135
Gangbangers?

434
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:56,724
<i>Speaking Spanish.</i>

435
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,351
Mr. Lucas,
I think you should take this call.

436
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,075
<i>Uno momento.</i>

437
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,525
It's Lucas.
He's working with the Latins.

438
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,754
<i>Running the boost?</i>

439
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,725
The only crew who can move
that kind of volume are the Salvadorans,

440
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,050
but they're Florida.

441
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,261
They're branching out, you idiot.

442
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,096
You mean the Salvadorans are here?

443
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:18,205
Yes, they're here. They're probably
clearing a path for Lucas

444
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,143
- and keeping an eye on him.
- <i>He's crazy.</i>

445
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,561
Salvadorans are brutal.

446
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:23,484
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

447
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:31,459
If Lucas were to, say... I don't know...
lose one of their shipments,

448
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,329
they probably wouldn't be too happy
about that, would they?

449
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,533
Gotcha.

450
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:42,915
Your boss did this.

451
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:47,670
- A.J. is a jerk, but he wouldn't...
- The question is,

452
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:50,352
do you want to work
for somebody who does this...

453
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,835
Or do you want to work for someone

454
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,105
who's bringing modern business
principles to the game.

455
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,263
- What are you talking about?
- Diversified products,

456
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,516
marketing metrics,
on line opportunities...

457
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:03,410
that is what I'm bringing
to the table.

458
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,365
I'm not talking about stickup men
and strung-out joyriders.

459
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:10,318
I'm taking this business
to the next level.

460
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:14,071
I want to see your operation.

461
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:18,117
All right. First thing tomorrow.

462
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:20,286
And all you got to do

463
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,289
is tell me when Lucas'
next shipment comes in.

464
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:33,743
Tomorrow morning at the docks...

465
00:26:35,146 --> 00:26:38,221
nine cars, top end and very hot.

466
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,308
Now...

467
00:26:44,218 --> 00:26:45,603
Let's go finish that drink.

468
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:53,361
Exactly how is that gonna help you
order pizzas better?

469
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:00,076
Slide. Don't stab.

470
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:04,497
Feel it catch on the lock rod.

471
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:08,085
Forget them.

472
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:10,711
Just tune out the distractions.
Work the problem.

473
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,869
This model has a weakness.

474
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:23,406
Here.

475
00:27:23,531 --> 00:27:25,495
Short out the posts on the solenoid.

476
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,290
Thanks.

477
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,689
Ignore those idiots, okay?

478
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,447
They've been sucking exhaust fumes
for too long.

479
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:42,159
They're not bad. They just don't want me
screwing up on a real boost.

480
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:46,364
I don't know where I'd go if they
didn't let me hang out with them.

481
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,753
Josie. Josie Marvin.

482
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,756
Here. These might help.

483
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:58,426
Listen up!

484
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,429
We've got a top order
tomorrow morning down at the docks...

485
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:04,849
nine cars.
So I'm gonna need all hands on deck.

486
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,434
Even you, shorty.

487
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,177
Nate, the hook is set.

488
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:15,792
All right.

489
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,528
Go and get me some bait.

490
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:25,888
Listen to me.

491
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:29,266
Don't go on the boost tomorrow. Call
in sick, sleep in late, don't show up.

492
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:31,936
Are you a cop?

493
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,129
But trust me, you don't want
to be there. They're all going down.

494
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:36,899
And stay away from the shop, too.

495
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,235
I don't understand...

496
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,029
These guys don't care about you.
They're not your family.

497
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:57,905
Tell me exactly what she said.

498
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,705
Tell that this boost was trouble.

499
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:02,863
And to stay clear of here.

500
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,512
And then those two just showed up out
of nowhere?

501
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,973
But they know how to boost.

502
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,475
This can't be a coincidence.
It's Lucas.

503
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,103
- He's setting me up.
- You want us to call it off?

504
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,956
We can turn this around.

505
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:20,651
Go down to the docks early,
surprise them.

506
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,987
Pack up the shop,
they're expecting to trap us here.

507
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,219
- Where should we take the cars, then?
- Bring 'em to my lot.

508
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:27,908
And the new guys?

509
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:31,912
Kill them.
Dump them down by the docks.

510
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,997
Wait. What?

511
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,042
You don't need to do that.
Just kick them out.

512
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:39,582
"Just kick them out"?

513
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,965
- This isn't a tree house, sweetheart.
- No, but you don't...

514
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,202
shut up!

515
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,418
Do me a favor. Grow a pair.

516
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:48,188
This is business.

517
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,602
Lefty should be hitting
the shipment in about an hour.

518
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,979
Hour and a half.
He called to push back our time.

519
00:30:57,682 --> 00:31:00,915
Well, that'll give Eliot more time
to offload the cars.

520
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,682
It'll also give you more time
to bring Penzer down to Lefty's.

521
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:06,363
- And once he's there, we call the cops.
- And we catch Penzer,

522
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,699
Lefty,
and the crew with the stolen cars.

523
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:11,701
By which point, we'll have already done
the blow-off. Let's go.

524
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:37,320
Get out of the truck.

525
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,584
Back away from the cars.

526
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,738
Don't want to damage
the merchandise.

527
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:51,249
Toss us the keys.

528
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,166
You want 'em?

529
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:10,656
Get him!

530
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,806
He went that way! Go!
Come on! Hustle!

531
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:17,426
Get him!

532
00:32:32,814 --> 00:32:33,873
Where is he?

533
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:36,544
He's gone.

534
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,461
We got the cars.

535
00:32:44,982 --> 00:32:46,380
Good, good. They clean?

536
00:32:46,658 --> 00:32:47,760
Checking them now.

537
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,912
Once they're done,
I'll bring them to the lot.

538
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,927
Guys will stay to handle
the other loose ends.

539
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,972
Great. I got something here
I'm gonna need you to handle.

540
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,990
Thank you.

541
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,688
So I'm anxious to see
this operation of yours.

542
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:04,648
Of course.

543
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:13,567
Wait, wait.

544
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,470
Where is everybody?

545
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,146
Cars aren't even here.

546
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:20,946
Where are you?

547
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:24,959
Something's not right.

548
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,883
- Go!
- Nate, we're blown!

549
00:33:31,561 --> 00:33:32,259
What?

550
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,080
All right, Parker, Hardison, hold tight.
Eliot?

551
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,378
<i>Sophie, you got to get out of there.</i>

552
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:44,063
Excuse me.
I just have to use the ladies room.

553
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,191
Sit down.

554
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,819
Sophie, I'm on my way.

555
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,186
- <i>Parker, Hardison, I need your help.</i>
-

556
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:01,747
Well, handle it.

557
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:03,165
Now?

558
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,574
All right. I'll be right there.

559
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,693
You stay put.

560
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,003
You got nowhere to hide.

561
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:20,744
Time's up.

562
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:32,032
"Nate," is it?

563
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:35,386
Let's go.

564
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:39,786
I don't know who you people are,
and I don't care.

565
00:34:40,402 --> 00:34:43,386
I've spent my whole life
beating pissants like you. Sit down!

566
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:46,917
Now, we're all just gonna sit here
and wait for my associate,

567
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:49,869
'cause he's much better at the...

568
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,256
Mechanical stuff.

569
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,161
Great rescue.

570
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,182
What's so funny?

571
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:24,288
Nate and Sophie.

572
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:27,791
There's got to be another car
around here somewhere.

573
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,044
Get in!

574
00:35:32,984 --> 00:35:33,964
Shotgun.

575
00:35:34,238 --> 00:35:35,438
Get in the back!

576
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:40,888
Nate, we're on our way.
Be there in 10.

577
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:50,630
Cars are here. Shop's closed up.

578
00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:52,868
Kip and the boys are mopping up down
at the dock.

579
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:54,902
Great.
Take these two with you. Quietly.

580
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:58,322
Don't want to attract a lot of attention
with all the hot cars on the lot.

581
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,958
Don't worry. We scanned them.
No signals coming out of them.

582
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:03,001
Let's go! Get up!

583
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:05,828
Shall we?

584
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,373
I was trying to help you.

585
00:36:15,498 --> 00:36:17,257
You weren't supposed to tell them.

586
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,802
I didn't know that,
I didn't think they'd try to kill you.

587
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,752
Wait. Hold up. You told her?

588
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:23,639
I should've known.
You're a menace, Parker.

589
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,182
She deserved a chance!

590
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,267
- Nate's gonna kill you.
- I'm gonna kill you.

591
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,644
Stop whining!

592
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,523
I got hit by a car!

593
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,650
"I got hit by a car." Get over it!

594
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,068
I'm gonna kill her.

595
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,278
Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

596
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,198
- Seriously, Nate's gonna kill you.
- Who are you people?

597
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,741
We're the good guys!

598
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:52,347
- Stall.
- What?

599
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:53,472
Stall!

600
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:56,338
You are such an idiot!
I can't believe I ever listened

601
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,173
to you! We're in this again!

602
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,315
- It wasn't me!
- What are you yapping about?

603
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,426
Nobody asked you!

604
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,139
Damn it! Parker,
where'd you learn to drive?

605
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,308
Before I stole cars,
I was a getaway driver.

606
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,144
Before? You started stealing cars
when you were 12.

607
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:14,286
<i>Pull to the side of the road!
Pull over!</i>

608
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:16,378
Get out of the way, you old bat!

609
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,570
Get out of the way, you old bat!

610
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,990
This is what I get for trusting
a drunk!

611
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,659
No, not again!
Nobody asked you...

612
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,120
I'm the one that ends up paying
for it every time!

613
00:37:32,224 --> 00:37:34,209
What the hell? Lefty.

614
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:35,836
Take them inside.

615
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,754
Put them in the office.
Keep them quiet.

616
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,381
I'll take care of this.

617
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:49,352
Damn it!

618
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:57,190
Officers! Just a little, small snafu.
It's all under control now.

619
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,318
- Those vehicles belong to you?
- Yes, they do.

620
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,945
Came in this morning.
Perhaps I could interest you in a deal.

621
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:04,615
- These are yours?
- Yeah. Is there a problem?

622
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:06,700
Yes, there is.

623
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,408
According to the massive number of alarm
tracking system signals we're receiving,

624
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,395
all these cars are stolen.

625
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:15,208
What?

626
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,711
Don't worry. We scanned them.
No signals coming out.

627
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,548
I just aim this thing at them
and zap them?

628
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:24,551
Yeah, man. They'll be good as dead
for half an hour.

629
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,140
There's got to be a huge mistake.

630
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:47,475
I just took delivery
of that shipment this morning.

631
00:38:48,102 --> 00:38:50,452
You know what?
The guy you want is right inside.

632
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
Come on.

633
00:38:58,481 --> 00:38:59,497
Slide over!

634
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:03,479
What's up, man?

635
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:19,112
Check all the cars in this lot.
Who knows what else is going on here?

636
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:21,620
Come on. Sir.
Please be calm.

637
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,569
It'll be a lot easier for both of us.
Come on.

638
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,250
I don't get it.

639
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:29,504
I've never seen cops respond so fast
to an alarm tracking signal.

640
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:32,217
How'd you know
they'd get here so quickly?

641
00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:35,426
Let's just say the owners
of those vehicles were highly motivated.

642
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:52,278
Maz, how come you didn't comm us
when those wannabe thugs attacked?

643
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:54,789
'Cause your little zapper thing
fried my ear bud.

644
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:57,181
Told you to take it out
before you used it.

645
00:39:57,992 --> 00:39:59,516
I was also underwater.

646
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,297
- I should work on that.
- Yeah.

647
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:05,562
Eliot, here.
Make sure you bring this back with us.

648
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:11,575
The Bauers are gonna have a little bump
in business when they get back.

649
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,243
- I could've done without the knee.
- Just selling the bit.

650
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,489
She almost got us killed.

651
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:24,397
She thought she was doing
the right thing, which means

652
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,981
she actually thought about
what the right thing might be,

653
00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:28,717
which is huge for Parker.

654
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,192
Just go easy on her, will you?

655
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:38,268
I need you to help me.

656
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,984
With Penzer's arrest, all the charges
against you have been dropped. And here.

657
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:51,118
Penzer's racecar -
worth about $150,000, maybe more

658
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:52,407
to a collector.

659
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:54,785
I can't repay this.

660
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,224
No, no.
There's no need for that.

661
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,714
But, that could go toward maybe
jump-starting your landscaping business,

662
00:41:00,952 --> 00:41:01,952
and...

663
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,736
you might want
to consider maybe hiring some new help.

664
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:08,703
She's a quick study,
and she's eager to work.

665
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:15,222
Thanks again.

666
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,223
All right.

667
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:21,856
- Have you ever done any landscaping?
- Not really,

668
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,169
but like she said,
I'm a fast learner, so...

669
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:27,672
- We'll see ya.
- Okay. Thanks.

670
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:35,155
- Well, you know, she's not a bad kid.
- No, she isn't.

671
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:38,025
She's just got to be around
the right people.

672
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,570
Yeah. Don't we all?

673
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,157
You saw me take down
that guy, right?

674
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,253
- The little guy? Yeah.
- He wasn't little.

675
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,003
He's pretty...
He had big shoulders.

676
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:51,641
I want to say thank you.
Thank you, by the way.

677
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,990
Why?

678
00:41:54,087 --> 00:41:55,082
For the car.

679
00:41:55,207 --> 00:41:57,363
Any time you want to borrow it,
it's yours, man.

680
00:41:57,488 --> 00:41:58,574
It's fast.

681
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:00,368
No, any time you want to borrow it.

682
