1
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:09,691
Yeah, I'm still at work.

2
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:12,211
Well, it's better than being
alone in my hotel room.

3
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:13,623
No, I am not.

4
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:15,980
I am not obsessed.

5
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:18,660
I know what obsessed is.
This is not obsessed.

6
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:25,979
It's done. Seal the exits.
No one gets in or out.

7
00:00:26,222 --> 00:00:28,402
Get this one up.
You are under arrest.

8
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:31,957
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,556
I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

10
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,667
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

11
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:42,525
We steal it back for you.

12
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:50,366
And sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

13
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,412
We provide...

14
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:56,813
leverage!

15
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:00,434
Season 2 - Episode 12
The Zanzibar Marketplace Job

16
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:05,513
Two weeks in Tokyo.
We'd have a great time.

17
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:06,979
What are we stealing?

18
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:09,593
We don't steal anything.
We'd be tourists.

19
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:11,404
Not following you.

20
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:15,634
There you go.

21
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,724
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Anytime.

22
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:21,964
- What?
- Really?

23
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:24,333
- What, I can't have a friend?
- Join a softball team.

24
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:28,860
Our next client...
Two kids, no job, pension gone.

25
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:32,074
State grabbed their land
under eminent domain.

26
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,543
So, these are all
your little lost sheep?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,003
Excuse me?

28
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:37,518
You can't save them all.

29
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:43,919
I'm getting some coffee.

30
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,023
He's drinking again.

31
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,126
- I'm not an idiot, Tara.
- I was told this was a problem.

32
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:53,313
The drinking is not a problem.
It's a symptom.

33
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:54,560
Hey. All right.

34
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,063
Okay, so...

35
00:01:58,857 --> 00:01:59,698
What we...

36
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,546
Eliot, I'm gonna ask you
not to do anything violent.

37
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,435
What? What are you talking about?

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,619
I only use violence
as an appropriate response.

39
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,845
Hello, Nate.

40
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:41,160
And this is?

41
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:44,877
James Sterling.
We used to work together.

42
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,248
Insurance.

43
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:48,599
He seems to rub Eliot the wrong way.

44
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:49,659
You think?

45
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:03,666
Hello, Sterling.
What are you doing here?

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,635
Actually, I came to offer you a job.

47
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,004
There's nothing you can say
to make us work with you.

48
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,831
It's Maggie.

49
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,548
Get him upstairs.

50
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:23,380
This Fabergé egg was commissioned
by czar Nicholas of Russia.

51
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,655
Being one of only 69
known to survive,

52
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,985
it's worth $9 million.

53
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:32,477
Maggie was working at the museum,
verifying russian artifacts

54
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:33,857
donated for an exhibit.

55
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:37,499
The night of the robbery,
she was the only person at the museum.

56
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,834
And there you have it.

57
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,670
- Who is...
- Maggie's Nate's ex-wife.

58
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,264
Okay. Is there any chance
she took the egg?

59
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,484
Maggie's the most honest person we know.
But besides that, she's okay.

60
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,178
Maggie's being set up.

61
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,347
You live and work here?

62
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:56,318
- I like the old place better.
- Do not mention the old offices.

63
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,563
Maggie is where,
precisely, right now?

64
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,860
Currently awaiting trial
in the Kiev jail.

65
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:04,776
When I heard that dear Maggie was
being held without bail, I rushed...

66
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,654
Please. As soon as you found out
that the Fabergé egg

67
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,912
that your company insures
went missing, you...

68
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:11,472
Rushed to the Ukraine.

69
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:14,002
Of course, I was unable
to clear her name.

70
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:17,199
- I assume you have another suspect?
- Absolutely.

71
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:21,578
Alexander Lundy.
International real-estate mogul.

72
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:24,207
Very rich, very powerful.

73
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,416
My only problem is that he
works at the american embassy,

74
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,552
which makes him untouchable
by normal law enforcement.

75
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,118
We got to book it. Our flight to Kiev
leaves in three hours.

76
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:35,357
- Okay. Let's go.
- Hang on.

77
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:39,194
- I'm not working next to this guy.
- No, you don't have to.

78
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,531
I'll work with him.
You have a different job.

79
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,399
- What?
- You're the retrieval specialist.

80
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,962
Retrieve my wife from jail.
Let's go!

81
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:06,938
Eliot, Hardison just got
to the police station.

82
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:08,961
They're waiting to see
the inspector in charge.

83
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:11,377
<i>Good. Once you get her out,
you need to disappear.</i>

84
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:14,429
She'll never see us.
How's Sterling's suspect?

85
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:17,466
You mean the financial
genius Alexander Lundy?

86
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,792
Yeah, definitely guilty.

87
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:23,530
- Alexander.
- Mr. Lundy.

88
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:26,227
Yeah, so, Mr. Lundy,

89
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:29,906
what does an economic liaison
do here at the american embassy?

90
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,382
I use my contacts from my business
in international real estate

91
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,283
to bring investments
to developing nations,

92
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,894
- such as those in eastern Europe.
- I see. Is that profitable?

93
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,266
Yes, very.

94
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,124
That's the point.

95
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,794
Profitable enough to buy
a $9 million Fabergé egg?

96
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,727
I like pretty things.

97
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:51,659
Anticipating discussion
of this topic,

98
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,603
I have brought copies
of the insurance paperwork.

99
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,329
I also brought a copy
of Mr. Lundy's schedule,

100
00:05:57,454 --> 00:06:01,176
which will verify his alibi
on the day and night in question.

101
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,238
- Thank you...
- Sam. Sam Phillips.

102
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,076
Mr. Lundy is not
under investigation.

103
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:13,155
We'd like to resolve this rather awful
situation as quickly as possible.

104
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,459
That's very fair of you.

105
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:22,631
I personally have no doubt you will get
what's coming to you very soon.

106
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,822
No.

107
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:34,279
Maybe we've been unclear.
We were sent by the american embassy.

108
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:36,894
We have documents
authorized by your government,

109
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,551
requesting the release of Maggie Collins
into the US embassy's custody.

110
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,950
No.

111
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:44,752
Can I ask why you're being
so dismissive of my fine documents,

112
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:47,611
which took a lot of work,
personal time, research?

113
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:49,353
If I release miss Collins,

114
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:51,860
I have no guarantee
she will return for trial.

115
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,062
She will run straight
to american embassy,

116
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,372
where she will be untouchable,
and I will be made fool.

117
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:58,360
<i>Nyet.</i>

118
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:00,662
- That means "no."
- Yeah, I got it.

119
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:04,335
You cannot out-bureaucrat
A former soviet union bureaucrat.

120
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,505
These guys gamed the most corrupt system
on Earth for 50 years.

121
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,207
Paperwork's not gonna cut it.

122
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:11,509
They're used to trading favors,
not forms.

123
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,272
- Hang on. Wait, wait.
- No.

124
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:16,971
Look,

125
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,873
I didn't want to have
to pull this card, all right?

126
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,191
I'm trying to use discretion here.

127
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:59,490
Do you have any idea
who this woman's lover is?

128
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:11,864
Still, you are not allowed
to leave the country, of course.

129
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,091
I understand.

130
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:15,946
And, please,
give the minister my best.

131
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,565
Anytime I can help,
he should call to me directly.

132
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,316
I will. Thank you.

133
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,418
I'm sorry. What minister?

134
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,393
Yes, of course.
"What minister?"

135
00:08:34,768 --> 00:08:36,846
Do not worry.
The men were very discreet.

136
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:40,268
You are not releasing me
because you think I'm innocent.

137
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:43,928
What did these men look like?

138
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:48,473
That lying son of a...

139
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:51,777
I mean, look at these financials.
The credit crunch wiped him out.

140
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,757
He's maybe three, four months
from declaring bankruptcy.

141
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,389
Lundy offers the egg up to
the museum for the exhibition

142
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:00,911
so that it falls
under their insurance policy,

143
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:05,085
hires a little local muscle to help
with the heist tidy payout.

144
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:07,213
I just need some proof.

145
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:08,871
It was an inside job.

146
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,136
Average keypad hack time
is 1 minute, 9.3 seconds.

147
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,595
Inner door access card takes at least
30 seconds for anybody but Hardison.

148
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:18,355
And then the vault was
an old Mark II Remington.

149
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,559
In and out average...
7 minutes, 40 seconds.

150
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,936
But these thieves,
they did it in 5 minutes, 12 seconds.

151
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,928
Maggie had the best access,

152
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:27,682
so the real thieves only had
to get her codes and badge.

153
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,818
Yeah, only way they could
pull it off that fast.

154
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,807
How long has she been sitting...

155
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:35,846
Maggie's on his calendar.

156
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:39,190
He had lunch with her the day of the
heisting to discuss his collection.

157
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,363
So, while he's keeping her
busy at lunch,

158
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,412
his men take her ID cards
and access codes,

159
00:09:47,697 --> 00:09:50,294
and she gets framed for the heist.

160
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:53,341
Oh, boy, I'm gonna nail
this son of a bitch.

161
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,346
I can explain.

162
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:09,209
Maggie, it's not what you think.

163
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,818
It's your first time being a fugitive,
so I made you a bag...

164
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,187
Thank you, Parker.

165
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,426
It's not that I don't appreciate
getting out of jail...

166
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:17,977
- I just can't live my life a fugitive.
- But you're not.

167
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:19,909
Passports, money, lock picks.

168
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,745
You were released, not broken out.

169
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,539
Toothpaste, explosives.
Do not mix these up.

170
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:27,739
Thank you, Parker.
But you released me to run.

171
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:29,919
I'm not going anywhere
until my name is cleared.

172
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,722
That's what I'm here to do...
To get the egg back, to clear your name.

173
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,884
You're clearing my name with thieves.
No offense, Parker.

174
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,093
At what?

175
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,700
Actually, Nate's been rehabilitated.

176
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:44,300
He's here on official IYS business,

177
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:47,432
as a consultant.
I brought him on.

178
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,224
You've gone straight?

179
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,608
The only reason they're here
is to deal with the authorities

180
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,947
And to get you released.
They're not staying.

181
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:55,128
Absolutely not.

182
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,038
I don't trust them.

183
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:59,854
- They don't trust me.
- Eliot already punched him.

184
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:02,724
You know, it's all aboveboard.
It's perfectly legit.

185
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:05,321
The best thing you could do would be
go back to the hotel.

186
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,157
 I'll call you. 

187
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,119
- I promise.
- This looks like gum. Not gum.

188
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,086
- Diamond-edged file blade.
- That's great.

189
00:11:12,577 --> 00:11:14,330
She needs this stuff.

190
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,230
I'm just gonna help you with this.

191
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,712
Crime suits you.

192
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:25,317
- You're becoming a much better liar.
- Thanks.

193
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,897
Let's nail this Lundy
before Maggie figures that out.

194
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:34,196
So, I took your advice
and did the whole touristy thing.

195
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,683
Went to the museum,
and it was amazing.

196
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,226
- You see?
- Yeah.

197
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:41,936
They have a guardian T-840 system.
I've only seen those things in books.

198
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,869
And the motion detectors...
gorgeous!

199
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,487
Six digital receptors. Six!

200
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:50,516
- What about the paintings?
- What about the paintings?

201
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,008
Finally.

202
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,636
Finally, somebody who can help us

203
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:03,379
with this marriage visa.

204
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:08,053
This is Luba. I want her to get back
home to the states with me.

205
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,146
It's true love.

206
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,723
- We meet on internet.
- We did, we did.

207
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,557
- You've got the wrong person.
- The girl at the front, she said...

208
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:20,634
She said that you was
the man with the...

209
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,174
You're right. You're not, this ain't...
It's not you. I am terribly sorry.

210
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,236
That's fine.
Let's just get this cleaned up.

211
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,583
You know how it is
with the girls on the internet.

212
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,841
- Sometimes they ain't girls.
- Right.

213
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:33,576
Right, right.

214
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,322
- Best of luck.
- <i>Spacibo.</i>

215
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:44,155
Alexander's got a travel visa
to the united arab emirates.

216
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,327
He's also setting up accounts
in the caymans,

217
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:47,849
Macau, and switzerland.

218
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,767
Countries with no extradition treaty...
Tax havens.

219
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:55,148
 Doesn't look like someone who's going
to wait around for an insurance payout.

220
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:57,112
And this guy showed up on his phone.

221
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,769
I know him. That's Adrian Chernov.
He's a fence.

222
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:01,244
A fence?

223
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:03,322
- So, he's selling it.
- <i>Sure he's selling it.</i>

224
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:06,275
He's gonna sell that egg on
the black market and run.

225
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,295
I got to hand it to the guy.
It's a good plan.

226
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,538
- I feel bad for screwing it up.
- <i>Really?</i>

227
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:11,523
I don't.

228
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,334
Hardison, can you get chernov's

229
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,615
<i>location for Tara and Eliot, please?</i>

230
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:29,776
Chernov.

231
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,151
I got this one.

232
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,777
Really? What are you gonna say to him?
Because we got no cover story.

233
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:37,900
- We got no background on this cat.
- That's it, then. I won't say anything.

234
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,634
Really. Not one word. Just when he turns
around and looks at you,

235
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,856
do that thing with your eyes
that scares people.

236
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,774
I don't know
what you're talking about.

237
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,318
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

238
00:13:58,929 --> 00:13:59,829
What the...

239
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,189
Who the hell are you?

240
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,717
Do I know you?

241
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,554
Did Samuels send you?

242
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,041
I paid them off.
I took care of it.

243
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:18,170
Oh, god.

244
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,944
Please. Is this about the item?

245
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:26,323
I didn't know.

246
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:27,982
No one told me.

247
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:30,983
Wait!

248
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:32,429
Here.

249
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:34,455
This is all I have.

250
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:35,831
I'll back out.

251
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:37,959
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,203
Sorry!

253
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,548
What we imagine is always
so much better than the reality.

254
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,070
Like love?

255
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:56,852
It's blank.

256
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:01,042
What the hell is this?

257
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,058
<i>It's a Zanzibar marketplace.</i>

258
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,044
<i>The marketplace
is a one-time event...</i>

259
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,932
<i>crops up in a city after an
important piece has been stolen.</i>

260
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:10,627
<i>You should have seen Stockholm
after the Rembrandt heist.</i>

261
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:12,401
<i>Parking was a bloody nightmare.</i>

262
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,685
How do people find out about it?

263
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,788
<i>Well, the prospective buyers are invited
by their black-market contacts.</i>

264
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,368
<i>They show up,
they verify the merchandise,</i>

265
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:23,200
<i>and they make a sealed bid.</i>

266
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:27,068
<i>Shine an ultraviolet light
on that card.</i>

267
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,454
Seriously?

268
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,118
You have one just laying around?

269
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:37,561
<i>The bidder's ID number and the time
of the auction's encrypted on the card.</i>

270
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,544
<i>The bidders write their bid
on the back of the card...</i>

271
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:42,412
<i>One number, no zeros,</i>

272
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:44,923
<i>and then they hand it
to the seller in a sealed envelope.</i>

273
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,652
<i>They leave town immediately.</i>

274
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,431
<i>A week later, if they win,
they transfer the money,</i>

275
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:54,151
<i>and the merchandise is couriered
to them by messenger</i>

276
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,371
- <i>as soon as the heat's died down.</i>
- So, no names,

277
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:58,327
no contact with the money
or the item?

278
00:15:58,452 --> 00:15:59,253
Nice.

279
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:02,275
A marketplace means multiple buyers
all at the same time.

280
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:05,471
- Where's he gonna do this?
- At the embassy.

281
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:10,054
The american embassy is
having a party tonight.

282
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:11,502
Perfect cover.

283
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,721
Embassy's a great place to
store stolen merchandise.

284
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:16,604
Pretty much american territory. Local
cops can't even get through the gate.

285
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:19,097
Even if we can prove
that Alexander has the egg,

286
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:20,981
police can't touch him,
search for it.

287
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,611
If we can't let loose the dogs of law
enforcement on him, what do we do?

288
00:16:25,773 --> 00:16:27,565
We steal the damn thing back.

289
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:43,096
Best be right about all this.

290
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:46,095
I pulled a lot of strings
to get tickets for all of you.

291
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,147
<i>All of you?</i>

292
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,281
Wait, no, Hardison... he's in the van,
eating stale candy

293
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:54,336
while all you get to dine on canapes
and champagne.

294
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:57,598
- I love canapes.
- <i>I'm terribly sorry about that.</i>

295
00:16:57,774 --> 00:17:00,215
The company has to draw the line
somewhere.

296
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:03,372
I can assure you it has nothing to do
with our little incident last year.

297
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:04,605
<i>You mean the incident</i>

298
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:06,929
where I came within 5 feet
of blowing your ass up?

299
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:09,112
I'm sure it has nothing to do
with that at all.

300
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:11,520
Van smells like cabbage.

301
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:14,571
How do you put up with all
this nagging in your ear?

302
00:17:17,097 --> 00:17:18,912
I've learned
to block most of it out.

303
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:22,940
Okay, guys, Tara's on the grift.
She's got the bidding envelope,

304
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,018
So she's gonna head
into the auction.

305
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:28,390
There's something
I need to tell you.

306
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,087
Now, guys, once she spots the egg,

307
00:17:31,212 --> 00:17:33,740
Eliot, Parker, you move in
and clean it out.

308
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,656
How are we gonna turn Lundy
over to the cops?

309
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,486
Well, we're not.
We're gonna get the egg,

310
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:45,035
and then Sterling's gonna use his pull
with IYS to clear Maggie.

311
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,073
Clearing Maggie is the priority.

312
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,412
It's on the tip of my tongue.

313
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,171
Yes.

314
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:00,799
That.

315
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,397
Try to have fun, now.

316
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,085
Alexander's seen you with me,
so you can't be the bidder.

317
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,228
- Eliot, you're first team.
- He needs the envelope.

318
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,767
So get it to him. Make sure Maggie
doesn't see Eliot or parker.

319
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,209
Parker, double reverse on three.

320
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,183
I thought you said
your friends were gone.

321
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:50,385
- You know, she's not...
- Tara Carlisle.

322
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,511
- Hi. Maggie Collins.
- Hi.

323
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:55,323
Mr. Ford, Maggie told me
how you helped her get out of jail.

324
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,098
- Thank you so much.
- Don't mention it.

325
00:18:58,223 --> 00:19:01,847
After all, what was I supposed to do,
Let her sit and rot in a ukrainian jail

326
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:05,566
to think about the poor choices
she's made without setting things right

327
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,170
r explaining herself?

328
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:08,752
Cheers.

329
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,265
Sorry.

330
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,767
I'm a little bit lost.

331
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:21,797
I have one of these.

332
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:28,256
Here you go.

333
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:33,197
All right, Nate, he's hired
some local security on the payroll.

334
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,760
Watch yourself.

335
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,069
<i>So...</i>

336
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:44,026
- You guys are...
- Yes, we are.

337
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,907
And you and Tara are...

338
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,544
Yes. Very much so, yes.

339
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:51,334
Mr. Ford,
how's the investigation coming?

340
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:54,107
Actually, we're kind of moving in
on someone right now.

341
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:57,450
Most thieves aren't nearly as smart
or good-looking as they think they are.

342
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:01,788
I'm sorry, Mr. Lundy,
but the ambassador is leaving.

343
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:03,762
- I think we should...
- Yes.

344
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:06,395
I apologize, but duty calls.

345
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,556
It was nice to meet you.
It was nice to meet you.

346
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:22,681
Hey, I'm not Sophie.
You want to drink, go ahead.

347
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,481
I'd drink, too, if I were you.

348
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:27,189
Smart, handsome, successful.

349
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:30,114
You know, I think he's
younger than you, too.

350
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:35,227
Okay, you guys,
Alexander's on the move.

351
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:37,752
Don't let that egg
out of your sight.

352
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,336
All right, they're about
to present the merchandise.

353
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:52,875
- They're bringing it out right now.
- Yeah.

354
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,532
All right, slight problem.

355
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:57,499
Smart.

356
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,016
Eliot, get them to prove that it's not
an old recording. I'll trace the signal.

357
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:03,594
Pardon me. I'm sor...

358
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,554
Am I the only one that. How do we know
that this is not a recording?

359
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,629
Could you ask him to move it?

360
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,205
Resituate the egg.

361
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,014
Now, worst-case scenario, that room
you're looking at is 100 miles away.

362
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:23,369
I am checking the internet traffic
in and out of the embassy network.

363
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:25,544
Just get me a few more seconds.

364
00:21:26,138 --> 00:21:28,100
Excuse me.
Can... can you have him show me

365
00:21:28,225 --> 00:21:31,466
A five, three, five,
two, two, please?

366
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:34,743
Show us five, three, five, two, two.

367
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:43,204
You're out of time, Hardison.

368
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:46,629
Nothing coming out of the pipeline
is big enough to be that camera feed.

369
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,811
That room is inside the building.

370
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:51,565
Eliot, do you see any wires
running into the laptop?

371
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,915
Okay, that means they're running it
off their ad hoc wireless network.

372
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,173
All I have to do is isolate
the camera's I.P. Address.

373
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:03,121
See, all the cold-war embassies
Were honeycombed with secret corridors

374
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:05,685
And secret rooms
for listening posts,

375
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,701
But none of them are used anymore.

376
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,548
Parker,
I'm sending you the map right now.

377
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,889
Just follow the ping.
That's your egg room.

378
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:16,057
I got it.

379
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:25,881
I know exactly what you mean.
What you mean.

380
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:27,735
Sorry to interrupt this.

381
00:22:28,524 --> 00:22:30,874
- Can I get two minutes?
- Oh, sure.

382
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:32,802
- Bye.
- Bye.

383
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,841
Yeah, Alexander seems, nice.

384
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:39,284
Yeah, he is.
And Tara seems so sweet.

385
00:22:39,547 --> 00:22:41,309
She's a foreign aid worker.

386
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:43,487
Really? I mean, really.

387
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,723
Yes. Really.

388
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:47,755
So, what happened to Sophie?

389
00:22:48,014 --> 00:22:49,966
That got a bit complicated.

390
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,886
Right, because you're
such a simple man.

391
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,508
Anyway, I should go find Alexander.

392
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:00,525
Yeah. You know, I'd actually
like to talk to him, too.

393
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,100
You know, maybe we can go together,
See what he's up to...

394
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,729
Together.

395
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:13,747
I'm right outside the door.
There's no sign of Alexander down here.

396
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:16,560
Your bids, please.

397
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:19,386
All right, parker,

398
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,901
They just shut off the
feed to the egg room, okay?

399
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,877
Whoever's in that room
is gonna be coming out.

400
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,878
I can't get past him.

401
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:35,936
I'm out of position.

402
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,456
Me too.

403
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,749
- What are you doing there, buddy?
- You are interfering

404
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:59,605
with the natural
course of my events.

405
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:01,462
Listen...

406
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,985
Maybe you can help me.

407
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,510
I'm supposed to meet my brother's...

408
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:09,155
It's a secret. It's a secret.

409
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:14,007
- Can you help?
- Yeah, absolutely.

410
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:16,604
- Cool. You come with me.
- And get my bottle. It's empty.

411
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:19,995
- Okay. You sure? You're very strong.
- Thank you.

412
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,315
Oh. Careful now.

413
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,537
I've got the package.

414
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:32,707
Great. Let's clear out before
they realize the egg is gone.

415
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:33,894
Anyone seen Nate?

416
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,569
You're welcome.

417
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:40,852
I don't know how you
people ever manage...

418
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,340
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

419
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,722
That just happens sometimes
with the ear buds...

420
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:46,140
You know, feedback.

421
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,928
As I was saying, the method...

422
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:52,275
Sorry.

423
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,183
This isn't gonna stop until I...

424
00:24:56,534 --> 00:24:59,605
Stop talking. Shh. Please.

425
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:08,216
Where's Nate?

426
00:25:10,098 --> 00:25:12,148
I swear I saw him duck in here.

427
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:16,442
Yes, but we haven't checked
the southeast corridor,

428
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,940
And, you know, I'd really like to give
him the good news myself.

429
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:21,575
I've heard that voice before.

430
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,118
What?

431
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:28,282
You don't even know that you do it,
do you?

432
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,050
I'm sorry, doing what?

433
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:34,239
That's your intercom voice.
You lied to me!

434
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,866
Wait, wait, wait. Maggie, Alexander...
you need to know...

435
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,680
- Do not drag him into this.
- Well, he's already into this,

436
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,728
More than you
I hate to be the one to tell you.

437
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:43,030
- Nate!
- No!

438
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:03,593
What?

439
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,855
No offense, but I think I
was better off in jail.

440
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,173
I think we were tasered...

441
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:14,148
Same thing that happened
to me at the robbery.

442
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:15,894
Did...

443
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:17,938
You see who did this?

444
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,123
Yeah, they looked
like security guards from the embassy.

445
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,441
Yeah, Eliot warned me about that.

446
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:27,083
I already tried it. It's locked.

447
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:28,846
Come on, come on.

448
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,400
- I just said it was locked.
- Yeah, no, I know. It's just,

449
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:37,078
Men.

450
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,529
This isn't good. I can't get him
on the cellphone, not on the comm.

451
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:49,817
Case is closed, people.
The egg is back.

452
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:53,245
I'm sure Nate is breaking it to Maggie
about her continued poor choice in men.

453
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:55,069
It's Nate's cell.

454
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,704
<i>We have your people.</i>

455
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:57,965
<i>No police.</i>

456
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:00,477
<i>Await further instructions.</i>

457
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:05,600
What are you doing?

458
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:08,887
Calling the police.
They don't get to dictate to...

459
00:27:09,012 --> 00:27:10,715
We're not calling the cops.

460
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,040
Two hostages means they can
kill one to make a point.

461
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,365
All right, listen.

462
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,013
There's three types of
calls we can get next.

463
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,892
One... amateur.
Cash and a dump site.

464
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,627
Number two... professional.

465
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:27,052
That's wire transfers and multipl
e-location drop-offs.

466
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,526
And three... targeted.

467
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,059
- Targeted toward us?
- No.

468
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,972
Towards a specific ransom demand...

469
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:37,425
Not cash.

470
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,868
- You're not risking a 9 million...
- It might be the only chance.

471
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,075
On a hunch!

472
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,260
Let me run this.

473
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,021
We track the calls, find out whoever
it is, have the police surround...

474
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:50,625
Sterling,
I'm the retrieval specialist.

475
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:52,485
That's my job.

476
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:57,284
Your friends' lives
hang in the balance,

477
00:27:58,332 --> 00:27:59,997
And you're gonna take your cues

478
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:02,662
Off a punch-up artist instead of me?

479
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,279
Call me when you need me.

480
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:11,428
'cause you will need me.

481
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,404
Basically, we're looking
for anything to help us get out of here.

482
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:24,241
Nate? At the party, you were trying
to tell me something about Alexander.

483
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:27,095
- We can deal with that later.
- No. Why don't you just tell me now?

484
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,085
- Getting you out is the priority.
- Why don't you tell...

485
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,113
You don't understand! You don't have
to do this! I'll give you anything!

486
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:34,438
Take my watch!

487
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,112
It's a patek phillipe!
Oh, thank god!

488
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:39,944
It's Alexander. He's gone crazy.

489
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,865
That's what I was trying
to tell you upstairs.

490
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:49,578
There's no sign of Alexander
at his home or the embassy.

491
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:52,503
And his embassy car has been signed out.
He's spooked.

492
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,950
He's angry. We took his payday.

493
00:28:55,654 --> 00:28:57,077
All right, all right.

494
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:02,283
Go.

495
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,549
<i>If you follow our instructions,</i>

496
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,474
<i>Your friends will be
returned unharmed.</i>

497
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:08,789
We agree. Tell us what you want.

498
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:11,535
<i>You owe me $9 million.</i>

499
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,801
- It's alex. It's Alexander.
- I still have a buyer for the egg.

500
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:17,358
Return it,
and I return your friends.

501
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:19,915
I want proof of life now.

502
00:29:21,123 --> 00:29:22,123
<i>Agreed.</i>

503
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,407
Yeah, we got Alexander's financials,

504
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:29,964
And he's three months from bankruptcy,
the theft was definitely an inside job.

505
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:33,056
I think you were right. I don't think
we should talk about this right now.

506
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:36,564
I know it is difficult hearing this
about your boyfriend. I get that.

507
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:39,117
Boyfriend? We date, Nate.
We go on dates.

508
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:42,603
That's probably not as exciting as
stealing art with your new friend Tara.

509
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:45,704
I'm not dating Tara. Now, what you do is
you make a cut here...

510
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:47,571
I knew it. You're dating Sophie.

511
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:50,312
I'm not dating Sophie, either.
I'm not dating anyone.

512
00:29:50,437 --> 00:29:52,908
But good for you, moving on
with a thieving kidnapper.

513
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:55,505
- That's terrific.
- Alleged thieving kidnapper.

514
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,618
- Call it...
- No, it's all true.

515
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,077
I found some irregularities
in mr. Lundy's finances.

516
00:30:01,324 --> 00:30:04,111
He told me they were no problem.
He took the files,

517
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:07,205
<i>Which, of course, tipped me off.
I knew something was wrong.</i>

518
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,522
- There's our proof of life.
-<i> I didn't have access to all his books.</i>

519
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:12,228
I was in that room earlier.

520
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:15,096
- That's the room the egg was in.
- They're at the embassy.

521
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:18,386
But it doesn't do us any good. We can't
storm it, and the police can't touch it.

522
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,646
-<i> Immigration papers, which,</i>
- You know, my team found.

523
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,054
Your team?

524
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:25,767
I thought you said your team had gone.
You lied to me.

525
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:27,555
You've been lying {\to
me }since we got here.

526
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,788
then he told me
he was going to kill me, and his

527
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:33,438
- men threw me in here like an animal.
- I was lying to you for your own good.

528
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:35,252
little hint for
your next marriage...

529
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,504
That excuse does not fly
with any woman on earth.

530
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,356
Next marriage? Really nice to say.

531
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:41,100
You know what?
I've heard that before.

532
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:42,967
Heard what?
What are you talking about?

533
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,560
Are you actually having
this argument now?

534
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:47,881
- She started it.
- He started it.

535
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:52,848
<i>I've sent you the address.</i>

536
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:54,678
Come alone at dawn.

537
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:57,781
<i>Bring the egg...</i>

538
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:00,510
<i>Or your friends die.</i>

539
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:06,992
Okay, the address Is one of
Alexander's construction sites...

540
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:08,357
Local project.

541
00:31:08,482 --> 00:31:10,593
Abandoned after his
business got in trouble.

542
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:13,575
Now we have to go convince Sterling,
who hates you...

543
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,198
Us. Hates us.

544
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,726
To loan you a

545
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:19,401
$9 million antique So you can
bring it to a ransom drop?

546
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:22,402
Listen...
we know who's behind this, all right?

547
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:24,176
We know what they want.

548
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,441
We have the upper hand here.

549
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:28,345
We do.

550
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:54,011
Well, that was close.

551
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:00,699
You owe me $9 million.

552
00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:03,398
Give me that.

553
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:06,210
The thing everyone screws up when
they fake their own death...

554
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:07,768
No body.

555
00:32:08,248 --> 00:32:10,113
Well, that can work, but it

556
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,766
leaves no suspect for
the police to chase.

557
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:14,898
- You won't get away with this.
- No,

558
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:16,615
you will. Of course.

559
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:19,415
I've left an evidence
trail a mile wide...

560
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,352
Visa applications,
accounts in offshore banks.

561
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,588
- You were my friend!
- I was your employee.

562
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:26,224
And thanks to your screw-ups,

563
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:28,932
I was an employee with no pension,
no savings,

564
00:32:29,057 --> 00:32:30,233
no nothing.

565
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:32,943
That was really,

566
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,319
really unacceptable to me.

567
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,919
It's a good plan.

568
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:39,776
What?

569
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:41,983
Listen, I spent 20 years chasing,

570
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:44,766
You know, guys that faked
their own death. I mean, this one...

571
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:47,248
- it's pretty well thought-out.
- Exactly.

572
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:49,695
Alexander Lundy, desperate for cash,

573
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:50,948
turns to violence.

574
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:54,512
And his poor assistant, Sam,
loyal to the last,

575
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,489
caught in the cross fire

576
00:32:56,795 --> 00:32:58,599
at a ransom drop gone bad.

577
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:01,088
- Cross fire?
- More like a blast radius.

578
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:04,424
That Alexander Lundy is crazy.

579
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:16,473
Sam, don't do this, please.
I'll pay you! I'll pay you anything!

580
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:17,715
Pay me? With what?

581
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,211
You can't even put
walls in this place.

582
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:24,145
- When Nate's people get here...
- Oh, they should already be here.

583
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,609
Just not, you know, here.

584
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,579
- Go.
- <i>Put the egg in the elevator.</i>

585
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:40,144
<i>Send it down.
We send your people up.</i>

586
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,205
- I want proof of life.
- So do I.

587
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,226
Picture of the egg. Now.

588
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:45,785
Your man's persistent.

589
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,832
Well...

590
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:49,412
He'll be dead in

591
00:33:49,537 --> 00:33:51,232
about two minutes, so

592
00:33:52,222 --> 00:33:53,563
it doesn't really matter.

593
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,956
You're never gonna get out
of the country.

594
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:14,556
Oh, but the embassy
car is waiting outside.

595
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:17,459
Straight to the airport,
right past customs, and into a

596
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:19,765
private jet,
all in Alexander's name.

597
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:22,378
We'll be in south america
by the time they're through

598
00:34:22,503 --> 00:34:25,202
hosing you and your friend
up there off the walls.

599
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:43,427
Your friends for the Fabergé egg.

600
00:34:43,595 --> 00:34:44,894
Put it in the elevator.

601
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:51,594
It's on its way down.

602
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:12,409
Come on, come on!

603
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,314
- Can you defuse it?
- I'm trying.

604
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,794
When I get it, I will.

605
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:31,836
Nate...

606
00:35:33,283 --> 00:35:34,130
What?

607
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,210
Get the car started.

608
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:55,306
What?

609
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:20,530
Excuse me.
I just have to grab that bomb.

610
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,098
Oh, my god.

611
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:31,754
The, uh, elevator stopped.

612
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,054
Yeah.

613
00:36:56,598 --> 00:36:57,400
Go.

614
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:17,430
It's okay.

615
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:20,182
First bomb's always the hardest.

616
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:23,729
You know,
it's not that embarrassing.

617
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:26,529
I do not want to talk about it.

618
00:37:29,412 --> 00:37:32,565
How did you get the elevators to stop
without the numbers stopping?

619
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,209
I sped them up 1.5 seconds per
floor for the first 10 floors...

620
00:37:39,244 --> 00:37:42,491
And then I sent them down regular
speed for the last 10 floors.

621
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:46,276
There was a 15-second window in
the middle for Parker to work her magic.

622
00:37:46,444 --> 00:37:48,722
- Looks like I missed the party.
- They do what we thought?

623
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,873
Ran right to their little embassy car
and headed straight for the airport,

624
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:53,183
fast as they could.

625
00:38:01,123 --> 00:38:02,439
This is an embassy car.

626
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:03,809
You were speeding.

627
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:05,551
American embassy.

628
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,398
You cannot pull us over
or give us a ticket. Now, we are late

629
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:10,350
- for a flight...
- This not a embassy car.

630
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:11,968
Does not have embassy plates.

631
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:13,921
Please, officer,
don't be ridiculous.

632
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:18,293
This...

633
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,069
this isn't right.

634
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:21,434
Listen.

635
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,657
- Listen to me.
- Plates are reported stolen.

636
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:26,139
Against the car. Now!
Against the car!

637
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:27,740
The plates have been switched!

638
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:30,558
This is a sovereign vehicle of
the United States government!

639
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,056
- You have no authorization.
- Be quiet! Put your head down!

640
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:35,811
How did...

641
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:37,701
Webcam.

642
00:38:37,995 --> 00:38:39,847
No sound the first time I saw it.

643
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:44,077
Can you have him show me a five,
three, five, two, two, please?

644
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,974
Then they turned up sound for proof of
life. why would they turn up the volume

645
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,274
during the second show?

646
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,621
- There's our proof of life.
- I was in that room earlier.

647
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:57,593
- That's the room the egg was in.
- They're at the embassy.

648
00:38:57,718 --> 00:39:00,884
But it doesn't do us any good. We can't
storm it, and the police can't touch it.

649
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:04,056
Was it because they wanted us
to hear Sam's performance

650
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,009
101, man.

651
00:39:06,574 --> 00:39:09,959
After that, you don't have to be
a rocket scientist To figure it out.

652
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:13,231
You know,
people underestimate you, Eliot.

653
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,901
That's kind of the point.

654
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:21,773
Where's the egg?

655
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:25,642
In order for us to,
Get the egg from Sterling,

656
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,505
he made some additions to the plan.

657
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:36,075
Inspector, what is it that you can
tell us about this case at the time?

658
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:39,616
Well, we catch people
on way to airport.

659
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:41,221
We catch...

660
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:49,547
Inspector.
Excellent, excellent work.

661
00:39:49,672 --> 00:39:51,723
- I see you got my call.
- What call?

662
00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:54,905
When I realized who was responsible

663
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:56,725
and overheard

664
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:59,345
they were trying to make
their escape to the airport,

665
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,515
well, here you go.
I had to stick close.

666
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,280
These men are responsible for...
responsible

667
00:40:05,075 --> 00:40:07,805
for stealing the Fabergé egg.

668
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:12,155
- Can I get a name?
- Can I get a name?

669
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:14,146
Sterling.

670
00:40:14,482 --> 00:40:15,925
Jim Sterling.

671
00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:19,388
And that's not all.
Today, based on his work

672
00:40:19,513 --> 00:40:22,600
recovering the priceless artifact,
James Sterling was invited

673
00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:24,225
to join interpol.

674
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,002
He's a real-life Sherlock Holmes.

675
00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:28,119
Interpol?

676
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:29,437
Seriously?

677
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:32,543
Sterling's career gets another
boost off of our hard work.

678
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:34,844
- We didn't even get paid.
- Nope.

679
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:36,387
I hate this guy.

680
00:40:38,546 --> 00:40:40,487
Now you're part of the team.

681
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:48,207
Should have known it
would be this place.

682
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:51,427
Can you stay in town?

683
00:40:52,054 --> 00:40:53,701
No, I have to get back to L.A.

684
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,572
But not...

685
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,328
Alexander?

686
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:02,374
He had issues.

687
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:06,038
Bankruptcy,
political fallout, the whole

688
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:09,296
"freaking out when he thought
there was a bomb" thing.

689
00:41:10,462 --> 00:41:12,854
Yeah, but I wouldn't be too
tough on him about that.

690
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:15,284
Parker's right.
The first bomb is the hardest.

691
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:18,217
Yeah, he's...

692
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:19,840
Anyway...

693
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:25,855
I'm sorry I lied to you, Maggie.

694
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:27,684
So am I.

695
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,970
This isn't what I want to do.

696
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:35,779
Oh, now, that's the lie.

697
00:41:36,573 --> 00:41:37,708
No, no. I...

698
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:43,330
Well, things have been
kind of tough lately, so...

699
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:47,130
There's Irish whiskey in that coffee,
isn't there?

700
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:49,177
Yeah.

701
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:51,923
A little bit.

702
00:41:52,091 --> 00:41:54,247
- Sorry.
- It's not the liquor that worries me.

703
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:56,826
It's the fact that you're
hiding it in your coffee cup.

704
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:05,841
I meant what I said before.

705
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,671
I really like the man
that you've become.

706
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:13,191
Too bad you don't.
