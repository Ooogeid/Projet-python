1
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,591
I'll handle this.

2
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:22,870
Vitamins?
She OD'd on vitamins? 

3
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:26,338
High-dose supplements.
They give them out at the factory.

4
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:27,712
They work...

5
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:32,835
15-hour days.

6
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,520
So they give them vitamins
to keep their energy up...

7
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,250
also instead of meal breaks.

8
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,440
Sweatshop.

9
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:45,958
The owners of the factory, the Pans,

10
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,367
helped her come over
to the states six months ago.

11
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:51,261
I want to ask you something.
Is Florence here...

12
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:53,404
You can just tell me... It's...

13
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:55,199
Is she here illegally?

14
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,032
No, the Pans are very careful.

15
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:58,869
They provide work papers,

16
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,206
keep everything just
on this side of legal.

17
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,788
But once the women are here,

18
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:04,876
they make them work off
the cost of their passage.

19
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,664
Right, which, takes years because,

20
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:10,394
my guess is they pay them
well below minimum wage.

21
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,433
And they know because of the language
barrier, no one's going to complain.

22
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:24,244
She's afraid if she causes trouble,
she'll lose her job.

23
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:27,080
All she wants is to earn enough money
to bring her parents over.

24
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:29,573
Now, what about your office?
What do you guys do?

25
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,100
How come you can't fix this?

26
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:32,990
We're an immigrant-advocacy network.

27
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,121
We can provide counsel,
but without a formal complaint,

28
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:37,590
we can't do anything.

29
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,424
Okay. Well, we can.

30
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:42,495
Now, does...
You understand, right?

31
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,790
Thank you, Mr. Ford.

32
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,640
Yes. Yes. Of course.

33
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,264
It's gonna be all right.

34
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,094
She's not here, so I...

35
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,556
So, what do we have planned
for Florence Ong?

36
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,530
We're gonna get her enough money

37
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:09,188
to take care of her
and get her parents to America.

38
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:11,372
That's not a very big payoff.

39
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,193
I want to give you an easy one to start.
Why are you here?

40
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,488
Sophie said you always meet
the clients with her, so I thought...

41
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:19,532
That's something I did with Sophie.

42
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:31,467
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

43
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,420
We steal it back for you.

44
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:41,262
And sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

45
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,265
We provide...

46
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:47,641
leverage.

47
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,150
Season 2 Episode 10
The Runway Job

48
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:54,541
He says he's cool with her,
but you know how he is.

49
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,848
The way she introduced herself...
that was a smooth con.

50
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:59,029
Yeah, but it didn't
exactly build trust.

51
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,964
Look, we didn't get along
when we first started.

52
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,608
Eliot, how long did it take
before you trusted me?

53
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:07,725
Eliot, you do trust me, don't you?

54
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,246
That's not the point, Sophie.

55
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,792
If Nate doesn't like this chick,
then it's not gonna work.

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,773
Which is why you've got
to get him on board.

57
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:16,657
You need a grifter. The last time
one of you tried to grift...

58
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,507
you wound up kidnapped by russians.

59
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,187
That's this brother right here.

60
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,428
We still can't let that go?

61
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,519
Listen to me.

62
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:26,481
Tara Cole is the best. I wouldn't have
sent her if i didn't trust her.

63
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:29,852
And I know you're gonna love her.
So just give her a chance.

64
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,070
She is hot.

65
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:33,105
- Very hot.
- Hot.

66
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:38,927
Warm? Cold?

67
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:40,427
Why are we staring?

68
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:42,691
Yeah, I'm not saying
you should throw her at him.

69
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,578
Get him on board. He doesn't always know
what's good for him.

70
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,468
He doesn't do anything about it.

71
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:49,788
He just lets it walk
straight out the door and...

72
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,523
like all the way to Europe?

73
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,041
Just do it for me.

74
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,172
So I don't have to worry about you.

75
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,033
Touchdown.

76
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,137
I just miss you.

77
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,867
- Okay, run it.
- Gloria and Russell Pan.

78
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:18,354
Self-made millionaires.

79
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,194
They built their fortune
off a company

80
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,947
that produces cheap knockoffs
of the latest fashions.

81
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:25,999
The bargain bin has been
very good to the Pans.

82
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:28,725
They got nice car,
big house in Brookline.

83
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,066
Gloria works the factory floor.
She designs all the clothes.

84
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,685
Russell, he handles all the accounting
and works with the partners in China.

85
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,878
Okay, Gloria designs the clothes.
Does she have any training?

86
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:41,079
She did a correspondence course
with a fashion school.

87
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:42,965
And she subscribes
to all the magazines...

88
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,235
vogue, instyle, fashion & style.

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,346
She submitted to "project runway."

90
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,598
Last year?
Last three years.

91
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,336
That's our way in.

92
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,187
We're gonna sell Gloria Pan...

93
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:57,722
her dream.
Yeah, no, I get it.

94
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,228
I mean, the word "con" comes
from "confidence," right?

95
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:01,868
So we got to build her confidence,

96
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:04,029
make her think
she's the greatest designer.

97
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,365
- There you go.
- How?

98
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,295
How?

99
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,274
We need a Caprina.

100
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,060
What does that...

101
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,728
So he just says things
and then walks away?

102
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:17,181
Yeah. You're gonna have to
get used to that.

103
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:02,452
Come on, Russell, let's go.

104
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,703
"Caprina.
Hottest designer in the world."

105
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,088
Fabulous look!

106
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:37,704
Over here, over here!

107
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:43,512
This? Don't you love it?
It's by Caprina.

108
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:49,094
<i>This? Don't you love it?
It's by caprina.</i>

109
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:01,305
Fabulous look!

110
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:04,641
<i>This? Don't you love it?
It's by Caprina?</i>

111
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:06,406
So there you have it.

112
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:10,095
Like everyone else, we can't wait to see
what surprises Caprina has in store

113
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,193
for her highly anticipated fashion show
at new England's fashion week.

114
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,320
It's Caprina's sketchbook.
No designer would be without it.

115
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,269
Great.

116
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,059
Tell me about fashion week.

117
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,700
The big designers use it
to launch their new collections,

118
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,900
but it's mainly showcases
for rising stars.

119
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,236
The investors are always looking
for the next big thing.

120
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:44,270
Tommy Hilfiger,
Marc Jacobs, Andre V...

121
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:46,101
they all got their start
at fashion week.

122
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:49,362
What?

123
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:54,751
Is that mascara? You got on guyliner.
And the leather pants? What the...

124
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:57,420
This is... listen...
This is fashion-y.

125
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:59,653
If you're Steven Seagal.

126
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,834
Don't. Don't.

127
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,530
Not everybody can rock the scarf.

128
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,865
I was gonna say "Steven Tyler,"
but "Seagal" works.

129
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:23,395
It's a bold choice, man.
I respect it.

130
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:27,503
Tell me this looks eggplant to you!

131
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:31,380
I like the purple, but I need something
that will hold up to ruching, yeah?

132
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,623
Something, this perhaps!

133
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:37,302
Did you invite Marcel to the show?
You know how touchy he gets.

134
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:39,592
Excuse me, is this your...

135
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:41,170
Grazie!

136
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:42,957
My designs, my dreams!

137
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,125
For a designer, this is sacred.

138
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,708
I know.

139
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:49,004
You are artiste, too?

140
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,455
Yes. Yes, I am.

141
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,026
I'm Gloria Pan.

142
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:54,379
And can I say, I'm a great admirer.

143
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:55,308
So kind.

144
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,985
I'm sure your work
is, wonderful, too.

145
00:09:58,313 --> 00:09:59,161
May I?

146
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:00,553
Really?

147
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:01,649
Please.

148
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:07,659
So lovely!

149
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:11,068
Such bold use of buckles!

150
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:13,032
I call it "pilgrim chic."

151
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:16,223
Who are you with?
Gucci? Dior?

152
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:17,574
I'm independent.

153
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,707
We must go.

154
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,147
We must talk more.

155
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:23,538
Come to the run-through for my show.
I insist. Julian, tick tock.

156
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,874
You mean fashion week?

157
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,988
Of course.
That is why I am in town.

158
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:29,404
That is why all the designers
are in town.

159
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:32,083
And bring your sketches.

160
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,346
There are people you must meet.

161
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:35,794
Ciao, bella!

162
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,557
Okay, she's on the hook.

163
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,269
Great. Let's go steal
a fashion show.

164
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,674
"Steal a fash... "
does he always talk like that?

165
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,864
You're on comms.

166
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,899
You do know I can hear you.

167
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,654


168
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:44,953
Am I all clear?

169
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:47,122
12 channels, 120 assistants.

170
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,999
My logic filter's telling me

171
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:51,415
the traffic is being directed
by somebody named Kerry.

172
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,910
Go.

173
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,785
Oh, yeah, Kerry,
this is Leon from parking.

174
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,968
It seems
there's a George Armani here

175
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,523
who's very upset because
his parking space is misspelled.

176
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:03,456
<i>What?</i>

177
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,757
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!

178
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,758
<i>Okay, Parker, you're up.</i>

179
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:09,607
Hey, you!

180
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,451
Yeah, you.

181
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:13,125
The models are out of menthol,

182
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,359
and the green-room water is cold,
not room temperature.

183
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,095
And that's my problem how?

184
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:19,968
Were you at the morning update?

185
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:24,236
Because I think Kerry
will be very interested

186
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:27,581
in who was and was not
at that mandatory meeting.

187
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,519
Kerry?

188
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:30,578
Mandatory?

189
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:32,588
This morning?

190
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,120
Accessing printer.

191
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:42,969
Tell me you have a new guest list.

192
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,516
Kerry printed it out in the meeting!

193
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:55,899
I didn't even see this.

194
00:12:58,437 --> 00:12:59,437
Listen.

195
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:03,815
Maybe Kerry doesn't have
to know about this?

196
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,484
Yeah, see...

197
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:10,497
Just this once.

198
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:12,189
Thank you.

199
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:17,912
Hi.

200
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:21,341
Passes, please, for Caprina.

201
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:32,084
How you doing?

202
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:35,074
Fine.

203
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:37,359
All right.

204
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:44,583
Right here.

205
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,866
Preenie, preenie.

206
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,703
You have outdone yourself once again.
The fall line is going to be fantastic.

207
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,875
No, the hair... not up!
Not up. Loose. In curls.

208
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,003
Up, it looks like someone is
squeezing your forehead for juice.

209
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,881
Baby, get us the exclusive.
Look... 12 pages, september issue.

210
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,678
- How does that sound?
- It sounds like you.

211
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:06,642
- I want to talk about how you make...
- No, I don't like to talk money.

212
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,027
Yes, but you know I do.

213
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,046
Glenda! Come, come.

214
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:14,118
- Gloria. Gloria Pan.
- Of course.

215
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:18,243
This is Nigel Marshall Thorn,
editor of fashion & style magazine.

216
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:22,694
And this crass little capitalist
is Jacques Bouvier, my sponsor.

217
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,405
Glenda here is quite
the artiste herself.

218
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,423
Show Nigel your sketchbook.

219
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,108
What is wrong?
What? What?

220
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:35,135
My young designer, who is going to be
at the newcomer showcase

221
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,715
at the end of fashion week...

222
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,376
- arrested.
- Drugs in the car?

223
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,420
No, hooker in the hotel.

224
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,906
He was to be my great discovery.

225
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,513
I don't know what to do.
I... you know...

226
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:47,554
What that boy could do
with a buckle.

227
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,429
Ms. Pan's designs are not bad.

228
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,976
- I'm gonna have to cancel the tv crews.
- I do have experience in the business.

229
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,672
And the reality program was going
to come and do it, as well.

230
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:59,308
No, Jacques... Puppy, stop babbling
for a second and listen to Nigel,

231
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:02,118
you could introduce her
at the showcase!

232
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:03,843
Her?

233
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,954
- You must be joking.
- No, look.

234
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,784
Think of what a coup it would be?

235
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,002
Out of the ashes of scandal,

236
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:15,872
Jacques Bouvier discovers
a diamond in the rough.

237
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:17,295
But...

238
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:20,270
she's so old.

239
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:23,659
Tragically so, but Gloria Vanderbilt
didn't sell her first pair of jeans

240
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:25,033
until she was 40...

241
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,259
But people eat these stories.
They do. They eat 'em up.

242
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,075
No, I know... Look, the publicity
would be worth millions.

243
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,639
Yeah, I understand, but...

244
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,933
I don't know. It's so...

245
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:37,198
Do you have more?

246
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:39,938
Yes, the rest are
on my computer at work.

247
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,316
- If you'd like to come to my office...
- I must be out of my mind,

248
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:46,317
but I must get something
up on this designer showcase.

249
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:51,116
Let's see what Gloria Pan-dervilt
has to offer, yeah.

250
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:52,525
Go, go, go.

251
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:56,183
So, good lines.

252
00:15:56,308 --> 00:16:00,111
I like very much the lines
of the crossover into the...

253
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:01,835
It gives a flow.

254
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,044
Come give me a hug.

255
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:12,888
Do you know why?

256
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,165
Because you are going to be...

257
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,351
the feature designer
at the newcomer showcase.

258
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:21,313
The models are already booked.

259
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,231
but I'm a little concerned

260
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:25,853
because we're gonna have to put
a rush on the garment creation,

261
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:28,491
- which is very expensive.
- What's going on?

262
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,193
These people are going
to put on my first show,

263
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,292
- at fashion week.
- They're what?

264
00:16:33,574 --> 00:16:35,827
I don't think your designs
are ready for that.

265
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:37,746
Gloria, listen to me.

266
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,458
Can we discuss this first?

267
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,313
So, who do you think will be there?

268
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,123
Everyone will be there.

269
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:49,072
I can guarantee you all
the top houses will be there.

270
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:52,625
And I guarantee you'll have a deal
before the end of the show.

271
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,344
Do you realize what this means?

272
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:58,465
Your designs will be in magazines,
on tv shows, at the oscars!

273
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,375
I'm gonna have to talk
to my funding partners, about all this.

274
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,298
And I'm a little worried because
they may take a long time deciding,

275
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:08,454
and, you know,
we have such little time.

276
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,884
So how much do you need?

277
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,871
- Yeah, $50,000.
- $200,000.

278
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,800
I think what Caprina means is that,

279
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:19,579
eventually, it will be $200,000 we need,
but right now, 50's fine.

280
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,988
But, of course,
having the funds all at once

281
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:23,772
will make things go smoother.

282
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,617
50, cherie, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

283
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,022
It's just too exciting.

284
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:34,069
Are you crazy?

285
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:36,325
- Shut up, Russell.
- You don't even know these people!

286
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,315
You'll have to forgive Russell.

287
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:41,701
He doesn't understand
the artistic process.

288
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:44,078
- Few people do.
- This is from the business account.

289
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:45,672
What are our partners gonna say?

290
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:48,942
How should I know? That's your area.
Why don't you go check on the floor?

291
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,322
Tick tock.

292
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:52,194
Yeah, tick tock.

293
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:54,314
Julian, sweetheart.

294
00:17:57,497 --> 00:17:59,372
Let me move some funds around.

295
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:02,956
I'll call you later and then get you the
other $150,000 if you really need it.

296
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,724
You won't regret this.

297
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,099
Ciao.

298
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:09,112
Goodbye.

299
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,011
All right.

300
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:15,988
- What the hell was that?
- I just got you a bigger payout.

301
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:19,396
But her husband's about to pop.
Now, we should have slow-played her.

302
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:21,533
On this team,
you got to follow my lead.

303
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:24,185
Well, maybe if you communicated
with actual sentences

304
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,253
instead of slogans and code!

305
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,323
I'm quitting.
I don't need this crap.

306
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:40,241
You're not quitting, Tara.

307
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,203
At least Eliot's a professional.

308
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,628
Hardison's, you know, warming up.

309
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:47,584
- Even Parker seems okay with me.
- Parker showed feelings?

310
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,795
A feeling. It seemed like a human one,
but it's hard to tell.

311
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:53,206
- Where are you?
- Uzbekistan.

312
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,924
I love Tashkent!

313
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,683
I know, right?
Especially in the springtime.

314
00:18:58,397 --> 00:19:01,497
Tara, you have to ask Nate about that
time on the russian border when he...

315
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,120
Let me tell you something.
Nate Ford is arrogant,

316
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:06,436
he's condescending,
he just doesn't listen!

317
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:10,121
Nate's having trouble communicating?
I'm shocked.

318
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:13,049
Yeah, I really, really
do not need this.

319
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:15,945
Just give it some time, Tara.
You owe me.

320
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:17,891
All right, fine.

321
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:21,075
But if he pulls this man-of-mystery
crap again, I'm gonna kick his ass.

322
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,870
And the whole "I'm sexy because
I'm broken" thing only goes so far.

323
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,747
I know, right?
Wait, what?

324
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,458
- Gotta go.
- What do you mean, "sexy"?

325
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,708
There you are.

326
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,160
Yes, just where you left me since I
couldn't join in any reindeer games.

327
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:34,990
Did you, get a call from Gloria?

328
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:37,050
- No, why?
- I did.

329
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,593
How would they even keep score,
the reindeer?

330
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:41,736
Play it, Hardison.

331
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:44,697
<i>Hello, Mr. Bouvier?
I have the rest of the money for you.</i>

332
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:46,322
<i>Please meet me at...</i>

333
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:50,438
"Meet me at."
Only two places make sense.

334
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,821
Her house or the factory.

335
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:54,192
Eliot, I need you to go
to the Pans' factory.

336
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,530
Right now?

337
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:01,200
I got to be honest with you.

338
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,188
I think she's gonna comeback
to fashion week, okay?

339
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:06,287
I got a sense about these things.

340
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:08,790
Yeah, nice try, Eliot.

341
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,058
<i>The factory.</i>

342
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,314
Hardison, check and see if she moved
those funds. Also check her car's GPS.

343
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,344
Parker and I are gonna
take the house.

344
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:21,283
- Wait, where are you going?
- Gloria's gonna expect me.

345
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:24,514
Right now, you're an unknown.
I don't need another one in the field.

346
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:27,058
Earbud.

347
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:30,103
Earbud.

348
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,029
Thank you.

349
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:45,802
Reindeer. I guess they could
make marks in the snow,

350
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:47,703
but what kind of math
would they use?

351
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:49,092
On task, Parker.

352
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:02,410
Move!

353
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,435


354
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:14,990
What do we know?

355
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:17,224
- Someone targeted the Pans.
- I'm with you on that.

356
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:20,027
And the silver sedan that pulled out
right before the explosion?

357
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:22,038
It belonged to the Pans.
I recognized it.

358
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:22,963
So,

359
00:21:23,623 --> 00:21:27,076
either they got away, or the people
who did this got away in the Pans' car,

360
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,080
<i>and the Pans... didn't.</i>

361
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:31,617
Already on it.

362
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:34,122
The Pans' car just got
on the i-95 heading south.

363
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:36,878
Okay, I need to see who's in the car.
Can you get me a visual?

364
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,589
A visual?
Do I look like I have a helicopter?

365
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:41,649
A simple yes or no.

366
00:21:42,164 --> 00:21:46,159
Well, I might be able to get you
a photo off a traffic camera,

367
00:21:46,284 --> 00:21:47,889
but, I mean,

368
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,181
I would have to time it just right,
based on the car's rate of speed.

369
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:53,269
Listen to me,
a car is driving 80 miles an hour.

370
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,396
How long does it take to get
to a camera mile away?

371
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,649
<i>Seventh-grade algebra, Hardison.</i>

372
00:21:58,742 --> 00:22:01,294
Listen, the husband said
that they had partners.

373
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,576
45 seconds.

374
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:05,678
What? That's the answer...
45 seconds.

375
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,122
Nate, I got bank statements here

376
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:15,305
listing sunbright holdings
as a joint account holder

377
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,262
- with the Pans...
- Wait, show me that.

378
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:21,715
- Great.
- <i>What's she doing there?</i>

379
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,801
Wait, tell Nate I know this corporate
id prefix! It's from Shanghai!

380
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,614
They pick up.
You don't have to yell.

381
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:27,654
Just tell him.

382
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,164
I'm looking at the footage
our camera caught at the Pans' house

383
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:31,684
right before the explosion.

384
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:33,017
Sending now.

385
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,573
Who's planting that bomb?

386
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,309
Eliot! Tara!
Get out of there!

387
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,738
- What?
- We gotta go.

388
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,006
We gotta go.

389
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:58,835
Nate, I got three guys here...

390
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,803
armed with cleavers.

391
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:05,627
That's the signature of the triad.

392
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,606
- The triads. We're a minute away.
- The chinese triads?

393
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:11,966
They control the global
counterfeit-clothing market.

394
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,183
Worth billions to them...
even more than narcotics.

395
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:17,443
So we didn't take money from the Pans.
We took money from the triads.

396
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,731
And the last person holding
their cash was Eliot.

397
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,025
This way.

398
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,362
Cleavers.
I haven't done that in a while.

399
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,240
All right, listen.
These rows are narrow. Okay?

400
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,579
They're gonna have to come
one at a time. Stay close.

401
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:34,697
- You're telling me what to do?
- Don't... Wait. What are you...

402
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,343
Please!

403
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:39,709
Please, please! I don't want to die.

404
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,587
Please!

405
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,244
Nate, I just got a shot
of the Pans' car.

406
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:23,798
Gloria is traveling solo.

407
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:26,038
I guess Russell didn't make it out.

408
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:28,170
<i>Poor bastard got blown to bits.</i>

409
00:24:31,195 --> 00:24:32,134
All right.

410
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:33,830
Russell Pan handles the finances.

411
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:36,663
Did we do a full background
check on Russell Pan?

412
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:39,602
You stay out here in case this
goes south, be the getaway car.

413
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:42,527
Of course we did.

414
00:24:42,652 --> 00:24:45,613
Driver's license, birth certificate,
hospital records, business records...

415
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:47,360
he's Russell Pan.

416
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,202
But did we make sure that Russell Pan
isn't anybody else, as well?

417
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:54,464
Hell.

418
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,641
Admit it.
You kind of like me now.

419
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:30,450
Guys, I just got a hit
on an interpol database.

420
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:33,647
Russell Pan's face matches
a one Nicholas Chow.

421
00:25:33,772 --> 00:25:36,432
Chinese national.
Works for the sun yee on triad.

422
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,225
Counterfeit clothing, black market,

423
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,372
he's known for burying his enemies
alive. This is a bad dude.

424
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:46,936
You got to be kidding me.

425
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:56,220
<i>And there's something else.</i>

426
00:25:57,228 --> 00:25:58,818
I don't think Russell's dead.

427
00:25:58,943 --> 00:26:01,124
He was there when they were
planting that bomb.

428
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:02,257
No kidding.

429
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,148
Good to see you again.

430
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:08,816
Hello. Guns.

431
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,094
Last time...

432
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:15,053
I saw you, we were here
for a business meeting with your wife.

433
00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:17,867
This is all a big misunderstanding.

434
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:21,454
That cow of a wife gave you
something of mine... $50,000 US.

435
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:25,019
Yes, this was for a show,
this was a business...

436
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:27,254
For 20 years, I carried her.

437
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:29,840
I brought over the cheap labor
from China.

438
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,742
I supplied the asian markets.

439
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:34,592
All she had to do
was copy the fashions.

440
00:26:35,256 --> 00:26:38,221
But, no, you sold the woman
on a ridiculous dream.

441
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,797
So I had to get rid of her.

442
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,517
Now, I am responsible
to my superiors for that money.

443
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:45,728
Where is it?

444
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,658
Sit tight.
Tell Chow or Pan... Pot, Skillet...

445
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:52,153
whatever his name is,
that his money's on the way.

446
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,664
It'll be there in 15 minutes.

447
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:55,414
Well...

448
00:26:56,244 --> 00:26:57,529
We don't have the money.

449
00:26:57,654 --> 00:27:01,327
The money's gone. We spent it
on the vendors for Gloria's show.

450
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:05,488
Did you not hear what I just said?
I'm on my way with the money.

451
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:08,611
Yeah, and there's no reason
to do anything or go anywhere

452
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,331
because the money's gone.

453
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:15,841
Wait, wait!

454
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,420
Now, wait, listen to me
one second before you...

455
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:21,914
What if i was able to give you something
worth much more than the $50,000?

456
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,022
What if I was able to give you the
designs for next fall's collections

457
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:26,098
today?

458
00:27:26,223 --> 00:27:29,168
Yeah, that's right. You could get your
factories churning out the knockoffs

459
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:31,175
way before the competition.

460
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,986
This would be worth millions to you
in additional revenue... millions!

461
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,725
And how are you going to do this?

462
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,532
We have access
to the fashion week shows.

463
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:42,293
I mean I can get Julian to steal

464
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:44,939
a major designer's designs.

465
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:46,539
So I let you go,

466
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:49,750
you run to the police,
and I get nothing.

467
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,336
- No deal.
- You can keep me as collaral.

468
00:27:53,387 --> 00:27:55,799
Wait. No. This is not necessary.

469
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,919
We're not going to go to the police.
We have no evidence.

470
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,980
I mean, you're gonna
hunt us down anyway.

471
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:02,513
We'll keep the woman.

472
00:28:02,903 --> 00:28:05,433
You bring us the designs, or...

473
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,059
we'll kill her.

474
00:28:07,824 --> 00:28:09,008
You have one hour.

475
00:28:09,672 --> 00:28:11,702
I'm telling you,
get him what he wants.

476
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:14,407
It's just 50 grand.
That's what this is about?

477
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:15,383
5-0.

478
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,179
Capisce? 5-0.

479
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:23,017
Julian, come. Come on, let's go.

480
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:32,545


481
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:34,795
You could've just given
Russell the money.

482
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,767
If we'd given the money, we would have
gone back to the client with nothing.

483
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:39,468
Because that's what it's about...

484
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,817
a chance to run a con
on the triads on the fly.

485
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:44,399
You put Tara's life in danger
to take down a bigger target.

486
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:46,642
It's one thing for Florence
and those other women

487
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,528
to owe money
to some local sweatshop.

488
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:50,910
You want them in debt to the triads
the rest of their lives?

489
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:52,608
You wouldn't have left Sophie there.

490
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,582
I know what I'm doing.
I got it under control.

491
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:57,315
We got less than an hour.
We need some designer's plans.

492
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,112
- We got to get...
- Hold. I got...

493
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,849
There's one show left today... Andre V.
He has a hip-hop couture line.

494
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,818
Great. Perfect.
Go get those plans.

495
00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:07,556
Wait, wait. What are we doing?

496
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:10,584
We are gonna make
Gloria Pan's dreams come true.

497
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,841
Maybe I wanted to meet Andre V.

498
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,407
Did nobody think of that?

499
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:17,781
Selfish.

500
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,493
- Three minutes till the show, Parker.
- I know.

501
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:41,987
- Three minutes.
- I got it.

502
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,303
Kerry, I've got it.
I need you to re-freaking-lax!

503
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:45,408
IDs, please.

504
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:49,027
How am i supposed to find soy
candles at such a short notice?

505
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:50,204
Farmers' market!

506
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,307
I need to double-check your IDs.

507
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:54,171
You know what?
Kerry sent us, okay?

508
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,795
There was a security breach earlier.
No exceptions.

509
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,926
The only thing that gets in
are models and clothes.

510
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:07,474
I left my ID at the desk.

511
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,279
- I'll help you get it.
- Thank you.

512
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,458
Only thing getting in
are models and clothes.

513
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:29,160
- How about this one?
- That's a shirt.

514
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,033
I know, but at least
you can move in it.

515
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:32,942
These clothes
are totally impractical.

516
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:35,434
There's no range of motion,
limited concealment options,

517
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:38,582
and this reflective material would set
off a motion detector a mile away.

518
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,326
It's a fashion show!
It's not thieves-r-us.

519
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,299
Fine.
How about this?

520
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:46,520
The a-line drape
of the empire waist is nice, but...

521
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,667
the neckline's a little weak.

522
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:50,048
If you ask me. What?

523
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:52,537
I date a lot of models.

524
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:56,373
Lot of private fashion shows,
if you know what I mean.

525
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:57,498
Yes, yes.

526
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:00,283
But most of the dresses ended up
on the ground.

527
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:01,892
Yep, I get it.
You're a guy.

528
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,903
- Means they were naked.
- Seriously?

529
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,623
I'm just saying.

530
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:08,948
How you doing?

531
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:12,799
What is that?

532
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:15,205
What is this atrocity on my model?

533
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,779
I don't know who did this,
but it certainly was not me.

534
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:20,524
This is not my dress.
This is not an Andre V dress.

535
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,580
I do not design halloween costumes.

536
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:25,404
And what is with this makeup?
Sweetie, you are lovely,

537
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:27,679
but you look like you just
came from clown school.

538
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,442
I asked for blue.
You gave me red!

539
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,950
This is terrible. What do I have to do
to get the correct color?

540
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:35,100
And you... you!

541
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:38,123
- You're incomplete! You are incomplete!
- What?

542
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:40,486
Boys and girls,
incomplete model on deck!

543
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:42,612
- Wait.
- Incomplete model on deck!

544
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:45,080
That is an emergency! Sit down! Sit!

545
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:48,823
Incomplete model on deck here! Nose.
Eyes. Chin. Hair. Go. Go.

546
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,492
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

547
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:52,782
The cheekbones.

548
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,891
Perfection. Perfect...

549
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,056
Wonderful. Okay, let's go.

550
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:07,715
- Go! Go! Go!
- What?

551
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:09,300
Faster! Go!

552
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,146
Go! And graceful, please!

553
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:15,278
You're not running a marathon.
Don't even think of coming back here!

554
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:17,771
Find your face!
Find your face!

555
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,382
Oh, my heavens!
My show!

556
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,680
<i>How we doing, Parker?</i>

557
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:48,776
All clear.
Grab the drive.

558
00:32:49,724 --> 00:32:50,632
Oh, my show.

559
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:53,011
Models, everyone,
the show must go on.

560
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,942
In the spirit of fashion,
the show must go on.

561
00:32:56,733 --> 00:33:00,633
You... models... get out there!
Look pretty! Get out there now! Go!

562
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:07,811
You must have a lot of trust
in your friends,

563
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:10,290
although they don't seem worthy
of such devotion...

564
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:13,239
especially the one in charge...
Bouvier.

565
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:19,555
Yeah, I agree.

566
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,415
I don't trust him.
And neither should you.

567
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:24,918
Why not?

568
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,107
Because he's not who he says he is.

569
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:30,942
His name is Nathan Ford.

570
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:33,079
And he's a con man.

571
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,266


572
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:42,311
He's a thief.
He's gonna try and play you.

573
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,397
Why are you telling me this?

574
00:33:47,064 --> 00:33:48,887
You and I both know
when he gets back here

575
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:50,305
you're gonna kill us.

576
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:54,222
Okay, but what if...

577
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:57,799
I told you I had a better way
to fix your problems?

578
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:05,042
They're all there...

579
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:07,275
Courtesy of Andre V.

580
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:15,971
Yes, they are.

581
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,181
Thank you, Andre V.

582
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:25,764
Files are compressed.
They're easy to e-mail.

583
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:32,915
All right.

584
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:37,032
If this thing starts coming
off the rails, don't wait. Call us in.

585
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:41,057
Yeah. Chow is primed.
I can handle him.

586
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:42,731
I'm not talking about him.

587
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,186
She's a pro.
She knows what to do.

588
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:53,799
Here...

589
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,683
Here are the designs!

590
00:34:58,822 --> 00:35:00,022
There you are.

591
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:15,305
- Andre V. Right. The real deal.
- Yes, the real deal, yeah.

592
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:18,515
Our factories will be working
off of these by tomorrow.

593
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,936
Yes, you will become
very, very wealthy.

594
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:24,345
So we are done, yeah?

595
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:26,446
We're done, yes?

596
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:29,552
No.

597
00:35:30,223 --> 00:35:32,993
The police are looking for someone
who broke into Andre V's computer.

598
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,066
They're on their way here now.

599
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:36,128
But...

600
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,125
- how would they know this?
- Because I called them...

601
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,197
and I told them a con man
named Nathan Ford

602
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:43,428
just tried to sell me a bunch
of stolen designs.

603
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:47,478
Well...

604
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:52,888
What if I told you I had a better way
to fix your problems?

605
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,780
Okay. Tell me.

606
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,747
You tell the cops he showed up

607
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,784
just before someone
tried to kill your wife.

608
00:36:02,654 --> 00:36:05,434
A grifter who comes into her life
just before he takes your money

609
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,259
and your house explodes?

610
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:09,634
You get the designs,
he takes the heat.

611
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:11,941
No bodies to clean up.

612
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:14,088
Nate's the fall guy,
and you walk away clean.

613
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,175
I knew I couldn't trust you.

614
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,636
You've donenothing to earn my trust.

615
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,679
I made you a member of my team.

616
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,361
Your team? Please.

617
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,669
You get off putting
everybody's lives in danger

618
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:31,011
so the great Nate Ford can come in
and save the day. That's your rush.

619
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:49,380
- They'll never believe your story.
- No?

620
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:52,075
You're in my factory.

621
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,053
You're pretending to be someone
you're not.

622
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:57,491
Besides, your prints
are all over the drive.

623
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:01,019
Detectives, this is the man
I called you about.

624
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:04,096
- They're in his jacket pocket.
- Hands on your head, please.

625
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,625
- Sir, are you Russell Pan?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

626
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,350
Aka Nicholas Chow?

627
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:22,322
From Interpol's most wanted list?

628
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,881
So you blew up your house
to kill your wife?

629
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:52,750
- All right. Get him out of here.
- Come on, let's go.

630
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:56,074
I got a couple questions for you, too.
Listen. Check my inside pocket.

631
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,032
What?

632
00:37:57,157 --> 00:38:00,194
I've been working fashion week.
Been undercover for six months.

633
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,711
Listen, you can take Chow.

634
00:38:01,836 --> 00:38:04,733
You've got enough for attempted
murder, conspiracy, arson, whatever.

635
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:07,264
- Here, make it look good. Walk me out.
- All right. Sure.

636
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:09,057
- Make it look real.
- You got it.

637
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,541
All right, you guys.
Clear the door.

638
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:18,545
Yes, sir.

639
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:22,281
We might want to destroy this.

640
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:25,784
Russell didn't actually transmit
the designs to the triad factories?

641
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:28,472
Designs, yes, but probably
not the ones they wanted.

642
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,252
Our factories will be working
off of these by tomorrow.

643
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,606
It was a simple switch. You just put an
auto-run instruction file on the drive

644
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,989
to show a set of designs for the startup
and a different set for the e-mail.

645
00:38:55,114 --> 00:38:58,103
Yeah, too bad gloria had to retire
before her collection was released?

646
00:38:58,228 --> 00:39:01,730
I have a feeling she might find a way to
stay involved in the clothing business.

647
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,223
Here's more clothes,
Mrs. Pan! Keep up!

648
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,086
Okay, no earpiece.

649
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,078
How did you tell Nate you were
gonna run the cop scam?

650
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:21,627
It's just 50 grand.
That's what this is about.

651
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:22,556
5-0.

652
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,370
Capisce?

653
00:39:26,162 --> 00:39:28,881
5-0? The cops?
That's all it took?

654
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,991
Some people just know
how to communicate.

655
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:34,053
I just finally learned
how to speak his language.

656
00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:36,317
Cryptic clues, slogans, and code.

657
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:43,630
Here's $50,000.

658
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,143
That should be enough to get
your parents to the states.

659
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:49,121
And when they get here, they'll have
decent jobs waiting for them.

660
00:39:58,366 --> 00:40:01,031
She wants to know how
you're able to do all this.

661
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,548
Well, you know, once the
Pans dropped out of the picture,

662
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:06,452
the factory went into receivership.

663
00:40:06,577 --> 00:40:08,712
We were able to convince
the courts to keep it running

664
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:11,464
under the guidance of a legally
appointed administrator.

665
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:18,352
Speaking of which,
how is it going there,

666
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:20,086
madam administrator?

667
00:40:20,676 --> 00:40:22,032
It's been very good.

668
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:25,541
Everyone's realizing they now get a say
in setting their conditions and hours.

669
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:31,212
But I think they're adapting
to the new rules pretty quickly.

670
00:40:34,697 --> 00:40:36,906
Thank you all so much.

671
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:45,036
Thank you.

672
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:51,437
Well...

673
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:55,246
Here.
That's your cut.

674
00:40:57,187 --> 00:40:58,072
And...

675
00:41:00,313 --> 00:41:02,613
I'm gonna give you your earbud back.

676
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:07,520
And, listen, you know, I'll try,
because Sophie sent you,

677
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:10,360
try... to communicate...

678
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:11,748
better.

679
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:14,294
Thank you.

680
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,992
And for what it's worth,
Sophie was right.

681
00:41:19,117 --> 00:41:21,517
You guys are the best
I've ever seen.

682
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,951
I know.

683
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,440
But no one in the world

684
00:41:26,565 --> 00:41:28,665
is as good as you think you are.

685
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,664
- <i>Rough day?</i>
- We got through it okay.

686
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:43,603
- <i>Barely, from what I heard.</i>
- Yeah, well

687
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:46,273
<i>Listen, Nate, I sent her, so...</i>

688
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:49,610
so even if you don't trust her,
you should trust me by now.

689
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,300
She was never
in any real danger, so...

690
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:53,710
<i>Really?</i>

691
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:55,882
<i>So would you have made
the same play if it were me?</i>

692
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:57,533
Yeah, probably.

693
00:41:58,627 --> 00:42:01,184
- No.
- <i>Nate, what are you doing?</i>

694
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,253
What am I doing?
I'm doing my job, Sophie!

695
00:42:03,378 --> 00:42:06,256
The one that you talked me back into
doing when I was sitting on this couch!

696
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:09,601
The same one that you walked out on.
So don't call me from London or Paris

697
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:12,856
or wherever you are and start telling
me, you know, how to run my crew!

698
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:14,698
I'm sorry, but it's just if you...

699
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,366
Sophie!
