00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,700
Hey, j.B., tell the boss
i'm going long on oil.

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,300
??

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Stacey, you got those munis for me?

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,900
- Yes, mr. Hurley.
- All right.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,600
Hey, todd, We're gonna need you
at that softball game saturday.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,800
- Bring the orange socks.
- No problem, jack.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,000
- Jack, jack.
- Hey, hey, hey, pam.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,400
- You got to help me.
- ??

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,600
I got this song on the radio.
It's in my head.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
- No, no, no.
- Jack, i need to talk to you.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,400
What?

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
I had to show them everything.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,300
??

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Have you told anyone
the money went missing?

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Not even the board of directors.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,700
Mr. Ford, those donations
were my responsibility.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
I could go to jail.

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,700
No, that's not gonna happen.

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,000
Tell us about your money manager.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800
His name's jack hurley.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,200
Works for one of
the biggest firms in town.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,300
He said that with the right investments,
He could grow our money.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,700
He was enthusiastic and sweet,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,100
Like a big kid.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,800
I did my homework. He checked out.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,000
So, when did you realize
things had gone wrong?

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,100
We're breaking ground next week
on a new food pantry,

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,900
And i needed to write some checks.

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,900
Jack's been ducking my calls,
so i contacted his boss.

33
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,600
And he told me they didn't even have
a record Of our having an account there.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
- How is that possible?
- It isn't.

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,500
The company is falsifying its records

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,000
So it's not on the hook
for hurley's embezzlement.

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Classy.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,900
It happens all the time.

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,700
People trusted me with this money.

40
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,900
And you trusted jack hurley.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Michelle, this isn't your fault.

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,800
Important for you to know that.

43
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,600
Please don't take this the wrong way.

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,100
After what happened with jack,
i have to ask.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,300
Why do you do this?

46
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,200
Same reason you do.

47
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,600
Bit early for that, isn't it?

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,600
What -- What's that?

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,900
What does that matter?

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,300
What does that matter?

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,400
What matters is this nice
woman runs a food bank --

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,500
You know, that we keep her
out of prison. That's what's the matter.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Look, this guy Is probably halfway
around the world already.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,500
Let's go.

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
She has all the company's
monthly statements.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
??Why can't she just sue the firm?

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,900
Yeah, well, have fun with
your seven-Year lawsuit

58
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,600
Against a wall street firm
and your pro bono mall lawyer.

59
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,500
Yeah, see how that turns out for you.

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,100
No, we have to find
this jack hurley. Hardison.

61
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,000
Jack hurley, money manager
for mcteague capital investments.

62
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,800
Single, no criminal record.

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,500
He owns a condo in the marina.

64
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,700
Last seen peeling out of
the company driveway yesterday.

65
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,500
Where is he?

66
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,000
I can tell you where
he is not -- In my world.

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,400
He's not on the grid.
No online noise at all.

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,100
He's probably liquidated
the charity's money into cash.

69
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
All right, if that's the case,

70
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,800
Then it's gonna be burning
a hole in his pocket.

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
<i>Okay, well, so,
we don't know where he is.</i>

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,700
<i>We have to figure out
where he's been.</i>

73
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
This is his last credit statement??
before he disappeared.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,900
bar, bar.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Strip club. Taco stand.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
I didn't know they took plastic.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,700
Asian massage.
I know they take plastic.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,900
Bar. Wing spot. Pay-Per-View.

79
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,000
This is all sunday.

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,500
All right, well, You have
any patterns with his movement?

81
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,900
That look like a pattern to you?

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,500
It's like billy from "the family circus,"
If billy was a drunken sex fiend.

83
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, look, we're assuming
this guy's still in los angeles.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
But you said yourself he could
be halfway across the globe.

85
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,200
No, his passport wasn't dinged.
He's still in the states.

86
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,600
Oh, well, that narrows it down.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,700
Actually, it does.

88
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,800
He's an addict, under stress.

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
So he's not gonna be
doing a lot of exploring.

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,200
He's gonna stay well
within his comfort zone.

91
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,600
He's still in l.A.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Oh, yeah.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,700
All right, we're gonna
do this old-School.

94
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,400
Parker, you break into his condo,
see what you can find.

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,000
Sophie and i will hit the retail spots.
You guys go to his favorite haunts.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
But don't spook him, just follow him.

97
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,900
Let him lead us to the money.

98
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
All right.??

99
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,900
??

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,900
I'm -- I'm gonna
need change for $100...

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
In singles.

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm sorry. What?

103
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,200
You think i have 100 singles on me?

104
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
Bar number 12.

105
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,300
You see this place?

106
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,100
He's not exactly a
velvet-Rope kind of guy, is he?

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
No, he's not.

108
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,200
Look at this guy one more time.

109
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,700
Don't get mad, but i may
have spilled slushy in your car.

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
That's like 44 ounces, hardison!

111
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,100
It's not that much.

112
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
The lid is floating
in the damn floorboard, man!

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,300
- you are being...
- it's running into the backseat.

114
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,000
- ...very dramatic.
- All right.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,300
When we get back to the office,
you're cleaning this up.

116
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,000
You're cleaning this up
as soon as we get back.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's our guy right there.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,800
- Don't try to change the subject.
- No, look, that's our guy.

119
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,200
All right, nate, we got hurley
at location number 12.

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,700
Meet us here to pursue.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
This dude --

122
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,600
You see him trying to force
his keys onto that girl?

123
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,900
Yeah.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
It should be the
other way around, huh?

125
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Oh, i'm sorry. I forgot.
You don't know nothing about that.

126
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,700
Really?

127
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,800
I almost had it in me
to wash this car. Almost.

128
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,300
In-Box says you're washing the car.

129
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
- ??
- I guaran--

130
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,800
Big idea.

131
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,300
??

132
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,100
Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no!

133
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,000
That is not how you exchange
insurance information.

134
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,700
- Where's my money?
- No, no, i --

135
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,000
I got a gun. I got a gun.

136
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,500
Eliot.

137
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
Nice job blowing out the engine block.

138
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,000
I was aiming for his leg.

139
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
- ??
- Give me the gun,

140
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,600
- hardison.
- What?

141
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,700
- Nate, we lost him.
- Don't worry. We found him.

142
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,000
He's around the corner
from you on cypress.

143
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,600
Is he sleeping?

144
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,500
Could be a concussion.

145
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,800
No, i've had concussions.
You don't snore.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
No sign of the money in the car.

147
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,300
Wake his ass up, then. I'll find out
where it's at in five minutes.

148
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Yeah, and what are we gonna do

149
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,400
While he sends you
on a wild goose chase, huh?

150
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,500
Tie him to a chair? No, thanks.

151
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not gonna add kidnapping
to my list of crimes.

152
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Well, what do we do?

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Just got to be smart about this.

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,800
Run a game on him.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
What game?

156
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
In five minutes, he's
gonna be in county lockup,

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,700
And we'll never get near him.

158
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
The cops aren't gonna lock him up.

159
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,500
Jack hurley is gonna lock himself up.

160
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,400
Guys, come on.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Where am i?

162
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,900
Last thing i remember, i was in my car.

163
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,000
I could swear i hit something.

164
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
Oh, yeah, you hit something, all right.

165
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,100
A little thing called rock bottom.

166
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,800
Welcome to rehab.

167
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Oh, my god.

168
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,200

Dr. Tanner, it's not every day

172
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,000
We get someone of your stature
to consult on our staff.

173
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,800
Well, one can't stay locked In the ivory
tower of academia forever, doctor.

174
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,200
I'm ready to get my hands dirty again.

175
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
Second act doesn't pander
to the rich and privileged.

176
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,600
It's not about status here.

177
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
The idea is that we're all equal,

178
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,100
So the first thing we do
when folks check in

179
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,500
Is take away all their ties
to the outside world --

180
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,300
Cellphones, pdas, even their clothes.

181
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Breaking the cycle -- I agree.

182
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Very important.

183
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,400
Well, dr. Tanner, this is our day room.

184
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,500
Ready to get your hands dirty?

185
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,600
Hello. I'm, uh -- I'm dr. Tanner.

186
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm gonna be leading this group.

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
Before we get started,

188
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,300
Why don't you go ahead
and introduce yourselves

189
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,100
And, um, tell us why you're here.

190
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,400
i'm marcy.

191
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm here because my mother's
a controlling bitch, basically.

192
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,700
candor. That's a good start, marcy.

193
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,800
??

194
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,100
Hi. My name is rose.
I'm a kleptomaniac.

195
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,400
My parents are rich,
but i shoplift anyway...

196
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Because i hate myself.

197
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay, rose, next time, Why not share
that with the group and not the floor?

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,800
Eye contact is the gateway
to communication.

199
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,000
Right. Who's next?

200
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,700
yeah, i'm tom, and i like to drink.

201
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm jack, and i'm an alcoholic.

202
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
- Thanks, jack.
- Also nicotine.

203
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,900
The patches, not the cigarettes.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,500
- Okay.
- Internet porn.

205
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,900
Non-Internet --
Well, porn, basically.

206
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,700
Also compulsive gambling.

207
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,300
Compulsive lying.

208
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,000
Compulsive eating.

209
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,100
Tacos.

210
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
I got a big taco problem.

211
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,300
I think it all stems from my stint
As an operative in the cia in beirut.

212
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Not the tacos, the drinking part.

213
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,700
But i tell you something.

214
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,900
Somehow in my drunken
stupor last night,

215
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,200
I stumbled in here
and checked myself in.

216
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,100
Apparently.

217
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,100
So i guess that means
i've hit rock bottom.

218
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,400
Splendid, jack. That was --
That was very brave.

219
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,300
Why don't we, um,
go back to tom here?

220
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,300
Me? Jack here --

221
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,000
Go to nick nolte over here. Why me?

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,300
Yeah, no, you said you like to drink,

223
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
But you didn't -- You didn't
characterize it as a problem.

224
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Well, 'cause it's not a problem.

225
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,200
Drinking relaxes me
and helps me focus.

226
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,900
Oh, i see. So you like to medicate
yourself with alcohol, is that it?

227
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,300
What are you doing?

228
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,400
Listen, doctor,

229
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,500
Do you know what the definition
of "addiction" is?

230
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,500
Any compulsive behavior That
has a negative impact on your life.

231
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,700
So i guess we could say

232
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,800
That those $1,500 boots that
you're wearing Are an addiction.

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,700
Well, i haven't heard any complaints.

234
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,300
??

235
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,800
???

236
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,500
Thanks a lot, sam.

237
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,200
But i don't think that tom here
Has actually answered my question.

238
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, well, okay, we could
talk about my drinking problem,

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,900
Or we could talk about
your boot problem.

240
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,200
Or we could talk about jack here,

241
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,500
Who has a very legitimate,
real problem here.

242
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,800
He has blackouts.

243
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
Isn't that why we're here,
uh, dr. Tanner?

244
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,100
Fine.

245
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,300
Tell us about it, jack.

246
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,100
It's bad.

247
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,700
I don't even remember
where i parked my car yesterday.

248
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,900
i hate to be the bearer of bad news,

249
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,300
But i overheard the orderlies
say that you totaled it.

250
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,700
That wasn't my car.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
No, i parked my car
somewhere downtown.

252
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,700
And i had the receipt
in my -- In my pocket.

253
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,300
And i really need to find that.

254
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Okay, good. That was --
That was a good start.

255
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,000
Does, um -- Does anyone have
anything they'd like to add?

256
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,700
1,500 bucks for boots?

257
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,700
You got ripped off, lady.

258
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,800
??

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
Oh, there you are, rose.

260
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,100
We've been looking for you.

261
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,400
Time for your medicine.

262
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,700
Medicine? What are you
talking about?

263
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,900
Well, you've been diagnosed
with kleptomania,

264
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,100
And in addition to talk therapy,
there's a drug protocol.

265
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
No, i don't -- I-I don't do drugs.

266
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,900
It's not doing drugs, rose.

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,700
Antidepressants are taken
by 20 million americans every day

268
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,500
To treat a variety of
behavioral disorders.

269
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,700
It's perfectly safe.

270
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,700
Talk to me, baby.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,600
Over there.

272
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,300
Damn.

273
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,100
Hurley's a big guy, right?

274
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,900
Yeah.

275
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,400
So is the parking attendant.

276
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,300
Why is the seat so far forward?

277
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
I don't think i can pop
the trunk without starting the car.

278
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,100
Somebody's been in the car.

279
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,100
- What's your problem?
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

280
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,500
??

281
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,100
Yeah, there's a bomb.

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
- What?
- Listen, listen.

283
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
- There's a bomb.
- No, stay, stay.

284
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,100
- No, no, no.
- Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay!

285
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,800
- Move! Move, move!
- Listen to me.

286
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,300
- Move!
- It's right underneath the seat.

287
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,000
All right? That means it's
got to be pressure sensitive.

288
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,300
If you move, this thing's gonna go off.

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,800
Chill.

290
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,800
Pressure sensitive?

291
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,800
It's pressure sensitive. You sure?

292
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Okay. Pressure. Pressure.

293
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay, um.

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,600
Eliot, go -- Go get
a bag of bricks, right.

295
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,500
Bricks, and you put it on the seat
At the same time i roll off.

296
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,100
That only works in the movies.

297
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,600
Bag of bricks is a good, sound plan!

298
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,100
We got two minutes.

299
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
- Two minutes?
- Shut up! Focus!

300
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,300
You start with
"the bomb has two minutes!"

301
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,100
All right.

302
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
There's wires running
in the dashboard computer.

303
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,600
That's probably how it's picking up
the pressure sensors In the seat.

304
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,600
It's -- It's, uh, a computer bomb.

305
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,400
I-I-I know computers.

306
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,700
Computer bomb, um.

307
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
We -- We -- We got to reboot the system.

308
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
- Yeah.
- You want me to kick it?

309
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,300
God, i'm gonna die.

310
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,400
No, just --

311
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Look.

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,900
J-Just -- No.

313
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,100
Duck up under the hood

314
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,800
And just tell me how it's attached
to the electrical system.

315
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,400
I got it.

316
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,000
Man, there's a lot of wires here.

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,200
Yes, there are a lot of wires.
It's a computer.

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,800
Breathe.

319
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,500
Breathe. Okay, um, you know what?

320
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,300
Look.

321
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,300
What you got to do, man,
you got to yank the wires.

322
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,200
At the same time,

323
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,000
i'll reboot the system

324
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
And trick the bomb into
thinking it's gone off.

325
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
What's our margin for error here?

326
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,600
About half a second.

327
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,500
Run the bag of bricks by me again.

328
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,600
You ready?

329
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,700
No.

330
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Are you ready?

331
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,400
Yeah.

332
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,500
Go!

333
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,200
Souvenir.

334
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,900
??Don't. Stop. Don't play.

335
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,000
Where you going?
We got to search the car.

336
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm gonna go and
freshen up a little bit.

337
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Maybe cry a little.

338
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Old friends.

339
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,000
And new ones.

340
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,900
??

341
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,900
You two, you with hurley?

342
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,100
Where's my money?

343
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,400
??

344
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,900
You have five seconds to
give us our money, or you die.

345
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,000
No, no, no, no, no.

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,500
We're getting our money first.

347
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,300
- Five...
- Hey, fellas, fellas, fellas.

348
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,900
We are from the same boat, you know?

349
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,300
I come from kingston, jamaica.

350
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,700
I come to collect my money
from the bastard hurley.

351
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,100
Four...

352
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,500
you think i'm playing with you?

353
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Fellas, fellas.

354
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,100
We all want the same thing.

355
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
Okay, let's just be gentlemen about it.

356
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,600
- Three...
- keep counting.

357
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
I'll put a bullet in your head.

358
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,700
Hey, we can settle this
over a refreshing beverage.

359
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,500
Two...

360
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,200
- Say "one," puta!
- Hey, yo, you a korean.

361
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
You a mexican.

362
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Me a jamaican.

363
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,400
Okay. Underneath,
we all the same thing.

364
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,700
- One.
- Hold on.

365
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,500
I got your bomb right here.

366
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,700
All right?

367
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,800
Chileans.

368
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,200
Never mess with chileans.

369
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,000
You mean there's more guys
that want this dude dead?

370
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,300
I got it on a one-Second delay.

371
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,600
That gives me just enough time
to get up underneath that truck.

372
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,800
Now, maybe i make it. Maybe i don't.

373
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
But one thing's for certain --

374
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,400
You all die.

375
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,000
Now, let's just calm down,

376
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,400
and let's back away.

377
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
???

378
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
Ivamos!

379
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, eliot,

380
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,800
When you said you were
gonna dive under that truck,

381
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,400
You were gonna drag me with you, right?

382
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,500
Sure.

383
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,200
I'm serious, man. Don't play with me.

384
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
I'm serious.

385
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,600
Mm.

386
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,900
Where's Hurley?

387
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,100
Hurley? I don't know.

388
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,200
He's probably leading
the codependent wing

389
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,800
In a rousing game of simon says.

390
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,200
You look awful.

391
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,600
Thank you. That's sweet.

392
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Do you need something, soph?

393
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Yeah. Eliot and hardison
are on their way over.

394
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay.

395
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,000
Aah! Whoa.

396
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,300
You're shaking.

397
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,000
I know. They have the
air-Conditioning on so high.

398
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
You haven't had a drink in 48 hours.

399
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,700
This is withdrawal.

400
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Soph, i'm not in rehab.

401
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,800
Pretending.

402
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,200
- Ah.
- Yeah.

403
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,100
Well, congratulations.

404
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,800
You've got me fooled.

405
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,300
Oh, god.

406
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Can i help you?

407
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,000
You sure can.

408
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,800
Here to see a patient
of yours -- Mr.Tom baker.

409
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,600
What's your relationship?

410
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,700
- Why?
- Second act has a strict policy.

411
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,000
Only family members can see patients.

412
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,800
We want to make sure outside influences

413
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,200
don't hamper our clients' recoveries.

414
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,100
I think that's an excellent policy.

415
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
I'm Tom's brother.

416
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,800
Hi. Mark.

417
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm -- I'm with him.

418
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,400
So, you're a friend of --

419
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,100
No, no, i am -- I am with him.

420
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,800
See, he thinks the
flirting makes me jealous,

421
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,900
But it doesn't.

422
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,500
You know, but if you was,
like, brad pitt or denzel or somebody,

423
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,900
Oh, girl, it would be on, seriously.

424
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,400
Bring your ass. Bring your ass.

425
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,900
So, it wasn't just a charity
that hurley ripped off.

426
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,800
It was like the axis of scumbags.

427
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,800
North korea is a counterfeiting center.

428
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,100
So they must be using Hurley's company

429
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,700
to launder their dirty paper.

430
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,600
Yeah, well, this mexican cat had an accent

431
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,500
Like he was from the oaxaca region.

432
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,200
He's probably sicario.

433
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,100
Hit man for drug cartel.

434
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Yeah, well, this is great.

435
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,500
I mean, the only guy who knows

436
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,400
where the money is is
a compulsive liar, so...

437
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,400
You all right?

438
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,700
Yeah.

439
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,300
We've come up blank on the car,

440
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,000
the condo, the office.

441
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,400
It means someone else is holding
the money for him, right?

442
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,300
Eliot, we need to learn
about the people in his life.

443
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
So i'll get the names.

444
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,100
I need -- I need you two to follow up.

445
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,600
What about the gangs?

446
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,200
We -- We still have,
you know, an advantage.

447
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,900
'Cause we have Hurley, so...

448
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,900
I thought my foster
parents just wanted me

449
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,300
So they could get money from the state,

450
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,900
But now i realize they
didn't love each other.

451
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,500
They just wanted someone to love them.

452
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,500
Like they need you to fill in
the gaps for their relationship.

453
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,000
Exactly.

454
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,500
But when that didn't happen,

455
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,300
- they just withdrew
- Yeah.

456
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,500
Which led me to steal.

457
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,100
Yeah.

458
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
It's all so clear to me now.

459
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
Wait.

460
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
Didn't you say your parents were rich?

461
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Yes.

462
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,300
Because underneath their
trailer, they found gold.

463
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,500
Whoa.

464
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,100
Excuse me.

465
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,700
Uh, thank you, rose.

466
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,800
All right, in the, um,
five minutes that we have left,

467
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,800
I'd like to talk about the
healing power of apology.

468
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,200
??

469
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,900
???

470
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
- Yeah.
- Why don't you speak?

471
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Thank you, sam.

472
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,500
That was -- That was touching.

473
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
And it's very big of you.

474
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,800
All right, let's go around the room.

475
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,100
Who -- Who wants to start?

476
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,800
Tom?

477
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,200
What?

478
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
Tom, who -- Who do you think

479
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
you might have hurt with your drinking?

480
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,100
Oh, jesus, here we go again.

481
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,200
Aren't you ready to say sorry to them?

482
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
He said -- He had his hand up.

483
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,600
I don't -- Listen, i don't think
i need to apologize for drinking.

484
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,100
I need to apologize maybe for not drinking.

485
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Maybe i'm a bigger bastard
sober than i am drunk, huh?

486
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,200
If this is you sober, hell yeah.

487
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,400
Thank you, marcy.

488
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,200
Shoo!

489
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,300
I have to say, i'm a little
disappointed in you, Tom.

490
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,000
I thought you'd set a better
example for jack here.

491
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm sure he has a few people
he'd like to say sorry to.

492
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,300
More than a few.

493
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,700
Maybe they've had to shoulder
some of his responsibilities.

494
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,300
Maybe he's burdened them in some way.

495
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,900
Jack, look at me.

496
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,000
I want you to take this pad

497
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,700
And -- And write a list
of all these people

498
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,300
And go away and call them,
apologize to them,

499
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,800
Relieve them of their burdens and yours.

500
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,200
That's a good idea.

501
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,500
He just called, actually.

502
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,000
Sounded kind of rough.

503
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,600
Yeah, well, we saw how he was treating you

504
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,400
At the bar the other day, and...

505
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,100
Oh, that. No.

506
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,300
He wasn't harassing me.
He bought me a car.

507
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,400
He was just trying to
convince me to take it.

508
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,000
He bought you a car?

509
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,400
Mine broke down.

510
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,500
Jack was just trying to help.

511
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,500
Thank you for your time.

512
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,400
Sure.

513
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,300
- Bye.
- Bye.

514
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,600
Well, that's not what i expected.

515
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
Who's next on the list?

516
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,200
A stripper at gary's hideaway.

517
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,900
He's not all bad.

518
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,800
He did give some of the
money to people in need.

519
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,000
You ever notice how all bad guys

520
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,400
- know at least one stripper?
- Hello?

521
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,500
And you know at least a hundred,
so what does that say about you?

522
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,800
- ???bad.
- I'll be right there.

523
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,100
What? What's wrong?

524
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,800
It's the rehab center.

525
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,600
He tried to go over the wall.

526
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm sorry to bother you, dr. Tanner.

527
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,400
But i checked your notes.

528
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,700
He seems like a deeply troubled man.

529
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,600
- Do you want us to restrain him?
- No.

530
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,800
Sorry. Um, no.
That won't be necessary.

531
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,200
Are you ready to go
back to your room now?

532
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,100
Anyway, pam,

533
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,900
i just wanted to say how sorry i am

534
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,800
For all those times
you had to pick me up

535
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,900
In the middle of the night
when i couldn't drive.

536
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,000
I don't deserve you.

537
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,600
You listen to the doctors
and get better, okay?

538
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,000
Yes, i forgive you.

539
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,900
Bye.

540
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,700
I'm sorry.

541
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,200
What branch of the s.E.C.
Did you say you were from?

542
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,000
San francisco office.

543
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,400
Now, did Mr Hurley happen to mention

544
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,000
Which facility he was at?

545
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,500
???

546
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,100
You tried to scale a wall
with a mop and a bedsheet.

547
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,000
I've been -- I've been
locked up with the guy 24-7!

548
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,500
I mean, you know,
you'd want to get out, too.

549
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,200
I just -- I needed to get a little air.

550
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,500
It was nothing.

551
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,200
- You needed a drink.
- More than one.

552
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,900
We're in the middle of a con.

553
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,400
What the hell were you thinking, nate?

554
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,100
Just -- Just tell me about our guy.

555
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,600
What do we know about Hurley?

556
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,900
We need to talk about this.

557
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,500
No, we don't need to talk.

558
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,900
You need to talk. I'm fine.

559
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,200
Now, just read me in.

560
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,500
You have a problem.

561
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,900
Sophie, you want to help me?

562
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,700
You really, really want to help me?

563
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,600
In the name of god, give me something to do.

564
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,800
Please, just give me something to do.

565
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,400
All right. Um...

566
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,200
It turns out that Hurley's
not as bad as we thought.

567
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
He spends as much time
and money helping others

568
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,800
As he does feeding his addictions.

569
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,000
Define helping.

570
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
Random acts of kindness.

571
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
He tried to buy some waitress a car,

572
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,700
Paid for some woman's college tuition.

573
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,600
There's more to this guy than we thought.

574
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,100
He stole from a charity.

575
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,300
Come on, what more do you need to --

576
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,700
Yeah, i'm not saying we should
pat him on the back or anything.

577
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,900
Listen, the guy, okay, he's an addict.

578
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,400
You know, he's -- He knows
how to manipulate people.

579
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,100
My father was an addict, my grandfather.

580
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,200
I know how these people operate.

581
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,500
I'm just gonna let you think
about that for a minute.

582
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,300
I like this character.

583
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,100
He feels more real than the others.

584
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,100
Sterling.

585
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,600
Company sent me.

586
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,900
They're worried about you.

587
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,600
A place like this isn't cheap.

588
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,000
We wanted to take care of your bill.

589
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,300
Is this a joke?

590
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,800
Treating your son's cancer,

591
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,600
That's something we wouldn't pay for.

592
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,500
That's money down a rat hole.

593
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
But you drinking yourself to death...

594
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,900
That's covered.

595
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,100
¡¢

596
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,900
With a small deductible, of course.

597
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,800
Aah.

598
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,600
Aah!

599
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,700
First step is admitting you're powerless.

600
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,200
Maybe it's just me,

601
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,000
but i don't think you're there yet.

602
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,700
Get out!

603
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,900
You know how to get rid of me.

604
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,300
But that would violate
all 12 steps, wouldn't it?

605
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,200
???

606
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,500
??

607
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,400
????

608
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,900
??

609
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,000
????

610
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,900
- ???
- ??

611
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,600
Yes.

612
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,300
???

613
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,100
Ha ha, that is so --

614
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,000
Where's the money?

615
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,500
I-I-I don't have anything.

616
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,300
They took my wallet when i came in.

617
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,600
Are you okay, Tom?

618
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
You're not thinking about
breaking out again, are you?

619
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,000
Stop with the jokes and the pandering

620
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,100
And pretending you care about people.

621
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,600
It might work on other people.
It doesn't work on me.

622
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,500
I can see right through it.

623
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,300
Come on. You need a little step five.

624
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,500
- Shut up!
- What do you want from me?

625
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,600
The truth!

626
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,000
Okay!

627
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,800
Okay!

628
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,100
I was never in beirut.

629
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Wait!

630
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,100
You want to know why i'm in here?

631
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,200
My wife left me, okay.

632
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,600
That's when everything changed.

633
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,500
???

634
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,300
It wasn't just scumbags
you took money from, was it?

635
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,200
Was it?

636
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,700
All right!

637
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,400
All right!

638
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,000
I stole from a charity!

639
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,100
Yeah.

640
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,300
But it's -- It's not what you think.

641
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,600
It -- It was gonna be my big fix.

642
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,800
Michelle is this woman
that works for a food bank.

643
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,500
Only she doesn't do it
for some high like me.

644
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,600
She does it 'cause she's
actually a good person.

645
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,800
I wanted to help her.

646
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,700
So i cleaned out her account.

647
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,200
With the tricks i've learned,
i can quadruple her money.

648
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,500
You were gonna give the money back?

649
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,000
You were?

650
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
Tell me something, Tom.

651
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,700
Lying, cheating, stealing --

652
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,600
If you're doing it to help someone,

653
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,200
Doesn't that make it okay?

654
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,200
- What's wrong?
- I didn't mean to.

655
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
- It was just instinct.
- Whoa.

656
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,800
I accidentally stole it
from the man in the hall.

657
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,800
Okay, we got to get out of here.

658
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,300
Why?

659
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,000
- ???
- ????

660
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,100
We got to get out of here.

661
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay, parker, get into the air vent,
out to the front gate.

662
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,700
- No.
- No?

663
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,900
No, i feel like i'm
making real progress here.

664
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,100
Listen, i need you to focus, okay?

665
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,100
What?

666
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,900
You don't usually touch me.

667
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,100
Or any of us, really.

668
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,700
It's the hole in your heart, Tom.

669
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,400
It doesn't allow you
to get close to people.

670
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,500
She's right.

671
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Let's go.

672
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,200
Hurley says the money's in his car.

673
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Impossible.

674
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,100
We searched every inch of that thing.

675
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,300
Apparently not every inch.

676
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,500
How did you break him?

677
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,600
Uh, well, um...

678
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,100
You took him out for tacos?

679
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,500
Nate, you're enabling him.

680
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,000
Whoa, whoa.

681
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,800
I haven't slept in three days.

682
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,600
I had a showdown with two different gangs,

683
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,900
Who now, by the way, know my face.

684
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
I sat on a bomb.

685
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,700
And all this could've been avoided
had you gave the man a taco?

686
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,400
Why are we even helping this guy, huh?

687
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,000
Why don't we just turn him over to the cops?

688
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,500
Listen to me, guys --
I'm not saying we throw him a parade.

689
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,400
But if we don't help him,

690
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,300
He's gonna be dead by the end of the day.

691
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,500
So, what's the plan?

692
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Oh, god.

693
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,300
Don't worry.

694
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,100
They're not gonna kill you
until after they get the cash.

695
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
You come empty-Handed?

696
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,400
You said you had the money.

697
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,100
Where is it?

698
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,900
I-I've got it. I-I-I swear.

699
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,100
It's just gonna take
me a second to get it.

700
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,900
Okay.

701
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,100
Hey, does anyone else hear
that beeping noise?

702
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,200
Yeah.

703
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,100
- I think i'm just gonna --
- Wait!

704
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Andale.

705
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,700
La bomba!

706
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,100
- What did he say?
- ??

707
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,900
- It sounded like bomb.
- Yeah, don't move.

708
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,000
La bomba regresa!

709
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,100
Trienta segundos! Trienta segundos!

710
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,100
30 seconds? I didn't want to know that.

711
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,400
Why didn't i take german in school?

712
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,500
Okay, just shut up for a second.

713
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,300
No, we don't have a second!
You got to get out of here.

714
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,800
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go, go, go!

715
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,900
Get out!

716
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,300
- Chileans?
- Jamaicans.

717
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,500
They must've figured out
where the money was,

718
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,200
Wanted to keep it all for themselves.

719
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,500
That's what i would do.

720
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,400
My boss will not be pleased.

721
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,300
Ivamos!

722
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,200
You okay?

723
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,500
Yeah, i wasn't expecting a,
uh, explosion that big.

724
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,200
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.

725
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,500
That's what happens when you
use other people's equipment.

726
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,900
Okay, what did you guys do
with the chileans' bomb

727
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,700
Once you disarmed it?

728
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,100
Uh...why?

729
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,900
Just glad it wasn't me
in that car this time.

730
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,100
How's our boy?

731
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,100
Oh, hey, Hurley.

732
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,900
How you doing?

733
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,100
I-I'm not entirely sure
what just happened.

734
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,100
Go, go!

735
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,900
Dr. Tanner?

736
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,200
Hurley, jump on. Let's go. Now!

737
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,100
Keep your head down. Keep your head down.

738
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,000
Y-You and Tom

739
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,200
Worked together to help me?

740
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,400
That's right.

741
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,900
You must really care about me.

742
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,600
I mean, for you guys to work together.

743
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,200
You don't even like each other.

744
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,700
Oh, well -- Well, actually,
you know, he and i, we --

745
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,000
We get along just fine.

746
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Sometimes, you know, in the
heat of the moment in therapy,

747
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
You know, you say things you don't mean.

748
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
You mean what you say.

749
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,200
Water under the bridge anyhow.

750
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,700
Hurley, that was a
pretty wild ride, right?

751
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,600
Yeah, except for the wild
goose chase you sent us on.

752
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,300
And i checked every inch of that car.

753
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,300
There's no money.

754
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Actually...

755
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,500
Aah.

756
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Ooh.

757
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,400
Steel-Belted radials.

758
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,300
Ohhh.

759
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,600
What do you think?

760
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,000
I think you might have a knack for this.

761
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,700
Sorry about the rubber smell.

762
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,700
It should go away after a while.

763
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,500
Thank you so much.

764
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,900
You have no idea how many
people this is going to help.

765
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,800
Um, just --

766
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,100
I'll, um, zip that up,
and then i'll see you out.

767
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,700
Okay.

768
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,300
Just -- Just take the win.
Take the win.

769
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,900
Here you go.

770
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,300
- What's this?
- That's your new identity.

771
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,900
It's a driver's license,
a passport, birth certificate.

772
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,200
Your library card,
netflix membership, sam's club.

773
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,300
Oh, i got you three months
free at 24-Hour fitness.

774
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,300
Maybe work off some of those tacos.

775
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,400
You guys didn't have to do all this.

776
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,900
Yeah, well, actually, uh, we did.

777
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,100
Uh, jack Hurley is dead. We killed him.

778
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,500
So this is your chance
to kind of start over.

779
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,500
Wow.

780
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,500
Hey, do you think michelle will forgive me

781
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,400
When she gets the payout from
my life-Insurance policy?

782
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,500
Yeah, why don't we just,
uh, go with the win?

783
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,900
We're giving you a second chance,
so don't screw it up.

784
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
If you do, i promise we'll know.

785
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Train ticket.

786
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,400
- Don't worry about me.
- Yeah.

787
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,200
I'm playing it straight from now on.

788
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
In fact, as soon as i get to, uh...

789
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,000
Rosarito, i'm gonna find
the nearest support group.

790
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,600
I promise.

791
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,500
Thanks for everything, Tom.

792
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,100
All right.

793
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,700
And, hey, if you ever need a sponsor,

794
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,200
I am totally there for you, man.

795
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,100
All right???

796
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,400
- Let's --
- No?

797
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,300
I'll keep that in mind.

798
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,100
All right. See you guys..

799
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
Okay.

800
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,800
So, we have one more piece of
business left to do, right?

801
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,200
Mm...

802
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,700
Um...is this supposed to be
a movie set or something?

803
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,800
I don't think she gets this game.

804
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,700
Um...

805
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,600
Cairo museum, the antiquities floor.

806
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,100
Finally!

807
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,000
This is the alarm room right here.

808
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,600
You're sure this is for the best?

809
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,800
Absolutely.

810
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,400
Second act isn't the right place for her.

811
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,700
No, she needs to be around people

812
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,400
Who better understand the
issues she's struggling with.

813
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,900
People more like her.

814
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,000
Hi.

815
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,600
I missed you guys!

816
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,200
When do the happy pills wear off?

817
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,500
- Usually about 24 hours.
- I missed you.

818
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,200
That's too bad.
I kind of like this parker.

819
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,000
Uh, eliot?

820
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,600
Ready to finish what you started?

821
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,900
I'm ready for a drink.
