4
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:16,087
- Thanks
- I'll see you.

5
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:20,020
Why does he have to
do his business here?

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,815
What? Doesn't he have
a parking lot he can go to?

7
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:22,815
???

8
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:25,854
You're cut is 35%.
That's what we agreed to.

9
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:27,372
I'm about to
bring his check.

10
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:28,815
Like he's gonna pay.

11
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:32,187
Ray, i don't like leaving you
alone with this guy.

12
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,954
I'll be fine.
I'll see you at home.

13
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:43,397
I'm glad
we had this little sit-Down,

14
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:47,747
Because i feel
i understand your position now.

15
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:53,561
What did you do?!

16
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:54,554
What did you do?!

17
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,421
Not me. You.

18
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:57,724
No! What?! No!

19
00:00:57,747 --> 00:00:59,818
Look, he came at you.
It's self-Defense.

20
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:01,821
This guy's a killer.
You're a citizen.

21
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:02,794
It's open-And-Shut.

22
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:04,911
Police! Police!
Open that door!

23
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:07,587
Nick, i can't risk it!
I got a wife and a little girl!

24
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:10,097
You paid for this place
with my money! You owe me!

25
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,097
???

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,725
Now...we're square.

27
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:17,087
And we'll take care
of your family, okay?

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,633
Let us in! Open this door!

29
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:21,254
This isn't
for negotiation, ray.

30
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:24,679
???

31
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:31,087
That was five years ago.

32
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,988
Ray still has 10 more years
left on his sentence.

33
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:38,721
It's all right, teresa.
Can i get you anything?

34
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,588
What's going on?

35
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:47,449
- Client meeting.
- I can see that.

36
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:49,454
I thought
i pick the clients.

37
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:51,454
Who is that crying?

38
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,123
That's teresa palermo.

39
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,787
Her husband
owed money to the mob,

40
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:57,387
And he took the fall
for a murder the boss committed.

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,869
She's a friend
of sophie's.

42
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:00,854
I see.

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,334
Stick around, hardison.

44
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:05,120
We're gonna have a meeting later
about how things work around here.

45
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:07,454
This is probably a bad time
to talk about christmas, huh?

46
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:09,120
Hey, nate,
this is my friend --

47
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:12,381
Ms. Palermo. Yes.
Hardison brought me up to speed.

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,587
Go on.

49
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:17,320
Please, continue.

50
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:20,153
Well, after it happened,

51
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,684
I told my husband
to tell the truth.

52
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:25,731
You know, we'd go
in the program, start over.

53
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,487
But he said
it was better like this.

54
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,592
That we'd have a cushion.
What a joke.

55
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:32,020
Moscone
never gave us a dime.

56
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,554
We lost the restaurant,
our house.

57
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,244
Then a couple weeks ago,
i saw this in our local paper.

58
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:42,523
Moscone has a big wedding
planned for his daughter --

59
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,569
His princess --
While my daughter

60
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:46,848
Only knows her father

61
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,221
From the other side
of bulletproof glass.

62
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,338
It's not right.

63
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,268
No. No, it's --
It's not right.

64
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:56,338
But, you know, uh,
we're not detectives.

65
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,547
And if you want to prove
your husband's innocence,

66
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,521
There are plenty of agencies
i could recommend.

67
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,187
Don't you think
i tried that?

68
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,854
This is nicky moscone
we're talking about.

69
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,572
They all laughed.

70
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:08,967
Yeah, i think, um,

71
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:12,587
What nate is --
Is trying to say is --

72
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:15,521
Is what exactly is it
that you want from us?

73
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:17,897
The note on the restaurant --

74
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,521
$765,000.

75
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:21,759
I want what moscone
promised us --

76
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:24,387
No more, no less.

77
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,270
If i could
get the restaurant back,

78
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,666
It would give my husband
something to look forward to.

79
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:31,642
- Otherwise --
- Yeah.

80
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:35,132
Well, we will discuss it
and get back to you.

81
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,760
I understand.

82
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,287
Thank you.

83
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:49,921
Where did my daughter go?

84
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:51,687
I think she was
with parker.

85
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,017
Go!

86
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,622
6 seconds!
Give it up!

87
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,692
Good job.

88
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:11,754
They have nowhere else
to turn.

89
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:13,996
Yeah, well, you know,
her husband
should have thought of that

90
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,687
Before he got in bed
with nicky moscone.

91
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,577
It's mob stuff. It's not
the kind of case we take.

92
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:18,368
I disagree.

93
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:20,833
Well, if you disagree
and you feel strongly about it,

94
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,856
Why don't
you write her a check?

95
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:23,487
Maybe i will,
if it comes to that.

96
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:27,042
Oh, wow. I really
thought you'd get this, nate.

97
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,020
Teresa doesn't want to
just get paid.

98
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,821
She wants the man
who destroyed her family to pay.

99
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,654
You know, if it
doesn't come from him,

100
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,764
If he's not hurt by it
in some way,

101
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:37,654
Then there's --
There's no justice.

102
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:41,020
Just take the mob
out of it.

103
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,183
What?
Take the mob out of it?

104
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:44,354
Hear me out.

105
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,253
Isn't this just
a breach of contract?

106
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,951
These guys
had a deal, right?

107
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:50,153
And your boy, ray,
he lived up to his end,

108
00:04:50,187 --> 00:04:51,487
But moscone didn't.

109
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:54,162
And for that, there's not
a court of law in this world
this lady can go to.

110
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:58,417
Which is exactly
the kind of case we take.

111
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,509
Oh, come on.

112
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:03,487
I don't --
Why teresa?

113
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,354
I don't know.

114
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:11,821
Well, her man's
gone to jail for 15 years,

115
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:14,604
And she's waiting
for him...

116
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,930
for 15 years.

117
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,320
Do you have any idea
how hard it is...

118
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,387
to wait for someone?

119
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:36,444
Yeah, okay.Yeah, okay,

120
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,862
Let's go rob nicky moscone --

121
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:41,754
A guy who kills people
and lives in our city.

122
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,420
Yeah, let's do that.

123
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:49,817
Typical mob mcmansion.

124
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:52,189
They've got
the hideous gates,

125
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,721
Infinity pool,
statues everywhere.

126
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,387
How are we gonna
handle surveillance?

127
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,398
We can't.
That thing's a fortress, man.

128
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:01,956
I clocked
four armed guards,

129
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:03,587
A tikva security system.

130
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,087
That thing's
israeli-Made.

131
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,420
It's used to protect
their military bases.

132
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,254
It's unhackable.

133
00:06:09,516 --> 00:06:12,587
Oh, and then there's the fbi
parked around the corner.

134
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,954
Fbi? Where?

135
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,487
You see that crappy van
that says "plumber"?

136
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:23,254
Did you say "plumber"?
That's their cover?

137
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,075
Oh, that is so cute.

138
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:26,959
It's like it's 1978
all over again.

139
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:30,153
Listen, you can't just walk
into a place like that blind.

140
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:31,988
Oh, yeah, that's true.

141
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,053
If we can't get our surveillance
the usual way,

142
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:36,721
We'll just have to, you know,
borrow somebody else's.

143
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:43,611
Yes?

144
00:06:43,657 --> 00:06:45,821
Relax.
We're with the bureau.

145
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:50,147
Howdy.
Special agent thomas.

146
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,077
This is special agent hagen.
She's fresh out of quantico.

147
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm showing her
all the hot spots, you know.

148
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,821
Uh-Huh.
Oh, by the way,

149
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:58,171
We got your memo.

150
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,287
We're moving it
up the chain.

151
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,954
What? Hey.
G-Great. Thanks.

152
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,799
Well, come on in.

153
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:10,264
Sorry about the heat...
and the smell.

154
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:13,684
Huh.
How did he know that?

155
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,451
Oh, the field guys
are always sending memos.

156
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:18,120
They just need validation.

157
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:22,787
This is really the front line
in the war on terror...

158
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:25,120
the terror
of organized crime.

159
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,120
Wow, is this
vest lining kevlar?

160
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:30,621
Uh...no. It --
It's rayon.

161
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:32,824
???

162
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:35,454
Yeah, it breathes
better than kevlar.

163
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:36,801
But i have it in my locker.

164
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:37,965
I wish i could
give you a sample,

165
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:40,314
But the bug we planted
in moscone's barbecue

166
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,621
Is pretty spotty.

167
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,477
<i>- The bug?
- Yes, sir.</i>

168
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:45,407
- Singular?
- Absolutely.

169
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,314
Good -- Good work.
Good work.

170
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,821
You know what?
I'm kind of into this.

171
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:53,896
- May i?
- Please.

172
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,989
???

173
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,431
...do any kind
of investigations.

174
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,320
- Do you have any snacks?
- Uh, yeah.

175
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,850
I've got a-A meat stick,
if you want it.

176
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,821
But, um...

177
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:06,851
well, it's half-Eaten.

178
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:09,083
Oh, okay, i see
what the problem is here.

179
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:11,479
You're bumping
into baby-Monitor frequency.

180
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:15,320
Oh, yeah. Yeah, i thought
i heard some crying.

181
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:19,246
???

182
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,271
See if that clears it up.

183
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,294
Yeah. Great.

184
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,053
I saw some rubber gloves.
What do you do with those?

185
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:28,721
Oh, actually --

186
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:32,061
We've just been kind of blowing
them up and playing volleyball.

187
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:35,155
But, uh, yeah.
If we need to...

188
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:37,574
???

189
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,420
All right.
All right.
Thanks.

190
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,621
Uh, yeah.

191
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,420
I got it!

192
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:50,454
There. Oh, yeah.

193
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:52,854
Nice.

194
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,158
Thanks for the tour.

195
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,454
Come back anytime.

196
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:12,460
All right.
Stay strong, brother.

197
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:14,420
- Will.
- The shake-Up is coming.

198
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,391
Long overdue.

199
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,721
You, i...
i'll watch for you.

200
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:20,287
I'm the coffee.
You're the cream.

201
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,856
She smells like jasmine.

202
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,950
???

203
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:37,811
Okay, i found the server
with the moscone
surveillance files.

204
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,821
Room 718.

205
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,821
All you have to do is rip them
on my flash drive and run.

206
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,021
I don't have to
type anything, right?

207
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:52,905
No, just plug it in.
It does the rest.

208
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,287
All right,
'cause you know i just learned

209
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,287
The photoshop thing
you told me.

210
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,441
I-I know. Baby steps.

211
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:00,999
So i just plug it in.

212
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:09,534
Now, audio files, they can take
a little while to run,

213
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,387
But, uh,
the servers are pretty loud,

214
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,354
So that should
give you some cover.

215
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,521
It's tapes.

216
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:20,687
Wha-- Hold, wait.
Did you -- You just say "tapes"?

217
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,814
I just said "tapes"!

218
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:22,977
Cassette tapes?

219
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,654
Your little thing --
It's not gonna work.

220
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,536
But at least you ain't
got to type nothing.

221
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,536
Hardison, how am i supposed to
get out of the fbi offices

222
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,908
With a boxful
of surveillance tapes, huh?

223
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,699
Punch somebody.

224
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:37,754
Oh,
i'm gonna punch somebody.

225
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,002
???

226
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:51,887
- You're welcome.
- Was that so hard?

227
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,608
Why couldn't you have
just done that off the bat?

228
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,526
How was it?

229
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,654
You try listening
to 74-Straight hours

230
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:06,237
Of surveillance of the mob...
on a walkman.

231
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,842
Okay,
what did you learn?

232
00:11:07,888 --> 00:11:10,585
Well, first of all, uh, how
great "jersey boys" is there.

233
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,818
???

234
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:16,493
No, what did you learn
about where moscone
keeps his money?

235
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,424
He keeps it in offshore accounts
under his wife's name, heather,

236
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,005
To protect it from the feds.

237
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,750
Can you break the codes?

238
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:26,005
The codes?

239
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,098
The codes to the cayman bank
and trust, where the cali cartel

240
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:31,052
And the african dictators
keep all their dirty money?

241
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:34,076
The ones that moscone
changes anytime
he damn well pleases?

242
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:36,937
Like, it's -- Come on.
Dude, are you kidding me?

243
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,526
You know, you're --
You're very negative lately.

244
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,827
- Yeah.
- And the sass?

245
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,092
It doesn't -- Doesn't help.

246
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:46,226
Where -- Where does moscone
keep the liquid assets?

247
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:50,589
Okay, i took a number
of the daily deliveries

248
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:51,891
His capos make
to the house,

249
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:55,287
And i cross-Referenced them
with his declared income
and his spending habits.

250
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,868
I'd say he's got at least
$2 million stashed right here.

251
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:00,544
So we're back
to the beginning.

252
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:05,059
Um, all we need is a --
Is a way in, right?

253
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:08,009
This guy. I could hit one of
the bagmen before they get in.

254
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:10,460
Roll the dice
on a big payout.

255
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,793
Or we could tunnel
from the neighbors.

256
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:15,242
What's going on here?
What's --

257
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:17,312
Uh, he's just
putting up a tent

258
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,917
For moscone's
daughter's wedding.

259
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:20,452
It's happening
this weekend.

260
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:23,149
There's a lots
of conversations
between him and the wife
about that.

261
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:25,126
Let's hear one.

262
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:28,592
<i>I am overwhelmed!
I need help!</i>

263
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,871
<i>Overwhelmed?! You're the one
who wanted this huge fiasco!</i>

264
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,755
<i>No, no. No.
For your daughter.</i>

265
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,662
<i>I told you, i don't
want people in my house.</i>

266
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,242
<i>Yeah, unless it's your skank
yoga instructor, by the way.</i>

267
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:39,615
???

268
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:41,919
It's a bit like an opera,
isn't it?

269
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:43,989
You mean 'cause
i want to run away.

270
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:45,965
Well, now,
if that isn't an invitation,

271
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:47,942
I don't know what is.

272
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,314
<i>Don't walk away from me.</i>

273
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:53,221
I don't see
what the problem is.

274
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:56,362
Well, it says,
"the bride and groom
release
a dozen white doves."

275
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,152
Yeah?

276
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,493
Oh, it just seems like a little
bit much, don't you think?

277
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:03,571
It's your wedding, maria.
It's a memory. Okay?

278
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:06,560
A precious,
precious memory.

279
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:11,177
Mrs. Moscone?

280
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,037
Ruby holden --
Peerless events.

281
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,456
Your wedding planner.

282
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,270
What? I didn't
hire a wedding plan--

283
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:17,665
Oh,
your husband hired me.

284
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:18,805
He didn't tell you?

285
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:21,991
He said something
about you being...overwhelmed.

286
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:25,693
Oh, well, uh,
ms., uh...

287
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:27,387
you can call me ruby.

288
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:30,224
Ruby -- That's cute.
How shall i put this?

289
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:31,922
Uh, everyone
i've hired for this wedding --

290
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:33,782
The caterer,
the florist, the band --

291
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,294
Is a frigging moron.

292
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:37,435
But i'm gonna
have to live with it
because the wedding
is two days away.

293
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:39,388
And, frankly,
i don't see how you can come in

294
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,132
And magically
fix everything.

295
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:43,393
What are you --
Mary poppins?

296
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:46,092
Well,
i do have a little help.

297
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,250
Sophie.

298
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,092
Where are we at?

299
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:01,959
Huh?

300
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:05,832
I don't know, nate.

301
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,135
I think you need to
ask yourself that question.

302
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,507
<i>You called me, remember?</i>

303
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:10,995
And now we're working together
every day.

304
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:12,530
I don't know
what you want.

305
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:15,293
And to ask me that
dressed like a vicar...

306
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,390
you're a very strange man.

307
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:19,959
No, no, no. I meant where are
we at with finding the money?

308
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,950
Oh.

309
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:26,205
Well, parker says there are
no wall safes upstairs.

310
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:27,508
And i'm still looking.

311
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:29,577
Okay, well, keep me posted
every 15 minutes.

312
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:32,159
I don't want to
miss anything.

313
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,766
How are we doing?
How's the search?

314
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,463
I haven't started yet.

315
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,021
Okay, you know,
i haven't gotten
one answer
i was looking for today.

316
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,068
What is it that you're doing?
What's going on?

317
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:53,463
I'm cutting onion...

318
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,045
deveining shrimp,
uh, pan-Searing some scallops.

319
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:58,114
I've got 200 people
i got to feed, all right?

320
00:14:58,161 --> 00:14:59,046
Back off.

321
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:01,185
Okay, okay. Hmm.

322
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,488
What,
you think the only thing
i know how to do
is bust heads?

323
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,441
No -- Well, yeah.

324
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:11,627
Look, hold a knife like this,
cuts through an onion.

325
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,791
Hold a knife like this,

326
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:15,326
Cuts through, like,
eight yakuza in 4 seconds.

327
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,628
Screams, carnage.
People are like knives.

328
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:20,907
Everything is in context.

329
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:24,093
Okay, hors d'oeuvres.

330
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:26,839
Yes, ma'am --
Stuffed mushrooms,

331
00:15:27,304 --> 00:15:31,606
Pine nuts, kiss of basil,
some sun-Dried tomatoes,

332
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,861
And...

333
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:35,257
the finishing touch...

334
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:36,885
lemon juice.

335
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:42,630
Does this look like
a food court? Does it?

336
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:45,421
I want high-End food --
High-End!

337
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:48,860
What are you...

338
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:52,351
??

339
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,934
Hey. Just --
Just find the money.

340
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,726
That's why we're here --
To find the money.

341
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:07,981
I saw a bunch of people
go in the house.

342
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:09,098
You get anything?

343
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:11,470
No, damn sprinkler's on.

344
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:17,092
Imagine if we had bugs
planted all over the house.

345
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:20,426
Yeah.

346
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,565
They're so far
from where i'm sitting.

347
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:44,914
I just think
your college friends
would prefer to sit
somewhere in the back.

348
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:47,751
Heather?

349
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:50,393
Was that you screaming my name?

350
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,589
Oh, yes, yes.

351
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,706
We're looking at the dresses
for the bridal party,

352
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:55,393
And i wanted your opinion.

353
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:00,124
You look lovely.

354
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:01,959
You don't think
it makes me look fat?

355
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:04,092
Oh, definitely.

356
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:07,497
I mean, why do you think
i had to let out the waist?

357
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,497
To make you
look less skinny?

358
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:11,590
She...

359
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:14,521
she didn't mean that.

360
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:17,173
Oh, suck it up, cindy.
You'll be fine.

361
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,731
Actually,
i could not agree more.

362
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:22,103
Finally,
someone around here
who knows
what they're talking about.

363
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:30,709
Now much do you weigh,
anyway?

364
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,337
???

365
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:35,406
I checked the library
and the maid's room.

366
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,499
No sign of the money.
Now, we need to focus.

367
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,788
We only have one day left
before we --

368
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,337
Oh, reverend.

369
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,105
Reverend, come in.

370
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:44,896
I'm having a drink
with my son-In-Law to-Be.

371
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,594
Thanks again for doing this
on such short notice.

372
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,105
The pastor from my church
back in kansas
doesn't travel much anymore.

373
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:53,198
Yeah, and the local clergy
bowed out

374
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:56,059
Because of
certain misconceptions
about my business.

375
00:17:56,082 --> 00:17:58,502
Oh, well,
i'm very happy to do it.

376
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:00,362
No, thank you. No.

377
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:02,154
- Come on.
- Okay.

378
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:04,222
Weddings can be stressful.

379
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:06,408
I should really be going.

380
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,153
Got to rest up for the big day.

381
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:10,106
Got the bachelor party
to go to?

382
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:12,689
No, that was last weekend,
remember?

383
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:14,014
We went whale watching.

384
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,154
Whale watching.

385
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:25,573
You know what i did
before you got here, reverend?

386
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:28,822
I offered him 200 grand
to disappear.

387
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,573
Yeah,
i was gonna eat everything --

388
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:33,154
The tent, the food,
everything.

389
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,713
He wouldn't take it.

390
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,993
Well, maybe he's not
interested in money.

391
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:40,355
Or maybe it wasn't enough.

392
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:44,355
If there's a man
without a price,
i haven't met him yet,
reverend.

393
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:47,016
Not very christian of me,
i know.

394
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,655
Oh, you and i have more
in common than you think.

395
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,388
I doubt that.

396
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,922
Uh, nick --
Oh, excuse me, father.

397
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:56,924
Uh, our friend from brooklyn's
on the line.

398
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:59,180
Um, i've got to take this,
reverend.

399
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,655
Oh, yes. Of course.
Thank you for the drink.

400
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,228
What?

401
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,042
Hardison, office phone.
Get the feed.

402
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:14,972
<i>Well,
you tell that bastard</i>

403
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:16,367
<i>If he wants that money so bad,</i>

404
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,154
<i>I'll give it to him
at the reception, huh?</i>

405
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:20,996
<i>And he better bring maria
one hell of a gift.</i>

406
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,154
Okay, that means the deal
is going down at the wedding,

407
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:28,521
Probably involving all
of moscone's available cash.

408
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:32,368
So, basically, we go in.
We've got to find the money.

409
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:34,997
Then we've got to
get it out
under the noses
of 200 hungry guests.

410
00:19:35,044 --> 00:19:36,253
While
we run the wedding?

411
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,323
Hey, we find the money,
we get out before it starts.

412
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:41,300
You know, i swear,
i never understood the lengths
people go
with these things.

413
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:42,928
I mean, the endless --
You know,

414
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:46,464
The dresses and the endless
toasts and the crying.

415
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:49,301
And -- And, you know, it's
just -- It's unbelievable to me.

416
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,278
And everyone
has a role to play, right?

417
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:52,580
And the bride and groom at
the end of the day,

418
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,221
They go home with a pile of cash.

419
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:55,278
And if you really
think about it,

420
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,743
The whole thing
is just a giant, giant con.

421
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,600
Well...aren't you romantic.

422
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,400
Yo

423
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,200
No way in hell i could
ever imagine getting married.

424
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,000
I mean, it's just --
It's just a piece of paper.

425
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,600
I take it you've never been married.

426
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,500
-No.
-Ever come close?

427
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,000
No.

428
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What was her name?

429
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,700
It was a girl i grew up with.

430
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,700
But anyway,she married somebody else, so...

431
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,100
hot damn,what did you do?

432
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,300
What did i do?
I liberated croatia.

433
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,500
Oh, see, now, me,i would have
just got fat and started up a comic-Book shop.

434
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,000
That's you and me right there.

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,100
Whoa, uh...

436
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,800
it's okay. Here. Zip.

437
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,600
Now, i know that you're in
charge of the bridesmaids' dresses,

438
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,100
But why are you wearing one?

439
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,000
A bridesmaid's dress is like
an all-Access pass at a wedding.

440
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,300
Plus, i kind of said something,
and the maid of honor cried.

441
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,500
And sophie said i should make it up to her.

442
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,800
By looking much,
much better in the same dress?

443
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, you let me know how that goes.

444
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,500
Hmm, you really think i look good?

445
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
And now you're perfect.

446
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,500
??I am overwhelmed!

447
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,400
Yeah, well, i don't care
where you put the trucks,

448
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,100
As long as they're not visible from the house.

449
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Hold on,i've got to take this.

450
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,700
Yeah -- Hold -- Not now.

451
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,900
Not now!

452
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
It's in the screening room.

453
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,100
The screening room.

454
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,900
Who left mud --

455
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,800
Lourdes, why is there mud on the floor?!

456
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,300
Oh.

457
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Yeah, i'm listening.

458
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,100
Everybody stop what they're doing.

459
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,900
Meet me at the southwest corner now.

460
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,700
I'll be right down.

461
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,000
What is it, sweetheart?
What's wrong?

462
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,900
What's wrong? Everything.

463
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Adam and i wanted something small.

464
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,300
But heather said dad needed this
to wine and dine his business people.

465
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,900
But now i realize,it's all about her!

466
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
Like your feelings don't matter.
Like you don't even exist.

467
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,600
Yes.

468
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm gonna tell you something,
and i want you to listen to me,

469
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,300
Okay, 'cause i learned this the hard way.

470
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,000
Do not put your faith in a man.

471
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,600
I know -- What?

472
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,100
-Men don't communicate,
-So what do we do?

473
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,800
We project onto them about us
and our lives together.

474
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,100
It's all rubbish.
We don't know what they want.

475
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,600
You want to know what they're thinking about

476
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,400
When they're off staring into
space, looking all romantic?

477
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,300
The job.
It's all about work to them.

478
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,600
That's all they care about.

479
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,100
Yeah, my advice...

480
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,100
do not put your faith in a man.

481
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,900
What is it?
I got bacon on.

482
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,800
The butcher is here.

483
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,800
Does he have the baby lamb chops?

484
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,300
No.The butcher of kiev.

485
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,700
Think he'll recognize you?

486
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,200
I kill you!

487
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Yeah,i think he'd remember me.

488
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,200
Okay, well how is it that we
know how good "jersey boys" is,

489
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,900
??But we missed this somehow?

490
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,200
Whoa, whoa,whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

491
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,500
Tone it down, brother.
Okay, first of all, the sass?

492
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
-It's not helpful.
-But you were listening to the tapes.

493
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,700
How did we miss this?
Why are y'all looking at me?

494
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Okay, look,the guest list didn't
raise any red flags with the feds.

495
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,900
Looks like steve and scott miller arrived.

496
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
There sure are a lot millers at this wedding.

497
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,400
Okay, listen, we have a world-Class
killer here who's going to i.D. Eliot,

498
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,000
And we are not prepared for this at all.

499
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,200
So i am gonna pull the plug.

500
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,100
I want everyone to meet me
at the van in two minutes.

501
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
Man.

502
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm staying.

503
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,800
I'm sorry. You're --
You're what?

504
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm staying.

505
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,200
You're staying?

506
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,400
Sophie, sophie,
it's the butcher of kiev.

507
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,100
Have you ever been to kiev?

508
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,900
The cake-Maker of kiev
would whup all our ass.

509
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,300
This is the butcher.

510
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,400
Uh-Huh.

511
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,600
Is this about fear of the
russian mob,or fear of intimacy?

512
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Oh, my god.

513
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,200
Listen, i made a promise to my friend
teresa and i'm not gonna let her down.

514
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,200
And that bride in there --
What's her name --

515
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm not gonna let her down, either.

516
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,300
So you guys can go.
I'm staying.

517
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,500
I'll do this by myself if i have to.

518
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Okay, fine.

519
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,100
Sophie, hardison, parker,find the money.

520
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,100
Eliot,stay away from the butcher.

521
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,900
Uh, me...

522
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
i have a wedding to officiate.

523
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,300
And so, what do our readings
today tell us about marriage?

524
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,200
Well, it's a union.
It's a holy bond.

525
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,000
It's a wonderful institution we have
in which two people fall deeply in love.

526
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,000
It's a covenant.
It's a contract.

527
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,900
What do we know about contracts?

528
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,700
Well, we know they're pretty lousy
vehicles for making people happy,

529
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,200
I'll tell you that for free.

530
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
One party feels they're getting
the short end of the stick.

531
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,200
And, uh, before you know it,
people start to lawyer up.

532
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,300
And, well, try telling that to someone who
thinks marriage is a sacred bond and a covenant.

533
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,100
I mean, you might as well
explain baseball to a dog.

534
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,800
But at least a dog
will bring the ball back to you,

535
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,100
And you can pat it on its head.

536
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,500
??

537
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,900
Downstairs is clear.

538
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,900
That leaves one place where
the money could be stashed --

539
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,400
The screening room.

540
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,600
Go.

541
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,100
These peaches aren't
gonna poach themselves, parker.

542
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Sorry, emeril.

543
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,600
-What was that?
-You heard me.

544
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,600
Yeah. I'll show you.

545
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,300
Bam!

546
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,500
I mean, what is marriage?

547
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,100
I mean, is it running
around rooftops in paris?

548
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,800
I don't think so. No.

549
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,900
It's pushing a cart
around the home depot.

550
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,900
We're good. We're good, pal.

551
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,000
It's pushing a cart around home depot.

552
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,000
That's what it is.
It's hard work.

553
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,800
Hard, hard, hard, hard work, people.

554
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,000
I mean, i mean, you know,some people don't
understand how hard a real relationship can be.

555
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,500
And some people should consider that other people,

556
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,500
You know, they don't --
Maybe they need a little time,

557
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,900
You know, before they start
dating some people again

558
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,400
And -- And -- And start
committing and -- And -- And

559
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,700
And -- And -- And...

560
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,000
but...but luckily, luckily, luckily,

561
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Adam and maria --
They don't have such problems.

562
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,100
No, because, you know, maria,
despite all the fear,

563
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,700
And doubt that life brings,

564
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,600
Adam, when he looks at you,maria,

565
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,300
You know, he knows that
you have made him a better man,

566
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,900
A better version of himself.

567
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,300
And now that he's known you,
he can never go back.

568
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,400
And, maria, you know that,
when you look at adam,

569
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,400
Yes, you know you've made him a better man

570
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,800
And that he should probably
just give up and agree with you.

571
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,800
Well, i would like to now
pronounce you, uh, man and wife.

572
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,000
You may now kiss the bride.

573
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,100
Um...

574
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,300
moscone is leaving.
The deal is going down now.

575
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,600
I have a meeting tomorrow morning
in london and the jet is idling.

576
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,700
G4?

577
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,500
Do i look like a hockey player?

578
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,100
Global express.

579
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,700
Eliot, i got the boss and sergei
in the dining room.

580
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,400
Where are they going?

581
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,600
The screening room.
Parker, you got the money?

582
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,500
Not yet.

583
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,800
All right, they're on their way.
Get out now.

584
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Not an option.

585
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,700
In my day,no one would do
business at their daughter's wedding.

586
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,600
I have deals going on in
three different continents right now.

587
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,100
I take payments 24/7.
The days of credit are over.

588
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,600
Well, the ports of long beach
have been good to us.

589
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,900
My unions got some fat
homeland security contracts.

590
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,400
And this -- This is just
the tip of the iceberg.

591
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,500
What?!

592
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,800
Where is my money?

593
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,800
It was in there!
I put the money in myself!

594
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,400
Look, get that gun out of
my face before i call my guys.

595
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,400
Do it. I tell my crew to start
shooting everyone in the tent.

596
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,200
Starting with the bride.

597
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
Money gone.
Sergei not happy.

598
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,300
Yeah, keep a lid on things until
i figure out what happened.

599
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,400
What's going on?

600
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,400
Somebody beat us to the money.

601
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,800
They set up moscone to hand
sergei an empty briefcase.

602
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,000
Who?

603
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,100
It's in the screening room.

604
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
The screening room.

605
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Go get me heather's phone.

606
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,300
I've got money overseas.
This is just a cash-Flow issue.

607
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
It's business!

608
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,900
I didn't do anything when you shot
my brother like a dog in that restaurant.

609
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,800
-What did you do?!
-Not me. You.

610
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,700
Nobody wanted a war. But now
you cheat us on a payout?

611
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,200
I have a green light.

612
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,700
Your brother, huh?
Look, it was a mistake, okay?

613
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,900
Eliot, get to the screening room right now.

614
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,200
It burns!

615
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,400
Cut him off.

616
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,200
??

617
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,500
??

618
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,000
Why would heather give
up all this just for a bag of money?

619
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,800
Well, she didn't.
The russians have the money.

620
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,200
She just told them where to find it.

621
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,500
So the empty briefcase was the excuse
sergei needed to kill moscone.

622
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,100
The guy's been waiting five
years, climbing up the ranks.

623
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,600
She gets the fat offshore accounts
her husband put in her name.

624
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
This is the --
You know, the big score.

625
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,000
There's no messy divorce,
but she's not...here.

626
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,200
And...

627
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,100
okay. I'll go find her.

628
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Yeah.

629
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,800
Now i kill you.

630
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
I can get your money
with one phone call.

631
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,300
Global economy never waits.

632
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh!

633
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,200
Ooh, you're not the deejay.

634
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,800
I was supposed to meet him in here.Shh.

635
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Hey,the father of the bride!

636
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,300
He's in here!

637
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,800
Everybody's been looking for you.

638
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,700
You're in so much trouble.
Come on, party's in full swing.

639
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,600
He's in here!

640
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,800
One word,everyone dies.

641
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,200
After you.

642
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
When i look at maria and adam,

643
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,800
I feel such a whirlwind of emotions.

644
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,600
??

645
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,500
First of all,i know that
she has found her one, true love.

646
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,600
Adam is such a great person,such a big --

647
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,100
Uh, hey, hey.
Hey, girl.

648
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,600
Let's give it up for the maid of honor.

649
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,000
You are working the hell out of that dress.

650
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Mmm, good god.

651
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,500
Um, and now let's give it up for
the man that made all of this happen,

652
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,400
Moscone, big papa,the duke of the docks,

653
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,300
The sultan of sanitation,
my man, mr. Nick moscone!

654
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,300
Watch out, brother.

655
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,800
-Personal space.Appreciate it.
-??

656
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,500
It's, uh -- It's time
for the father-Daughter dance.

657
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,500
So do your thing.
Keep dancing. Keep two-Stepping.

658
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,400
Now i kill you!

659
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,900
??

660
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,700
It's the lemon juice.

661
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
You just kill a guy with an appetizer?

662
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,600
I don't know. Maybe.

663
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,600
??Ride's here.

664
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,800
It's about time.

665
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,100
How did you get away from sergei
in the screening room?

666
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,900
I pretended i was drunk and that
we were meeting down there to have sex.

667
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,800
Put it in the trunk.

668
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,400
This car?

669
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Do it.

670
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,400
Hardison, we've got to
end the wedding now.

671
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,200
Get adam and maria out immediately.

672
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,600
Hey, people,what's happening?

673
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,800
I just got word that there's
a storm brewing in the rockies,

674
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,400
So if these kids want to make it
to kansas by tomorrow,

675
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,900
They got to go.

676
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,300
Oh, yeah, yeah,
look, hey, hey, hey, hey.

677
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,100
If y'all don't want them driving
through golf-Ball-Sized hail,

678
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,700
Let's give them a good send-Off,
come on, people.

679
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,800
How are you doing?

680
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,600
I'm sorry this day didn't
work out the way you wanted.

681
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,300
It did.

682
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,400
You're a dead man.

683
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,200
Do you think you scare me reverend?

684
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,100
No, i don't think i do.

685
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,900
But i think that mr. Moscone's friends
here might put the fear of god into you.

686
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,000
If you're looking for your
people, they're in the kitchen.

687
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,700
Please, excuse me.

688
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,500
Certainly.

689
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,300
Exactly what denomination are you, reverend?

690
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,800
I -- Excuse me.

691
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
??

692
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Okay, yeah.
Where's heather?

693
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,400
I got her.

694
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,900
Hey, you miserable shrew.

695
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,900
You are never gonna bother
those kids again. Ever.

696
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,100
And you better start
brushing up on your russian

697
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,200
'Cause your husband's about to discover
you're the one who sold him out.

698
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,500
You're not mary poppins.
You're a bitch.

699
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,900
Ow! That hurt!

700
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Nate, i lost her.

701
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,700
-Where's my wife?
-Your wife -- She's gone.

702
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,100
Where's the cash?

703
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,900
Yeah,where's teresa's money?

704
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, nate, what have you done this time?

705
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,300
Ah. Wait for it.

706
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,800
Yeah, yeah, i need all new codes
for cayman bank and trust,

707
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,300
Account number 7187931768.

708
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,000
You know all those offshore
accounts that moscone has,

709
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,000
You know,the ones in heather's name?

710
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,800
Well, now that she's blown town,

711
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,500
Guess who's on the phone
changing the passwords.

712
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Can you do anything with those?

713
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,500
Oh, i can do everything with them.

714
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,300
Wait, wait, wait.
I-I still don't understand.

715
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,100
What happened to the cash?

716
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
Oh, the cash.

717
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,000
Well...

718
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,000
??

719
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Put it in the trunk.

720
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,000
-This car?
-Do it.

721
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,600
Don't spend it all in one place.

722
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,800
So, padre, a wedding's
just a big con, huh?

723
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,200
I never said there was
anything wrong with that.

724
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,100
Let's go.

725
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,000
This is pretty good, man.

726
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,600
Thanks, man. I squeeze, like,
fresh lemon juice on it.

727
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,900
Cool. Cool.

728
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,200
Did you clear out moscone's accounts?

729
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,500
I left him five dollars for socks.

730
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,800
Meet me at the car.

731
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,800
Reverend.

732
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,800
Did you find your wife?

733
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,600
No. And you know what?
Good riddance.

734
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,400
On the day my daughter takes her vows,

735
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,900
That woman broke her vows to me.

736
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,800
I can't think of anything lower than that.

737
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,500
"Give, and it shall be given to you.

738
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,200
"For whatever measure you deal to others,

739
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,500
It will be dealt to you in return."

740
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,000
People who break their promises
get what's coming to them,mr. Moscone.

741
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,800
Thanks, reverend.
That makes me feel better.

742
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,000
Sure.

743
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,500
Please. Take it.

744
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,600
Oh, i appreciate it, reverend,
but i'm a busy guy.

745
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,700
Well, you never know
when you might find the time.

746
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,100
Surprise!Surprise!
Surprise!Surprise!

747
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,100
What the --

748
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,300
It's all yours.

749
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,100
What?I don't know what to say.

750
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,000
Give me a hug.

751
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,200
-Oh, my gosh.
-Come. Come sit down.

752
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,300
I wish ray were here to see this.

753
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Wait for it.

754
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,900
Huh?

755
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,400
Moscone's arrest casts new light on the
murder of russian hit man anatoli sirosky,

756
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,000
A murder l.A. Restaurant owner raymond
palermo was convicted of five years ago.

757
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,600
Mr. Palermo's attorneys
are already filing appeals.

758
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,400
-I thought you couldn't.
-How?

759
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I didn't do anything when you shot
my brother like a dog in that restaurant.

760
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,300
Your brother, huh?
Look, it was a mistake.

761
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay?

762
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,000
-All right!
-Hey!

763
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,800
Daddy's coming home.

764
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,300
Hot plates! Hot plates!
Hey, come on, now!

765
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,900
Make some room.
Make a little room there.

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000

00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,900
I've got a toast.

769
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,900
Cheers.

770
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,800
Cheers.
