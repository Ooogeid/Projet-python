00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,300
YES ???,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,600
???

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,300
- WHERE IS HE? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM?
-WHY HAVEN'T YOU RETURNED OUR CALLS?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,800
DID YOU THINK WE'D JUST GO AWAY?

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,100
WE'VE GIVEN YOU THE MONEY.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,900
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH LUKA?!
- DANA!

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,300
JOE?

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,300
JOE!

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,000
JOE. GOD...

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,300
HELP!

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,800
PLEASE!
SOMEBODY HELP US!

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,200
PLEASE! ?????

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,800
JOE'S STILL IN PHYSICAL THERAPY.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,700
HE SPENT TWO WEEKS IN A BELGRADE HOSPITAL
BEFORE HE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO FLY BACK HOME.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
WE JUST WANTED A FAMILY.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,600
RIGHT. WHY SERBIA?

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,000
BACK IN COLLEGE, JOE GOT BUSTED
ON A SMALL POT CHARGE.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
NOTHING MAJOR,
JUST TYPICAL, STUPID KID STUFF.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,000
RIGHT, RIGHT -- BUT IT DISQUALIFIED YOU
FROM ADOPTION AGENCIES IN THE STATES, RIGHT?

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,700
- AND KOREA AND CHINA AND GUATEMALA.
- MM.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,000
IRINA WAS THE FIRST ONE TO TELL
US THAT IT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,200
-ALL SHE NEEDED WAS...
- MONEY.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,100
"ADMINISTRATIVE FEES" --
THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLED IT.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,900
MM-HMM.

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,700
AFTER A FEW MONTHS, WE GOT SUSPICIOUS,
SO WE FLEW OUT THERE.

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,400
WE TOLD HER WE'D GO
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,500
THAT'S WHEN SHE INTRODUCED US TO LUKA.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,600
AFTER THAT, WE GAVE IRINA
EVERYTHING SHE WANTED.

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,200
HOW MUCH MONEY DID SHE TAKE FROM YOU?

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,500
$120,000.

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,800
WE HAD TO TAKE A SECOND MORTGAGE
OUT ON THE HOUSE.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,600
WELL, WE CAN GET THE MONEY BACK.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,900
WE DON'T WANT THE MONEY.

37
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,000
ALL WE WANT IS LUKA.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,100
RIGHT.

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,600
SO IRINA LET LUKA STAY
WITH THE MORTONS FOR A WEEK.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,700
THAT'S WHEN THIS WAS TAKEN.

41
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,100
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BOY AFTERWARDS?

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,300
DON'T KNOW. A CAR CAME ALONG,
PICKED HIM UP, TOOK HIM AWAY.

43
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,700
- ARE WE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS, HUH? 
- SWIPING A KID?

44
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,800
YEAH, WELL --
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,500
WELL, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
IT WAS A LESBIAN BAR?

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,500
OKAY, LISTEN --

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,100
MONEY, JEWELS, PAINTINGS --
THOSE WE STEAL.

48
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,800
BUT A LITTLE BOY?

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,700
WE HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,600
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ISN'T GONNA HELP
BECAUSE THEY WENT OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,300
AND OVER THERE,
IT'S THE WILD WEST.

52
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,700
NO RECORDS,
NO PAPER TRAILS.

53
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,300
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO FIND ONE ORPHAN.

54
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,700
HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW
THIS KID IS AN ORPHAN?

55
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,000
SEE HIM POCKETING THOSE COOKIES?

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,600
HE'S HOARDING FOOD.

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,200
THAT BAG ON THE TABLE --
HE KEEPS HIS ESSENTIALS LIGHT AND PORTABLE.

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,300
HE KNOWS HE'S GONNA BE
TAKEN AWAY AT ANY MOMENT.

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
AND THERE, WHEN SHE GOES 
TO TOUCH HIM, HE FLINCHES.

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,700
HE'S EXPECTING...
FOR HER TO...

61
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,200
TRUST ME.
HE'S AN ORPHAN.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,100
NATE.

63
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,000
HIT IT.

64
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,200
IRINA LARENKO.
FORMER RUSSIAN MODEL.

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,100
SHE HAD A DECENT CAREER IN THE '80s.
SHE DID THE WHOLE PARIS FASHION CIRCUIT.

66
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,900
UH, SHE HAD SOME PARTS
IN SOME SMALL FILMS.

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,500
- REALLY?
- WHAT FILMS?

68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,600
SOME...FRENCH FILMS.

69
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
??
- "EMMANUELLE UNLEASHED."

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
SHE WAS TATIYANA.

71
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
YEAH, THIS IS WHEN
THEY REBOOTED THE FRANCHISE.

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,500
- THAT'S RIGHT -- EMMANUELLE AT 
THE SPACE STATION WHO RIDES THE CONTROLS.
- YEAH, YEAH.

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,300
- ANYWAY, ??
-???

74
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,800
SHE STARTED LIVING A LITTLE TOO HARD.
SHE FELL IN WITH SOME RUSSIAN MOBSTERS.

75
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,100
SHE WOUND UP GRIFTING HER WAY
THROUGH EUROPE.

76
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,300
SHE ENDED UP IN BELGRADE
A FEW YEARS AGO.

77
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,000
ALL RIGHT,WHAT'S THE ADOPTION SCAM?

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,300
OKAY, SO, YOU'RE LOOKING
TO ADOPT A KID, RIGHT?

79
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,000
YOU LOG ON TO A LEGITIMATE
ADOPTION WEBSITE.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,100
YOU FOLLOW ONE OF THE LINKS ON THE SIDE,
IT LEADS YOU TO IRINA.

81
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,100
NOW, SHE JUST SHOWS YOU A BUNCH OF PICTURES,
STRINGS YOU ALONG A LITTLE BIT,

82
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,300
AND SHE HITS YOU UP FOR SOME MONEY.

83
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,800
YEAH, IT'S JUST LIKE
THE "SPANISH PRISONER" SCAM.

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
AND THEN SHE HOOKS YOU
UNTIL SHE BLEEDS YOU DRY.

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
YEAH, BUT HOW DOES
SHE GET THE KIDS?

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,700
AFTER THE WAR,
THERE WAS, WHAT,

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,500
100,000 ORPHANS IN SERBIA.

88
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,000
SHE COULD BE GETTING THEM
FROM ANYWHERE.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
WHERE'S IRINA NOW?

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,300
WELL, SHE CLOSED HER OFFICE IN BELGRADE
AFTER THE INCIDENT WITH THE MORTONS. HOWEVER...

91
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,600
HER NAME POPPED UP
ON AN INVITATION TO A PARTY

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,900
- AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY NEXT WEEK -
- VERY EXCLUSIVE.

93
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,100
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY --

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
A LITTLE LOOK AND HOOK.

95
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,000
PACK YOUR BAGS.

96
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
WE'RE GOING TO BELGRADE.

97
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,100
HEY, CAN WE -- CAN WE
STOP OFF IN PARIS ON THE WAY?

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,700
UH...

99
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,200
MAYBE ON THE WAY BACK.

100
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
COOL.

101
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
- ????
- ??

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,800
- ???
-??

103
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,800
ANYWAY, A BAD INTERCEPTION
STOPPED THE GAME.

104
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,600
WE ENDED UP WINNING.
I MEAN, IT -- IT'S LIKE --

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,800
- EXCUSE ME.
- ???

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,500
YES. AND SHE'S WITH SOMEONE.

107
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,900
THAT'S NEVER STOPPED ME BEFORE.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,100
???

109
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,700
YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD BE EASIER
IF YOU WERE IN HERE.

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,100
WELL, WE WOULD BE IF SOPHIE WEREN'T ALREADY
OLD FRIENDS WITH THE AMBASSADOR.

111
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,700
I WOULDN'T SAY "OLD FRIENDS" EXACTLY.

112
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,100
THE UNITED STATES IS PLEASED
TO MAKE THE FIRST PAYMENT

113
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,500
FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE
TRANS-UKRAINIAN OIL PIPELINE

114
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,800
TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS,
PRINCESS MAGDA OF SLOVENIA.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I STILL HAVE THAT TIARA, THOUGH.

116
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
HARDISON, ANYTHING ON THE 
FACIAL RECOGNITION? COME ON.

117
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,200
HEY, I'M WORKING ON A LAPTOP
IN A BORROWED OFFICE.

118
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,500
YOU KNOW, JUST HURRY UP.

119
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,100
IT'S NOT SO FUN WORKING IN THE
CRAPPY COMMAND CENTER, IS IT?

120
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,600
NO, SEE, YOU'RE USUALLY OFF
DOING YOUR EUROPEAN SPY THING.

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,900
WELL, WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,100
ORANGESCU?

123
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,600
OH. I-I GOT A HIT --
FAST.

124
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,400
THAT'S WEIRD.
I GOT A FACE MATCH BUT NO NAME.

125
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,100
THIS FILE'S ALREADY
ON MY HARD DRIVE.

126
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,600
THAT'S THE GUY THAT --
THAT -- THAT'S THE GUY

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,900
- WHO PICKED UP THE KID FROM THE MORTONS.
-IT SURE IS HIM.

128
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,100
HEY, PARKER, I NEED YOU
TO LIFT HIS WALLET.

129
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,300
- WE NEED MORE INFO.
- ELIOT...

130
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,100
GET READY TO MEET IRINA.

131
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
I'll give you
your cues.

132
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,900
YOU KNOW, I HAVE PICKED UP WOMEN BEFORE,
 ALL RIGHT? LIKE YESTERDAY.

133
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,300
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
AND WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT, UM...

134
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,600
- Dagmar.
- WHO WAS IT? -- 

135
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,800
DAGMAR FROM THE CAR-RENTAL PLACE
WAS A LOVELY GIRL,

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,700
BUT LISTEN, IRINA'S A PROFESSIONAL GRIFTER.
SHE'S GONNA SEE STRAIGHT THROUGH YOUR MOVES.

137
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,400
SHE DOES THIS FOR A LIVING.

138
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,100
YOU KNOW, GETS PEOPLE
TO LIKE HER AND TRUST HER,

139
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,600
EVEN TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH HER.

140
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
SHE DOESN'T DO THIS
FOR SPORT.

141
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,200
MM. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE I KNOW.

142
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,400
Parker, have you
found him yet?

143
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,500
NO. I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LOST HIM.

144
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,100
- WELL, HELLO, BEAUTIFUL.
-fround him

145
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,100
OKAY, PARKER, DON'T PANIC.
YOU'RE JUST HAVING A LITTLE CONVERSATION.

146
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,900
AND WHO HAS COME TO SHAME
THE SPLENDOR OF BELGRADE with her beauty?

147
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,500
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- HARDISON!

148
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
HARDISON.

149
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,400
BEAUTIFUL NAME FOR A BEAUTIFUL LADY.

150
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
TELL ME, HARDISON,

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,300
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO SERBIA?

152
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,800
OH, DO MY FANGS AND CAPE FRIGHTEN YOU?

153
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,300
- HARDISON.
- HARDISON.

154
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,600
OKAY, UH, PARKER, YOU'RE --
YOU'RE AN EXCHANGE STUDENT.

155
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
ASK HIM HIS NAME.

156
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
I'M AN EXCHANGE STUDENT,
AND WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

157
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,600
NICOLAS OBROVIC, AT YOUR SERVICE.

158
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,300
THIS ONE'S ON THE HOUSE.

159
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,000
NEXT ONE'S ON YOU...

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,300
UNLESS YOU TIP ME WELL.

161
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,500
HI.

162
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,700
AMERICAN.

163
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,200
YES, MA'AM.

164
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
YOUR HAIR IS TOO LONG,

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
YOUR BOW TIE IS POORLY TIED,

166
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,000
and your eyes,
they shift to the left,

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
SO EITHER YOU'RE LYING
OR YOU'RE ABOUT TO LIE.

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,100
No, no, no, listen.
You have to demonstrate higher social value.

169
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,800
SHE NEEDS A REASON TO BE
INTERESTED IN YOU.

170
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,700
OKAY, ELIOT,
LISTEN TO ME.

171
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,800
YOU'RE RIGHT.

172
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,700
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,100
I AIN'T BIG ON FORMAL OCCASIONS.

174
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,200
I'D MUCH RATHER BE
ON MY RANCH IN TEXAS.

175
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
- YOUR RANCH IN TEXAS?
- YES, MA'AM.

176
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

177
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
THERE'S ANOTHER OILMAN TRYING
TO BE COWBOY, HUH?

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
WELL, MAYBE.

179
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
BUT I CAN'T STAND BEING
IN THE BOARDROOM, YOU KNOW?

180
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,100
THAT'S WHY I LOVE
TRAVELING THE WORLD.

181
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,600
WELL, WE ARE CERTAINLY GLAD THAT
BELGRADE MADE YOUR ITINERARY.

182
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,900
WELL, IT'S BECOMING ONE
OF MY FAVORITE STOPS.

183
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,600
OKAY, GOOD.
SHE'S FEELING HAPPY.

184
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,700
NOW ANCHOR THE EMOTION.

185
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,700
- Raise the champagne flute to your lips.
- CHEERS.

186
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Take a nice, long sip.

187
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,500
And now every time she laughs or smiles,
repeat that motion.

188
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,300
SHE'S GONNA LINK THAT TO A NICE,
 WARM FEELING. YOU CAN USE THAT LATER.

189
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,400
THAT, UH, DRINK THING...

190
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,200
YOU'VE NEVER USED THAT ON ME,
HAVE YOU?

191
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I WOULD NEVER.

192
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,800
OF COURSE NOT.

193
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,400
SO...

194
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,600
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

195
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,000
- WHERE AM I FROM?
-MM.

196
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,300
OH, WHERE AM I FROM? UH...

197
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,600
PITTSBURGH, DETROIT, ATLANTA.

198
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,500
I'M FROM
PITTSBURGH-DETROIT-ATLANTA.

199
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,200
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I MEANT PICK ONE.

200
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,900
DON'T LET IRINA GET TOO COMFORTABLE.

201
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,500
TOSS HER -- YEAH -- TOSS HER
A BACKHANDED COMPLIMENT.

202
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,700
- YOUR EYES ARE REALLY BLUE.
- THANK YOU.

203
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,900
THEY'RE ALMOST TOO BLUE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

204
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,200
HEY, YOU, UH,
MANIPULATED ME?

205
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,700
- NATE, REALLY, NOW?
-WELL...

206
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,400
NO, GIVE HER A TIME LIMIT.
TELL HER YOU CAN'T STAY LONG.

207
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,500
ALL RELATIONSHIPS
ARE ABOUT MANIPULATION.

208
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,000
OH, THAT -- NO, PARKER,
SLEEPING IS NOT A HOBBY.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
THAT'S SO CYNICAL.

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,600
PERFECT. NOW JUST STEP BACK.
YEAH, LET HER COME TO YOU.

211
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
WHY IS THAT CYNICAL, HUH?

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,100
BECAUSE I DON'T LEAVE
MY PERSONAL LIFE TO CHANCE?

213
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,200
WELL, NO, BECAUSE,
I MEAN, YOU SAY ALL --

214
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
- THAT'S NOT --
- REALLY, GUYS. SERIOUSLY?

215
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,700
COME ON, NOW, LOOK --
IF YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR
LITTLE DELIGHTFUL BANTER,

216
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,100
I GOT SOME ACTUALLY
USEFUL INFORMATION, OKAY?

217
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,900
NICOLAS OBROVIC --
ORGANIZED-CRIME TIES.

218
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,500
- SMUGGLING.
- NOW, HE WENT LEGIT FIVE YEARS AGO.

219
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,100
HE TOOK OVER A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT TAKES 
IN FAMILIES FROM THE KOSOVO WAR --

220
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,700
RELOCATIONS AND LOST RELATIVES,
THINGS LIKE THAT.

221
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,100
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. THAT EXPLAINS
HOW SHE GETS THE KIDS.

222
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,400
THIS GUY COULD LEAD US
RIGHT TO LUKA.

223
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,600
OKAY, PARKER.
TRY THIS...

224
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,500
IT'S AMAZING HOW FAR SERBIA'S COME,

225
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
BUT THE SCARS MUST STILL BE THERE.

226
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,800
I MEAN, ALL THE FAMILIES
WHO SUFFERED DURING THE WAR.

227
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,800
YES, BUT HISTORY ALWAYS
HAS ITS CASUALTIES.

228
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,500
YES, BUT THOSE FAMILIES
AND THOSE CHILDREN.

229
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,900
IT'S TRAGIC, YES.

230
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,500
BUT THE STRONG,
THE SMART, THE...

231
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,500
THE BEAUTIFUL,

232
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,700
THEY SURVIVE.

233
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,200
SMILE!

234
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
SMILE.

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,300
- WHAT'S WRONG?
-???

236
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,200
IT'S TIME TO GO.

237
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,900
NOT EVERYONE...

238
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,800
IS WORTH SAVING.

239
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,500
BORIS! BORIS!

240
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
- OH!
- WHAT'S GOING --

241
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,100
- WHAT -- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHOA.

242
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,700
BORIS!

243
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,400
I'M -- I'M GETTING A BUNCH
OF CALLS TO THE POLICE.

244
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,800
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON DOWN THERE?

245
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,000
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON --
PARKER JUST STABBED HER GUY WITH A FORK.

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,800
OHH

247
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,000
I'M GONNA LOSE IRINA.

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,200
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

249
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
MAYBE IRINA IS GONNA GO AFTER NICOLAS,
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIM.

250
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,500
UNH-UNH. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHE WOULDN'T RISK THAT.

251
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,200
NO, NO, NO. THEY'D BE PREPARED.
THEY'D HAVE A SAFE HOUSE.

252
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,900
A DEAD DROP FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS --
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.

253
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,000
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D DO.

254
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,700
OKAY, ELIOT, LISTEN UP.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

255
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,500
LISTEN, SWEETHEART, I-I-I-I APOLOGIZE.
I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

256
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,600
I HAVE A -- I HAVE
AN EARLY CALL TIME TOMORROW.

257
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
- CALL TIME?
- YEAH. YEAH. I'M, UH,

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,700
I'M HERE PRODUCING A FILM,
AMONG OTHER THINGS --

259
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,400
TRYING TO PRODUCE. THERE'S A -- 
THERE'S A LOT OF ROLES LEFT TO CAST.

260
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,500
- YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE ACTRESS.
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

261
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,400
QUITE GOOD, YOU KNOW.

262
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,800
YOU WOULDN'T --
YOU WOULDN'T WANT --

263
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,100
I MEAN, IT'S --
IT'S A REALLY SMALL ROLE.

264
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,400
THERE ARE NO SMALL ROLES.

265
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,600
- THIS IS PERFECT.
- ???

266
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,000
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO.
I'LL HAVE A CAR SENT TO THIS ADDRESS 

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,100
- IN THE MORNING THAT WILL PICK YOU UP.
- THANK YOU.

268
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,400
- OKAY, WE'LL SEE YOU.
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

269
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,100
SO, HOW DID YOU KNOW IRINA
WOULD GO FOR THE MOVIE THING?

270
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,000
A EUROPEAN GRIFTER WHO WANTS
TO BE AN ACTRESS? LUCKY GUESS.

271
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,300
- WHERE'S PARKER?
-???

272
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
 CAN'T REACH HER ON THE COMMS.?

273
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
SHE SLIPPED THE SECURITY GRID
AT THE EMBASSY.

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,500
WHERE COULD SHE BE?

275
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,100
THIS IS PARKER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
SHE COULD BE HALFWAY ACROSS EUROPE BY NOW.

276
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,600
TRUST ME --
SHE IS GONE.

277
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,900
WHO'S GONE?

278
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,700
WHAT?

279
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,000
SO, IRINA'S EXPECTING TO BE IN A MOVIE.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

280
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,900
NOW?

281
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,100
WE STEAL A MOVIE.

282
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,500
NOW, EASTERN EUROPE,
WITH ALL ITS CHEAP LABOR,

283
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,700
IS PRETTY POPULAR
WITH AMERICAN FILM PRODUCTIONS.

284
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,900
CURRENTLY THERE ARE FIVE FILMS
SHOOTING IN SERBIA,

285
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,900
ONE OF WHICH IS INDEPENDENT --
IT'S NOT TIED TO ANY U.S. STUDIO.

286
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,800
NOW, ALL THE CREW, THEY'RE LOCAL,
SO THEY'LL LISTEN TO WHOEVER'S PAYING THE BILLS.

287
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,900
SO WE JUST HAVE TO CLEAR OUT TWO PEOPLE...

288
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,700
IT'S ALL WRONG! IT'S ALL WRONG!

289
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,900
- THE DIRECTOR...
- REALLY? REALLY? ARE YOU KIDDING?

290
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,400
- LET'S TAKE A, UH, PICTURE FOR MY AGENT, PIKE.
-...AND THE PRODUCER.

291
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,600
FORTUNATELY, FILM PRODUCTIONS
ARE PRETTY FRAGILE ENTERPRISES.

292
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,800
NOW, JUST THIS MORNING THERE
WAS AN UNFORTUNATE INTERRUPTION

293
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,600
IN THE FILM PRODUCTION'S CASH FLOW.

294
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,200
WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"THE MONEY'S ALL GONE"?!

295
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,400
NO, DON'T DO ANYTHING. 
I'LL BE ON THE NEXT FLIGHT BACK TO L.A.

296
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,300
AND WHAT ABOUT THE DIRECTOR?

297
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,700
HE GOT AN OFFER HE COULDN'T REFUSE...

298
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,200
???

299
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,400
??? IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.
-????

300
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,800
OH, I --
HOW YOU SAY? -- SORRY.

301
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,200
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S FINE.

302
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,900
FINE, FINE. FINE.

303
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,400
?????

304
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,600
FORGET THE LATTE!
JUST GET ME A CAR AND MAIL ME MY LUGGAGE!

305
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,400
BUT WAIT A MINUTE --
YOU DID THE LIFT?

306
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,100
WHY WASN'T I INVOLVED?

307
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,000
BECAUSE SOMEBODY DECIDED
TO JEOPARDIZE THE MISSION

308
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,100
WHEN A CERTAIN SOMEBODY
SHISH-KEBABBED A CERTAIN MARK.

309
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,300
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.

310
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,200
SO, UH, WHAT ABOUT THE MOVIE?
WHO'S THE NEW DIRECTOR?

311
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,200
WEREWOLVES! THAT'S IT!
COME, COME, AND...

312
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,100
GREAT! CUT!

313
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,700
OKAY, ONCE AGAIN, 
WITH MORE, UH, FEELING! FEELING!

314
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
UP

315
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I'M LUCKY TO HAVE YOU
ON SUCH A SHORT NOTICE.

316
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
ZHAVALITI.
IS THAT RIGHT?

317
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,200
ZHAVALITI? THANK YOU?
SEE? YEAH? NO?

318
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,500
- WELCOME TO THE SET.
- FIRE IN THE HOLE!

319
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,400
- YEAH, IT'S EXCITING,ISN'T IT?
- YES.

320
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,300
THAT GUY'S OUR SPECIAL-EFFECTS GUY.
HE AIN'T ALL THERE.

321
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,000
WHAT? YOU'RE SHOWING ME A COUPLE OF SHIRTS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT --

322
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
- DALE? DALE?
-???

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
- ????
- WHAT -- WHAT IS THIS?

324
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,200
NOT NOW, SWEETHEART.
WHAT DID I SAY LAST TIME?

325
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
- LISTEN.IRINA LARENKO.
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

326
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,500
- THIS IS JACK LINDSEY.HE'S THE DIRECTOR.
- AH. LET ME SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

327
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,300
UH-HUH!LET ME SEE WHAT YOU GOT.
THE OTHER WAY.

328
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,200
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
WHAT DO YOU THINK? PERFECT.

329
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,500
OKAY, THE OTHER WAY.
YEAH.

330
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,400
GOOD LAUGH.
GOOD, GOOD LAUGH.OKAY.

332
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,100
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING?

333
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,200
THE MOTHER!

334
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,800
SO, UM, I-I-I WILL BE
A-A MOTHER, YES?

335
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,100
YES! YES.
VERY, VERY EXCITING PART.

336
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,700
WE JUST NEED TO GET YOU

DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE
OR WATER OR...?

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,600
COLD OR ROOM TEMPERATURE?

344
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600

345
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,900
- THANK YOU.

346
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,900
OKAY.

347
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,600
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

348
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,300
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

349
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,900
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THESE ARE REAL?

350
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,200
THIS IS WHAT HE EXPECTS ME TO DO,
FETCH SCRIPTS AND WATER?

351
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
NO. IT'S A TRUST THING.

352
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,800
HE JUST NEEDS TO KNOW THAT 
YOU'RE GONNA GO ALONG WITH THE GAME PLAN.

353
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,700
YEAH, YEAH. I GET IT --
WE'RE A TEAM.

354
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,400
A LITTLE MORE THAN A TEAM.

355
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
I'M JUST SAYING.

356
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,000
HARDISON? LET'S GO, MAN.
DO YOU HAVE IT?

357
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,600
AW, NOT YET.

358
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,800
UH, SOPHIE, SOPHIE, WE NEED THAT SCENE.
ARE YOU FINISHED WITH IT YET?

359
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,000
IT'S IN THE BOX ON THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.

360
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,300
SOPHIE. ARE YOU --
SERIOUSLY, SOPHIE.

361
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,000
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TWO-PAGE SCENE
BETWEEN IRINA AND A BOY.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,500
THAT'S STILL THE HEART OF IT.

363
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,700
"THE HEART OF IT"?
THERE'S LIKE 10 PAGES HERE!

364
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,300
YOU HAVE A STUNT.
YOU HAVE SPECIAL EFFECTS.

365
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,800
"SISTER MAGDA CROSSES
AND GETS A LOAF OF BREAD."

366
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,300
WAIT, WHO'S SISTER MAGDA?

367
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
SEE THAT COMING.

368
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,500
OF COURSE YOU NEED THE NUN!
YOU CAN'T GIVE IRINA THE DEATH SCENE.

369
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,800
WHAT? WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT -- WHAT DEATH SCENE?

370
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,500
IN THE SECOND ACT.

371
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,300
- BUT THE THING IS, YOU --
- WHAT?

372
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,800
YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH, YOU KNOW,
THE MAIN CHARACTER'S DRAMATIC NEED.

373
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,200
OTHERWISE THERE'S NO EMOTIONAL
PAYOFF IN THE RESOLUTION.

374
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,400
THIS -- THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT NATO TROOPS
BEING ATTACKED BY WEREWOLVES!

375
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,700
NO. THERE IS NO EMOTIONAL PAYOFF!

376
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,900
EXCUSE ME?!

377
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,000
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS CONVINCE
HER TO BRING LUKA TO THE SET

378
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,300
TO FINISH HER SCENE,
COMPLETE IT, AND THAT'S IT.

379
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,400
- LET'S JUST KEEP THIS SIMPLE.
- LISTEN. ALL RIGHT,

380
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,900
LOOK ??? LOOK --

384
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,900
BASH HER HEAD IN --
ELIOT.

385
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,200
INTERNET PORN --
HARDISON.

386
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,800
IF YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE OVER A MOVIE, THEN...

387
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,700
YES, AN -- AN ACTOR.

388
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,200
RIGHT. UM...

389
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,700
SOPHIE...

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,000
...ABOUT THE ACTING...

391
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,800
OH, YEAH? WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

392
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,000
YOU'RE RIGHT.
Y-YOU'RE RIGHT.

393
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,900
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA GO --
WE'RE GONNA GO WITH YOUR SCENE.

394
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,100
REALLY?! OHH!
MWAH!

395
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,400
IT'S GONNA BE --
IT'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

396
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,100
- IT CERTAINLY IS.
-I'M -- I'M -- I'M GONNA GO TO MAKEUP.

397
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,800
OKAY, EVERYBODY, TENSE UP!

398
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,400

400
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,500
THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD,
I SHALL NOT WANT.

401
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,900
???

402
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,600

404
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
YEA...

THOUGH I WALK IN THE VALLEY...

406
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,100
...OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH...

407
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,700
...I FEAR NO EVIL...

408
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,800
AND...CUT!

409
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,100
She can't act.

410
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
She can act when it's an act.

411
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,200
UNBELIEVABLE.

412
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,700
- REALLY?! REALLY?!
- YEAH, REALLY.

413
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,600
IT WAS GREAT.

420
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,200

NO. WE HAD THE PERFECT BOY.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

437
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,500
HE WAS 10 YEARS OLD,
BLOND HAIR, ALMOND EYES.

438
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
- OLD SOUL! HE WAS PERFECT!
- PLEASE DON'T CUT THE SCENE!

439
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,400
TRUST ME! I KNOW THIS BOY!

JUST TAKE IT SLOW
UNTIL SHE LEADS YOU TO LUKA.

447
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,200
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY
SENT YOU TO BABYSIT ME.

448
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,800
I'M HERE ON MY OWN.

449
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,400
HARDISON, WHAT DOES IT SAY?

450
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,900
"ORPHANAGE."

YEAH

456
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,600
WHY DOES AN ORPHANAGE
NEED ARMED SECURITY?

457
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,700
MUST BE SOME BADASS KIDS.

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,600
NO, PARKER, I DON'T --
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

474
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,600
PARKER!

475
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,100

476
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,200
SHE'S GOT LUKA,
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,500
WE'VE GOT NEW PLAYERS.

478
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,600
RECORDING AS WE SPEAK.

479
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,000
TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE.

480
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,300

00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,000
OK????

OH, THIS ISN'T GOOD.

484
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,400
THIS ISN'T JUST AN ADOPTION SCAM.

485
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,600
I KNOW.
I ALREADY CALLED NATE.

486
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,500
THESE ARE ARMS DEALERS,
AND THEY'RE USING THE ORPHANAGE FOR COVER.

487
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,800
I ALREADY CALLED NATE.

488
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,000
NOW, LOOK, WE CAN GO OVER THIS
WITH THE OTHERS BACK AT THE HOTEL.

489
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,800
WE HAVE TO BAIL.

490
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,200
NO. NO, NO, NO.
WHAT ABOUT LUKA AND THE OTHERS?

491
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
-WE CAN'T LEAVE THEM LIKE THAT.
- WHY NOT?

492
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,600
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

493
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,100
YOU THINK THIS IS THE ONLY
CRAPPY ORPHANAGE IN THIS PLACE?

494
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,600
THIS IS A COUNTRY
FULL OF ORPHANS, OKAY?

495
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
WE CAN'T SAVE THEM ALL.

496
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,300
NO, BUT WE CAN SAVE THIS ONE.

497
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,400
WE CAN --
WE CAN SAVE THIS ONE.

498
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,700
LOOK, I KNOW
GROWING UP WAS TOUGH.

499
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,400
I-I KNOW THAT YOU --
YOU GREW UP IN THE SYSTEM.

500
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,000
IT WAS -- IT WAS BAD.
I KNOW.

501
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,500
IT WAS --
IT WAS WORSE THAN BAD,

502
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,500
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL
ST PARENTS ARE MONSTERS.

503
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,600
MINE WASN'T.

504
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,400
YOU GREW UP WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

505
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,500
WE CALLED HER "NANA,"

506
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,200
BUT SHE WAS OUR FOSTER MOM.

507
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,700
SHE, UH...SHE -- 
SHE WOULD CUSS LIKE A SAILOR.

508
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,400
THE OLD GIRL WOULD TAN YOUR ASS
JUST AS SOON AS LOOK AT YOU.

509
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,300
BUT --
BUT SHE FED US, SHE BATHED US,

510
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,000
SHE PUT A ROOF OVER OUR HEAD.

511
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,800
AND, OH,SHE WOULD RAISE HELL

512
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,500
IF YOU SO MUCH AS
LOOKED AT US CROOKED.

513
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,300
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

514
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
WELL, YOU WERE LUCKY.

515
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,500
NO.
WE'LL PUT THESE KIDS IN THE SYSTEM,

516
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,700
AND ODDS ARE, THEY'RE GONNA --
THEY'RE GONNA...

517
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,400
...THEY'RE GONNA TURN OUT LIKE ME.

518
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,600
I LIKE HOW YOU TURNED OUT.

519
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,200
LET'S GO.

520
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,700
SO, DURING THE NATO BOMBING RUNS
IN THE '90s,

521
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,700
GUNRUNNERS, THEY USED TO STORE
THEIR WEAPONS IN HOSPITALS,

522
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,300
ORPHANAGES, ANYWHERE THEY KNEW
WOULDN'T BE TARGETED.

523
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,900
YEAH, SO, NOW INSTEAD OF EVADING BOMBS,
THEY'RE DUCKING THE POLICE.

524
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,200
IT'S THE SAME STRATEGY.
AND WHAT ABOUT THE ADOPTION SCAM?

525
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,200
OH, FRINGE BENEFIT.
YOU TAKE A BUILDING FILLED WITH ORPHANS,

526
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,000
A BUNCH OF KIDS NOBODY CARES ABOUT,

527
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
WHY NOT USE THEM
TO MAKE SOME EXTRA CASH?

528
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,700
NICOLAS SELLS HIS GUNS, 
AND IRINA GETS A LITTLE SIDELINE.

529
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,800
A MODERN-DAY WORKING COUPLE.

530
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,000
I RAN HUMPTY AND DUMPTY
THROUGH THE USUAL DATABASES.

531
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,400
CHECHEN SEPARATISTS.
SERIOUSLY BAD DUDES.

532
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,300
AFTER READING THEIR BIOS,
I DON'T THINK I'M EVER GONNA SLEEP AGAIN.

533
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,800
NEVER TELL A CHECHEN
HIS SISTER HAS A NICE SMILE.

534
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
TRUST ME.

535
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,100
I RAN THIS THROUGH
A TRANSLATION PROGRAM.

536
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,900
THEY'RE INSPECTING THE MERCHANDISE.
THEY'RE BRINGING THE MONEY TOMORROW.

537
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,700
WELL, NONE OF THIS
AFFECTS OUR ORIGINAL PLAN.

538
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,800
IRINA IS BRINGING LUKA
TO THE SET HERE TOMORROW.

539
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,700
SO WE GRAB HIM AND WE CLEAR OUT.

540
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,600
AND NICOLAS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
PART OF THE PICTURE.

541
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,900
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ORPHANS?

542
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,700
LISTEN, WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.

543
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,500
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT EQUIPPED.

544
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
NO, NO, NO. I ALREADY
TALKED TO PARKER ABOUT IT.

545
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,700
- AND I SAID WALK AWAY.
- YOU DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

546
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,700
WE CAN'T LEAVE THEM THERE.

547
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,200
IT IS TOO RISKY. THEY HAVE --
THEY HAVE GUNS, MANPOWER,

548
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,100
POTENTIAL HOSTAGES.

549
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,100
WHAT DO WEAVE?
WE HAVE A -- A PROP TRUCK.

550
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
THAT'S IT.

551
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,800
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE WILL GO HOME,
WE WILL FIGURE THIS THING OUT,

552
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,000
DO SOME RESEARCH,
MAKE A REAL PLAN,

553
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
AND WE WILL COME BACK.
WE'LL COME BACK.

554
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,300
BUT RIGHT NOW, THE FOCUS
HAS TO BE ON LUKA...

555
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,300
TO RESCUE LUKA.

556
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

557
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,800
HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

558
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,100
I KNOW.

559
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,500
HE IS PERFECT.

560
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,300
GONNA BE GREAT. OKAY.

561
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,400
???

562
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SCENE.

563
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,300
 COME ALONG. ALL RIGHT.

564
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,400
- NOW, YOU'RE RUNNING THROUGH THESE BUSHES.
- YOU HEAR, "AHHH."

565
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,900
NOW, THESE -- THESE SOLDIERS,
THEY'RE YOUR ESCORTS,

566
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,600
ONLY THEY CAN'T PROTECT YOU
FROM THE WEREWOLVES.

567
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
AND THEY ALL DIE, YES?

568
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,700
YES, THEY ALL DIE,
WHICH IS WHY YOU RUN --

569
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,400
YOU MOVE THROUGH HERE, AND YOU
RUN INTO THE CABIN, OKAY?

570
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
YOU COME IN HERE AND EVERYTHING,

571
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
'CAUSE YOU WANT TO --
YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR SON.

572
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU GO BACK OUT.

573
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
YOU -- YOU -- YOU FIGHT THE
WEREWOLVES WHILE HE'S IN THERE.

574
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,600
OKAY, ONE SEC. YOU GOT THAT? GOOD.
OKAY, MORE BLOOD --

575
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,000
NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
MORE BLOOD.

576
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,800
NO, NO, I MEAN, IT'S JUST
CORN SYRUP AND FOOD DYE.

577
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,500
WHY ARE YOU SKIMPING?!

578
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,300
MORE! MORE! MORE! MORE!
BLOOD! BLOOD! MORE!

579
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,600
- THAT'S WHAT AUDIENCES WANT.
- TO SEE ME DIE?

580
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,300
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

581
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,000
OKAY, LET'S GO BACK TO ONE.

582
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,800
BACK TO ONE.

583
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,400
OKAY, AND...ACTION!

584
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,400
THE WEREWOLVES!
AAH!

585
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,300
I CAN DO BETTER.
WE GO AGAIN?

586
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,700
HELLO?

587
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,400
MR. DIRECTOR?

588
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,900
WHAT'S GOING ON?

589
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,900
OKAY, LET'S GO.

590
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,100
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKEY

591
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,500
DO YOU UNDERSTAND? 

592
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,400
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP.

593
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,600
HI, LUKA.

594
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,400
DO YOU REMEMBER US?

595
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,600
- THANK YOU

00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,500
COME ON

597
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,500
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I HAD MY DOUBTS AT FIRST,

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,200
THIS FEELS PRETTY GOOD.

YEAH, WE'LL, UH, WE'LL
COME BACK FOR THE OTHERS.

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,000
WHERE'S PARKER?

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,100
- I THOUGHT SHE WAS WITH YOU.
- NO.

602
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,500
UH, SHE'S NOT WEARING HER EAR BUD.

603
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,900

00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,400
IT'S -- IT'S --
IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL.

605
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,100
REMEMBER WHEN I LOST HER AT THE PARTY?

606
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,200
I PUT A GPS TRACKER IN HER SHOES.

607
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,400
SHE'S HEADED BACK TOWARDS THE ORPHANAGE.

608
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,100
- NO MORE STALLING.
- LET'S FINISH THIS.

???HURRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE
ARMED GUARDS AT THIS DOOR.

THESE ARE THE GUNS YOU SOLD ME?

WHERE IS MY MONEY?

638
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,100
THEY'RE ALL ASLEEP.

639
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,700
WE'LL REPLACE
THIS LICENSE PLATE, NATE,

640
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,300
SO WE CAN GET A CLEAN SHOT

OKAY, WHEN WE CROSS OVER,
WE'RE GONNA TURN THE KIDS OVER

CALL THE FBI.

651
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,600
I THINK I FOUND
WHO TOOK OUR MONEY.

652
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,200
SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.
TAKING A PRODUCER'S CUT.

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
OH, NATE, YOU DID --

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,100
MY DEATH SCENE FOR MY REEL?

655
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,900

00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,800
WE ARE DEFINITELY,
DEFINITELY STOPPING IN PARIS.

658
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,300
WAY TO GO.
NO FILM IN THE CAMERA?

659
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,400
REALLY? SERIOUSLY?

660
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,400
HEY, HOW DID YOU KNOW
I'D BE AT THE ORPHANAGE?

661
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
THANK HARDISON FOR THAT.

662
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,100
YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE
GOTTEN KILLED.

663
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,200
DID -- DID YOU EVEN HAVE
AN EXIT STRATEGY?

664
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,800
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK
THAT FAR AHEAD.

665
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,900
- YOU DON'T WORK ALONE ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
- I KNOW.

666
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
WE'RE A TEAM.

667
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,500
WE'RE A LITTLE MORE THAN A TEAM.

668
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,900
HEY, NATE.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

669
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,200
