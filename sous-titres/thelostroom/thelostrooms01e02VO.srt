1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:02,282
<i>Previously on</i> The Lost Room...

2
00:00:02,283 --> 00:00:03,049
What's this?

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,472
<i>Joe Miller has just found a key
to a room unlike any other.</i>

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,271
What if it resets while we're in there?

5
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:09,889
As long as we have the key, we're safe.

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,833
<i>A room that can take you
around the world</i>

7
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:14,290
- We can go anywhere?
- Anywhere with a door I think.

8
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,737
<i>and gives power to everything inside.</i>

9
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:18,163
It's an object.

10
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:19,808
One of many.

11
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,757
- How many are there?
- About a hundred at least.

12
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:22,986
You can't break an object.

13
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:26,474
- And do they all...
- They do weird stuff.

14
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:29,458
Some people think
that these things are...

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,234
a way to communicate with God.

16
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:33,757
Since you've found the key,
has your life gotten better

17
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:34,678
or worse?

18
00:00:34,843 --> 00:00:36,313
People are coming for you, Joe.

19
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:39,647
They won't mind killing you, or your family
to get their hands on these objects.

20
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:42,112
- Anna!!
- Daddy!

21
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:43,845
My daughter disappeared
inside that room.

22
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:45,849
Is there an object that
can bring her back?

23
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,407
Yes, the prime object.

24
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:48,811
Give me the key, Joe.

25
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,398
Whose side are you on?

26
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,830
Detective Joe Miller
just shot his partner.

27
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:58,325
Hello?

28
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:01,605
Daddy!
Daddy, help me, please!

29
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,080
Bingo.

30
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:53,793
Glad to see me?

31
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,408
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Sorry.

32
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:00,712
Look,

33
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,547
you called me.

34
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:05,048
You need the Legion's help.

35
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:06,234
I'm helping you.

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,840
How do I know
you're going to help me?

37
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,738
Well, I'm not the one
who killed my partner.

38
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:11,823
I didn't kill Lou.

39
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,068
Look at me.

40
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:16,861
I didn't.

41
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:20,005
Okay.

42
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:31,755
Here, some fake ID's, a couple of credit
cards, this should last for a while.

43
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:33,896
"Joe Doorman?"

44
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:35,825
Hilarious.

45
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:42,365
I have two objects here.

46
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,496
It's your nail file
and the pen.

47
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:46,474
Get rid of them.
Do whatever you guys do.

48
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,443
Does this mean
you're gonna join us?

49
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,906
Just tell me what you know
about the prime object.

50
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,440
Most people think it's a myth.

51
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,118
Those who don't?

52
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,225
End up dead or crazy
looking for it. Why?

53
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:02,012
I need it to find my daughter.

54
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:05,349
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

55
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:07,636
Joe!

56
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:16,057
Next.

57
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:21,247
And my photos.

58
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:28,810
What's the last name?

59
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:30,218
Stritzke.

60
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:32,262
S.T.R.I.T.Z.K.E.

61
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:36,729
Oh,

62
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,311
Mr. Stritzke's here.

63
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:41,621
Did you ever here of digital?

64
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,492
12 bucks.

65
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,046
Hey!

66
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:57,911
What's going on?

67
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,389
Next time,

68
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:04,971
have a little couth, huh?

69
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:52,219
Great.

70
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:18,946
Damn it!

71
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,808
- He must've ditched the key.
- We'll go back, check the alley again.

72
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:31,794
Indestructible.

73
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:33,357
No joke.

74
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:42,425
Marty.

75
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,450
- Detective Lee.
- Hi.

76
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:47,090
Look, I'm sorry to make you
go through this again,

77
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,631
but I'm still a little confused

78
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:50,791
about the order of events
around Lou's murder.

79
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,605
I've already spoken
to internal affairs.

80
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,424
I know. Bear with me.

81
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:56,226
I just have some
questions of my own.

82
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:57,874
Who fired the first shot?

83
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,804
You're not on this case
officially, are you?

84
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,621
No, no, I just want
to understand.

85
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,798
I'm sorry, Lee.
It's been a terrible week.

86
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:08,053
Helen hasn't been sleeping,
and quite frankly neither have I.

87
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:09,851
If you've read the report,

88
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,673
it should all add up.
The crime scene matches my description.

89
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,885
Forensically...yes.

90
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:19,223
I'm really tired.

91
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:44,278
- You have to eat, hon.
- I can't.

92
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,079
It's this house.

93
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,648
I can't stay in this
house anymore, Marty.

94
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,467
Lou was murdered in the next room.

95
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:54,800
- Helen, please.
- You saw joe pull the trigger.

96
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,230
He almost killed you.

97
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,933
Helen, you have no idea
what you're talking about!

98
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:05,120
I'm sorry, hon.

99
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:07,888
It's just...

100
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:10,151
What?

101
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:15,135
What?

102
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,392
Don't get the phone.

103
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:20,199
Don't get the phone!

104
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,804
What do you mean I have no idea?
Martin!

105
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:23,862
I have to take it.

106
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,073
Hello.

107
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:31,336
<i>Have you found us
an object, dr. Ruber?

108
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:33,128
Uh, I'm trying. I...

109
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:36,010
<i>You had a chance to take the key.
Did you take it?

110
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,899
It got away from me.

111
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,286
<i>Bring us an object and you'll be
welcomed into the Order with open arms.

112
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,672
<i>Do you understand?

113
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:43,779
Perfectly.

114
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:46,042
<i>Look for Kang. K-A-N-G.

115
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:48,278
Kang.

116
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:51,990
Martin, who was that?

117
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:55,117
Martin!

118
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,250
Detective Miller.

119
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,112
I should thank you
for exposing my...

120
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:20,976
security weaknesses.

121
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,314
I won't.

122
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,772
Bit of a sore loser.

123
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:26,395
Come on in.

124
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:34,008
Where's the key?

125
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,092
You can't have it.

126
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,649
But it's mine.

127
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,601
I paid for it.

128
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,322
I gave someone money.
It's mine.

129
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:44,910
It was stolen from me.

130
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:46,555
That's a crime, detective.

131
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,394
Or are you so far gone you
no longer care about the law?

132
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:54,387
I guess not.
You broke into my house. Stole my clock.

133
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:56,712
You mind if I sit down?

134
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,709
Please.

135
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,238
My daughter went inside that room.

136
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,796
The motel room.

137
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:12,902
And she's gone.

138
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:16,215
So I need the key to get her back.

139
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:23,477
How on Earth would you do that?

140
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,373
The prime object.

141
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:29,751
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find it.

142
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:34,204
How about I...

143
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,485
give you some advice instead?

144
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,333
Walk away.

145
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:46,159
You have no idea what you're getting
yourself into. You certainly don't know

146
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:50,339
just how deep this well goes.
And that you will never

147
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,392
climb out.

148
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,450
Unless you just walk away.

149
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,378
You done?

150
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,169
You've done me wrong, detective Miller.

151
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:07,714
It's just that simple.

152
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:12,278
Men and women have
died doing me wrong.

153
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:13,682
You're not getting the key.

154
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:15,546
You can lose all you ever wanted.

155
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,323
I have nothing to lose.

156
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:25,001
Take the coat. Let him go.

157
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,767
We have a lot in common, detective.

158
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:34,434
I could have helped you,

159
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,868
Sorry about your daughter.

160
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,914
I really am.

161
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:49,986
Follow him?

162
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:51,171
No.

163
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,057
It's up to him now.

164
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:27,039
Thanks buddy.

165
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:53,881
Mr. Kreutzfeld?

166
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:55,131
He's back.

167
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:06,649
And bearing gifts.

168
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:07,899
The clock returns.

169
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:12,528
Thank you.

170
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:14,678
Maybe I can trust you after all.

171
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:16,257
The key stays with me

172
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:17,420
for now.

173
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:21,161
Why don't you tell me what
you know about the prime object?

174
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:22,664
Can we start over?

175
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:26,480
As long as it don't begin with
you shooting me in the back, yeah.

176
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,236
Fair enough.

177
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:31,175
- First name's Joe. Can I call you that?
- That's my name.

178
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:32,967
Mine's Karl.

179
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,740
Joe, how much do you know
about the objects, their history?

180
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,574
Not a lot.

181
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:42,728
First known date of existence
is May 4th, 1961,

182
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:45,756
no one really knows how
or why they came to be.

183
00:14:45,757 --> 00:14:49,200
What we do know is that people
have been fighting over them ever since.

184
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:53,363
In the beginning,
there was one cabal. The collectors.

185
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:56,149
Started gathering objects

186
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,781
before anyone else
knew what was going on.

187
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:03,651
Within five years,
they had gathered almost all of them.

188
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,547
Damn near 100.

189
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:10,364
What happened then?

190
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:14,291
Well, they annihilated themselves,
didn't they?

191
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:19,546
Most of them were killed.
The rest simply went insane.

192
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,025
But a few of the surviving

193
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,504
disciples thought it best
to gather the most

194
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:27,400
important objects and
hide them in a vault.

195
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,954
I've spent a considerable
amount of time

196
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:33,959
and a ridiculous sum of money
trying to find this vault.

197
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,162
I have no idea where it is,
but what I do know

198
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,729
is that in order to get to it...

199
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:41,923
- You need the key.
- Yes.

200
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:46,859
No offense, Karl.

201
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:49,974
I just want to find my daughter.

202
00:15:51,553 --> 00:15:52,716
Yes, of course.

203
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:56,774
The prime object is what you need.

204
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,012
If it exists, it's inside the vault.

205
00:16:00,415 --> 00:16:03,377
I have my own object I need
from the vault. The glass eye.

206
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,295
They say it can repair all flesh.

207
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:08,993
And what do you want it for?

208
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:18,383
This handsome young man
is my son Isaac.

209
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:21,806
Hey, buddy.

210
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,824
Fell asleep watching the movie?

211
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,369
Yeah. Say hello to Joe.

212
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:27,488
Hi, Joe.

213
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:29,309
Hello, Isaac.

214
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:32,687
I was telling him about
our plans to cure you.

215
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:35,298
- What's the name of your disease?
- Leukemia.

216
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,994
That's the one, huh?

217
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:40,548
Go back to sleep, tough guy.

218
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:47,238
Perhaps now you see why I'm so...

219
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:48,752
desperate

220
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,310
and willing

221
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,635
to do whatever it takes.

222
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:56,211
I too just want to save my child.

223
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:01,454
Maybe we can help each other.

224
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:08,474
The last possible surviving
member of the collectors

225
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:10,206
is a woman named
Barbara Stritzke.

226
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:13,540
She's nearly impossible
to find or to kill

227
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:16,743
because she has an
almost unbeatable object,

228
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:17,884
the comb.

229
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,026
Oh, no! Oh, shoot!

230
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,950
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did I scratch it?

231
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,260
Oh, who can tell?

232
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:36,121
I might have scratched it. Let me see if I
can give you something for the scratch.

233
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:07,337
<i>Need your help.
Where are you?

234
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:23,658
I'll be back.

235
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,707
Jennifer Bloom.

236
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,054
What do you want, Joe?

237
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:41,396
Well, I'm looking for somebody,
and I thought you could help me.

238
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,864
But... am I interrupting something?

239
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,927
No, forget it.
What are you looking for?

240
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,683
I'm trying to find a woman
named Barbara Stritzke.

241
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,816
So now you need my help?

242
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,432
You and Kreutzfeld.
What a pair.

243
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,254
He's all right for a rich guy.

244
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:04,636
Under different circumstances,
we could be friends.

245
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:07,430
Kreutzfeld used to be on our side.

246
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:08,812
He was Legion.

247
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:12,981
Quit a few years ago.
Started buying up objects like crazy.

248
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:16,162
He paid my partner 2 million dollars

249
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:18,488
to betray the Legion
and steal the key.

250
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,668
You really think you can
trust a man like that?

251
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:22,940
His kid is dying.

252
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:26,822
My daughter vanished inside that room.
I'm hoping we can help each other.

253
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:28,578
Oh, don't be a sucker, Joe.

254
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:32,987
Hey, I will try every means necessary
to get my daughter back, every means.

255
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:37,561
All right.

256
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,312
I will help you find Barbara Stritzke.

257
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:44,099
But afterwards,

258
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:46,468
the Legion gets the comb.

259
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,364
All right, deal.

260
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:52,173
What does the comb do?

261
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,598
It stops time.

262
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:55,661
Wait here.

263
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:11,499
- Arjun Mehta. How may I help you?
- Look out your window.

264
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:15,754
<i>I've got Joe Miller in the car
and he has the key.

265
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:16,874
You brought him here?

266
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:18,431
<i>He doesn't know.

267
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:20,252
<i>I can take the key now

268
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:21,663
<i>with your say so.

269
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:27,937
He's more valuable if
we recruit him to our side.

270
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,714
He won't join.

271
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,807
<i>He thinks he can bring back
his daughter with the right objects.

272
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:35,111
We all think we can undo
things in the beginning.

273
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:36,208
Remember?

274
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:39,881
<i>Well, if we don't act now,

275
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:42,536
it could fall into Kreutzfeld's hands.

276
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:45,124
Stay close to him.
Earn his trust.

277
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,162
Show him we're trying to help.
And, Jennifer...

278
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:53,953
Give him the Stritzke info.
But stay with him.

279
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:07,436
Well, I've got good news and bad news.

280
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:10,617
The good news is
I have a lead on Barbara Stritzke.

281
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,955
She's in Michigan.

282
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,443
And what's the bad news?

283
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:16,649
It's Order territory.

284
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,382
Badly cabal to mess with...

285
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:30,778
<i>Suzie Kang. Cash only. Paid upfront

286
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:37,732
<i>30124 Eastwick.

287
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,332
I'm sorry, hon.

288
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,270
Excuse me.

289
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:11,144
Excuse me. Are you Suzie Kang?

290
00:22:18,143 --> 00:22:19,832
- Do I know you?
- No.

291
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:21,873
My name's Martin Ruber.

292
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:23,452
I'm looking for an object.

293
00:22:23,716 --> 00:22:24,571
Get lost.

294
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:27,994
I have cash.

295
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,099
What are you looking for?

296
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,470
Something... easy.

297
00:22:32,777 --> 00:22:34,071
You know, something close.

298
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:35,804
5000.

299
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:40,195
5000 dollars.

300
00:23:03,186 --> 00:23:04,327
Your lucky day.

301
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:06,191
Guy in Bloomfield's a mechanic.

302
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,759
So he posts a query on
some motorhead board

303
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,627
asking if anyone knows
why a pair of glasses

304
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:13,536
would prevent a car from starting.

305
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:16,892
- I don't get it.
- The glasses inhibit combustion.

306
00:23:29,594 --> 00:23:30,757
Do you have an object?

307
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:31,722
No,

308
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:32,770
I just track 'em.

309
00:23:33,164 --> 00:23:34,042
Never touch 'em.

310
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:35,972
Those things'll kill you.

311
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,066
Thanks.

312
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,774
Newbies. You gotta love 'em.

313
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:46,790
Barbara always leaves a key

314
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,000
up there in the frog.

315
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:50,128
- When will she be back?
- From the dead?

316
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,090
- Well, how about never?
- Here. I'll make it...

317
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,654
Barbara's nephew Harold
is living here now.

318
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:58,425
He's let this place go
to hell in a hand basket.

319
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,882
- I hardly ever see him.
- Well, we'll be just a minute.

320
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:04,085
Okay. Well, I'll be right
here when you come out.

321
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:04,700
Okay!

322
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:24,816
Guess Barbara was a good shot.

323
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:28,503
No wonder the Order
never messed with her.

324
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,927
And it looks like nephew
Harold's a Peeping Tom.

325
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,612
Oh, my God.

326
00:24:59,237 --> 00:25:01,145
I'm gonna go check the
women's locker room.

327
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,223
Harold!

328
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,715
Harold Stritzke!

329
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,795
<i>Oh my God! Come on!
What are you doing?

330
00:25:52,864 --> 00:25:53,479
Harold,

331
00:25:53,873 --> 00:25:56,484
I need your help.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

332
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:58,436
Go away!

333
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:14,800
Damn it!

334
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:27,260
<i>Leave me alone!

335
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,354
<i>You can't have it!

336
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:26,301
<i>- Hey you two, take it outside
- Pick up, pick up.

337
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:49,138
You're a tough man to catch, Harold.

338
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:55,787
Holy crap!

339
00:28:56,511 --> 00:28:58,002
This is the room, ain't it?

340
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:00,811
What are you gonna do to me?

341
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:02,346
Nothing. Just calm down.

342
00:29:03,838 --> 00:29:07,129
- What happens if I open this door?
- Without the key, you'll die instantly.

343
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:11,517
Really?

344
00:29:11,846 --> 00:29:12,592
Yeah.

345
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:23,878
You with the Order?

346
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,090
No, don't get
paranoid on me, Harold.

347
00:29:30,043 --> 00:29:31,645
Paranoid. Ha!

348
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:34,255
Like nobody's trying
to get my comb, right?

349
00:29:34,286 --> 00:29:36,985
And nobody's trying
to shoot me in the back.

350
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:40,692
Paranoid! I'd have been shot times
by now if I didn't have the comb.

351
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:44,476
If you didn't have the comb,
nobody would shoot at you.

352
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,859
Yeah, well, that's just
your opinion, buddy.

353
00:29:49,892 --> 00:29:52,323
You've got an object.
I don't see you giving it up.

354
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:57,175
My daughter disappeared
inside this room,

355
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:59,430
so I'm keeping the key
until I can get her back.

356
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:03,186
She disappeared?

357
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:04,491
Yeah.

358
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,022
No fooling.

359
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,005
Yeah, no fooling.
So once I get her back,

360
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:10,728
they can shoot the objects
to the moon for all I care.

361
00:30:13,032 --> 00:30:14,831
What do you know
about the prime object?

362
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:15,971
The what?

363
00:30:15,972 --> 00:30:18,276
The prime object, the one
that controls all the others.

364
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:21,095
Your aunt barbara was a collector.
She must've known about it.

365
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:23,124
Well, I don't know.
She never said.

366
00:30:25,844 --> 00:30:28,016
You know, don't bother.
Objects don't work in here.

367
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:31,043
Yeah, right.

368
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,983
All right,
make sure you try all of them.

369
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:35,913
Did you get that one there?

370
00:30:43,438 --> 00:30:45,632
It's gonna be ok.
I'm just gonna reset the room.

371
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:53,770
No! Where'd it go?!

372
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:55,229
Where did it go?!

373
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,810
Where's the comb?!

374
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,334
Harold, Harold, Harold.

375
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,848
Calm.

376
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:08,470
Oh, my God!

377
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:11,871
Harold, I need you to
teach me how to use that comb.

378
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,758
How do I know when it works?

379
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:21,061
Well, it'll be pretty ob...

380
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:37,373
... obvious.

381
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:39,567
Oh, look, you did it!

382
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:41,848
You okay?

383
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:43,907
I'm a little dizzy.

384
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:45,882
Yeah, it takes some
getting used to, huh?

385
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,469
You try doing that three, four times in
a row, you're gonna puke your guts out.

386
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:51,377
You mean you always feels like this?

387
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:52,759
Wait, you do that every time?

388
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,736
Oh, non, you gotta stop just before you
snap back into it, okay?

389
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:57,155
- You stop, okay?
- Yeah.

390
00:31:57,216 --> 00:32:00,200
And then also, these little buddies.
Motion sickness pills.

391
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:01,801
Can't go anywhere without those.

392
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:03,894
Take one. Take two.

393
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:04,509
I'm good.

394
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,110
So it just lasts for a few seconds?

395
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,811
Yeah, ten seconds tops.

396
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:09,182
Yeah, you gotta use it carefully.

397
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:11,946
Hiding spots are a plus,
to let you catch your breath, you know?

398
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:14,930
Hey, you want to see something?
You want to try again? Watch this.

399
00:32:14,986 --> 00:32:18,287
Try to take that. I bet you can't do it.
You can't do it. Go on. Go on, try.

400
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,163
You can't do it. Come on.

401
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:36,505
Butterfingers! You see?

402
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:39,159
Everything's frozen.
It's like you can't open doors even.

403
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,002
You just gotta move and hide.

404
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:42,329
Move and hide, that's it.

405
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,281
That's about all you can do, really.

406
00:32:46,804 --> 00:32:48,120
Hey, here. Thanks.

407
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:49,810
You're giving it back to me?

408
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,038
You gonna run away?

409
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:52,969
No.

410
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,264
All right then.

411
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:57,664
Trust me, Harold. I don't want the comb.
I just want your help.

412
00:32:59,662 --> 00:33:00,693
You promise

413
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,338
you won't take my comb?

414
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:04,642
It's all I got.

415
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:08,415
I promise.

416
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:11,228
Thanks, buddy.

417
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,118
- Just a phone.
- Okay, yeah.

418
00:33:17,282 --> 00:33:18,401
<i>Just a phone.

419
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:20,595
Oh, great.

420
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:23,096
Forget something?

421
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:25,839
Yeah, listen, I'm sorry about that.
But I'm with our guy.

422
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,181
You're kidding me.

423
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:28,388
With the comb?

424
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:29,463
Where are you?

425
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:30,582
Kansas.

426
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:32,863
Well, bring him back.

427
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,254
I can't do that.
I need some more time.

428
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:37,119
We had a deal, Joe.

429
00:33:37,272 --> 00:33:40,508
Listen, I said you could keep it.
I didn't say i'd steal it for you.

430
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,840
Jennifer, I can't do it.
The comb is all he's got.

431
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:46,902
You messed up, Joe.

432
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,339
- She's in Michigan. We got her.
- Stay on her.

433
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:14,707
Who's that, your girlfriend?

434
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:17,209
More like the ex-girlfriend I never had.

435
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:20,587
I got some of those.

436
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:24,843
Harold, you gotta think. Is there anything
that your aunt may have left behind?

437
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:26,773
A notebook, a map, anything.

438
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:29,559
No.

439
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,529
Oh. Wait!
She did leave something.

440
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:35,943
In the woods.

441
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:13,281
283,

442
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:14,728
Gotcha.

443
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:40,768
Who the hell are you?

444
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:43,905
I understand that
you found my glasses.

445
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,026
Your glasses?

446
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:47,079
Yes.

447
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:50,611
Every time I wear them,
my car won't start.

448
00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:55,212
That's just too bad, cause...
I decided not to sell them.

449
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:57,999
Whatever you heard was a mistake.
You understand me...

450
00:35:58,876 --> 00:35:59,820
dork?

451
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,724
<i>Oh! Oh, God!

452
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,445
<i>Help me!

453
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:45,289
<i>Somebody help me!

454
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:33,472
Where's she gone?

455
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,170
It's been a while. Sorry.

456
00:37:36,763 --> 00:37:38,342
I know it's out here somewhere.

457
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:40,295
Overgrown.

458
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:42,620
Oh, there she is.

459
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:43,805
Deer hut.

460
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:46,591
My aunt used to take
me hunting out here.

461
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:48,895
Sounds like your aunt
was a sweet lady, Harold.

462
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,295
Yeah, she sure was.

463
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:53,301
Oh, God.

464
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:54,749
Sorry about the smell.

465
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:56,395
It's been a while.

466
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:02,933
Damn.

467
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,110
Ah, still here.

468
00:38:09,843 --> 00:38:11,839
She asked me to hide it until...

469
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:13,682
until it was time.

470
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:16,150
- Time for what?
- I don't know.

471
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:18,344
Maybe until you came looking for them.

472
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:20,494
- Can I took a look at them?
- Sure.

473
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:40,588
"Gallup."

474
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:42,453
Like a horse.

475
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,195
No, like New Mexico.

476
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,321
Harold, do you have
a lighter or some matches?

477
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:49,736
Yeah, I think so.

478
00:38:51,085 --> 00:38:51,875
<i>Let's see.

479
00:38:55,495 --> 00:38:56,197
Yeah.

480
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,422
Thank you.

481
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,195
What are you doing?

482
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:11,280
It's an object.

483
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:12,541
No.

484
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,382
Is that the prime object? The thing...

485
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:19,089
I don't know, Harold, but thank you.
Can I keep these polaroids?

486
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,295
Sure.

487
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:23,345
You gonna keep the comb too?

488
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:24,705
Tell him, Joe.

489
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:28,237
He promised the comb to the Legion.

490
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:29,202
No!

491
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,067
- No... no.
- Joe.

492
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,716
I'm not gonna take the comb.

493
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,217
- He's using you, Harold.
- Wait a minute.

494
00:39:38,782 --> 00:39:40,822
Harold, easy, easy! Look at me!

495
00:39:40,954 --> 00:39:41,941
Give me the comb.

496
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,718
Who's shooting? How many?

497
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:47,162
There's four of them.
We're being flanked.

498
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:49,333
- It's the Order!
- Stay down!

499
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:51,483
I will bring it back.
Take this.

500
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:54,796
Oh, God!

501
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:25,098
Watch out! He's got the comb!

502
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,025
- There he is!
- You go straight. I'll go around.

503
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,641
Don't shoot!

504
00:41:38,941 --> 00:41:40,059
Here. You want that?

505
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:44,053
You gonna be all right?

506
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:46,356
I guess so.

507
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:49,713
I'm gonna get a doctor to take
a look at it though, just in case.

508
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:56,742
No.

509
00:41:57,324 --> 00:41:58,816
You keep it.

510
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:00,637
I don't want it anymore.

511
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:01,383
You sure?

512
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:03,840
I'm sick of people taking pot shots.

513
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:06,231
Keep it.

514
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,951
Good luck!

515
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:25,141
You okay?

516
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:27,630
No.

517
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:33,061
I never killed anyone before.

518
00:42:57,914 --> 00:42:59,713
I've brought you an object.

519
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,534
All right.

520
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:20,727
You're in.

521
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,647
Welcome to the Order, Martin Ruber.

522
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:37,883
It's all right.
You're not in hell anymore.

523
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:41,064
- Wally. Come here.
- What? What I do?

524
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:47,952
You know, it's really no fun for me
if you keep bringing them back.

525
00:43:47,953 --> 00:43:48,304
Yeah.

526
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:49,511
Listen...

527
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:51,397
You recognize these?

528
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:54,003
This is an object.

529
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:56,812
What is this? What's in Gallup?

530
00:43:58,172 --> 00:43:59,466
I give up. What?

531
00:44:00,168 --> 00:44:00,914
Don't lie to me.

532
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:03,686
This says Gallup.
Your bus ticket takes you to Gallup.

533
00:44:03,687 --> 00:44:07,131
It's not really Gallup technically.
It's just outside Gallup.

534
00:44:07,132 --> 00:44:08,403
Yeah, I know. I was just there.

535
00:44:08,404 --> 00:44:11,012
- I want to understand this.
- You don't want to know, Joe.

536
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:13,184
If I show you what's there,
there's no going back.

537
00:44:13,185 --> 00:44:14,940
It won't bring your daughter home.

538
00:44:15,938 --> 00:44:17,737
It will make you crazy.

539
00:44:20,317 --> 00:44:21,679
I don't have a choice, Wally.

540
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:24,349
I have to go. Now show me.

541
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:26,386
Come on!

542
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:28,971
Remember, you asked for this.

543
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:50,444
All right. So why here?

544
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:52,343
Why the middle of nowhere?

545
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:54,054
It's not the middle of nowhere.

546
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:55,918
It's the middle of everywhere.

547
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:56,796
Everything.

548
00:44:57,242 --> 00:44:58,119
Come on.

549
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:46,362
You feel that, Joe?

550
00:45:47,459 --> 00:45:48,051
Feel what?

551
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:49,214
That.

552
00:45:50,004 --> 00:45:53,075
Like when the objects start
to get close together. That...

553
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:55,356
sick feeling. Like a...

554
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:57,375
vibration almost in here.

555
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,613
I've been feeling that for a while now.
I thought it was just nerves.

556
00:46:00,614 --> 00:46:04,006
It's the motel. All the objects.
The key, the room, everything,

557
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:06,309
they all came from this place.

558
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:08,591
You knew this was here the whole time?

559
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:10,192
It's a bad place.

560
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:13,636
What else don't I know?

561
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,502
The event

562
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:24,275
happened on may 4th, 1961.

563
00:46:26,294 --> 00:46:27,808
1:20 pm.

564
00:46:28,597 --> 00:46:29,124
The event?

565
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:31,581
Whatever created these objects.

566
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:32,717
See,

567
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:35,832
the objects want
to be put back together.

568
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:38,059
You think it was an accident, us meeting?

569
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,406
You think finding
the polaroid was an accident?

570
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:45,265
I may have shown you the way,
but the objects brought you here.

571
00:46:58,738 --> 00:47:00,691
- Where's room 10?
- There is no room.

572
00:47:01,414 --> 00:47:02,884
Never existed.

573
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:08,061
At least not after may 4th, 1961.

574
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:46,036
You know what that is?

575
00:47:46,935 --> 00:47:49,129
Object chart. I've seen one before.

576
00:48:07,414 --> 00:48:10,244
Are... you... him?

577
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:41,694
Martin Ruber...

578
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:42,396
Yes.

579
00:48:43,076 --> 00:48:45,642
Do you believe in
the reunification of God?

580
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:48,296
Do you believe in the truth,

581
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:49,919
the Order,

582
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:51,521
the new religion?

583
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:53,166
Yes.

584
00:48:55,337 --> 00:48:57,400
Do you reject your former life?

585
00:48:58,474 --> 00:49:00,142
Do you give yourself

586
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:01,326
to the Order?

587
00:49:03,146 --> 00:49:04,100
Yes.

588
00:49:26,558 --> 00:49:27,698
Then pray.

589
00:49:50,712 --> 00:49:52,818
Pray to this object.

590
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:55,231
What is it?

591
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,640
It's a piece of God.

592
00:50:00,286 --> 00:50:02,128
Like every other object.

593
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:05,551
And I want you to pray to it.

594
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:19,197
If we can reunite all the objects,

595
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:23,102
we can restore the mind of God.

596
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:25,779
We can communicate

597
00:50:26,152 --> 00:50:27,073
with God

598
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:29,682
for the first time in human history.

599
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:35,276
- Do you believe that, Martin?
- Yes. Yes, I believe.

600
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:40,936
Then open your eyes

601
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,350
and embrace the Order.

602
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:54,210
Stupid.

603
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:56,053
Arrogant.

604
00:50:58,072 --> 00:51:00,595
You live only because
I was once like you.

605
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,058
But you will learn,

606
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,308
Martin.

607
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,889
Thank me for this mercy.

608
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,194
Thank you.

609
00:52:17,574 --> 00:52:19,329
The motel room key

610
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:23,717
is the most important object
to the Order right now.

611
00:52:26,086 --> 00:52:28,785
Margaret, I want your group
to find Joe Miller

612
00:52:29,136 --> 00:52:30,276
and take the key.

613
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:33,041
We can't have another
screw up like Michigan.

614
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,806
Ray Korey's group in New York

615
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:37,890
and Parchman's group in Cleveland

616
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:40,457
will act as support if necessary.

617
00:52:41,443 --> 00:52:44,405
I understand Dr. Ruber
knows Joe Miller personally,

618
00:52:45,085 --> 00:52:46,621
which is why the job is yours.

619
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:50,285
I don't think Dr. Ruber's in
any kind of shape to help us,

620
00:52:50,286 --> 00:52:51,952
considering his falling out with Miller.

621
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,278
That's exactly why
Miller will talk to me.

622
00:52:56,295 --> 00:52:58,072
He'd like to kill me.

623
00:53:01,693 --> 00:53:03,360
There's no such thing as ghosts.

624
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:06,716
Fine. I'm just asking you.
You swear you didn't see her?

625
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:07,923
Didn't see her.

626
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:12,375
- I don't believe in ghosts, all right?
- Yeah, me neither, I mean,

627
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:13,385
magic bus tickets, sure,

628
00:53:13,386 --> 00:53:15,300
- but ghosts, no.
- I've seen the bus ticket, all right?

629
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:17,494
- With my eyes seen it.
- Well, I saw her.

630
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,118
And whatever she is, she was there.

631
00:53:20,112 --> 00:53:20,639
Here.

632
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:23,228
Tape that down.

633
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:25,626
Are you ready?

634
00:53:25,627 --> 00:53:26,635
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

635
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,466
- I feel stupid. Do you?
- Just give it a sec.

636
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:42,363
Great.

637
00:54:42,582 --> 00:54:43,767
The camera's broken.

638
00:54:44,545 --> 00:54:46,683
You know, I might be able
to dig it out and fix it.

639
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:47,342
The key's okay.

640
00:54:53,277 --> 00:54:54,045
Yeah, Miller.

641
00:54:54,703 --> 00:54:56,063
Joe, it's Ruber.

642
00:54:56,414 --> 00:54:58,564
We need to talk... about your daughter.

643
00:55:15,325 --> 00:55:16,663
What do you want, Ruber?

644
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:18,528
I want to help you get
your daughter back.

645
00:55:19,098 --> 00:55:19,909
Yeah?

646
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:22,696
Any thoughts about getting Lou back?

647
00:55:23,507 --> 00:55:25,350
I've joined a group, Joe.

648
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:26,885
A cabal.

649
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:29,791
They're called the
Order of the Reunification.

650
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:31,433
They believe in the objects.

651
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,188
They want to use them.

652
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,811
Do you have any idea

653
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,465
how powerful the objects really are?

654
00:55:37,992 --> 00:55:40,844
The Order thinks if they can
get all the objects back together...

655
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,617
- they can talk to God.
- That's insane.

656
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,315
Come with me to the Order.

657
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,531
Give us the key.

658
00:55:50,189 --> 00:55:52,383
If anybody can bring Anna back, we can...

659
00:55:52,971 --> 00:55:53,936
together.

660
00:55:54,243 --> 00:55:55,450
Someday, Ruber...

661
00:55:56,382 --> 00:55:58,137
you're gonna get
what's coming to you.

662
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:01,856
Someday you're gonna need me, Joe.

663
00:56:13,034 --> 00:56:14,503
I've almost got this thing working.

664
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:18,079
<i>Can you make animal pancakes?

665
00:56:18,517 --> 00:56:20,272
What kind of animal pancakes you want?

666
00:56:20,448 --> 00:56:21,040
Elephant.

667
00:56:21,522 --> 00:56:24,461
All right, I don't know how to make
an elephant, but how about a mouse?

668
00:56:24,462 --> 00:56:25,439
Elephant.

669
00:56:28,883 --> 00:56:30,924
Okay, okay, okay. I got it, I got it.

670
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,779
All right, wait. Go back, go back.

671
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:49,113
Slow it down.

672
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,861
She's disintegrating.

673
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:56,990
You see, somehow
the key brings her back

674
00:56:57,231 --> 00:56:58,701
just for a few seconds into our...

675
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:00,653
time and space.

676
00:57:01,157 --> 00:57:03,483
What's it like for her
the rest of the time when she's

677
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:05,062
not in our space?

678
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:06,510
I don't know.

679
00:57:07,764 --> 00:57:09,892
But Anna may be
trapped in the same place.

680
00:57:10,111 --> 00:57:11,713
I need to find out who she is.

681
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,134
You sure you know where you're going?

682
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,298
Yes.

683
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:17,745
How much further?

684
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:19,994
I don't know. Not much.

685
00:57:20,454 --> 00:57:23,723
- Doesn't seem like much of a shortcut.
- Please don't complain to me now.

686
00:57:25,205 --> 00:57:26,602
Hey, what's the name of this town?

687
00:57:26,603 --> 00:57:28,620
I don't remember.
Nobody goes there anymore.

688
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:29,602
Why not?

689
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:32,652
You know, the questions get
really boring after a while.

690
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,801
I don't know the name
of the town, okay?

691
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:37,543
Doesn't matter.
What it was a long time ago I don't know..

692
00:57:41,904 --> 00:57:43,264
You're trespassing.

693
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:44,185
Sorry.

694
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,673
We didn't know anybody lived here.
We're just heading into the town.

695
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:51,381
There ain't a town anymore.

696
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:00,716
Friendly.

697
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:02,547
That's why I don't like coming here.

698
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:06,025
Come on.

699
00:58:06,288 --> 00:58:06,661
Come on.

700
00:58:06,946 --> 00:58:08,153
Just relax.

701
00:58:12,518 --> 00:58:14,427
- Where is everybody?
- Exactly.

702
00:58:16,336 --> 00:58:17,916
Make an offer. What do you think?

703
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,347
Proud of yourself?

704
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:42,002
What's the problem?

705
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,735
I've been here a couple times.

706
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,479
I... I don't like it in there.

707
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,498
Just stick with me a
little longer, all right?

708
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:49,587
I'll buy you lunch.

709
00:59:02,553 --> 00:59:03,935
Bus station's that way.

710
00:59:04,352 --> 00:59:05,646
Not looking for the bus station.

711
00:59:07,775 --> 00:59:09,113
I'm hungry. I'd like to eat.

712
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:17,932
Tell you what.

713
00:59:18,063 --> 00:59:19,423
I'll just have the special.

714
00:59:19,665 --> 00:59:21,179
Turkey, mashed potatoes.

715
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,319
Sounds good.
Some apple pie, coffee, please.

716
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,841
- I'll have two of the same.
- Two?

717
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:26,851
Yeah, two.

718
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:32,894
- See why I don't like this place?
- Relax, okay?

719
00:59:36,558 --> 00:59:37,457
Anything else?

720
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:38,752
Yeah.

721
00:59:38,753 --> 00:59:40,437
I'd like to know about that motel.

722
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:54,993
What's the matter?
I can't ask a simple question?

723
00:59:56,013 --> 00:59:58,799
- What happened at that motel?
- Motel's haunted.

724
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,847
What do you mean "haunted"?

725
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:06,127
There's these people out of nowhere
coming down over the hill thinking

726
01:00:06,128 --> 01:00:07,114
they're in Hell.

727
01:00:07,893 --> 01:00:09,319
Used to hardly happen at all.

728
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:11,753
Now it happens all the time.

729
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:14,155
All right, what about the
woman at the motel?

730
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:19,146
The woman?

731
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:21,187
The ghost?

732
01:00:22,504 --> 01:00:23,447
Who's seen her?

733
01:00:24,303 --> 01:00:25,356
Nobody, huh?

734
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,897
We'll take the rest at the booth.

735
01:00:37,564 --> 01:00:40,076
I know I'm not hallucinating,
but I feel like I'm losing it.

736
01:00:40,077 --> 01:00:40,800
You're losing it?

737
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:41,919
You see these people?

738
01:00:42,402 --> 01:00:44,639
They're living a mile
and a half from that motel.

739
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:47,338
It's making them half-crazy,
and they don't even know why.

740
01:00:47,586 --> 01:00:49,473
Most people left a while ago, but...

741
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:51,864
they...

742
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:54,079
a lot of them never
figured out... what?

743
01:00:56,869 --> 01:00:58,062
There's our ghost.

744
01:01:09,786 --> 01:01:10,523
Hi.

745
01:01:12,822 --> 01:01:13,682
You want to come in?

746
01:01:15,999 --> 01:01:17,245
I don't think so.

747
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:24,915
Better?

748
01:01:25,231 --> 01:01:26,003
Much.

749
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:28,811
I want to ask you a question.

750
01:01:29,826 --> 01:01:31,186
Do you recognize her?

751
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,015
No.

752
01:01:35,397 --> 01:01:36,341
Who is she?

753
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:39,280
She's a woman I saw at the motel.

754
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:43,667
The actual motel, room number 9.

755
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:46,936
What's wrong?

756
01:01:47,945 --> 01:01:49,546
Joe, don't go back there.

757
01:01:53,429 --> 01:01:56,083
- You knew about it?
- You wouldn't understand.

758
01:01:56,566 --> 01:01:58,387
What wouldn't I understand, Jennifer?

759
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:05,583
That's the guy from
the hospice, isn't it?

760
01:02:07,316 --> 01:02:08,435
He's my brother.

761
01:02:09,554 --> 01:02:10,344
Drew.

762
01:02:11,397 --> 01:02:14,600
We all have a reason to get rid
of the objects. Drew is my reason.

763
01:02:15,258 --> 01:02:18,198
He became obsessed with room 9.

764
01:02:19,207 --> 01:02:21,269
And whatever happened to him in there...

765
01:02:21,532 --> 01:02:22,629
destroyed him.

766
01:02:23,814 --> 01:02:26,469
So, Joe, you promise me
you won't go back there.

767
01:02:37,724 --> 01:02:39,589
I am sorry about your brother.

768
01:02:40,247 --> 01:02:41,498
I really am.

769
01:02:41,814 --> 01:02:43,942
But I have to go back,
because whatever's happening

770
01:02:43,943 --> 01:02:46,290
to that woman could be
happening to Anna right now.

771
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:49,943
So I'm gonna find out the names
of everyone in this picture,

772
01:02:49,944 --> 01:02:53,254
and hopefully I can talk to one of them.
Because if I can bring that woman back,

773
01:02:53,255 --> 01:02:54,330
I can bring Anna back.

774
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:56,195
I know it.

775
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:21,357
My brother's research on room 9.

776
01:04:11,749 --> 01:04:12,473
Yeah.

777
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,338
Home sweet home.

778
01:04:33,711 --> 01:04:35,335
Jennifer, I...

779
01:05:02,452 --> 01:05:03,351
You all right?

780
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:07,190
Yeah.

781
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:15,505
Just don't break my heart.

782
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:22,174
Don't break mine.

783
01:06:05,722 --> 01:06:07,411
Jennifer, get dressed.
We have to go.

784
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:08,772
What's going on?

785
01:06:08,954 --> 01:06:10,007
Get everything.

786
01:06:35,455 --> 01:06:36,683
Still here.

787
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:39,250
Whoever made that print
was here in 1961.

788
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:42,584
I think my brother identified
the people in this photo.

789
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,734
They are the collectors.

790
01:06:46,598 --> 01:06:49,670
The woman you saw was
the motel manager in 1966.

791
01:06:49,671 --> 01:06:50,767
Arlene Conroy.

792
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,824
Arlene Conroy.

793
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,588
The woman in the picture, right?

794
01:06:56,983 --> 01:06:57,685
Yeah.

795
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,750
What happened to the rest of them?

796
01:07:04,405 --> 01:07:05,940
Everyone else is dead.

797
01:07:16,865 --> 01:07:18,817
We need to find out
who this belongs to.

798
01:07:32,922 --> 01:07:33,866
Somebody in there?

799
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:35,357
Yeah, just working late.

800
01:07:36,608 --> 01:07:38,407
Who's in there? Pendergast?

801
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:39,686
<i>Yeah, buddy.

802
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:44,994
I've seen this guy.

803
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:46,991
I'll be damned.

804
01:07:46,992 --> 01:07:48,131
<i>Who the hell's in there?!

805
01:07:54,986 --> 01:07:56,895
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

806
01:08:16,642 --> 01:08:18,529
Who are hell are you?
Get out of my house!

807
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,657
Gus Jacobs,
I want to know about Arlene Conroy.

808
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:23,972
I've seen her.

809
01:08:25,332 --> 01:08:26,648
At the motel.

810
01:08:33,295 --> 01:08:34,688
Please, tell me what happened.

811
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,542
I don't know.

812
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:39,833
I don't know.

813
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:42,838
I wish to God I could help her.

814
01:08:44,528 --> 01:08:45,910
She's my wife.

815
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,017
My daughter disappeared inside
that motel room, same as your wife.

816
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,550
She's only 8 years old.

817
01:09:09,866 --> 01:09:10,853
Oh, God.

818
01:09:13,223 --> 01:09:15,285
- I'm sorry.
- Please help me.

819
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:18,543
Tell me what happened in room 9.

820
01:09:22,975 --> 01:09:27,187
Do you know how the objects were created?
Were you and Arlene involved somehow?

821
01:09:27,318 --> 01:09:28,053
No.

822
01:09:28,808 --> 01:09:29,466
God, no.

823
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:30,695
How could we?

824
01:09:32,033 --> 01:09:32,933
We just...

825
01:09:33,547 --> 01:09:35,302
we just ran the motel. That's all.

826
01:09:36,114 --> 01:09:38,242
Arlene managed it.
I was a janitor.

827
01:09:38,593 --> 01:09:40,413
It was just a regular place.

828
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:43,726
It's not like something happened.

829
01:09:44,691 --> 01:09:45,173
It's like,

830
01:09:45,371 --> 01:09:47,740
afterward we figured
something must've happened.

831
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,613
The motel only has 9 rooms, right?

832
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,149
Except,

833
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:54,737
one day Arlene finds
the key to room 10.

834
01:09:55,768 --> 01:09:57,107
We tried the key and...

835
01:09:58,006 --> 01:09:58,818
well...

836
01:09:59,717 --> 01:10:01,713
I suppose you know what we saw.

837
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,587
There was still a few objects inside.

838
01:10:05,113 --> 01:10:06,386
I didn't want any of it.

839
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:09,787
But Arlene got this look in her eye.

840
01:10:10,116 --> 01:10:12,288
She wanted to get all the objects back.

841
01:10:13,056 --> 01:10:15,162
She got some of our friends involved.

842
01:10:15,929 --> 01:10:18,957
- Pretty soon we were this group.
- The collectors.

843
01:10:23,562 --> 01:10:25,295
By '66, we had...

844
01:10:25,296 --> 01:10:27,358
found almost all the objects.

845
01:10:27,928 --> 01:10:31,548
And since there wasn't a room 10,
Arlene started experimenting in room 9.

846
01:10:32,564 --> 01:10:34,956
And finally she found the watch box.

847
01:10:37,786 --> 01:10:39,541
And that's when everything went wrong.

848
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:41,844
What do you mean "went wrong"?

849
01:10:45,558 --> 01:10:46,984
It's easier if I show you.

850
01:10:49,573 --> 01:10:52,513
This is a copy. The original was stolen...

851
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:53,742
years ago.

852
01:11:13,444 --> 01:11:16,230
She looks the same.
God, she looks exactly the same.

853
01:11:18,205 --> 01:11:21,061
Arlene had been looking for
the five objects for years.

854
01:11:21,851 --> 01:11:25,317
She said with the right combination
she could open the door,

855
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:26,765
the right way.

856
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:30,165
I think she was insane by then.

857
01:11:32,571 --> 01:11:34,326
Then I gave her the watch box.

858
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:36,871
And everything went bad.

859
01:11:40,052 --> 01:11:41,895
She opened the door, and it was like...

860
01:11:42,926 --> 01:11:45,098
like she opened a tear in reality.

861
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:53,435
What the hell is happening?

862
01:11:53,436 --> 01:11:55,432
Gus, was this film spliced together?

863
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:56,529
No.

864
01:11:57,034 --> 01:11:58,723
It's one continuous piece of film.

865
01:12:03,484 --> 01:12:05,809
Arlene sacrificed herself to end it.

866
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,623
I saw Arlene a few months later

867
01:12:23,624 --> 01:12:24,698
at the motel.

868
01:12:25,071 --> 01:12:26,737
Just for a few seconds.

869
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,317
She begged me to help her.

870
01:12:29,063 --> 01:12:30,028
I couldn't.

871
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:31,608
I didn't know how.

872
01:12:32,025 --> 01:12:33,670
I got rid of the key and...

873
01:12:34,284 --> 01:12:35,491
I never went back.

874
01:12:36,675 --> 01:12:37,926
I changed names.

875
01:12:38,364 --> 01:12:39,659
Traveled all over.

876
01:12:41,348 --> 01:12:43,191
Eventually I came back. I...

877
01:12:44,441 --> 01:12:46,569
I guess I just want to be near her.

878
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:50,913
Gus, what does the box do?

879
01:12:55,892 --> 01:12:57,296
May I take this film?

880
01:12:58,108 --> 01:12:58,920
Take it.

881
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:01,684
I never want to watch it again.

882
01:13:04,645 --> 01:13:06,554
And if you do find my wife,

883
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:10,041
please put her out of her misery.

884
01:13:19,364 --> 01:13:22,457
You're not gonna believe this, Detective.
We had a break-in last night.

885
01:13:22,896 --> 01:13:23,554
Shut up.

886
01:13:23,758 --> 01:13:26,610
Someone came in just to
use the fingerprint database.

887
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:29,001
They logged in under Joe Miller.

888
01:13:29,527 --> 01:13:31,128
Why does Joe still have a login?

889
01:13:31,435 --> 01:13:33,783
Well, we've got a lot on
our plate, Detective. It's...

890
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,546
What was he looking for?

891
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:39,790
Okay.

892
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:41,952
Looks like Joe Miller's
headed to New Mexico. 

893
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:47,856
I think this must be the box.

894
01:13:48,075 --> 01:13:50,730
Well, if the key brings conroy
back part way, maybe with the box

895
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:52,143
she'll come back all the way.

896
01:13:52,603 --> 01:13:54,117
I don't know. Something's missing.

897
01:13:55,012 --> 01:13:56,197
How do I get the box?

898
01:13:57,447 --> 01:13:58,391
If you do this,

899
01:13:58,392 --> 01:13:59,690
I'm going in with you.

900
01:14:01,928 --> 01:14:02,783
There's a woman.

901
01:14:02,784 --> 01:14:04,253
She's an object tracker.

902
01:14:04,734 --> 01:14:07,257
She won't deal with the Legion,
but she might deal with you.

903
01:14:07,806 --> 01:14:09,078
Her name's Suzie Kang.

904
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:12,719
Who was it referred you again?

905
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,628
I just heard your name
around, that's all.

906
01:14:14,847 --> 01:14:16,251
- You work for the Legion?
- No.

907
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:17,721
Good.

908
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:19,477
Bunch a scumbags.

909
01:14:19,729 --> 01:14:21,835
Always trying to hide
the objects from everybody.

910
01:14:21,845 --> 01:14:22,898
It's bad for business.

911
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,457
But they'll get theirs.

912
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,547
I'm on my own.

913
01:14:26,469 --> 01:14:27,478
And I have the key.

914
01:14:28,355 --> 01:14:29,430
You're the new motel man.

915
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:30,374
Joe Miller.

916
01:14:30,461 --> 01:14:32,238
Yeah, whatever.
Can I see the key?

917
01:14:32,447 --> 01:14:33,500
Can I point my gun at you?

918
01:14:33,653 --> 01:14:34,992
I just want to see the key.

919
01:14:39,518 --> 01:14:40,330
Damn.

920
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:43,554
All right, Mr. Guy.

921
01:14:43,862 --> 01:14:45,068
What are you looking for?

922
01:14:45,946 --> 01:14:46,758
The box.

923
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:50,114
- Well, that is totally ungettable.
- Where is it?

924
01:14:50,443 --> 01:14:52,615
You know, I feel bad for you
because you're stupid.

925
01:14:52,966 --> 01:14:54,129
1000 bucks.

926
01:15:22,536 --> 01:15:23,589
The watch box.

927
01:15:23,809 --> 01:15:26,244
Dampens entropy for a limited radius.

928
01:15:26,407 --> 01:15:27,811
I must've been absent that day.

929
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:30,948
It prevents things from decaying.

930
01:15:31,453 --> 01:15:32,177
Who has it?

931
01:15:33,581 --> 01:15:34,875
They call themselves the Order.

932
01:15:34,929 --> 01:15:36,706
Very, very nasty cabal.

933
01:15:36,947 --> 01:15:38,658
Box was their first object.

934
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:40,457
They based the whole religion around it.

935
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:41,060
Thank you.

936
01:15:55,703 --> 01:15:58,127
- I guess if you were gonna shoot...
- Shut up and listen.

937
01:15:58,128 --> 01:16:00,671
The Order has an object that I need.
The watch box.

938
01:16:00,672 --> 01:16:02,735
- Where do they keep it?
- I don't know.

939
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:04,785
Don't lie to me, Ruber.

940
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:06,562
You'll never get near it, Joe.

941
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,307
Then close your eyes.

942
01:16:08,308 --> 01:16:09,667
Listen to me, Joe.

943
01:16:09,668 --> 01:16:12,357
You can't get the box, but I can.

944
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:16,858
- I'll get the box for you.
- Sit down.

945
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:20,806
Joe...

946
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:23,900
I want to see the motel room again.

947
01:16:24,338 --> 01:16:25,852
I want to go inside.

948
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:27,124
Why?

949
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:29,910
Because when I saw that room...

950
01:16:30,525 --> 01:16:32,170
I knew that there was something

951
01:16:32,389 --> 01:16:34,802
in that room that I was meant to see.

952
01:16:35,285 --> 01:16:37,226
I don't know why, Joe,
but I need to see it.

953
01:16:37,786 --> 01:16:40,023
I need to get inside that room.

954
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:49,117
The only reason that you're alive
is because I need that box.

955
01:16:51,508 --> 01:16:53,329
You get the box,
you get inside the room.

956
01:16:58,112 --> 01:17:00,262
If I make it out of there in one piece,

957
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,013
I promise I will find
a way to wake you up.

958
01:17:13,885 --> 01:17:15,289
Oh, my god, Drew.

959
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:17,241
The comb.

960
01:17:34,637 --> 01:17:37,851
I wanted to let you know I think
I found a way to bring your wife back.

961
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:41,833
All you'll bring her is pain.

962
01:17:42,732 --> 01:17:44,356
Just let it go, son.

963
01:17:48,787 --> 01:17:50,367
I'm sorry. I have to give it a try.

964
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:55,390
Excuse me.

965
01:17:58,242 --> 01:17:59,328
- Miller. 
<i>- Joe, listen.</i>

966
01:17:59,394 --> 01:18:01,741
<i>The last object my brother
was missing was the comb.</i>

967
01:18:01,895 --> 01:18:03,540
<i>I got it back from the Legion.</i>

968
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,285
I'll be right there.

969
01:18:06,821 --> 01:18:07,589
I have to go.

970
01:18:11,823 --> 01:18:12,547
Joe...

971
01:18:13,995 --> 01:18:17,241
Arlene didn't disappear
the same way your daughter did.

972
01:18:18,272 --> 01:18:19,742
Arlene had the key.

973
01:18:21,453 --> 01:18:23,187
It was the objects that ate her.

974
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:31,149
It was the objects.

975
01:18:38,235 --> 01:18:41,482
Joe Miller, you're under arrest for
the murder of detective Lou Destefano

976
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,128
and the kidnapping of Anna Miller. 

977
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,693
Want to make a statement?

978
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,535
Do you want to make a statement?

979
01:19:07,627 --> 01:19:08,790
Ex-wife,

980
01:19:09,558 --> 01:19:12,300
custody battle. They're gonna put
you away and run you up.

981
01:19:13,264 --> 01:19:14,954
Tell me what happened.

982
01:19:16,994 --> 01:19:18,113
I can't do that.

983
01:19:19,472 --> 01:19:20,789
You know me.

984
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:24,013
You've been to my house.
Our kids play together.

985
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:26,273
I've seen you with Anna.
You're a good dad.

986
01:19:27,281 --> 01:19:27,896
Okay?

987
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:29,519
This isn't you.

988
01:19:30,924 --> 01:19:33,095
Now, let me help you
get whoever did this.

989
01:19:33,096 --> 01:19:35,070
Lee, I'm telling you for your girls...

990
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:38,799
Drop this case.

991
01:19:40,884 --> 01:19:42,946
What the hell did you
get yourself into?

992
01:19:48,714 --> 01:19:51,128
You know, Lou asked me
the same thing, and now he's dead.

993
01:19:55,076 --> 01:19:55,998
And Anna?

994
01:19:58,498 --> 01:19:59,464
She's alive.

995
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:04,180
And if I have to rip the world
in half to get her back, I will.

996
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:21,490
Last chance.

997
01:20:28,586 --> 01:20:29,266
Lee!

998
01:20:32,689 --> 01:20:33,654
Are you alright?

999
01:20:34,072 --> 01:20:34,620
Lee!

1000
01:20:35,366 --> 01:20:36,572
Damn! Sorry.

1001
01:20:42,408 --> 01:20:44,229
Get down! Do it now! Do it now!

1002
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,501
Comply, comply!

1003
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:52,745
You got the key, Joe?

1004
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:55,070
Yeah, I got the key, Ruber,
and I'm armed.

1005
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:12,359
Stop!

1006
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:16,023
Put it in park. Now take the
keys out of the ignition. Now!

1007
01:21:18,589 --> 01:21:20,739
Jennifer, look away!
He's got the deck of cards.

1008
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:22,724
Put 'em on the dashboard, Ruber, now!

1009
01:21:24,493 --> 01:21:25,393
Get out!

1010
01:21:25,788 --> 01:21:26,468
Get out!

1011
01:21:27,696 --> 01:21:29,013
Up against the van!

1012
01:21:31,623 --> 01:21:34,167
- No, no, Joe!
- Give me the watch box!

1013
01:21:34,705 --> 01:21:36,504
- Give me the box!
- There it is!

1014
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:38,303
Joe?

1015
01:21:39,502 --> 01:21:41,082
- Joe, take the comb!
- Joe!

1016
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:42,881
What are you doing?!

1017
01:21:43,056 --> 01:21:43,671
Joe!

1018
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,680
Joe!

1019
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:46,106
Joe!

1020
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:47,740
<i>Let me in!

1021
01:21:48,749 --> 01:21:49,758
Arlene!

1022
01:21:58,031 --> 01:21:59,588
Open the box!

1023
01:22:06,345 --> 01:22:07,881
Have you seen a little girl?

1024
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:13,482
I have lost my daughter. She is
trapped in the room. Please help me.

1025
01:22:13,931 --> 01:22:15,204
<i>Are you him?

1026
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,387
Am I who?

1027
01:22:17,486 --> 01:22:19,855
<i>The man. The man in the picture!

1028
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,422
Picture? What picture?

1029
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,230
Please! Make it stop!

1030
01:22:24,796 --> 01:22:26,862
- What picture?
- Joe!

1031
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,648
Don't close it!

1032
01:22:30,886 --> 01:22:33,211
Joe, the comb! The comb!

1033
01:22:39,716 --> 01:22:42,151
<i>Thank you.

1034
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,824
I'm not the man in the picture. I'm sorry.

1035
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:49,084
<i>I know.

1036
01:22:51,606 --> 01:22:53,559
<i>I saw your daughter.

1037
01:22:57,924 --> 01:22:59,921
<i>She's waiting for you, Joe.

1038
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:22,428
She said she saw Anna.

1039
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:36,600
I don't understand.

1040
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:38,136
What happened?

1041
01:23:38,465 --> 01:23:39,254
I don't know.

1042
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:41,952
But I think I know
what picture she was talking about.

1043
01:23:42,259 --> 01:23:43,159
It's this one.

1044
01:23:43,949 --> 01:23:44,739
What is that?

1045
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:47,334
It's the room.

1046
01:23:52,928 --> 01:23:54,398
Oh, my God.

1047
01:24:06,222 --> 01:24:07,867
Would you move, Ruber?

1048
01:24:12,956 --> 01:24:15,633
This must be exactly
how the room was in 1961.

1049
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:18,485
Just before the objects changed.

1050
01:24:38,252 --> 01:24:39,831
- What was that?
- What?

1051
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:41,483
What the hell is that?

1052
01:24:45,069 --> 01:24:45,947
It's a man.

1053
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,733
There was an occupant in room 10.

1054
01:24:51,014 --> 01:24:52,243
Incredible.

1055
01:25:00,184 --> 01:25:01,150
Let's go.

1056
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:09,858
You can't leave me here, Joe.
I gave you the box.

1057
01:25:10,099 --> 01:25:11,240
We had a deal.

1058
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,464
Come on, Ruber.

1059
01:25:18,304 --> 01:25:19,510
Oh my God!

1060
01:25:20,761 --> 01:25:22,911
I'm actually in... the room.

1061
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:42,020
He was right here.

1062
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:49,105
Feel enlightened, Ruber?

1063
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:50,992
Yes.

1064
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,327
Yes, I am.

1065
01:26:00,316 --> 01:26:03,080
Objects don't work in the room, Ruber.

1066
01:26:20,961 --> 01:26:22,146
He stole it!

1067
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:23,813
Doesn't matter.

1068
01:26:25,173 --> 01:26:26,007
Why?

1069
01:26:28,025 --> 01:26:29,166
The man in the room.

1070
01:26:29,891 --> 01:26:30,680
Yeah?

1071
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:33,905
If I'm right, he's the prime object.

1072
01:26:37,986 --> 01:26:39,105
And we're gonna find him.
