Previously on
<i>The Lost Room</i>

2
00:00:01,658 --> 00:00:02,241
What's this?

3
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:05,549
<i>Joe Miller has found a key
to a room not like any other.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,437
We can go anywhere?

5
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,214
<i>A room of great power.

6
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:10,787
All the objects come from
the motel room...

7
00:00:10,814 --> 00:00:13,096
- And do they all...
- They do weird stuff.

8
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:15,030
A room of great danger.

9
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:17,363
- Anna!
- Daddy!

10
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:19,371
My daughter disappeared
inside that room.

11
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:21,313
Is there an object that
can bring her back?

12
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:22,775
Prime object is what you need.

13
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:24,853
If it exists,
it's inside the vault.

14
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:26,669
Do you think you can
trust a man like that?

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,613
His kid is dying.

16
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:30,360
I have my own object I need
from the vault : the Glass Eye.

17
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:31,822
It can repair all flesh.

18
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:33,517
People are coming for you Joe.

19
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:36,750
They won't mind killing you
to get their hands on these objects.

20
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:39,856
- Do you give yourself to the Order?
- Yes.

21
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:41,537
Give me the key, Joe.

22
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:46,444
Detective Joe Miller
just shot his partner.

23
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:47,995
Who fired the first shot?

24
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,209
<i>Now, to get his daughter back,

25
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:51,781
<i>he has one last hope.

26
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:52,896
The man in the room.

27
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:55,370
If I'm right, he's the Prime object.

28
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:56,832
And we're gonna find him.

29
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:36,041
Anna!

30
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:39,472
Anna!

31
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,113
Somebody help me!

32
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,558
- Lee, help me! Anna!
- Daddy!

33
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,715
Lee, help me!

34
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,477
Ruber, what the hell
did you do to me?

35
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:33,412
How you feeling, kiddo?

36
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:37,704
We're getting close, son.

37
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,745
Car's ready, sir.

38
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:03,564
Hey.

39
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:06,215
Did you sleep?

40
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,347
No.

41
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,655
I just can't come up with anything.

42
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:17,367
You sure these pictures
don't mean anything to you?

43
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:18,707
No.

44
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,342
I mean, except that the collectors
keep showing up again and again.

45
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,256
The pictures, the film.

46
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,492
But I can't make a connection.

47
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:28,296
I can't either.

48
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:32,792
I just hope they can help us
find out who the man in this room was.

49
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,371
We're in uncharted
territory here, Joe.

50
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:39,674
I mean, no one's
ever seen this guy before.

51
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:41,321
We don't know that
he actually existed.

52
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,806
Jennifer, he was standing
right there. We both saw him.

53
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:47,456
And if the prime object is a person,

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,569
it makes sense that he'd be
able to bring my daughter back.

55
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:56,236
Gotta find him. That's all
I care about right now.

56
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,184
Right.

57
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:09,193
What are you gonna do?

58
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,149
I'm gonna take another
look at the film.

59
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:14,817
The collectors...

60
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,455
disturbed reality somehow.

61
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:20,749
I want to try and figure it out.

62
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:30,194
What?

63
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:33,173
Kreutzfeld sent you after
those polaroids, didn't he?

64
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:34,376
He didn't send me.

65
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,861
We're working together.

66
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:45,282
What makes you think
you can trust him so much?

67
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:30,150
Good morning, Sir.

68
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:31,544
Right this way.

69
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:32,733
Please.

70
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:34,277
Welcome to the Sood's.

71
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,140
Mr. Kreutzfeld,

72
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:47,520
my good friend.

73
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,486
At last we meet in person.

74
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,744
You're early.

75
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:54,463
Never early for business,
is it, Sood?

76
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,158
No, no, never, never.

77
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,188
You go everywhere together?

78
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:00,744
Oh, yeah. Afraid so.

79
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:03,942
Not by choice.
I prefer my old life.

80
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:05,992
I was once normal.

81
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:07,167
It's overrated.

82
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:08,808
Sit, please.

83
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:21,225
First edition.

84
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,523
Rough around the edges.

85
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:23,685
I'd call it...

86
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:24,997
"Fair condition".

87
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:31,805
A little less fair now.

88
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,126
- Just checking it's not an object.
- No, no, no.

89
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:36,452
Never objects in my shop,

90
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,791
only science.

91
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:40,101
Pictures of objects.
Videos,

92
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:41,263
artifacts.

93
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,903
No objects for sale.

94
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:43,915
That's...

95
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:45,500
dangerous business.

96
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:48,739
Tell me more.

97
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:55,654
It belonged to John Clark,

98
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:57,158
one of the collectors.

99
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,648
Born 1938,

100
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,370
- died...
- 1971.

101
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,694
In the first cabal war.

102
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:05,618
- How do you know it's Clark's?
- I just bought itoff his nephew.

103
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:08,242
Had a bunch of stuff in a trunk.

104
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:09,705
No idea what it was.

105
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:13,068
I called you first, of course.
I know you have a taste for...

106
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,057
collectors' artifacts.

107
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:17,723
Thank you for coming
to me with this.

108
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,798
I'll of course pay
whatever it is you're asking.

109
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:23,644
Whatever price you think is fair.

110
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:26,295
And I shall accept your word
that it's genuine.

111
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,769
But if at some point
I should find out that it's fake,

112
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,388
that you tried
to con me in any way,

113
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,092
or that I hear you've made copies
and someone else has one,

114
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:39,274
then I'll have to come back here
and hurt you.

115
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:41,905
Mr. Kreutzfeld,

116
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:42,916
my friend.

117
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:44,174
I am the Sood.

118
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:45,666
I deal in science.

119
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,719
No fakes,

120
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:49,357
no forgeries, no duplicates.

121
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,213
I stake my life on it.

122
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:04,815
No, no, no!

123
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,619
I don't have anything
to do with that.

124
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:09,202
Mick, what's going on out there?

125
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:14,207
- Is that a way out?
- Yes.

126
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:15,068
This way.

127
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:30,089
You need to tread
very carefully now.

128
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:33,642
You need to tell me
what's going on.

129
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:34,954
I've told you everything I know.

130
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,991
I've been straight with you
from the beginning.

131
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:39,697
Then what's this?

132
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:42,170
That's the...

133
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,097
combination to the collectors' vault,

134
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,587
wherever it is.

135
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:47,890
It's what we both
have been looking for.

136
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:50,815
In the vault, I believe,
is the Glass Eye,

137
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:54,642
which has the power
to destroy or repair all flesh.

138
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,592
Could be used as a
weapon most definitely,

139
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:01,096
but it could also cure
my son's leukemia.

140
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:03,624
Can I be any more clear, detective?

141
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:08,940
What about the man?

142
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,821
What man?

143
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,555
The man in the motel room.
Who was he?

144
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,259
You're speaking of the occupant theory.

145
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:27,849
People far more obsessed than you
have gone down that road.

146
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:31,937
"Who did the objects belong to?
There has to be an occupant." Right?

147
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:34,261
I say no.

148
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:35,511
There's no occupant.

149
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:36,830
I've seen him.

150
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,902
I took the polaroid
to the original motel.

151
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:47,072
I went inside the motel room, and I saw
it just like it was back in 1961.

152
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,750
And there was a man in the room.

153
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:57,158
My God.

154
00:10:57,773 --> 00:10:59,126
You really didn't know, did you?

155
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:05,714
That certainly explains

156
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:08,243
something I've never
really understood.

157
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,389
Most of the time,

158
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:11,963
in the evidence I found,

159
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,609
the collectors referred to
their hiding place as a vault.

160
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,234
But in two instances,
they call it a tomb.

161
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:23,512
You think he's dead?

162
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,307
Nobody's seen him.
Nobody knows who he is.

163
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:27,968
Trust me. I've done the research.

164
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:31,193
But if there's a body,

165
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,503
and the collectors hid it somewhere,

166
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,020
it might be in the vault.

167
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,033
I got this from Conroy's husband.

168
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,526
He's the last living collector.

169
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:44,951
I had it digitized.

170
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,837
Unbelievable.

171
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:51,162
The collectors are trying
to do an experiment in room 9.

172
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:53,388
Look.

173
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,493
They nailed objects to the door.

174
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:58,294
This is huge.

175
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,700
It gets weirder.

176
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:06,385
Wh-what's happening now?

177
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:12,194
I think this is where
the world almost ends.

178
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,852
The original film was stolen.

179
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:20,230
Someone's a step
ahead of us on this.

180
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:23,093
I'll kick this up the ladder.
Get the legion moving on it.

181
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,078
Your lt back in Pittsburgh
has been calling.

182
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:29,948
Wants to know how the hell
we let Joe Miller escape.

183
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:32,162
I don't know.

184
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:34,376
There's no hallucinogens
in your system.

185
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,251
You're clean.

186
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:36,018
No,

187
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:39,612
- Martin Ruber did something to me.
- I think you should go back home

188
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:42,552
as soon as the doctors
release you, detective.

189
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,682
Not until I find Martin Ruber.

190
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:41,700
You're probably gonna die...

191
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:43,313
of dehydration.

192
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,980
I just thought I'd mention.

193
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:08,899
No!

194
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:13,941
No!

195
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:52,484
I've been promoted.

196
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:54,178
By the Pontifex himself.

197
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,718
So your cell will
report directly to me

198
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:58,783
from now on.

199
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,610
Congratulations, Parchman.

200
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,415
Thanks.

201
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,750
Should've been you.

202
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:15,738
But you let Ruber steal two objects
right out from under you.

203
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,922
You know what
the punishment is for that.

204
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:22,995
I'll get the objects back.

205
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:26,706
And I'll take care of Ruber.

206
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:29,121
Good.

207
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,374
It would be a shame to lose you.

208
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:51,200
Key, clock,

209
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:52,349
scissors.

210
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,809
If we want into the vault,
we need all three.

211
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:55,970
Between us,

212
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,157
of course,
we have the key and the clock.

213
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:00,877
It's the scissors. I...

214
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:04,451
I think I know someone
who can help us find them.

215
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:10,185
Where did you vanish, Mr. Kreutzfeld?

216
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,069
The Sood has
security video and everything.

217
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:14,217
Yeah.

218
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,591
I had a little lapse in security.

219
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:18,723
He's trying to sell the DVD now.

220
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:25,969
So what are you guys looking for?

221
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:26,898
Scissors.

222
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,371
You're pitching slow balls.

223
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:32,278
Ten grand.

224
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:33,440
Cash.

225
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:36,543
Five.

226
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:43,203
- Okay, ten.
- Twelve.

227
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:51,090
I think you've tried
my patience enough for one day.

228
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:00,836
Zoraida Figueroa.

229
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:02,243
Washington, D.C.

230
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:04,012
She deals crystal methor

231
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,425
pop tarts or something.

232
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:06,559
Is she dangerous?

233
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,944
The scissors are
rarely sought after.

234
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:11,961
But she's had 'em for three years.
So she must be doing something right.

235
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:13,608
And what do the scissors do, exactly?

236
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:16,444
They rotate things.

237
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:19,505
So what do you do,
spin plates with them?

238
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:22,478
Dude, if you want to theorize,
I'm gonna charge you another grand.

239
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,028
So Zoraida's apartment
is up on the fourth floor.

240
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:35,240
And if she still has the scissors,
we should be able to just buy 'em off her.

241
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:37,440
This is a terrific neighborhood.

242
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:41,303
Is there a reason we couldn't
just come here through the motel room?

243
00:17:41,304 --> 00:17:43,833
It's just it's not that easy.
I've never been here before.

244
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:46,942
Besides, I like to see
what I'm getting into first.

245
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,211
Maybe we should surprise her.

246
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,649
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't want her
to rotate us till we're dizzy.

247
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:18,302
That's her apartment?

248
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:39,048
Stay behind me.

249
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:40,620
If you insist.

250
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:37,544
Zoraida, I'm...

251
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:46,858
You want something from me, huh?

252
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:56,349
You want some too?

253
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,557
Oh, rotates.

254
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,078
Calm down.

255
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:36,089
You picked the wrong
girl to mess with.

256
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,263
Having a hard time breathing?

257
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:12,998
I'll take this.

258
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:53,305
Please.

259
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,722
Don't take my scissors.

260
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:01,519
I'm sorry.

261
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,607
It's all I have left.

262
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:34,573
Get up!

263
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:36,282
Get...

264
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:37,457
up!

265
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,557
Who the hell is that?

266
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:10,048
That,

267
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:14,229
I believe, is the combination
to the vault.

268
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,699
If only we knew where the vault was.

269
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:26,709
What is this?

270
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:29,360
I don't know. The sun?

271
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:31,301
No, I've seen this before.

272
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:43,219
I'll be right back.

273
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:22,355
Barbara Stritzke had these.

274
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:25,129
The location of the
collector's vault is hidden

275
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,220
somehow inside those pictures.
I'm sure of it.

276
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,384
They certainly make no sense to me.

277
00:24:33,425 --> 00:24:37,149
Well, it didn't make sense to me at first
either, but together they make up a map.

278
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:38,967
A map.

279
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:42,801
Well, a map or instructions.
It makes sense if you've used the key.

280
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,181
When you leave the room,

281
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:46,716
you have to picture a door in your mind.
If you don't,

282
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:48,951
it'll just pick a door
for you at random.

283
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,377
If you want a specific door,
you have to have been there.

284
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:53,695
You have to be able to fix
an image of it in your mind.

285
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:55,759
And I think that's what
these pictures are for.

286
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:57,860
To take you to the vault

287
00:24:58,585 --> 00:25:00,320
without ever
having been there before.

288
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:02,056
And...

289
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:03,518
where is "there" exactly?

290
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:10,517
Okay.

291
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:13,038
What do these look like to you?

292
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:17,367
They look like lines.
Maybe out of focus.

293
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:23,596
These are bars.

294
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:26,549
And that's a guard tower.
You see that?

295
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:29,105
I can't believe
I didn't see this before.

296
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,150
This is a prison.

297
00:25:33,943 --> 00:25:34,927
We find the prison,

298
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:35,938
we find the vault.

299
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:17,994
Hey.

300
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:19,361
Hi.

301
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:26,276
What's wrong?

302
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,664
Why do you want this?

303
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:33,533
Why do you need the Legion's
files on the collectors?

304
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,994
I'm trying to find a way
into the vault, with Kreutzfeld.

305
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,527
Oh, God.

306
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,065
I'm sorry you don't like this,
but this is the best chance I've got.

307
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:43,227
You forget, Joe.

308
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,976
I used to know Kreutzfeld.

309
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,518
I liked him too.

310
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:50,497
But something happened to him.
He changed.

311
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:52,261
I trust him.

312
00:26:54,503 --> 00:26:56,950
He's gonna kill you
as soon as he's done with you.

313
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:02,969
You're putting
the rest of us in danger.

314
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,054
I'm just trying to find my little girl.

315
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:07,364
I can't worry about
the whole damn world. I'm not you.

316
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:19,433
You don't think
I wake up every morning...

317
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,975
wanting my old life back?

318
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:29,834
You don't get to choose, Joe.

319
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:35,847
No, I don't.

320
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:58,815
I'm not ready
to come back to Pittsburgh yet.

321
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:00,339
I need some time off.

322
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:02,662
I'm searching for something.

323
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:19,857
What? What's the matter?

324
00:28:20,404 --> 00:28:22,823
Wally, you can't send
teenage girls to Hell.

325
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:25,338
You kidding me? Teenage girls
deserve it the most. Look,

326
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,399
I could've bowled a 260
if those girls weren't teasing me.

327
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:30,869
I can't bowl
when people watch.

328
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:31,767
It makes me tense.

329
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:32,587
Seriously,

330
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:34,363
I could go pro
if no one was watching.

331
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:35,797
That's great, Wally.
Listen to me.

332
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,067
I think I found a way
into the collector's vault.

333
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,604
What, you don't think I can go pro?

334
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,673
- Wally... Wally!
- You should see my release.

335
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,605
What do you think you're
gonna find in the vault, Joe?

336
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:47,979
The occupant and the eye.

337
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:50,494
Okay.

338
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:53,433
There's no such thing as the occupant.

339
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:56,317
And even if there was,
he's long dead by now.

340
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:57,219
I've seen him.

341
00:28:59,765 --> 00:29:01,501
- And I'm gonna find him.
- Are you nuts?

342
00:29:01,502 --> 00:29:02,799
Do not go in the vault, Joe.

343
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:03,844
Do you hear me?

344
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:06,209
The collectors buried
the objects there for a reason.

345
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,589
Wally, I have to find him.

346
00:29:08,478 --> 00:29:11,293
If the occupant's body is in the vault,
I'm taking my chances.

347
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:13,275
What if he ain't dead, hmm?

348
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,556
What if he's just
sitting there waiting for you?

349
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,650
Why are you really here, Joe?

350
00:29:25,522 --> 00:29:26,670
I need a favor.

351
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:31,003
This is ridiculous.

352
00:29:31,454 --> 00:29:34,912
I mean, how do you hide objects
for 40 years inside of a prison?

353
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:36,529
If we're lucky, it's abandoned.

354
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:37,923
How about if it's torn down?

355
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:39,713
How about if it's a golf course now?

356
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:42,105
This is definitelythe door
they want us to use.

357
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:43,923
There's probably
no other way in or out.

358
00:29:48,564 --> 00:29:49,139
Karl...

359
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,790
What was the name of the collector
who owned that book,

360
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:53,539
the book you got from the Sood?

361
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:56,164
John Clark.
He was one of the original...

362
00:29:56,314 --> 00:29:57,366
collectors.

363
00:29:58,186 --> 00:29:59,143
John Clark.

364
00:29:59,786 --> 00:30:01,733
There's something there
in the Legion files?

365
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:03,448
Here he is. John Clark.

366
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:06,728
John Clark was a guard
at the state prison in Kellogg county

367
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:09,120
from 1955 to 1963.

368
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:11,007
I think we found our prison.

369
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,106
Oh, Karl, you shouldn't have.

370
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:23,555
It's what I do.

371
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:26,521
I thought I'd make it easier for us.

372
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:36,201
You're gonna have to leave the flask.

373
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:37,664
Excuse me?

374
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:41,429
We're taking the clock, the scissors,
and the key. No other objects.

375
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:46,697
Okay.

376
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:51,640
You should leave the gun, then.
Fair is fair.

377
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:54,046
Well, technically
the gun's not an object.

378
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:54,879
Joe.

379
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:57,445
All right.

380
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:00,725
And in the interest
of complete disclosure,

381
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,924
I shall leave behind
the cuff link as well.

382
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:05,956
What the hell does that do?

383
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:07,750
Lowers blood pressure.

384
00:31:08,423 --> 00:31:10,943
Might be a placebo,
but something's working.

385
00:31:12,056 --> 00:31:12,747
All right.

386
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:17,480
You ready?

387
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:18,284
Yes.

388
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:31,756
Do you have it yet?

389
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:33,995
Just give me one more second.

390
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:37,913
I think I got it.

391
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:44,708
What are you waiting for?

392
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,090
Wait!

393
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,498
Karl, hang on!

394
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,422
Hang on!

395
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:53,338
- You got me?
- I got you.

396
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:54,514
Maybe I'm wrong,

397
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:56,963
but I thought
we wanted the inside of the prison.

398
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:02,359
All right, ready.
Come on up.

399
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:13,401
I guess I owe you one.

400
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:15,352
Forget it, we're even.

401
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:30,279
Well, at least it's abandoned.

402
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:32,735
Yeah, but it's still the wrong door.
I can't get it.

403
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:37,345
If I was a vault, where would I be?

404
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:40,488
Well, it's doubtful it's in here.

405
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,223
I just can't get a lock on this door.

406
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:47,158
These pictures just don't add up.

407
00:32:58,092 --> 00:32:59,021
Wait a minute.

408
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,349
If it's in a fall out shelter,
it's underneath the prison.

409
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:06,032
Come on.

410
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:29,854
So is this it?

411
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:32,724
Looks like it.

412
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,643
It's not a real door.

413
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:39,886
What?

414
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,538
It's just painted on.

415
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:49,070
What does this look like to you?

416
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,589
It's Conroy, isn't it?

417
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:56,656
No.

418
00:33:58,173 --> 00:33:59,936
There's someone else in that room.

419
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:05,854
It's him.

420
00:34:10,473 --> 00:34:11,553
It's the occupant.

421
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,683
The man I saw in the polaroid.

422
00:34:20,682 --> 00:34:21,420
Damn it!

423
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:33,379
Why don't you use the key?

424
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:36,468
No lock.

425
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:48,625
Concrete.

426
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:51,496
Collectors.

427
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:54,762
What does the clock do exactly?
It doesn't happen to...

428
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:56,143
drill through walls, does it?

429
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:58,985
It sublimates brass.

430
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:01,445
Sublimates?

431
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:04,880
Turns solids into gas
without liquifying.

432
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:06,259
Or vice versa.

433
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:07,891
Sort of like when...

434
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,798
dry ice becomes steam.

435
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:13,971
- And the scissors...
- Rotate.

436
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:15,757
Yeah, I got that one.

437
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,177
There's a seam here.

438
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,438
Hand me the scissors.

439
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:32,464
Right.

440
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:35,473
Be careful with these, will you?

441
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:07,812
Thank you.

442
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:08,766
Yeah,

443
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:10,429
nice work.

444
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,384
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

445
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,165
What the hell?

446
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:34,186
Good thing you had me
leave my gun behind.

447
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:36,829
Starting to have
second thoughts about that.

448
00:36:40,304 --> 00:36:41,346
What do we got here?

449
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:44,094
Our fallout shelter.

450
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:47,701
Welded shut.

451
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:50,511
Let me guess.

452
00:36:51,798 --> 00:36:52,866
With brass.

453
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:10,811
We should step back a little.

454
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:12,010
Why's that?

455
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:14,732
I don't want to breathe in
metallic gas, do you?

456
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:27,580
I found what you wanted.

457
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:32,377
Here's the Legion's report of all
the objects and their known where abouts.

458
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:35,479
I don't know
how accurate that is, but...

459
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:37,618
that's the closest thing we've got.

460
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:39,156
Great, thanks.

461
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:03,389
Oh, my God.

462
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:04,551
Look at this.

463
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:12,575
I don't get it.

464
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,201
These are the Conroy objects.

465
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,222
The same objects from the film.

466
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:19,491
Karl Kreutzfeld has them all.

467
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:21,104
He's trying to recreate

468
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:22,580
the Conroy experiment.

469
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:24,552
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

470
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:26,353
It's suicide. He'll kill us all.

471
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:28,403
Not if we kill him first.

472
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:32,832
I hope the prime object's in there.

473
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,167
I hope we both get
what we want out of this.

474
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:39,898
After I get my daughter back,
you can have the key.

475
00:38:41,443 --> 00:38:42,263
I don't want it.

476
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,706
I couldn't have done this without you.

477
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:47,381
Oh, my God.

478
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:54,126
We found it.

479
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,695
Joe, nobody's seen these
objects in over 40 years.

480
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:57,839
Oh, no.

481
00:40:59,260 --> 00:40:59,850
No.

482
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:05,142
I'm sorry.

483
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,012
I'm so sorry, Joe.

484
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:34,042
Joe, my search is over.

485
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:38,853
Well, that's great for you, Karl,
but mine's not.

486
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:39,979
Oh, but it is.

487
00:41:41,238 --> 00:41:42,947
I can bring your daughter back now.

488
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:44,683
How?

489
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,266
How can you bring Anna back?

490
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:50,204
The same way
I bring Isaac back.

491
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:55,048
Do you know what
the quarter does, Joe?

492
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:07,767
It brings life to memories
for a short time.

493
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:10,474
Two days, sometimes three.

494
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:19,851
Oh, my God.

495
00:42:19,946 --> 00:42:21,054
My son Isaac.

496
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:26,849
He died nine years ago.

497
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:30,033
This is all I have left.

498
00:42:35,938 --> 00:42:37,304
It was enough for a while.

499
00:42:38,316 --> 00:42:39,272
Karl, what are you...

500
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,951
What are you saying?

501
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:45,942
You're still not seeing
the objects for what they really are.

502
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:48,662
They're tools.

503
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:52,100
Tools to reshape reality.

504
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:56,227
The properties
that we perceive, they're...

505
00:42:57,635 --> 00:42:59,494
side effects, tips of the iceberg.

506
00:42:59,904 --> 00:43:01,749
The objects allow us to change

507
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,866
reality on levels that
our brains can't even understand.

508
00:43:05,193 --> 00:43:09,239
Don't you see? Conroy opened up
a door through reality itself...

509
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,491
Where anything is possible.

510
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:14,337
Listen to me.

511
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,999
I saw what Conroy did.

512
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:22,154
And she almost
ripped reality apart.

513
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:24,627
But I can do it right this time.
I can bring my boy back.

514
00:43:24,628 --> 00:43:26,129
I can bring him back to life.

515
00:43:26,443 --> 00:43:29,081
We can both bring our children back,
both of them!

516
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:31,568
No, Karl, this isn't
just about us.

517
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:34,226
- What if you're wrong?
- It will work!

518
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:35,661
And what if it doesn't?!

519
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,931
Well, everyone will be dead.
It won't really matter.

520
00:43:45,846 --> 00:43:46,898
Well, I can't do that.

521
00:43:47,144 --> 00:43:47,909
Yes.

522
00:43:49,837 --> 00:43:51,969
You said you were willing
to do whatever it took.

523
00:43:52,393 --> 00:43:53,022
I am.

524
00:43:54,074 --> 00:43:55,127
But not this.

525
00:44:02,616 --> 00:44:04,243
Then I'm gonna need the key, Joe.

526
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:05,623
No.

527
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:11,936
The quarter brings
living memories as well.

528
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,202
No.

529
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:16,323
The key.

530
00:45:24,165 --> 00:45:25,327
Sorry, Joe!

531
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:30,343
Kreutzfeld, you son of a bitch!

532
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:18,968
Hey.

533
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,227
You're getting good at that.

534
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:26,662
You okay?

535
00:46:27,278 --> 00:46:27,660
No.

536
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,706
Thanks for the loan, wally.

537
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:31,473
My pleasure.

538
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:33,932
Uh, your lady friend is here.

539
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,736
You were right about Kreutzfeld.

540
00:46:48,294 --> 00:46:50,454
I lost the key.
I lost everything.

541
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,228
I know what Kreutzfeld's
trying to do.

542
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,292
He's trying to recreate
the Conroy experiment.

543
00:47:02,303 --> 00:47:03,424
His son is dead.

544
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,037
He wants to resurrect him.

545
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:07,442
And now he has
the Glass Eye.

546
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:11,884
I'm responsible for that.

547
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:17,270
Listen, Joe, I restored the film,
and I saw exactly what happened.

548
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,978
Conroy didn't stop
the experiment.

549
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:21,261
The occupant did.

550
00:47:21,985 --> 00:47:22,873
The occupant?

551
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:33,213
I am sorry. I don't know how to do this,
but we have to stop Kreutzfeld somehow

552
00:47:33,214 --> 00:47:33,609
now!

553
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:35,611
Let me do that
with the Legion.

554
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,741
But if we fail,
the occupant's our last hope.

555
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:40,491
You have to find him.

556
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:43,699
I don't know where to start. I don't have
the key. I don't have anything.

557
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:47,419
Joe, you've come farther
than anyone else.

558
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:49,415
You'll find him.

559
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:25,913
We're ready, son.

560
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:29,329
All right, think.
What do we know about the occupant?

561
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:29,849
Nothing.

562
00:48:29,918 --> 00:48:32,268
The objects all belong to him,
so they're his

563
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:34,715
personal possessions.
So there's gotta be at least

564
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:37,635
one thing that identifies him or...

565
00:48:37,636 --> 00:48:40,019
I didn't even know there was
an occupant till yesterday.

566
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,354
How would I have any idea if he...
What are you... Don't touch...

567
00:48:43,355 --> 00:48:46,514
Wait a minute, before it was an object,
this was just a bus ticket, right?

568
00:48:46,515 --> 00:48:48,562
I need you not to do that.
Come on!

569
00:48:48,563 --> 00:48:50,873
Do you know how hard it is
for me to get that duct tape

570
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:53,006
on there without zapping
myself here all the..

571
00:48:56,245 --> 00:48:57,106
Whoa. Look at that.

572
00:48:58,883 --> 00:49:00,059
Bus route's right on there.

573
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,421
Willowbrook, Arizona.
That's where he came from.

574
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:05,799
That's a start, my friend.

575
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:07,876
Pull over here.

576
00:49:07,877 --> 00:49:09,748
- Think we're at the driveway?
- Right here.

577
00:49:09,749 --> 00:49:11,419
- Right here?
- Yep, right here.

578
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,005
Welcome to Willowbrook,
home of the occupant, whoever he is.

579
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:21,848
Well, if I'm right,
he disappeared from here in 1961,

580
00:49:22,011 --> 00:49:23,978
so I'm gonna check
the missing persons reports.

581
00:49:23,979 --> 00:49:25,141
Where's the police station?

582
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:27,659
Wally, I'm wanted
for murder and kidnapping.

583
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,231
I can't walk into a police station.

584
00:49:29,723 --> 00:49:31,691
We're at the hall of records.

585
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:38,142
Sheriff, it's detective Bridgewater.

586
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:39,297
You still in town?

587
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,500
Yeah, I have a question.

588
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:44,029
Detective Miller and Dr. Ruber
escaped in a prisoner transport van.

589
00:49:44,097 --> 00:49:45,833
- Did it ever turn up?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

590
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,047
<i>- Abandoned not too far from here.</i>
- Where?

591
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:51,683
<i>Motel sunshine. Just off old Route 66.
You know the place?

592
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,624
Yeah.

593
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:46,836
Novocaine.

594
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:48,672
Sir?

595
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:55,670
I need novocaine

596
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:56,961
and a syringe.

597
00:51:02,788 --> 00:51:03,160
I'll...

598
00:51:03,422 --> 00:51:04,176
see to it, sir.

599
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:13,568
What, a man can't sing
to his bus ticket?

600
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:27,183
Well, there were
no missing persons in 1961,

601
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,537
but there was an extra person.

602
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,218
What's an extra person?

603
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:34,304
<i>Police arrested an unidentified man
yesterday blah blah blah blah.

604
00:51:34,543 --> 00:51:36,224
<i>The man accosted Mabel Smith,

605
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:37,782
<i>24 of Willowbrook,

606
00:51:37,908 --> 00:51:39,234
<i>claiming to be her husband.

607
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:40,956
<i>Miss Smith is unmarried.

608
00:51:41,243 --> 00:51:42,404
Who's Mabel Smith?

609
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:44,170
She's the town librarian.

610
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:48,557
Oh,

611
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:50,320
help you boys?

612
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,015
Mabel Smith?

613
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,680
I'm Joe Miller.

614
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,231
Can we sit down
and talk for a second?

615
00:51:57,775 --> 00:51:58,158
Sure.

616
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:13,200
I found an old article
that mentions your name.

617
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:20,143
Why are you showing me this?

618
00:52:20,594 --> 00:52:21,784
I'm looking for him.

619
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:24,230
I'm sorry. I...

620
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,406
I can't help you.

621
00:52:25,665 --> 00:52:26,335
Mabel,

622
00:52:26,786 --> 00:52:29,916
you filed a police report against
this man. You must remember something.

623
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,426
It's been so long.

624
00:52:36,149 --> 00:52:37,707
He said he was my husband.

625
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:40,946
I never saw him before, but...

626
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:43,694
he knew all sorts of things about me.

627
00:52:44,472 --> 00:52:46,932
Things no one knows.

628
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:49,570
What struck me at the time...

629
00:52:51,018 --> 00:52:53,437
was that he seemed so sure, so...

630
00:52:54,326 --> 00:52:56,622
insistent that I believe him.

631
00:52:58,316 --> 00:52:59,027
And do you...

632
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:00,489
Did you believe him?

633
00:53:00,721 --> 00:53:02,567
Oh, no, no, no.

634
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:06,804
But he still haunts me.

635
00:53:09,306 --> 00:53:09,948
You see...

636
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,283
I never married.

637
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,439
And, uh...

638
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,405
He was as close as I came.

639
00:53:29,778 --> 00:53:30,708
What was his name?

640
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,742
Oh, I don't, uh...

641
00:53:34,097 --> 00:53:35,204
I don't remember.

642
00:53:35,484 --> 00:53:38,088
Is there anything else that
you can remember, anything at all?

643
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,221
I can't tell you how
important this is to me.

644
00:53:51,389 --> 00:53:52,660
He gave this to me.

645
00:53:53,684 --> 00:53:55,106
I've never shown anyone.

646
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:57,893
Now, that's...

647
00:53:58,002 --> 00:53:59,684
him, and that's me.

648
00:54:01,146 --> 00:54:03,046
But that picture was never taken.

649
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:07,132
I never saw him before
he showed up on my doorstep.

650
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,169
And this...

651
00:54:10,973 --> 00:54:14,280
this is the part that I can't sit with.

652
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:20,212
Yes,

653
00:54:20,335 --> 00:54:21,647
that's my handwriting.

654
00:54:26,171 --> 00:54:27,484
I still wonder...

655
00:54:28,017 --> 00:54:29,397
if I should've said yes.

656
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,717
"Yes, I remember."

657
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,019
Mabel, may I take this picture?

658
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:41,315
Yes, take it.

659
00:54:42,122 --> 00:54:42,614
Thank you.

660
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:52,003
40 years old,

661
00:54:52,386 --> 00:54:53,301
good as new.

662
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:54,668
It's an object.

663
00:54:56,227 --> 00:54:59,152
Well, Wally, I think I know
why no one's ever found the occupant.

664
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,664
Whatever the event was
that created the objects

665
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:04,293
ripped him out of the world somehow.

666
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,892
Just like the motel room.

667
00:55:07,273 --> 00:55:08,667
His history's been erased.

668
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:12,507
No one remembers him. This picture might
be the only evidence he ever even existed.

669
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:15,886
Yeah, right. A pencil gets plucked out
of existence, nobody cares.

670
00:55:16,788 --> 00:55:17,841
But a whole guy...

671
00:55:18,103 --> 00:55:20,078
And how do you find
a man who doesn't exist?

672
00:55:49,357 --> 00:55:50,492
Oh my God!

673
00:55:51,257 --> 00:55:52,200
It's real.

674
00:56:00,386 --> 00:56:01,110
Bridgewater.

675
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:01,821
Lee,

676
00:56:02,183 --> 00:56:03,158
sheriff Starns.

677
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:05,681
Good news.
We just picked up your man Dr. Ruber.

678
00:56:06,245 --> 00:56:07,882
You wanted to know
what he did to you?

679
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:08,885
Why don't you ask him?

680
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:09,896
He's at the hospital.

681
00:56:14,681 --> 00:56:16,186
Sood's books.

682
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:18,636
Welcome to Loserville.

683
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:23,167
Any disgusting, wanna-be, coulda-been,
has-been object loser hangs out here.

684
00:56:24,016 --> 00:56:25,598
It makes me sick
to see you here.

685
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:29,012
I need to find something
that IDs the occupant.

686
00:56:29,398 --> 00:56:31,791
Driver's license, some personal item
with his name on it.

687
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,527
The Sood's the guy to ask, but...

688
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,305
He won't help you now.
You pissed him off.

689
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:39,369
Well, I'll apologize to him.
Smooth things over.

690
00:56:39,794 --> 00:56:40,710
Yeah, that'll work.

691
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:41,260
Come on.

692
00:56:41,854 --> 00:56:43,166
Uh, I... I'm...

693
00:56:43,668 --> 00:56:46,060
I'm not coming with you.
Anymore.

694
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:48,028
Those people, my bus ticket...

695
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,591
They're like piranhas.

696
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,854
This whole thing, you're getting in
so deep, it's dangerous for me, man.

697
00:56:56,267 --> 00:56:57,695
I'm sorry, I just can't.

698
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:11,883
You know what, Wally?

699
00:57:12,685 --> 00:57:13,399
You're right.

700
00:57:14,286 --> 00:57:15,270
Thanks for everything.

701
00:57:16,254 --> 00:57:16,929
I owe you.

702
00:57:20,456 --> 00:57:21,208
Hey, Joe?

703
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:25,472
Get her back.

704
00:57:38,032 --> 00:57:39,363
Hi. I'm here to see the Sood.

705
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:40,868
Appointment only.

706
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:49,085
Look, could you just tell the Sood
that I'd like to apologize?

707
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:52,480
Appointment only.

708
00:57:57,206 --> 00:57:58,537
Can I make an appointment?

709
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:01,527
<i>No!

710
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:19,720
Well, well.

711
00:58:21,977 --> 00:58:24,852
Took me a while, detective.
You're a difficult man to track down.

712
00:58:28,748 --> 00:58:31,150
- But every riddle has an answer...
- I don't have it.

713
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:35,153
You'll excuse me
if I don't believe you.

714
00:58:35,404 --> 00:58:36,561
Montague, ask yourself,

715
00:58:36,562 --> 00:58:39,243
would I be walking to
my next destination if I had the key?

716
00:58:39,802 --> 00:58:40,285
So what?

717
00:58:40,844 --> 00:58:43,612
You're just another object-loser?
Well, welcome to the club.

718
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,208
That really a gun in your pocket?

719
00:58:47,134 --> 00:58:47,694
Yes.

720
00:58:54,684 --> 00:58:55,648
Intimidating.

721
00:58:55,803 --> 00:58:56,922
You know the Sood?

722
00:58:57,072 --> 00:58:58,054
Do I know the Sood?

723
00:58:58,055 --> 00:59:01,183
Of course I know the Sood. He's a friend,
he's a colleague. We have dinner.

724
00:59:01,184 --> 00:59:01,645
Good.

725
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,840
Introduce me to him.

726
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:06,946
Sir?

727
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:09,937
Enter.

728
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:18,694
Weasel, how many times
have I got to tell you,

729
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:21,338
keep your stinking
carcass out of my shop.

730
00:59:28,118 --> 00:59:28,890
You too?

731
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:30,260
Pumeet!

732
00:59:30,896 --> 00:59:31,610
Wait, wait.

733
00:59:32,093 --> 00:59:35,581
Sood, listen. I just wanted
to introduce you to my friend... here...

734
00:59:35,716 --> 00:59:38,668
I know you guys got off
on the wrong foot, so...

735
00:59:39,806 --> 00:59:40,520
Kill them.

736
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:41,621
Please, Sood.

737
00:59:43,242 --> 00:59:43,840
Hear me out.

738
00:59:56,853 --> 01:00:00,325
I want to apologize for the disturbance
I caused here a few days ago.

739
01:00:01,252 --> 01:00:03,277
My argument was with Mr. Kreutzfeld.

740
01:00:05,013 --> 01:00:07,695
And I had no right
bringing that argument here.

741
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:09,951
All I want...

742
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,247
is to find this man.

743
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:17,746
The occupant.

744
01:00:21,103 --> 01:00:22,839
There's a guy object?

745
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:24,035
I mean...

746
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,195
There's an object that's a guy?
That... that...

747
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:27,392
That changes everything.

748
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:30,266
You can't find any objects
with this man's name on them.

749
01:00:30,903 --> 01:00:31,424
No,

750
01:00:31,984 --> 01:00:34,183
no driver's license.
No business card.

751
01:00:34,511 --> 01:00:37,231
No such object has ever surfaced.

752
01:00:41,823 --> 01:00:42,691
Here...

753
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:45,392
is where all the known
objects are right now.

754
01:00:45,393 --> 01:00:47,630
Can you find me the pen?
Where's... where's the pen?

755
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:48,537
Pen?

756
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:51,450
How accurate is this?

757
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,320
It's pretty accurate.

758
01:00:53,765 --> 01:00:56,350
I've collected as much history
of the objects as I can.

759
01:00:58,202 --> 01:00:59,070
The key...

760
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:00,556
for instance...

761
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,382
just in the last few weeks,
you've been spotted in Pittsburgh,

762
01:01:06,383 --> 01:01:07,367
New Mexico,

763
01:01:07,714 --> 01:01:08,524
Kansas,

764
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,743
- Cleveland...
- I haven't been to Cleveland.

765
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:17,784
How far back does this go?

766
01:01:18,498 --> 01:01:19,211
Years.

767
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:21,546
Back to the beginning for some objects.

768
01:01:22,298 --> 01:01:24,709
What if you mapped all
their movements all at once?

769
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:27,044
What would that prove?

770
01:01:27,045 --> 01:01:29,653
Well, I'm not sure, but there
might be some sort of a pattern.

771
01:01:29,654 --> 01:01:30,997
Could you just try it, please? 

772
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:45,803
What's that?

773
01:01:47,347 --> 01:01:47,933
What's there?

774
01:01:48,597 --> 01:01:50,248
No object has ever
been through there.

775
01:01:50,928 --> 01:01:51,452
Nothing.

776
01:01:51,823 --> 01:01:52,780
It's the desert.

777
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:54,323
That's where he is.

778
01:01:55,588 --> 01:01:56,684
The occupant in the room.

779
01:01:57,209 --> 01:01:59,323
Somehow, he is keeping
all the objects away.

780
01:02:01,344 --> 01:02:02,559
I need to borrow your car.

781
01:02:02,718 --> 01:02:03,690
Great. I'll drive.

782
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:04,987
Give me the keys.

783
01:02:07,503 --> 01:02:08,568
This is all I have...

784
01:02:09,571 --> 01:02:10,976
Give me... the keys.

785
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:18,322
<i>At the center of the map
is a town called Green Valley.

786
01:02:18,832 --> 01:02:20,406
<i>Doesn't look like much of a town.

787
01:02:20,697 --> 01:02:21,700
<i>From the outskirts,

788
01:02:21,962 --> 01:02:23,151
<i>there's a sanitarium.

789
01:02:23,969 --> 01:02:24,555
<i>Good luck.

790
01:02:26,145 --> 01:02:27,843
We have to hit
Kreutzfeld hard and fast.

791
01:02:28,876 --> 01:02:30,384
It's not gonna be easy getting in.

792
01:02:30,388 --> 01:02:31,164
Leave that to me.

793
01:02:31,546 --> 01:02:32,796
I have someone on the inside.

794
01:02:35,945 --> 01:02:36,423
Look.

795
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:40,019
None of us have ever done
anything like this before.

796
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:43,168
We have no idea
what we're getting into.

797
01:02:43,399 --> 01:02:46,378
But if we don't at least try,
we're gonna end up dead anyway, so...

798
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,971
Let's go. 

799
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:10,613
What are you doing?

800
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,030
Hey.

801
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:13,140
How are you?

802
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:16,131
It's a little project.
It's gonna take a while, though.

803
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:19,833
But I remember Anthony said something
about making ice cream, though.

804
01:03:19,834 --> 01:03:21,397
That wouldn't interest you, would it?

805
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:23,114
Okay.

806
01:03:25,487 --> 01:03:27,147
Hey, close the door, will you, buddy?

807
01:03:41,624 --> 01:03:42,550
We're in position.

808
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:43,699
Very good.

809
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:45,146
Wait for my signal.

810
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:53,770
Yeah?

811
01:03:54,098 --> 01:03:55,082
They're about to attack.

812
01:03:55,777 --> 01:03:56,703
<i>Wise man.

813
01:03:56,872 --> 01:03:58,165
<i>You made the right choice.

814
01:04:54,363 --> 01:04:55,289
No one's here.

815
01:04:56,736 --> 01:04:58,462
Something's wrong.
I think it's a trap.

816
01:04:58,627 --> 01:04:59,321
Get out!

817
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:00,459
Get out now!

818
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:12,575
Let's go.

819
01:05:36,688 --> 01:05:37,556
Don't.

820
01:05:39,138 --> 01:05:40,507
It won't heal.

821
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:44,810
Objects don't work in the room.

822
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:12,918
Hi.

823
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:16,024
Visiting hours are over.

824
01:06:17,066 --> 01:06:18,069
Police business.

825
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,693
I'm here to see a patient.

826
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:23,104
Police, wow.

827
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:24,339
Okay, sure.

828
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,882
Uh, who's the patient?

829
01:06:26,307 --> 01:06:27,329
John Doe.

830
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:32,751
You do have a John Doe here?

831
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:35,625
Yeah.

832
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,477
He's always been here.

833
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:40,602
You should empty your pockets.
He doesn't like things.

834
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:43,304
What do you mean?

835
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:44,828
Things, stuff.

836
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:45,831
Pens,

837
01:06:46,062 --> 01:06:46,641
wallets,

838
01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:48,243
keys.

839
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:49,805
Freaks him out.

840
01:07:15,579 --> 01:07:16,640
The firearm.

841
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:18,685
Stays with me.

842
01:07:50,885 --> 01:07:52,352
My name is Joe Miller.

843
01:07:56,133 --> 01:07:57,638
And I just want to ask you a few...

844
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:01,979
Easy,

845
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:03,175
easy.

846
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:04,487
Easy. It's okay.

847
01:08:05,703 --> 01:08:07,458
It's okay. It's okay.

848
01:08:07,593 --> 01:08:08,577
It's okay.

849
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:10,603
I'm not gonna hurt you.

850
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:12,474
Okay?

851
01:08:14,905 --> 01:08:16,004
I'm not gonna hurt you.

852
01:08:20,518 --> 01:08:21,367
Okay?

853
01:08:24,628 --> 01:08:27,097
I just want to talk to you,
that's all. All right? 

854
01:08:32,016 --> 01:08:33,685
I'm just gonna
sit down right here...

855
01:08:33,695 --> 01:08:34,177
Okay?

856
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:44,093
No! Stop!

857
01:08:56,836 --> 01:08:57,299
Damn.

858
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,509
Oh, my God.

859
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:15,917
Who the hell are you?

860
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:21,145
I just want to know who you are
and what happened in that motel room.

861
01:09:21,743 --> 01:09:24,868
- And if you created the ob...
- Stop talking!

862
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:35,942
I met your wife.

863
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:37,100
Mabel.

864
01:09:38,122 --> 01:09:39,231
She gave me your picture.

865
01:09:39,762 --> 01:09:40,765
She misses you.

866
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,147
Even if she doesn't remember you.

867
01:09:53,864 --> 01:09:55,465
I felt the photograph coming.

868
01:09:58,610 --> 01:09:59,632
I thought maybe...

869
01:10:01,292 --> 01:10:03,337
you might've been...
you might've been my wife.

870
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:05,092
So I let you through.

871
01:10:07,215 --> 01:10:08,045
I'm sorry.

872
01:10:11,286 --> 01:10:12,289
I'm really sorry.

873
01:10:14,584 --> 01:10:16,012
Please. It's very important.

874
01:10:17,556 --> 01:10:20,758
I just need to know,
did you create these objects?

875
01:10:21,144 --> 01:10:21,723
I didn't.

876
01:10:23,054 --> 01:10:24,366
Then where did they come from?

877
01:10:25,389 --> 01:10:26,276
I don't know.

878
01:10:27,569 --> 01:10:29,595
I didn't do anything,
it just happened.

879
01:10:31,813 --> 01:10:32,893
I need your help.

880
01:10:35,845 --> 01:10:38,816
My little girl went into that motel room,
and she never came out.

881
01:10:41,768 --> 01:10:43,215
Can you tell me where she is?

882
01:10:44,218 --> 01:10:45,221
She's still there.

883
01:10:45,472 --> 01:10:46,147
Where?

884
01:10:46,397 --> 01:10:47,864
- In the room.
- No, she's not.

885
01:10:47,865 --> 01:10:50,680
- I've been there, she's gone.
- There's more than one.

886
01:10:52,474 --> 01:10:55,793
- What do you mean, there's more than one?
- There's more than one. Come on.

887
01:10:56,989 --> 01:10:58,224
Can you bring her back?

888
01:11:00,577 --> 01:11:03,163
Please tell me you can bring her back.

889
01:11:04,224 --> 01:11:05,189
I can't.

890
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,616
But you can.

891
01:11:15,723 --> 01:11:16,340
How?

892
01:11:16,803 --> 01:11:18,018
How can I bring her back?

893
01:11:19,176 --> 01:11:20,777
Take me to the motel room.

894
01:11:41,971 --> 01:11:43,611
Almost had me there, Jennifer.

895
01:11:44,209 --> 01:11:45,270
Yeah, too bad.

896
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:50,267
Didn't think you had it in you.

897
01:11:53,372 --> 01:11:55,707
I want you to witness
what I'm about to do.

898
01:11:56,826 --> 01:11:59,160
I know you're scared of it,
but if I'm right...

899
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:02,691
- If I'm right...
- You're not.

900
01:12:06,936 --> 01:12:08,942
I won't harm you
unless you interfere.

901
01:12:26,807 --> 01:12:28,138
I saw him.

902
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:30,473
I...

903
01:12:31,244 --> 01:12:33,058
saw him, he...

904
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,144
I saw him.

905
01:12:37,244 --> 01:12:39,289
I've come a long way, Martin.

906
01:12:41,468 --> 01:12:42,356
Margaret?

907
01:12:45,096 --> 01:12:46,002
Margaret.

908
01:12:47,006 --> 01:12:48,260
I saw him.

909
01:12:48,338 --> 01:12:49,900
Shh, Martin.

910
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:53,122
I saw the man in the room.

911
01:12:55,901 --> 01:12:56,673
What man?

912
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,876
I saw him through this polaroid.

913
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,275
At the motel.

914
01:13:05,918 --> 01:13:07,076
I saw...

915
01:13:07,809 --> 01:13:08,735
the occupant.

916
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:12,824
The living...

917
01:13:13,557 --> 01:13:14,271
object.

918
01:13:18,342 --> 01:13:19,480
This isn't true.

919
01:13:21,081 --> 01:13:21,988
None of it.

920
01:13:24,073 --> 01:13:26,272
He gave me a vision.

921
01:13:26,793 --> 01:13:28,028
In the desert.

922
01:13:30,805 --> 01:13:33,506
He told me that the Order was wrong.

923
01:13:34,799 --> 01:13:36,015
He said...

924
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:39,122
that if I could put all the objects

925
01:13:39,372 --> 01:13:41,224
back together again,

926
01:13:42,112 --> 01:13:43,539
that I wouldn't just

927
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:46,163
talk to God.

928
01:13:50,331 --> 01:13:51,604
He said...

929
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:55,057
I would be God.

930
01:13:55,983 --> 01:13:57,874
That's why you won't kill me,

931
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:00,381
I'm a prophet.

932
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:16,525
Lee.

933
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:19,226
I knew you'd come.

934
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:20,576
Ruber.

935
01:14:23,104 --> 01:14:25,748
Don't smile at me like that.
I want some answers.

936
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,236
Who killed Lou Destefano?

937
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:30,011
I did.

938
01:14:30,397 --> 01:14:31,806
What happened to Anna Miller?

939
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,041
The motel room took her.

940
01:14:33,465 --> 01:14:34,893
You know the motel, Lee.

941
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:36,594
You dreamed about it.

942
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:38,176
How did you know that?

943
01:14:39,068 --> 01:14:41,151
The motel room is
where the objects come from.

944
01:14:42,328 --> 01:14:43,023
And they

945
01:14:43,447 --> 01:14:44,778
protect me.

946
01:14:45,955 --> 01:14:47,455
I'm the prophet

947
01:14:47,456 --> 01:14:49,038
of the objects now.

948
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:51,314
Good-bye, Lee.

949
01:14:52,896 --> 01:14:54,035
You're under arrest!

950
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:57,854
Stop, Ruber,
or I will put a hole in you!

951
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,196
When you're ready
to know the objects, Lee,

952
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:16,338
come find me.

953
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,147
It's ready.

954
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,127
I'm nervous, Anthony.

955
01:15:41,304 --> 01:15:41,998
Karl.

956
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,600
Please don't do this.

957
01:15:45,317 --> 01:15:47,092
I want to see my son.

958
01:16:19,176 --> 01:16:19,813
No!

959
01:16:22,398 --> 01:16:23,074
Daddy?

960
01:16:30,559 --> 01:16:31,273
Isaac.

961
01:16:33,549 --> 01:16:34,321
Daddy?

962
01:16:36,907 --> 01:16:37,563
Yeah.

963
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:42,674
Isaac, no.

964
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:45,646
No, Isaac. Please!

965
01:16:45,839 --> 01:16:46,553
No.

966
01:16:50,682 --> 01:16:51,512
Please!

967
01:16:52,438 --> 01:16:53,209
Come back!

968
01:16:54,849 --> 01:16:55,891
Karl, don't!

969
01:16:58,688 --> 01:16:59,826
<i>I want to see my son.

970
01:17:26,044 --> 01:17:27,086
Joe, don't!

971
01:17:29,999 --> 01:17:30,693
Stop!

972
01:17:56,003 --> 01:17:57,952
I feel like myself again in here.

973
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:06,209
Outside...

974
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:08,930
in the real world,
there's so much

975
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,033
noise in my head.

976
01:18:17,544 --> 01:18:18,547
It's quiet in here.

977
01:18:20,225 --> 01:18:21,190
Who are you?

978
01:18:23,215 --> 01:18:24,199
I used to be

979
01:18:24,488 --> 01:18:26,186
a man named Eddie McCleister.

980
01:18:28,174 --> 01:18:29,022
Used to be?

981
01:18:31,223 --> 01:18:32,052
And now you're...

982
01:18:33,827 --> 01:18:34,965
What, the prime object? 

983
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:36,760
No, there's no prime object.

984
01:18:38,187 --> 01:18:39,942
I'm just an object, like the rest.

985
01:18:41,235 --> 01:18:42,065
I have a will.

986
01:18:42,296 --> 01:18:44,370
That's the only thing
that makes me different.

987
01:18:47,216 --> 01:18:48,566
Except you're alive.

988
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:52,540
Yeah, unfortunately.

989
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:55,530
Unfortunately?

990
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:02,071
Outside this room,

991
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:05,139
the objects all sense each other.

992
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,666
Always.

993
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,344
Like pain.

994
01:19:09,653 --> 01:19:11,351
Electricity, noise.

995
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:14,843
For a conscious mind, it's torture.

996
01:19:24,141 --> 01:19:25,819
You said I could
bring my daughter back.

997
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:28,964
How do I do that?

998
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:31,974
You have to kill me.

999
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:36,527
No.

1000
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:38,919
I can't.

1001
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:40,347
You can.

1002
01:19:40,752 --> 01:19:41,813
Even if I wanted to,

1003
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:45,893
you shot yourself in the mouth.
You... you spat the bullet out. I can'T.

1004
01:19:46,405 --> 01:19:48,141
You can kill me in this room.

1005
01:19:49,642 --> 01:19:50,588
Take the burden.

1006
01:19:51,957 --> 01:19:52,902
What burden?

1007
01:19:53,597 --> 01:19:54,484
Become an object.

1008
01:19:54,716 --> 01:19:55,700
Take my place.

1009
01:19:57,321 --> 01:19:59,501
No, I don't understand.
How... how is that possible?

1010
01:19:59,809 --> 01:20:01,652
One object is destroyed,
another is created.

1011
01:20:01,653 --> 01:20:03,022
Conservation of objects.

1012
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:08,009
Eddie, I can't.

1013
01:20:08,858 --> 01:20:09,919
I... I don't want that.

1014
01:20:10,054 --> 01:20:11,057
I want to die.

1015
01:20:13,179 --> 01:20:14,837
If you want to see
your daughter again,

1016
01:20:14,838 --> 01:20:15,880
you have to kill me.

1017
01:20:15,976 --> 01:20:18,137
Now. Here.
In this motel room.

1018
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:19,642
No.

1019
01:20:21,146 --> 01:20:22,574
No, I won't be a murderer.

1020
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:24,021
Take out your gun.

1021
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:25,992
Please.

1022
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:27,902
End this.

1023
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:30,102
No.

1024
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,185
There's a price for everything, Joe.

1025
01:20:32,186 --> 01:20:34,973
This is the price. This is
the price to get your daughter back.

1026
01:20:41,562 --> 01:20:42,314
Please.

1027
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:03,104
I'll get my daughter back?

1028
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:09,692
Will my past be erased?

1029
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:11,505
Like yours was?

1030
01:21:12,335 --> 01:21:13,299
I don't know.

1031
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:19,434
Will my daughter remember me?

1032
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:20,899
I don't know.

1033
01:21:21,903 --> 01:21:23,253
But she'll be alive.

1034
01:21:25,645 --> 01:21:26,359
I'm sorry.

1035
01:21:46,713 --> 01:21:47,678
God forgive me.

1036
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:01,722
Are you allright?

1037
01:22:02,976 --> 01:22:04,095
What happened?

1038
01:22:05,465 --> 01:22:06,391
Where is he?

1039
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:08,976
I'm sorry.

1040
01:22:11,118 --> 01:22:11,774
Joe?

1041
01:22:11,967 --> 01:22:12,893
He's gone.

1042
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:15,478
Joe, what did you do?

1043
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,430
You have to reset me.

1044
01:22:22,867 --> 01:22:24,160
I'm gonna go in the room.

1045
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,543
And I want you
to reset it with the key.

1046
01:22:28,867 --> 01:22:29,600
I can't.

1047
01:22:30,603 --> 01:22:32,426
You're gonna disappear,
just like Anna did.

1048
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:33,169
I won't.

1049
01:22:34,636 --> 01:22:35,485
I promise.

1050
01:22:54,448 --> 01:22:55,779
You better come back.

1051
01:22:57,168 --> 01:22:57,804
I will.

1052
01:23:10,441 --> 01:23:11,927
Please bring my daughter back.

1053
01:23:18,486 --> 01:23:20,126
Please bring my daughter back.

1054
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:22,885
Please.

1055
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:35,117
- Daddy!
- Anna!

1056
01:23:37,066 --> 01:23:37,934
You're okay?

1057
01:23:38,879 --> 01:23:39,979
- You're okay?
- Yes.

1058
01:23:40,404 --> 01:23:41,542
- You're okay?
- Yes.

1059
01:23:42,449 --> 01:23:43,124
Yes, daddy.

1060
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:45,845
Are you sure you're okay?

1061
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:48,044
You're all right?

1062
01:23:48,237 --> 01:23:50,012
Is that bad man gone?

1063
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:52,327
Yeah.

1064
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:54,410
Yeah, the bad man is gone.

1065
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:56,282
Okay?

1066
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:02,958
Banana, you're safe with me now, okay?

1067
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:05,755
You're safe with me.

1068
01:24:06,063 --> 01:24:06,893
Yeah.

1069
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:09,970
- All right, banana?
- Yeah. 

1070
01:24:10,674 --> 01:24:11,446
Okay.

1071
01:24:11,851 --> 01:24:12,854
Let's get out of here.

1072
01:24:23,388 --> 01:24:24,430
Oh my God.

1073
01:24:28,211 --> 01:24:29,137
How is she?

1074
01:24:29,851 --> 01:24:30,912
Oh, she's all right.

1075
01:24:31,529 --> 01:24:33,246
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

1076
01:24:34,384 --> 01:24:34,886
Yeah.

1077
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:36,101
She's okay.

1078
01:24:38,146 --> 01:24:38,995
Oh, Anna?

1079
01:24:39,786 --> 01:24:40,828
This is Jennifer.

1080
01:24:42,063 --> 01:24:42,603
Hi.

1081
01:24:43,336 --> 01:24:44,012
Hi.

1082
01:24:46,983 --> 01:24:48,642
And Jennifer,
this is my daughter, Anna.

1083
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:55,433
What is it?

1084
01:24:55,684 --> 01:24:56,455
Where are we?

1085
01:25:00,623 --> 01:25:02,591
I will tell you
the whole story later, okay?

1086
01:25:02,842 --> 01:25:03,361
Okay.

1087
01:25:03,362 --> 01:25:05,292
Right now,
I just have one last thing to do.

1088
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:06,796
