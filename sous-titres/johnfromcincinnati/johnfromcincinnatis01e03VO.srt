4
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,006
He's much improved... Shaun.

5
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,953
He's well.

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,511
I had Zippy kiss him.

7
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:57,632
Thought I'd take a shot.

8
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,028
Hi, Shaun.

9
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,030
My name's Dr. Smith.

10
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:15,038
You got hurt
a few hours ago surfing.

11
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:19,203
I'm gonna ask you to do
a few things for me, okay?

12
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:23,686
If you understand me, you just
blink once for yes and twice for no.

13
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,278
Do you understand me?

14
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:31,422
Okay.

15
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,053
- I'm going in there.
- No.

16
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:35,353
You're not.

17
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,245
Well, if he doesn't come out
in a couple of minutes,

18
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:40,092
I'm going back in there...

19
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:42,861
Pretty quick.

20
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,633
She's got some voice
on her, this girl.

21
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,746
Played the girl in
"the phantom of the opera. "

22
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,448
I had tickets twice...

23
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:56,108
To see the show.

24
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:00,587
Oh, yeah. Here's
some blood-drinking

25
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:02,274
Vampire cocksucker

26
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,717
On sale for half
a ham sandwich.

27
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,723
Oh, God, hail Christ.

28
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,460
Pray for yourself
you don't see this man,

29
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,229
you fucking vampire reptiles,

30
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,598
'cause I will cut you
into 50 fucking pieces

31
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,654
before you get your
first question out.

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Well, you seem perfectly
fine to me, Shaun.

33
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,943
I know that tube
is uncomfortable for you.

34
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,751
I'm gonna go outside and tell
your family how you're doing.

35
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,596
Then I'll come back in and I'll
take that out for you, okay?

36
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,823
Okay.

37
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:48,915
Good.

38
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,204
Shaun has recovered.

39
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,839
Once I get the tube
out of his throat,

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,208
I'll come back out and we should talk.

41
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,377
- We can't come in now?
- Not till the tube's out.

42
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,728
It can be uncomfortable
for relatives to watch.

43
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,616
You're gonna pay for that, pal.

44
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,851
Bird shit in my pocket.

45
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,813
I took a dump.

46
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,681
Zippy kissed him.

47
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,778
Shaun's much
improved and well.

48
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,819
Bill thought he'd give it a shot.

49
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:50,022
Shit in bill's pocket.

50
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,109
No no, I got my eye on you.

51
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:56,662
The end is near.

52
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,832
I know.
You told me.

53
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,906
I'd like to bone you, Kai.

54
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,406
You are one smooth-talking city dude.

55
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,263
Oh, who's this now?

56
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,676
Shit.

57
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,297
Do you mind?

58
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,683
There's reporters around the corner.

59
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:40,212
I'm just working up to making
a break for the parking garage.

60
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,077
Can I ask how your
grandson's doing?

61
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,118
He's gonna die.

62
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,419
And my wife doesn't
want me up there.

63
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,930
I got to leave her the car.

64
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,328
I can give you
a ride if you want.

65
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,674
I'll bring my car around.
We can go out the other way.

66
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:33,958
That's where the blind
dago's supposed to come in.

67
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,427
What is this a different version?

68
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,935
When I examined Shaun
on admission,

69
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,724
His neck was broken.

70
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:48,026
His spinal cord was severed
and there was no brain function.

71
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,943
Your grandson had passed away
by every meaningful measure,

72
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,478
But now...

73
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,480
He has come alive.

74
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,316
Showing no sign of any
of those injuries.

75
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:01,820
How badly damaged is his brain?

76
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:03,989
He's... he's fully responsive.

77
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,625
And the monitor is showing
normal electrical activity.

78
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,522
Everything that should move, does.

79
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,996
I don't think his brain
is damaged at all.

80
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,417
How long is he
gonna have to stay in here?

81
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:17,674
This is a very important

82
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:20,236
And delicate part
of this conversation.

83
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,531
No hospital is equipped to deal
with what happened to your grandson.

84
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,382
If he stays,

85
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:29,795
what'll happen to him here
is in the hospital's interest

86
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:31,514
and will be of no benefit to him.

87
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:34,188
So you're saying
we should take him home?

88
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:37,656
As a physician,
I can't say that to you.

89
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,186
What's the word, Kurd?

90
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:51,103
Hey, dad.

91
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,401
Here's this fucking idiot.

92
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,464
Are you gonna get
in the fucking car?

93
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:19,999
Well, I didn't know if you saw me

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
'cause I didn't
want to frighten you.

95
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,272
Are you gonna get in?

96
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,577
How you doin'?
How was the flight, good?

97
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,419
Give me your hand.

98
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,370
Oh! Oh, that's broken!

99
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:39,833
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

100
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,212
I'm half-thinking
I'm gonna need a reason

101
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:45,991
to find out what's
going on in there.

102
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Take you in as an injured friend.

103
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:51,782
- Absolutely.
- I take you in,

104
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,593
you need attention, I'm in there
on the ear about the kid.

105
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:55,966
Right.

106
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:58,637
Who's that? Look.

107
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,205
- Oh, sh... what's that?
- Oh, shit.

108
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:08,452
Oh, christ! Get out!
Scare the snakes off!

109
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:09,982
- Go ahead!
- Where's the snakes?

110
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,526
The reporters!

111
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:14,086
Scare the fucking
reporters over there!

112
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:15,971
- Where?
- Over there.

113
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,015
Over there!

114
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,592
Hey, I've been attacked!
I'm injured!

115
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,161
Look what's happened to me!

116
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:23,759
Help me, please!

117
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:26,106
Please!
Who's a doctor?

118
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,633
Are you a doctor?
Look at me!

119
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:30,002
No, no! Over there!
Over there!

120
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,371
There's one over there.

121
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,641
Please help me. It's broken!
I've been attacked. I'm injured!

122
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,811
I broke my wrist!
I broke my wrist!

123
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,173
I knew it was fucking wrong.

124
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:08,140
Letting him compete.

125
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:12,040
I'm sure it's what he wanted.

126
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,972
Well, the mistake is not him wanting it.

127
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:16,548
The mistake is me letting him.

128
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,987
Sometimes, I think...

129
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,889
You have to let people
follow their heart.

130
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,192
And that whole heat...

131
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,357
Every ride...

132
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,096
It was beautiful to see.

133
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:33,666
What was beautiful? Watching
him milk a closed-out section

134
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,901
to impress a bunch
of fucking judges?

135
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,038
That's not surfing.

136
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:45,277
Yes? Oh, hi, yeah.
I'm glad you called.

137
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,186
Can you tell the lab
that the film looks good?

138
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,649
- Are you with him?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,917
I don't know what's going on,

140
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,952
but the whole family
just left here with Shaun

141
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,622
And it looked to me
like his eyes were open.

142
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,090
He was moving his arms.

143
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:01,263
No, I... I don't
know about that reel.

144
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,729
Has anybody called Mitch?

145
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,364
No, but probably they will soon.

146
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,434
Well, just play it out.

147
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,483
You do any good with him?

148
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:12,938
Yeah, I like the way
the film looked when I saw it.

149
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,074
Yeah, well, smart girl.

150
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,353
You know, that's flapping
your fins for an audience.

151
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,348
That's letting dipshits
define you by a number.

152
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,583
So other dipshits
can compare you

153
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,452
with other numbers
so the other dipshits.

154
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,310
It's know who to pay
to wear their sunglasses

155
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:31,154
So the dipshits in the malls
know which ones to buy.

156
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,495
I just... I shouldn't
have let him go out.

157
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,990
And...
What I'm doing here...

158
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,474
Instead of being at the hospital...

159
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,770
For me and for her.

160
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,415
But I suppose that's...

161
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,360
What it's come to,
between my wife and myself.

162
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:08,327
Would you like to walk?

163
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,366
I'm a friend of the Yosts.

164
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:17,145
And, um... Can you tell me
anything about Shaun?

165
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:18,771
His eyes were open.

166
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,582
Looked to me like
he was moving his arm.

167
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,441
- Can you tell me anything about that?
- No.

168
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:25,876
You're probably not
allowed to talk to anyone

169
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:27,379
Who's not part of the family?

170
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:30,015
This is a restricted area, sir.

171
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,786
Thank you. Thank you
for the work you do.

172
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,065
When my brother-in-law
got shot one time...

173
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,200
Nobody felt like cooking.

174
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:52,371
One wonders, Ramon,
why that comes to mind.

175
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,130
When the Yosts get home, they'll be sad.

176
00:12:57,006 --> 00:12:58,677
They'll have no food.

177
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,380
Should we take them
a nourishing pot-luck dinner?

178
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:04,983
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

179
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,185
Something which can be heated
easily and served without fuss.

180
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:12,887
May I be your wheelman
once I've seen to room 24?

181
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,240
Only to close the door
I left open

182
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,662
As I fled.

183
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:21,700
Or you could leave closing
the door till tomorrow.

184
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,891
I intend no confrontation
with what I saw within,

185
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:27,339
only to mark the boundary between us.

186
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,342
Didn't the poet say, "good
fences make good neighbors"?

187
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,956
No skipping.

188
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,929
- Animate or inanimate?
- Inanimate.

189
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,946
Inanimate.

190
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,822
Do you hear the dead man
singing within, gentlemen?

191
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,376
I'm half-deaf
from the leaf blower.

192
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,245
No, attorney dickstein?

193
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,991
Surfer's ear...
exostosis of the ear canal.

194
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,583
I alone then am...

195
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:14,887
Favored by that
jovially croaking

196
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:16,388
Post-coital falsetto.

197
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,857
Winsomely caricaturing
debbie boone.

198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,870
Maybe we could
get him some pea soup.

199
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,872
Dark knee socks.

200
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:37,409
You're suggesting we go
to a pea soup restaurant,

201
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,832
am I correct, Ramon?

202
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,113
Now that the door is properly closed.

203
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,584
Yeah.

204
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,121
Come.

205
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,390
- Come.
- We'll take mine.

206
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,519
Yeah.

207
00:14:47,894 --> 00:14:49,922
I won, dad.

208
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,312
Good job.

209
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,832
Can't I get out of bed?

210
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,067
It's a three-ring circus
out there now, Shaunie.

211
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,836
If you get out of bed,
we'll be up to five.

212
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,589
What a stupid fuck you are.

213
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,290
Almost got this put on.

214
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:30,029
Explain to me the difference
between you and a monkey in a tree.

215
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,439
Yeah. I don't know.

216
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,372
Would it distract you
if I asked you a question?

217
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,211
I called you yesterday,

218
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:48,113
Butchie wanted to buy an ounce.

219
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,601
Don't give him no dope,
sell him shit, right?

220
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,485
Could you explain your thinking,

221
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,214
If you think I could fathom it?

222
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,624
He's got some insurance,
settlement, Butchie.

223
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,027
Thinks he'll deal
instead of just use.

224
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,563
What he's gonna do is o. D. And die.

225
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,415
Long term, we lose a client.

226
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,895
All the weight I move,
you think Butchie's

227
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:14,961
two dime-bags a day
means anything to me?

228
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:16,975
No, absolutely not.

229
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:19,793
Moron.

230
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,750
So, our angle...

231
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,231
Is what?

232
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:29,555
- No, I'm asking.
- I don't know.

233
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,834
Not why I told you not to sell to him.

234
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:36,259
Not what I flew out here for...

235
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,590
To see shape changers
in a rearview mirror.

236
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,233
- You see 'em now, you see 'em?
- Shut up.

237
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:44,045
Yeah, I go weeks on end
not knowing what I'm up to.

238
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:47,473
Believe me, it's gonna
be a zoo out here

239
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,708
For that family to deal with.

240
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,378
And you're too fucking
ignorant to realize it.

241
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,749
God, what a fracture.

242
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:01,587
When I was a kid,

243
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,889
there were still some of
those old-timers down here

244
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,682
in those driftwood shacks.

245
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,893
Dempsey holder.

246
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,729
You know your history.

247
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,576
Well, like I said...

248
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,774
You like vintage.

249
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,170
Well, you love a thing,
you want to pass it on, or...

250
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,013
You have.

251
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,547
Have you met my son?

252
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,551
Now, Shaun...

253
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,487
You should also know,
you've had an effect

254
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,456
On a lot of people.

255
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,068
You know, who you are.

256
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,402
Come to my hotel.

257
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:02,585
Straight to fucking voicemail.

258
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:06,487
Well, if dad's surfing, he's
not gonna have his phone on him.

259
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:09,088
I'm not a family spokesman,
I'm a retired police officer.

260
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,462
Let's give the yost family
a little privacy...

261
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:12,586
What's that, Bill?

262
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,962
Gawkers, press, candle fanatics.

263
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,598
We're on the precipice
of a clusterfuck.

264
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,755
I'm thinking I'll go
out and thin it out.

265
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:24,803
- I'd appreciate it.
- Happy to do it.

266
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:27,439
Come on, Zip.

267
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,398
Why don't you press yourself
up against the door

268
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,871
and make it impossible to do
what she's asked me to do?

269
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,515
Jesus christ almighty.

270
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,787
John wanted to go look
at some boards at the shop.

271
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,053
I'm gonna bone Kai, Butchie.

272
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,325
I may have to break her jaw first.

273
00:18:46,532 --> 00:18:48,961
No floor boning,
we'll just clear off a couch.

274
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:51,563
Make her see god, John.

275
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,559
I'm gonna try hard enough.

276
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:55,642
Yeah, we'll go out back.

277
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,237
We can jump the fence.

278
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,874
Where is that guy from?

279
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,479
Cincinnati.

280
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:12,985
Shaunie won.

281
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:18,535
Maybe I should leave
your dad another message.

282
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,768
I went off on him.

283
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:32,435
Yeah?

284
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,841
When it looked like
Shaunie was gonna die.

285
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,945
I bet dad held his end up.

286
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,144
Last few days
have been a little strange.

287
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:50,289
I'm not confusing
you two with the huxtables.

288
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,760
Is that freddy out there?

289
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,397
Yeah.

290
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:01,478
Why am I surprised
he's not in hawaii?

291
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,636
'cause he flew out
to beat my balls off.

292
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,438
I don't want any
trouble here, Butchie.

293
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:09,475
We're all right. I mean,
he drove me to the hospital.

294
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,312
He's not surfing.

295
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,847
His boards are in the garage.

296
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:16,915
I mean, if you go up
in the air like he did.

297
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,951
It has to fuck
with your head a little.

298
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,395
- Who, freddy?
- No.

299
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,825
I don't know.

300
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,130
Go tell Shaunie I'll...
I'll be in in a minute.

301
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,721
I'm gonna go have a cigarette.

302
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:37,481
Sure.

303
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:41,306
Excuse me.

304
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:43,442
I have to ask you
your business with the Yosts.

305
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,685
My business is
none of your business.

306
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,965
I believe I just made it my business.

307
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,464
- What is your name, please?
- What's your name?

308
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,986
Bill Jacks. I'm a retired
police officer.

309
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:56,355
And you don't want to make
me ask your name again.

310
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,325
Retired cops don't get my name,

311
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,012
What time it is,

312
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:04,226
or pissed on
if they go up in flames.

313
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:06,527
Well, that would be a mistake
by you pertaining to me.

314
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:08,013
Then go up in flames. I'll piss on ya.

315
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:11,099
'cause I will kick your ass,
retired or not.

316
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,603
I'm a friend of the family, all right?

317
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,544
I'm a friend of the family.

318
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,812
Then they got two friends
looking out for them.

319
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:22,508
And you look out for them how?

320
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:25,931
By seeing when their backs are
turned so you can steal their drapes?

321
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,389
I've flown a long
distance on my own dime

322
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,990
To look out for these people.

323
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,326
I don't have to fly
because I live nearby.

324
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,832
Well, pin a rose on your donkey nose.

325
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,898
Being you won't tell me your real name,

326
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,834
Here's a made up one:

327
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,203
Do not impede me looking
out for these people,

328
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:47,639
Dipshit-who-looks- like-someone-smashed-
his-face-in-with-a-board.

329
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:57,249
Susan, make your own
decision about those exposures

330
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,904
and we'll go over 'em at the lab.

331
00:21:58,905 --> 00:22:00,652
This is bullshit.
Get him over here.

332
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:02,860
Really?

333
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:05,439
Yes, really. They brought him home.

334
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,360
- I may take a ride over there.
- Well, make it fast.

335
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,329
I'm standing around
like a fucking wannabe.

336
00:22:14,786 --> 00:22:16,335
It's the girl who called earlier.

337
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,171
Susan.

338
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,541
She's been following the story.

339
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:24,009
They've taken Shaun home.

340
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,615
Turn around.

341
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,369
Maybe you want to find
yourself a board, John.

342
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:52,623
People take hours with that.

343
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,441
Could be our full date.

344
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,142
Where do we bone, Kai?

345
00:22:58,297 --> 00:23:01,380
If we were gonna bone,
my trailer's out back.

346
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,650
What does "bone" mean, John?

347
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,619
I don't know, Butchie instead.

348
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:11,202
Touch my tits.

349
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,393
Tits don't ring a bell.

350
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,265
- Are we gonna bone?
- We're going to my trailer.

351
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,267
Boning doesn't necessarily ring a bell.

352
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:30,418
I'm not tired.

353
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,112
Okay, you know,
you can read them mags.

354
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:34,947
No need to stay in bed.

355
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,640
Why does Gram want me to?

356
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:40,888
Well, she saw you get hurt.

357
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,797
- I'm okay now.
- You were hurt.

358
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,976
You remember anything,

359
00:23:58,017 --> 00:24:00,039
You know, after you wiped out?

360
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,339
You got fucking done, man.

361
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,110
Owned hard.
You know, Gram...

362
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,908
And Gramps too,

363
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:09,230
they thought you
weren't gonna make it.

364
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,118
A lot of people.

365
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,972
I woke up, I had a tube in.

366
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:25,230
Yeah.

367
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,836
One time I put icy hot in the
crotch of this guy's wetsuit.

368
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:33,228
And Bill was there.
And Zippy.

369
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,140
And then you got better.

370
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:38,544
But before that, they
didn't think you could.

371
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,777
Zippy was dead the day before yesterday.

372
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:45,250
You thought he was dead.

373
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,480
Can I go out on the half-pipe?

374
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:57,389
Your Grams is out there
smoking a cigarette.

375
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:59,164
She's always worried.

376
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,472
Now you understand...
you go out there,

377
00:25:03,473 --> 00:25:06,321
You can't just hug her and say
"I'm okay, Grams" and start to boogie.

378
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:13,954
I let you go out there, you're
gonna do what you're gonna do,

379
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:16,281
but you have to let Grams
do what she has to do.

380
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:18,217
- Cool?
- Thanks, dad.

381
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:22,287
You know, because something
really did happen to you, Shaunie.

382
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:34,643
Don't go to the front of the house.
There's a lot of people out there.

383
00:25:34,644 --> 00:25:36,301
- Okay.
- They heard something happened.

384
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,203
They're just curious, that's all.

385
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:39,522
Okay.

386
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:54,286
Yo, dad, call mom
for christ's sake.

387
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,558
All right?
It's not what you think.

388
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:58,490
Just call her.

389
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:03,927
Hi, Gram.

390
00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:06,455
What are you doing?!

391
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:08,634
Dad said, you know,

392
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,522
I could ride a little while.

393
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,406
- Did he?
- And not to go out front.

394
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:17,676
So dad was full of instructions.

395
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,818
Did he tell you to break your
neck for the second time today?

396
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:26,585
<i>Gram, I feel like a
dork in there laying around.</i>

397
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:28,781
<i>Well, isn't that too goddamn bad?</i>

398
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:31,190
You listen to me! Don't
listen to that fucking idiot!

399
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,935
<i>You stay in here till
you hear me say you can leave!</i>

400
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:50,969
Did you build that half-pipe?

401
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,522
No, ma, you did.

402
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:56,480
And what you did is
blow smoke in the phone!

403
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:59,488
"yeah, ma!
I'll be right there, ma!

404
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:02,166
Sorry I couldn't help, ma!"

405
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:05,624
I didn't even tell Shaun
you were gonna come help!

406
00:27:05,861 --> 00:27:08,293
'cause I knew what the odds were!

407
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:12,581
"where's my dad, Gram?

408
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,500
Where's my dad?"

409
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:18,217
Now you want him
to break his neck.

410
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,719
We're bonin' now, aren't we?

411
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,091
Now we're boning, Kai.

412
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,603
Boning, John,

413
00:27:47,604 --> 00:27:50,336
Is when you put your
joint in my pussy.

414
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:54,288
That's your joint.

415
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,208
Here's my pussy.

416
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:01,213
Now we're boning.

417
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,587
Has anyone ever
called you slow, John?

418
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,622
Challenged?

419
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:14,960
I don't know, Butchie instead.

420
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:18,790
You know,

421
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,004
if we did bone...

422
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:24,426
I'd feel like I was getting
over on a hot slow guy.

423
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:30,776
See god, Kai.

424
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,996
Motherfucker!

425
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,887
Fuck!

426
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:29,001
Did you slip me a roofy?

427
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:31,057
- I slipped you a roofy.
- Shut up, John.

428
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:34,290
- You don't know what you talkin' about.
- I don't know what I'm talking about.

429
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:36,662
I'm so dizzy.

430
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,680
My piercings feel
like they're in a furnace.

431
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,049
They were in a furnace.

432
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,453
Shut up!

433
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:51,890
Don't do that to me again, John.

434
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:54,186
Never.

435
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:56,528
You fucking hear me?

436
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:00,899
See god, Kai.

437
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,045
If that's what it's like,

438
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,337
I don't want to.

439
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:07,573
That's what it's like.

440
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,268
Thanks.

441
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:52,584
Where's the girl in the porsche?

442
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,620
Yeah, where'd she get to?

443
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:59,411
What you do, celebrate
your birthday over there?

444
00:30:59,412 --> 00:31:00,766
Busy winchell's.

445
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:04,029
It's burnt. Burnt.

446
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,365
It rains, it pours.

447
00:31:14,426 --> 00:31:15,815
Why did she bring him home?

448
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:18,377
He recovered
from his injuries.

449
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:23,916
- What are you talking about?
- A miracle?

450
00:31:32,443 --> 00:31:34,823
What are you gonna say? Tell
him that the bird kissed him?

451
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:38,145
Zippy, Jesus Christ almighty.

452
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:47,506
Mr. Yost, can I have a second
of your time, please?

453
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:49,074
Forget it, forget it.

454
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,377
- It's a simple question.
- Only a few seconds!

455
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:54,763
Why don't you pick that cigarette of
yours off my driveway and swallow it?

456
00:31:57,016 --> 00:32:00,085
<i>Obviously an exhausted
and very relieved...</i>

457
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:15,534
There's another fucking drug casualty.

458
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:37,464
I'm so happy about Shaun.

459
00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:41,827
Do you notice?
I'm smoking in here.

460
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,330
If we'd done things
my way at the hospital...

461
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,901
He wouldn't be alive.

462
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,404
I looked for you when we were leaving.

463
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:54,473
Yeah, I had the phone off.

464
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,638
Just coming to terms with how it
seemed like it was gonna be for Shaunie.

465
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:03,315
Maybe if I ask if you had the phone
off, you'll tell me where you went.

466
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:04,696
I walked away, Cissy.

467
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:07,686
I... you know, I'm not trying
to turn away from that.

468
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:11,119
You know, and I'll...

469
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,036
Take whatever time
I have to...

470
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:14,689
To live into what that means.

471
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,297
I'm... I'm also
not gonna deny...

472
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:21,266
The things you said
to me in that room.

473
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:25,871
You know, it's gonna take some
time living into those, too.

474
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,018
You want to see Shaun?

475
00:33:37,192 --> 00:33:38,686
<i>He's in his room?</i>

476
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:41,286
Over there.

477
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:55,624
What you said to me in the
hospital shamed me, Cissy.

478
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:00,472
And it made me recognize
how my shortcomings.

479
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:02,057
Have hurt you.
And I mean, that's...

480
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:03,561
That's on me to deal with.

481
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:07,693
But I'd just as soon...

482
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:11,383
Shaunie not see me
right now this fucked up.

483
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:17,288
Not being as bright
as you, Mitch,

484
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,675
So full of the wisdom
of the east,

485
00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:22,832
Sounds like you're saying
what's right for you

486
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,096
Is to do whatever
you fucking want.

487
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,890
- Oh, Cissy...
- Which isn't exactly fresh news.

488
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,272
Anyways, we're a little busy here.

489
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,421
Go do your heavy thinking.

490
00:34:32,422 --> 00:34:34,917
Whoever drove you from the hospital.

491
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,242
Can give you a lift.

492
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:41,620
Which is another way of saying...

493
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:45,284
Yeah, we do need time apart.

494
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:47,686
I'm going.
There's a mob outside.

495
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:51,251
I'll go over the back fence.
Everyone better get used to that.

496
00:34:51,252 --> 00:34:52,822
Maybe not you, Mitch.

497
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,248
Doc!

498
00:35:44,678 --> 00:35:45,934
Physician?

499
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,717
Can we ask a couple questions
about the Yosts?

500
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,577
Just one question.

501
00:35:53,578 --> 00:35:56,722
Is that the bay, or the ocean itself?

502
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:17,427
Yeah, you smell the smoke.
I usually do it outside.

503
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:22,839
So how is Shaun?

504
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,087
Breaking my balls to let him skate.

505
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:27,353
Well, I take that as a good sign.

506
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,215
What do you want?

507
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,228
- Sorry.
- No...

508
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:38,901
It's a good question.

509
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:42,981
Are you here to examine him?

510
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:47,540
It's important to me not to
misrepresent myself, Miss. Yost.

511
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:53,403
I'm confident the diagnosis
of Shaun's condition

512
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:56,804
That I gave you and your husband
in that waiting room was correct.

513
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,162
Shaun's x-rays showed

514
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:01,387
catastrophic spinal injury.

515
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:05,691
His E. E.G... the test
that measures brainwaves,

516
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:07,790
Was essentially a flatline.

517
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:08,854
Now,

518
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,223
people don't survive
those injuries as vegetables,

519
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:14,512
Let alone recover fully.

520
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:17,269
Yet I don't doubt
if you let me examine Shaun,

521
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:19,271
I'll confirm that he has recovered.

522
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:21,354
Which brings us

523
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:23,834
face to face with possibilities that,

524
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:27,746
I've been taught deserve no more than a
friendly pat on the head.

525
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:30,376
Which brings me there...
here...

526
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,789
Watching a stranger
tie himself in knots is...

527
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:40,997
Probably not
your idea of fun just now.

528
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:42,127
But...

529
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:46,532
Room's in back.

530
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:48,388
Thank you.

531
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:51,303
You know, I smoke sometimes...

532
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:53,231
A couple a day.

533
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,618
Dad? Hey.

534
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,230
Fuck.

535
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:16,816
It's some mess out front, huh?

536
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:20,232
Yeah, and now I got a nail
right in the back of my knee.

537
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:22,401
Well, you're hanging there
like a side of beef.

538
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:24,136
Oh no no no, god!

539
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:27,010
Don't, don't! Get away!
I don't want to tear the artery.

540
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:29,802
- We gotta get you off there, dad.
- Just wait.

541
00:38:29,803 --> 00:38:32,250
Wait. Just... fuck!

542
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:36,851
- Now come on, here we go...
- Okay, you know what?

543
00:38:36,852 --> 00:38:39,289
Put your... put your thumb above
it just to stop the circulation.

544
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,405
Just shut up, dad!

545
00:38:40,406 --> 00:38:42,521
God damn it! Just to
stop it from spurting!

546
00:38:42,522 --> 00:38:44,007
Oh, what a fountain?

547
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:46,271
- Oh, fuck, is it spurting?
- No, I'm fucking with you.

548
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,824
You're off the hook, dad.

549
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,165
I guess you heard about Shaun.

550
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,170
Yeah, that was... something, huh?

551
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:01,698
Here, come on.
Let's go clean it up in your fort.

552
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:06,062
Where are you going?

553
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:08,013
Thanks.

554
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:26,031
- Now?
- Yeah.

555
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:31,737
Good. Now bring your
fingers toward your face

556
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:33,238
and touch the tip of your nose.

557
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,207
This sucks.

558
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,744
Okay. You can open your eyes.

559
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,952
I want you to push down
on my thumb with your chin

560
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:43,423
as hard as you can.

561
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:45,718
Hard.

562
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,299
Good.

563
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,090
Done. We're all done.

564
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:52,257
Very good.

565
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:55,227
So, was I dead or something?

566
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,524
You... you looked pretty banged
up when they brought you in, Shaun.

567
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,970
But obviously you're fine.

568
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:05,504
If I had any doubts,
I'd restrict your activities.

569
00:40:06,857 --> 00:40:08,507
Did you think I was gonna die?

570
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,725
No, sir.
No, I did not.

571
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:20,419
Well, I'm sure glad I got
the chance to be your doctor.

572
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,216
Thanks for taking care of me.

573
00:40:22,217 --> 00:40:23,358
Sure.

574
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:26,094
That's my dad.

575
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:28,788
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

576
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,127
I was just out here rippin' a few.

577
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,224
- I'll see you, Shaun.
- Can I skate?

578
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:40,117
Whatever's okay with your grandmother.

579
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:41,505
See ya.

580
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:55,854
- What'd the doctor say?
- He wouldn't restrict my activity.

581
00:40:58,024 --> 00:40:59,291
Did he leave?

582
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:00,959
He's out back with my dad.

583
00:41:01,512 --> 00:41:02,628
When did your dad get back?

584
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,463
I guess he came over the fence.

585
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,759
I was a jerk before to your dad.

586
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:15,341
I'm sorry I scared you...

587
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,710
Getting hurt.

588
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:23,315
I guess the doctor
meant you could skate.

589
00:41:24,803 --> 00:41:27,101
He said you had to say it was okay.

590
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:32,061
It's okay.

591
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:36,722
I mean, maybe wait

592
00:41:37,648 --> 00:41:40,199
till your dad's done
talking to the doctor.

593
00:41:40,836 --> 00:41:41,943
Okay.

594
00:41:41,944 --> 00:41:43,447
Because he was scared too,

595
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,646
your dad.

596
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:47,960
Okay. Thanks, Gram.

597
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,256
Okay.

598
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,718
You find a place to light,
would you, doc?

599
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:10,529
I'm having a problem
with my implants, doc.

600
00:42:10,968 --> 00:42:12,531
Implants?

601
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:18,147
It's palaka the ice-cream man.

602
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:21,501
- You know me?
- No.

603
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:23,442
No? 'cause I know your father.

604
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:24,808
Yeah.

605
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,281
Listen, that guy...
that guy in the back,

606
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:29,101
Is that the guy I saw coming in?

607
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:31,084
How do I know
who you saw coming in?

608
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:33,919
You make a good point.
Anyway, he's a doctor?

609
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:37,289
He identified himself as a
doctor to get past the heat.

610
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:39,240
- Yeah, he's a doctor.
- Yeah? Good.

611
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:41,042
Oh, thanks.
Thanks very much.

612
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:42,711
Thanks, dude.

613
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:46,999
You know steady freddy?
I do delivery work for him.

614
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,701
- I thought he was in hawaii.
- No, he... he's here.

615
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:52,272
He broke my wrist.

616
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:54,073
That's why...
'cause, you know...

617
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,172
Anyway, I'm glad you're better.

618
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:57,991
Yo, cool.

619
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:01,850
Hey, I was... you know, we were
in the parking lot when you booked.

620
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:05,084
I was the guy who
stood off the reporters.

621
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,215
I mean, never mind. Don't worry
about it, I got you covered.

622
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:12,536
Yeah, I passed out.
They got that fucking hot.

623
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:15,611
But that's not the first place
you'd think of for implants.

624
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:20,043
Well, it was sort of a "fuck you,
Who gives a fuck?" you know?

625
00:43:23,664 --> 00:43:26,605
35 fucking old-schoolers
write to a magazine.

626
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:30,042
Butchie Yost and his fucking aerials!

627
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:32,878
Stink finger to
the entire fucking sport!

628
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:38,308
Good, douche bags.
If I'm such a bad guy, deal with these.

629
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:45,215
Sensations of burning
like you felt with your implants.

630
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:47,859
Can be caused by I.V. Drug use.

631
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:53,298
What's drug use got to do
with the price of eggs?

632
00:43:53,837 --> 00:43:56,019
You've got a phlebitis
which should be looked at...

633
00:43:56,448 --> 00:43:57,572
Where you shoot up.

634
00:43:58,399 --> 00:43:59,457
If it breaks off,

635
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:02,143
That clot can go places
in your body that

636
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:03,542
you'd prefer it didn't.

637
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:07,244
You should be a doctor.

638
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:11,630
It's also possible that what you felt
had nothing to do with paresthesias.

639
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:14,653
Whatever that means, doc, I'm
busted for being a dope fiend.

640
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:18,415
Why would that make you ineligible
for a paranormal experience?

641
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:21,837
And as Shaun's father,

642
00:44:22,862 --> 00:44:25,097
Maybe your eligibility's enhanced.

643
00:44:31,773 --> 00:44:35,441
- You met my old man, right?
- Mitch, yeah.

644
00:44:37,002 --> 00:44:39,019
Up in the air yesterday.

645
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:42,291
I saw it with my own eyes.

646
00:44:43,498 --> 00:44:46,118
Off the fucking ground.

647
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,924
I wouldn't rule out the
possibility of a connection.

648
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:55,337
Listen to this, doc:
a guy shows up at my door.

649
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:57,696
He creates money in his pants.

650
00:44:59,338 --> 00:45:00,363
Plastic.

651
00:45:01,107 --> 00:45:03,305
A platinum fucking credit card

652
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:06,198
with an unspecified
upper credit authority.

653
00:45:07,884 --> 00:45:09,311
His cell phone...

654
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:11,043
Unlimited calling minutes?

655
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:14,413
You know, plus
as far as getting high,

656
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:17,710
The last couple days have been
One fucking interruption after another.

657
00:45:17,711 --> 00:45:21,053
You know, I should be on the floor
dope-sick and I don't feel that bad.

658
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:28,727
What's the matter?

659
00:45:32,765 --> 00:45:34,733
I am so happy.

660
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:43,942
You take care.

661
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:50,399
Go ahead, Shaun.
Go on out on the half-pipe!

662
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:21,547
But we're bringing them
some nutritious soup.

663
00:46:21,548 --> 00:46:24,099
I don't care if you're
bringing a sikorsky helicopter.

664
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:27,052
Saw plenty of them, didn't we?

665
00:46:27,053 --> 00:46:28,669
We can't let you in.

666
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,956
We let you in,
we gotta let 'em all in.

667
00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:33,025
You need a smack?

668
00:46:33,496 --> 00:46:35,160
No, I don't need a smack.

669
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:37,296
I got my eye on you.

670
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,966
That's that shape changer.

671
00:46:43,526 --> 00:46:45,804
Jesus christ.

672
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,657
What's going on, John?

673
00:46:53,252 --> 00:46:55,581
See god, Kai.
