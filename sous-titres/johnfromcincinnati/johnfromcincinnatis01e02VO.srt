2
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,900
Hey, old man!

3
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,100
<i>I didn't realize
I was this far down.</i>

4
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:13,771
I kept catching
those really long rights.

5
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:15,624
Keep doing that and
you'll end up in rosarita.

6
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,400
I didn't mean to intrude.

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,825
It's a long walk back.
My car is here

8
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,200
if you want a ride.

9
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,811
You should watch your feet.
I stepped on a syringe here yesterday.

10
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,500
Yeah, welcome
to the slooze.

11
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,400
Who's that chick?
Is she a fan of yours?

12
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,100
All my fans are
in retirement homes.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,700
Mitch Yost, you probably
don't remember me,

14
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,900
but I met you once.
Pipe masters.

15
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
I was 15,

16
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:44,100
and I got to tell you
I had a big crush.

17
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,100
- My name is cass.
- Give me a fucking break.

18
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,565
I didn't notice, huh?

19
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,500
I was still knock-kneed
with braces.

20
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, everything changes.

21
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Yeah, I make movies now.

22
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,400
Thanks anyways, pop. I'm
gonna walk and get some air.

23
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,400
- All right, Kal.
- Nice car, chick.

24
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,200
These are hard to find.

25
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,700
I like vintage. What can I say?

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,600
So, I'm doing this film.
It's called "legends".

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
i would love to shoot you for it.

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,500
I know this really isn't
your kind of thing,

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,700
but you know my name
and you've got my number.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,500
Just think about it.

31
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
Bill jacks.

32
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,900
Why'd I hang up? I got
tired of being held on hold.

33
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,000
Good thing I'm not
being robbed here.

34
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm looking into a nut job,
as certain if he's wanted or missing.

35
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,200
I got his prints here.
I want him lifted.

36
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,500
Why am I calling ahead?

37
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,774
Well, anderson, that's
to avoid standing there

38
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:11,700
like a mope with my hat in my
hand someplace I worked 16 years

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,700
while my request
is walked through channels.

40
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,600
What are the prints on?

41
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,975
You ask me that, I think maybe you haven't
tried the water fountain this morning.

42
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:22,865
Because being the nutjob drank

43
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,100
from the station house fountain
yesterday, anderson.

44
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,500
His prints are on the fucking handle
which I am in fucking possession of.

45
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,651
Hey, you know what?
Fuck you.

46
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:32,205
Where are you gonna drink?
Try the toilet.

47
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,100
And while you're in there,
go fuck yourself.

48
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,600
But you really ought to be doing is
updating the goddamn bulletin board!

49
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,500
Preparation for the celebration
of the millennium

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,700
was a goddamn disgrace.

51
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,000
16 fucking years.

52
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,100
How did you sleep?

53
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,800
How did you sleep?

54
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,300
I slept, you know?

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,100
You know, I do know that I'm
not feeling dope-sick right now.

56
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:20,400
What are you doing? You got
to take a horrendous dump too?

57
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,129
Because I got to take
a horrendous dump, pal.

58
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,500
I got to take
a horrendous dump.

59
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Fuck.

60
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Firsties on the can. I got the face.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,900
Damn, but make it quick, all right?

62
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,300
Drop your pants. Ass on
that seat, baby, and push.

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,800
I gots to go.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,100
Come on.

65
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,100
Oh, shit. Are you shy about
doing your business, John?

66
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,700
I'm shy about
doing my business.

67
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,100
Shit, I haven't seen you dump
or take leak since you got here.

68
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,800
Do you want me
to step outside?

69
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,100
<i>I don't know Butchie instead.</i>

70
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,700
Hey, we all have
our quirks and wrinkles, pal.

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,100
It is all good.

72
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,946
Jojo got through his heat.

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,600
Anyways.

74
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
Shaunie Yost.

75
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,400
<i>I got your demo, man.
it rocks.</i>

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,400
<i>It's about Shaun, and the event
at huntington.</i>

77
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,400
<i>give me two minutes
to tell you what I can do.</i>

78
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,400
Well, hurry up.

79
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
Mitch will be home
any minute.

80
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
What's shaking, Ramon?

81
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,300
Dickstein said
new owner's coming over.

82
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,300
Strapped like
he was yesterday?

83
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Should be relevant to you, since
you're supposed to be gone now.

84
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,100
You dumped out, John?

85
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm dumped out.

86
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,800
Stand up and pull your pants up.

87
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900
The kid's turn
on the crapper.

88
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,700
There you go.
Come on.

89
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Do that outside.
I got to go.

90
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,500
Here.

91
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,900
Park it right here, my man.

92
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,700
Good, well done.

93
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,400
A- plus on
the fume-control, pal.

94
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
<i>Radio silence now, John
until further notification.</i>

95
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:53,400
this is a dump that a
grown man can be proud of.

96
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,900
What the hell are you doing here?

97
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,400
<i> You need to hear him.</i>

98
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Shaun's back in at huntington.

99
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
You muscled him in.

100
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,000
<i>yeah, that's
the way it goes, Shaunie.</i>

101
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,700
<i>You miss your heat... </i>

102
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,558
as long as you can hear the
money talk, you got no problem.

103
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,729
<i>You just sign up with the man,</i>

104
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,000
<i>get the sponsor's push,
win yourself a Hummer.</i>

105
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,900
Just this once, Mitch,

106
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,700
think what Shaun wants.

107
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,900
You know, I was a grom

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,900
<i>just like you once.
always in the water.</i>

109
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:37,900
totally stoked 24/7.

110
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,000
I felt like I was tapping
into something bigger.

111
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,600
and I'll tell you, a lot of people can
paddle out there and get that rush,

112
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,100
but to be able to give them a
taste of it just by watching...

113
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,900
No, that's something different.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I never had that.

115
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,500
Not like you and your dad...

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,300
<i>and your grandpa.</i>

117
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300
<i>But I could see that people would pay</i>

118
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:02,100
to see those who could do it.

119
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
And I made some money.

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
And I made some mistakes.

121
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,400
<i>Your dad was one of them.</i>

122
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,200
I was young, he was changing the sport.

123
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,500
All I could see was that him being
a bad boy was good for business.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I thought the image was the thing.

125
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,800
What I see now...

126
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,700
What's taken me
years to see...

127
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,431
Is the thing itself...

128
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:27,753
that's the thing.

129
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:29,686
And I don't have to show
them any more than that.

130
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,999
To get them to buy the thing
that you want to sell them.

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,300
Well what if I'm selling
them the thing for itself?

132
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,300
I think you're a fucking saint.

133
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Well, I got all the money I need, Cissy.

134
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Yeah, well, that makes
it a little easier.

135
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:44,000
It's the way
some of us need it.

136
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Does that rule me off the team?

137
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,000
<i>I'd like to compete.</i>

138
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,700
I like it.

139
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,500
<i>If you feel me going
off with Shaun, just tell me.</i>

140
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
I would be grateful to hear it.

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,700
No image.

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,100
Just him and some really great waves.

143
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,700
So huntington's crossed-up swell.

144
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,001
What do you think?
You want to try the new stick.

145
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,300
I might try it.

146
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
A day like this,

147
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,000
if you can get the dealer's
ass out of bed,

148
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,039
the pier's a nice place to cop a fix.

149
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:52,100
Let's get the dealer's ass out of bed.

150
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,700
We're not here to score, my brother.

151
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,800
Although I can't say why
I'm not getting dope-sick.

152
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,500
Found your man, frat boy?

153
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Comfy cozy, sweet pea.

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,250
How didn't I figure you two
would know each other?

155
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:14,700
We don't. I drove him over
to your place yesterday.

156
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,400
I never got high overseas
like I needed to get after that ride.

157
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,389
Did you come in through the slooze?

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,713
And don't go over the railing!

159
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:26,800
I came in from the slooze and
I won't go over the railing, Butchie.

160
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,200
<i>Is that where you picked him up?</i>

161
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,300
You think he may
be a mexican?

162
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm trying to get
a line on him, joe.

163
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,600
Why do you think I needed
to fire up that fatty?

164
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
<i>My old man levitated.</i>

165
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,900
<i>I'm not feeling sick. John,
what the hell is going on?</i>

166
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
<i>John, you can be honest
with me, man.</i>

167
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,100
<i>tell me what's going on.</i>

168
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,900
<i>John, tell me what
the fuck is going on.</i>

169
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
What are you looking
at out there, John?

170
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,500
What do you see?

171
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
What do you want, Butchie?

172
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,700
Come on, Pal. We'll figure it all out.

173
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,300
<i>Joe, smoke another fatty, baby.</i>

174
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,400
So he said to meet here
in the office?

175
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,400
Specifically insidethe office.

176
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,600
Seemed in good spirits when he called.

177
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,400
Yesterday too until
he pulled out his gat.

178
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,000
- Buenos dias, Ramon.
-Buenos dias.

179
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,200
And a hearty shalom,
attorney dickstein.

180
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,200
Hot from the panaderia.

181
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,882
- Oh, thank you.
- Empanadas,

182
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,200
churros, coffee.

183
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
I see you drink tea.

184
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,900
Si, antioxidant.

185
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Also, I bear news

186
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,100
that the motel will not be leveled.

187
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Is that so?

188
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:15,500
It is so, Ramon.

189
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,700
I had a vision, gentlemen.

190
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,481
That how you got the numbers
for the jackt?

191
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,200
In fact, Ramon, yes.

192
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,600
I often get visions after my seizures.

193
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,200
Eventful days like yesterday
do tend to bring them on.

194
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Teddy and I had quite the siege.

195
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,100
The next drawing is on tuesday.

196
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,100
I looked it up.

197
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,500
<i>No numbers in last
night's vision, Ramon.</i>

198
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,700
I am called, among other things,
to learn to surf.

199
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,900
I have the perfect board
for you to learn on.

200
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,900
Ain't you glad now you didn't
blow your brains out yesterday?

201
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,800
Motel is closed.

202
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,600
Change in ownership.

203
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,800
Butchie Yost.

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
He went out, Butchie.

205
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,900
He's in number F.

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,700
You could leave it on the door,

207
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,400
if you want to leave a message.

208
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,500
I'll give it to him
when he shows up.

209
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,700
Pastry while you wait?

210
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,400
<i>Why raise a building
for what its walls have seen?</i>

211
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,900
<i>Why not imagine</i>

212
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,099
<i>it's shuttered saloon</i>

213
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,300
<i>as some homier place
of entertainment?</i>

214
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,100
<i>Renovate the guest rooms.</i>

215
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,100
<i>Upgrade,
liberate them.</i>

216
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
<i>Why not?</i>

217
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,800
Room 24.

218
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,400
Excuse me.

219
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
It's his join.

220
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,900
<i>He looks like the bowzer
guy from Sha Na Na.</i>

221
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,800
It's okay.

222
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,400
<i>It's okay.</i>

223
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,700
It's okay.

224
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,700
No, no, no, no.

225
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Shaun, Bill.</i>

226
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,477
Hey, Shaun, come on in.

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,800
Give me a hand here. I'm just about
to clean these cages.

228
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,764
Guess what?

229
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:27,700
You found a dinosaur egg.

230
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,700
I'm back in the contest.

231
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,465
Is that so?

232
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,900
That contest at huntington
I missed yesterday.

233
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,500
This guy is getting me back in.

234
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,300
- My heat's in two hours.
- Jesus, that doesn't leave us much...

235
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,200
My gram and gramps are taking me.

236
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,100
- Is that so?
- This guy talked to them.

237
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,700
We left my dad a message.
Maybe he'll come too.

238
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,965
- Good, fine.
- You want to go up there with us?

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,277
- My gram and gramps are right outside.
- Right outside?

240
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,865
Jesus, Shaun.
No, I can't.

241
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
This is a family outing.
This is...

242
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,900
This is a family thing. I can't go.

243
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,400
No, you go ahead.

244
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Bill's not coming.

245
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,008
- Well there's that.
- Thanks anyway.

246
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,400
- I'll cheer him on from down here.
- That's all right, Bill.

247
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,199
- We understand.
- I got to get after the accumulation.

248
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,378
They're crap machines.

249
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,600
My birds, they're crap machines.

250
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:16,700
<i>You do good, Shaunie.</i>

251
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,100
<i>Drive safe.</i>

252
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,900
Good for them.

253
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,700
Maybe Shaun's ne'er-do-well father

254
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,900
and his jerk-off sidekick
will go up there too.

255
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,000
That would be nice.

256
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,100
<i>She's like the kid's second mother. </i>

257
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,500
<i>I can't believe she saw you
hit on Mitch this morning.</i>

258
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,640
You know, linc,
I actually do make films.

259
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,000
<i>That's the trick, that's what you're supposed
to make her think you're here for. </i>

260
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,300
Arguably, it is what
I'm doing here.

261
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,100
Is it... Arguably?

262
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,300
I'll see you at huntington.

263
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,500
Yeah, you'll see me, but
you won't fucking talk to me.

264
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,299
Yeah, and for christmas, I was thinking
i could either run you over

265
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,100
in the street or enroll you in
a tony robbins seminar.

266
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,600
I guess you and young einstein are out.

267
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,400
Anyway, so Cissy just called,

268
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
and she must have spiked
Mitch's wheat germ.

269
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,100
He's letting Shaun surf
in the contest at huntington.

270
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,225
I bet Shaun would like it
if you went up there.

271
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm not going. I'm hip-deep
in customers here.

272
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,600
Huntington, shit-for-brains.

273
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,665
Did you get Mitch
in your porsche?

274
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,300
<i>you show him how
the gear box worked?</i>

275
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
I make movies.

276
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,629
I want to make one about Mitch.
It's obvious that he respects you a lot,

277
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,694
although it's not as obvious

278
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:04,367
as you and I getting off on
the wrong foot this morning.

279
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,600
No sale, chick.

280
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Mitch's wife just called Cissy.

281
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,200
<i>Shaun's in an event at huntington.</i>

282
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,900
First time Mitch
ever let him enter.

283
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,200
Well, maybe I'll go.

284
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,100
Yeah, maybeI'll go too.

285
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,141
You know, that family's got
enough of their own problems, but

286
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:27,100
can't we all still do our
little parts to make them worse?

287
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,500
I'll tell you something.

288
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,700
And I'm not a frightened
person by nature...

289
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,900
But I'm afraid
here suddenly.

290
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
I'm feeling a real...

291
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Genuine frightened feeling.

292
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Something's behind me or whatever
the hell might be going on.

293
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm afraid here to even
turn around and look.

294
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,700
<i>isn't that
something, zip?</i>

295
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
Brother.

296
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,100
Is that you, Lois?

297
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,300
Is that you, honey?

298
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,565
I wish she'd
come to me.

299
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,700
She used to come
to me in dreams.

300
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,600
<i>Barry:
the motel is haunted.</i>

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
at least room 24
is haunted.

302
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,800
You had mentioned you had an
unpleasant experience there.

303
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,700
It was all one
in my mind.

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,900
Time flies when
you're having fun.

305
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,111
Mega millions are not the broom

306
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:09,000
<i>to sweep
room 24 clean.</i>

307
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,900
Must I say for me?

308
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,000
<i>Isn't "for me" understood?</i>

309
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,700
You're getting
a little hard to follow.

310
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,600
Not for Gilbert Rollins.
He can do it dead.

311
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,200
Well, you're with us now.

312
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,800
- you don't have to go in that room no more.
- fuck room 24.

313
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,500
Thank you.

314
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,400
- Thank you.
- No, it's okay.

315
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I woke up
this morning happy.

316
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,600
I mistook that freedom
for power.

317
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
Ghost showed you
what was what.

318
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.
Yes, Ramon.

319
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,100
Our visions are powerless
against our pasts.

320
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Happiness is helpless
in passing.

321
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,600
Please, god.

322
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,800
<i>Help me live.</i>

323
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,100
<i>I forgive gilbert rollins.</i>

324
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:14,000
I forgive Butchie Yost.

325
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
<i>Thank you for my friends.</i>

326
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,500
- Amen.
- Amen.

327
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,800
Amen.

328
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,904
You don't think that's
going through, Marco,

329
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:37,460
<i>because he's hanging with Butchie.</i>

330
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,800
<i>and if he's hanging with
Butchie, he ain't juiced.</i>

331
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,200
He's juiced.

332
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,700
<i>I am hanging
with a man of means.</i>

333
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,800
<i>This is my brother
from another mother</i>

334
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:48,700
<i>from the side of the family
with some cheese.</i>

335
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
And if that doesn't
go through, this will.

336
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,400
And that ain't my cock!

337
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,600
You are in for
a big surprise, Marco.

338
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
That's right!
That's right, ladies.

339
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,000
The line forms to my left to blow me.

340
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
The line forms to Butchie's left.

341
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Okay, just to see how much
fuel we have in this rocket,

342
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,900
I will take half of the...

343
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,200
No, I will take
the whole row of Chivas Regals.

344
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,700
Could we try my dad again?

345
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,300
Sure we can.

346
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,300
<i>Can I call him?</i>

347
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:32,569
Then why don't we
get out of the car

348
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,100
and bang our heads on that lamp
post until the light changes?

349
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,800
Do not fall in love with
the cardboard models, John.

350
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,000
Papercuts on the penis...
very painful.

351
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,100
Wait till the...
no no no no.

352
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,600
Jesus, John.

353
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,700
What the fuck?
Okay, follow my lead.

354
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,024
I say this from the bottom of my
heart, brother, and with all the love

355
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,700
but I'm picking up you don't do
too well with traffic, do you?

356
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,400
I don't do too well with traffic.

357
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,024
Which leads me to believe...
Come on, come on, come on.

358
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,500
Quick, follow me.

359
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Leads me to believe that
you're not from around here.

360
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:12,000
- I'm not from around here, Butchie.
- Oh yeah, no?

361
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:14,400
Or any other metropolis
for that matter.

362
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,699
I'm feeling kind of a,
you know, small town.

363
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
Not a farm town, but a small town.

364
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,800
A small town like, you know,
I'm feeling a little Cincinnati.

365
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,000
- I am from Cincinnati!
- Get the fuck out.

366
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,000
- You get the fuck out.
- Get the fuck out.

367
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,400
The housing brain unit's
open 24 hours, baby.

368
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:32,700
<i>Linc, this is bullshit.</i>

369
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,800
<i>My kid earned his spot in this round.</i>

370
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,900
<i>What is this?</i>

371
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,565
What this is, Mr. Dolan,
is your son's main sponsor,

372
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,000
who is about to send him and
you on a mag trip to Sumatra,

373
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:48,600
is saying tommy had to take
one for the team.

374
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
<i>Yeah, okay, team is one thing.</i>

375
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,800
<i>But Butchie Yost's kid,
that's something else.</i>

376
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,600
<i>You're not gonna let me be polite?</i>

377
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
you do not get a vote
about Shaunie Yost.

378
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,600
You get to vote on whether
or not you pass on Sumatra.

379
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,800
<i>That's the horn for the junior finals. </i>

380
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,900
<i>Remember it's 30 minutes
for each surfer. </i>

381
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,200
<i>The three highest
scoring waves count. </i>

382
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,300
<i>First to surf is in yellow. </i>

383
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,500
<i>Nice turn over the top. </i>

384
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,200
<i>That's Shaun Yost
picking one up on the outside. </i>

385
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,600
<i>Looks like a party wave out there. </i>

386
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,900
<i>Oh yeah, that could
be interference on red. </i>

387
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,500
Watch this.

388
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,212
Yeah, Shaunie!

389
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
Your kid sticks one like that,

390
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
you come back and piss in my ear.

391
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,800
<i>One thing for certain, these kids
definitely know how to handle them. </i>

392
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,965
<i>Nice turn, cut back. </i>

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,800
<i>And he's milking that one
all he can. </i>

394
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,000
<i>He's got it won.</i>

395
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,300
Right? Hands down.

396
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,500
Unless they're completely fucking blind.

397
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,000
Here we go.

398
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,200
<i>I could throw one down tonight.
Get off my girl, Johnny monad.</i>

399
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,600
What the fuck?

400
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,700
Wait here, John. Wait here.

401
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,700
Hey, Freddy, did I get
teleported to fucking hawaii or...

402
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Motherfucker!

403
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,799
What's that you say,
Butchie, huh?

404
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,200
<i>You're gonna drown me
in a cop tsunami?</i>

405
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,400
Or whatever faggot threat
you left on my machine?

406
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,100
That call was a mistake.

407
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,900
<i>No, that call was
a fucking favor to me.</i>

408
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It reminded me of what
a fuckup you turned into,

409
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,600
instead who I watched surf rocky point.

410
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,100
I was pissed off you beat me
on the fucking buy.

411
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,500
You got no business
buying a lid of smack.

412
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,900
I got a fucking injury settlement.
I was looking to make a move.

413
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
It's not like I got many left.

414
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,400
Fuck your sad story, Butchie.

415
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,700
You'd have od'ed and died
before you sold your third bag.

416
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,300
What are you looking at, big eyes?

417
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
You want some of that?

418
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
- I want some.
- yeah?!

419
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,500
Freddy, he ain't all there!

420
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,700
Well, now he's there even less.

421
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,000
Don't fucking hit him anymore.

422
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,100
It's just an earthquake,
John. It happens all the time.

423
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,300
What do you want, Butchie Yost?

424
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,300
You'll remember, to expedite closing,

425
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,267
you had me waive
the physical inspections.

426
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,200
I absolve you if the walls tumble down.

427
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,200
Oh, boy.

428
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,900
Oh, what the hell is going on now?

429
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,265
Anderson, hey, Bill Jacks.

430
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,800
Hey, did you guys feel
a temblor over there just now?

431
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,300
No, because I felt like
i just felt a temblor.

432
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,600
All right, Anderson!

433
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
<i>Oh, a socal tremor there. </i>

434
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,700
<i>Dude, I felt that. </i>

435
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,000
Big fucking earthquaker !

436
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,950
Wave of the day, the judges
are doing the boogaloo

437
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,416
<i>'cause of a little
fucking earthquake.</i>

438
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,400
You had it won already, bro!

439
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,600
I think they missed it.

440
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Well, if they didn't miss
the entire heat, he's fine.

441
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,000
<i>He's not up.</i>

442
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,900
He's not up. He didn't come up.

443
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
<i>He never came up!</i>

444
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,700
Shit!

445
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,600
Look at you swinging, Zip.

446
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
It was a temblor.

447
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Seems minor.

448
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,200
Minor temblor.

449
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,700
And the old man's still got his marbles.

450
00:31:27,057 --> 00:31:29,454
<i>Do you find that your emotions
are getting the best of you?</i>

451
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,473
<i>I would say so.
I mean, when she pushed me... </i>

452
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,700
We're closed.

453
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,000
Instead of what you want to see,

454
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,300
see what the fuck is
in front of you.

455
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,800
It's how you get 17 safe deposits.

456
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,200
Fuck you surfing rocky point!

457
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,000
Fuck watching you
from my fucking porch.

458
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,200
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

459
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,600
- Phone call for Butchie.
- Yeah?

460
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,800
You piece of shit! What's
with your fucking phone?

461
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,100
The battery died.

462
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,600
<i>- Yeah, what a shock.
- Uh, no hurry.</i>

463
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Whenever he's done...
Phone, just...

464
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,100
Is that what you called to talk
to me about, my fucking phone?!

465
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:15,100
Shaunie broke his neck at huntington.

466
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,300
- Is he gonna be all right?
- He broke his neck!

467
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
They're airlifting him
to mercy hospital.

468
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,378
Of course, if you gave
any kind of shit,

469
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:27,527
I wouldn't have to be telling you
this 'cause you would've been here.

470
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,900
What the fuck you talking about, he's at
huntington? Nobody fucking told me dick!

471
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:32,565
<i>Your battery's dead. </i>

472
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,399
What, you couldn't drive four
fucking blocks out of your way

473
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,500
- To come down here and tell me?
- Why,

474
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:41,600
'cause you've never been anywhe
for anybody? Why waste the gas?

475
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,700
So what are you saying, dad?
Is he gonna die?

476
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,165
<i>Go ahead out for pizza. </i>

477
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,100
I can leave word with
the manager.

478
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,600
What's going on?

479
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,400
Come on, John. We're gonna take a ride.

480
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,700
Garage door Tijuana, Freddy, to cop.

481
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,930
And you better not try and stop me
unless you're ready to fucking kill me.

482
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:06,614
Look, my kid got hurt.
He broke his neck.

483
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:09,200
- I can't handle it straight.
- I'm holding.

484
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,900
Get in the car.

485
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Go get the dope and bring it back to me.

486
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,600
Get in the car
or I'll shoot you,

487
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,097
him and the three guys
in the fucking office.

488
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:22,639
What do you want ?

489
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:26,899
I didn't drop a dime on you,

490
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,890
if you're thinking about
killing me in that car.

491
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:31,400
Go ahead, go.

492
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,100
Well, they seem
to have worked it out.

493
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,900
His father said
his son had an accident...

494
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,500
Butchie.

495
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,700
They make these fucking
cars for midgets.

496
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,265
I hate coming to this fucking country.

497
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,365
Sunset beach, the kid you
used to put on your back

498
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,800
and paddling out to for
him to watch from the channel...

499
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,500
That's the one broke his neck now?

500
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,800
It's the only one
i know I got, Freddy.

501
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,200
Some fucked-up shit.

502
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,699
I thought of that on the way
to the airport this morning.

503
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,700
That is some fucked-up shit.

504
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,400
Then till now I hadn't
thought of it fucking once.

505
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,600
That mope in the back seat
keeps changing fucking shapes.

506
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,500
Who the fuck are they?

507
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,500
I want you to go in here, Butchie, and
I want you to act like a fucking man.

508
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
The business between us,
we'll deal with later.

509
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,500
Well, you didn't get me high,
but you didn't kill me either.

510
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,700
Just shut the fuck up and get out.

511
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,000
Take this shape-changing mope with you.

512
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,700
- I ain't afraid of you, Pal.
- I ain't afraid of you.

513
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
I don't give a fuck
what you are.

514
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,900
- I ain't afraid of you, Pal.
- I took more acid...

515
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,900
Than you ate cheerios
for fucking breakfast.

516
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,500
In a volcano.

517
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,500
The fucking hallaka-halama-vaka
fucking thing.

518
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,100
Haleakala, freddy.

519
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,800
If you move your seat back,

520
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,800
you wouldn't look like
such a fucking monkey.

521
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,500
Get out, before I blow
both your fucking heads off.

522
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,400
Thanks for not killing me.

523
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Come on.

524
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,000
Motherfucking press.
Come here.

525
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,500
Leave the fucking door open.

526
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
Fucking seat belt.

527
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,000
<i>I'd doubt the connection
with the minor area temblors</i>

528
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,300
<i>we've been reporting, bob,
have had much to do with this. </i>

529
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,400
<i>All we know at this point is that
the young surfer broke his neck</i>

530
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,400
<i>while competing
at huntington beach</i>

531
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,800
<i>and has en listed in grave
condition at mercy hospital. </i>

532
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,500
<i>And this is the famous
surfing Yost family?</i>

533
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,500
That could be Shaun.
Who are they discussing?

534
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,200
Where is he?!

535
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,100
What's his condition for Christ's sake?

536
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,200
Oh my god!

537
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,900
Don't yell at me.
Don't yell at me.

538
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,700
Don't yell at me.
Don't yell at me.

539
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Anderson! Anderson, for God's
sake, don't hang up on me.

540
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,200
Please help me find an injured friend.

541
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,900
I won't intrude on them, but
if there's anything they need...

542
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,165
The family, errands

543
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,800
or whatever the hospital
doesn't provide,

544
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,500
I'm available to do that day or night.

545
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Okay.

546
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,900
Well,

547
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,400
I have terrible news
to share with you.

548
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,400
Shaun has suffered devastating injuries.

549
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,000
The vertebrae at the base of his
skull was crushed when he fell,

550
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,500
and that left him paralyzed
and unable to breathe.

551
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
<i>a machine is breathing for him now,</i>

552
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,800
<i>but the time he was without oxygen</i>

553
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,600
<i>underwater and later</i>

554
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,800
did catastrophic damage.

555
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,400
Our tests show that there is
no electrical activity in Shaun's brain.

556
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,462
So you're saying he's brain-dead.
You're saying there's nothing you can do.

557
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm sorry,

558
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
<i>but I think
that's the case.</i>

559
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,700
we'll run our test again
in the morning,

560
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,350
but I don't expect
to see a change.

561
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:11,142
Why put him through
the tests then?

562
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:14,600
<i>We have to be absolutely certain
of Shaun's condition and prognosis</i>

563
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,100
<i>before later decisions can be made.</i>

564
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,400
Yeah, but you're
absolutely certain now.

565
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,000
A protocol is developed
in these situations.

566
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,161
Your protocol's more
important than his suffering?

567
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,400
To take a patient off life support,

568
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,900
possibly making his organs
available for transplant,

569
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,900
those aren't cliffs you can reclimb.

570
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,500
Why don't you leave
the cliffs out of it?

571
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,900
I understand that you're
suffering terribly.

572
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,900
If it's any consolation, i assure you,

573
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
your grandson is not.

574
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,800
When it suits your protocols,

575
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,400
we take you at your word.
When it suits your protocols

576
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,000
before we can take you
at your word,

577
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,700
you get to crucify him with
another 12 hours of tests.

578
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,600
Mrs. Yost,

579
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,800
<i>do you have anything
you want to ask me?</i>

580
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,800
No. Doctor, go away.

581
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,700
I'll be with Shaun.

582
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,200
You take Shaunie
off that machine, Mitch,

583
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,158
you better never
get in our bed again.

584
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,000
Did you hear anything
that asshole said?

585
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
He needs it to breathe.
He stays on the machine.

586
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
I will murder you in your sleep.

587
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,861
Shaunie is brain-dead, Cissy.

588
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,700
- He's breathing and I can hold him.
- well, get a dog.

589
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
<i>he's dead.</i>

590
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
I want him off the machines.

591
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,500
You want to get back to
your clubhouse, go ahead.

592
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,900
<i>get out, you coward!</i>

593
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,500
get out and leave me
alone with my grandson.

594
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,000
<i>You're afraid
of the hospital, not me.</i>

595
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,300
i got used to it,
all the months I spent

596
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,000
listening to the asshole
I married whine about killing himself

597
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,200
'cause his knee was gone.
He couldn't be king of the waves.

598
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,200
Mitch Yost, the big realist.

599
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,200
"Let's face it, Cissy, he's gone.

600
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,100
Let's just put him
in the ground."

601
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,600
Well, when the time comes,
why don't you just sign

602
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:17,700
<i>whatever papers it is
they need you to sign?</i>

603
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,700
- Should I go in?
- I don't know.

604
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,600
Did he die?

605
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,800
Your mother will explain it.

606
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,500
- Did he die?
- No.

607
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,500
Cissy is in there.

608
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,200
How's it going?

609
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,600
Did you du out this morning?

610
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,300
You need to dump out?

611
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,300
Okay, come on.

612
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,900
He was going for a little
cover-up on the inside,

613
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,700
<i>the water sucked out.</i>

614
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,500
Was he doing good
before he ate it?

615
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,300
He had it won.

616
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,400
Can we go see him?

617
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,700
He's dumping out.

618
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,000
This is my son Mitchell junior.
Shaun's father.

619
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
How do you do?

620
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,200
- Can we go in?
- Please.

621
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,400
Is it okay if touch him?

622
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,800
I thought one day, a day with
no dog fights, I'd square things.

623
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,200
You know, surf some spots
with him in Indonesia, maybe.

624
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,500
I thought we'd have the time.

625
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,900
<i>They asked about
donating Shaun's organs.</i>

626
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,100
He gave his stick away that time
to that one-legged kook kid at trestles.

627
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,800
<i>I surf.</i>

628
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,800
You were great.

629
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,400
You know, I could introduce
you to him if you want.

630
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,100
<i>or you could keep pretending
you don't know each other.</i>

631
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,400
Hi, I'm Linc Stark.

632
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,600
Hi.

633
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,200
- Get with Mitch.
- Can you hold that, please?

634
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,900
Like my heart's beating in a cartoon.

635
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,000
Are you here to see Shaun?

636
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,900
Yes, I am.

637
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,600
Can I see him?

638
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,100
I don't have to decide now
about the organs, right?

639
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,600
I'd still have the 12 hours
to change my mind.

640
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,600
You've been more father
to him than I was.

641
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:39,000
Excuse me.

642
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Okay, zip.

643
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,800
Now, don't hold back on me, pal.

644
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,000
I just took a dump a grown
man would be proud of.

645
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,100
Attaboy.

646
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,500
A- plus for fume control, Butchie?

647
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,900
A- plus, John.

648
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,400
The end is near.

649
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,300
That's it, zip. That's it.

650
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,100
And kiss Shaunie too as long
as we're being stupid.

651
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,900
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
