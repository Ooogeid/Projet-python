4
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:31,808
You know, I'd want to tell you some
things if you'd want to listen.

5
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:42,829
Stop. Shut up. Whatever you
want, you're not getting it.

6
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:46,007
Wherever you are,
fucking stay there

7
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:48,007
and leave us alone!

8
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,475
Oh, come on, Cissy, don't.

9
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:55,871
Come on!

10
00:02:57,014 --> 00:03:00,426
Is she here?
Is she here?

11
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,796
What's going on?

12
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:16,821
- 14 years late.
- Who just pealed out of here?

13
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,937
Shaun, get dressed. You're
going to work with me today.

14
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm supposed
to surf with Sammy.

15
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:24,107
Come on!
get dressed.

16
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:26,438
Just do what your
grandmother says, Shaun.

17
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:32,350
You want to tell me
what the hell is happening?

18
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,190
What's happening...

19
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:36,820
Is the b-side
bombshell

20
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:40,264
has decided she could make
more off of Shaun than in porn.

21
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,764
- That was tina on the phone?
- Yeah,

22
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,285
and in the guinea-red
mustang outside.

23
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:50,509
If she thinks she is
getting him away from me...

24
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,133
She's taken one
too many money shots.

25
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:57,433
Put those shoes on, Shaun.
we're getting out of here.

26
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:59,350
- I want to have some cereal.
- Come on!

27
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,863
Let's go.

28
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,756
See, John,
that freaks me out...

29
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:23,492
You standing there, just staring.

30
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,315
Do you listen to me
when I'm in there?

31
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:29,168
I listen to you.

32
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,206
Work here, Cass.

33
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:38,528
Here, in my hotel room

34
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,934
that I have
no money to pay for?

35
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,731
I will happily work, John,

36
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,783
if you explain
to me what you mean.

37
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:48,155
- Work here.
- Here...

38
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:53,848
In my work area?
With your towels on my barrier?

39
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,862
Huh? How's this, John?

40
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,729
You like this look?

41
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,233
Fuckin' towelheads are gonna
get themselves eradicated.

42
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:08,066
I'm broke, John. Okay?

43
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,203
I am not averse to work,
I believe in it.

44
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:13,012
I believe
in paying my debts.

45
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:16,758
I'll be paying on my student loans
when I'm on social security.

46
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:23,343
Also, like everyone else,
I have issues around money.

47
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:26,402
It's probably a holdover
from my childhood

48
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:28,855
when my pop, he'd leave for
work and then three days later

49
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:31,865
we'd get a call asking
to wire him bus fare home...

50
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,848
From las vegas.

51
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,353
In summary, John,

52
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:41,597
I am no longer able
to trade on my sex

53
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:44,488
and I need to make some money.

54
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,240
You need your camera, Cass.

55
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:55,290
It's safe. It's in the trunk of my car.

56
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,908
Unless linc's had it
repossessed.

57
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,922
Listen to me. Listen
to me. Listen to me!

58
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,051
Do not confuse...

59
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:22,859
My admitting a mistake...
like a gentleman...

60
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,161
With a check made out to you

61
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,413
to subsequently go berserk.

62
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,059
Yes. I got along
with the hawaiian, Zippy.

63
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,289
26 years in law enforcement,

64
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:41,633
I am able to coexist
with shitheels.

65
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:43,736
The subject you raise now

66
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,180
concerns a different kettle of fish.

67
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,314
And for all we know, he may
be a fish, this John.

68
00:06:51,331 --> 00:06:53,802
"I've got
my fisheye on you."

69
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,113
So this isn't an evenhanded
back and forth.

70
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:07,128
This is me on the receiving end of you

71
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,691
delivering unalterable instructions.

72
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,060
Then we can save time
and argumentation.

73
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:14,892
Excuse me
while I take a piss.

74
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,371
If you have
an objection,

75
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:18,741
I'm sure you can
convey it silently

76
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,622
once I get my stream going...

77
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:22,034
...And thereby
shut that down too!

78
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:24,321
Jesus Christ !

79
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,089
This'll pass
in a heartbeat.

80
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,218
You don't want to go
bandying that shit about.

81
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,243
What do you mean?

82
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,714
Just ask the girl...
Marie...

83
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:49,487
On bandying about my...

84
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:51,369
Sleep talk.

85
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,109
- Sleep talk?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:58,226
She's got five or six resting
places on the big island.

87
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,545
Dig her up and ask.

88
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,782
The other night, I heard you
talking in your sleep, right?

89
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:10,273
"Is two days off a crime?
Do I never get to fuckin' relax?"

90
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:13,810
When are you gonna take
the pictures of your wrist?

91
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,181
You know, I'm hesitant.

92
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:20,323
You know? Physicians,
they... They toss it off.

93
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:23,368
"Get yourself an x-ray,"
like "next light go left,"

94
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:26,404
'cause they never hit no bumps
on life's highway, right, boss?

95
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:30,300
Fellas like us, information
ball gets rolling,

96
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,788
next thing you know
we're dead in an avalanche...

97
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,454
Wants, warrants,
failures to appear.

98
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:36,614
Just remember what I said...

99
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:38,370
That other thing.

100
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:41,486
Believe me, it's recorded...

101
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,771
In here.

102
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,358
"You want to wind up
like Marie?

103
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,122
Five pieces."

104
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,106
I'm not pulling out this time.

105
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:06,377
It ends today, Ernie...

106
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:10,557
In this place.

107
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:14,467
I can give you a soda
or a clamato, Joe,

108
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:17,745
but I can't serve you
liquor at all,

109
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,251
not as long as you're
holding that gun.

110
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,294
Why would you want
to make my story

111
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,320
the punch line of your practical joke?
Why, ernie?

112
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:29,761
I didn't, Joe.

113
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,257
He knew I was behind
with my boot off

114
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:36,669
squeezing puss out of where that
punji stick went through my foot.

115
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,044
- Who did?
- This guy you put out there

116
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:42,480
to make me think
he was wounded so bad

117
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,515
and pretend
I brought him back.

118
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:49,055
I never repeated your
story to anyone, Joe.

119
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:52,023
I don't believe
you ever told us.

120
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,794
You...

121
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,559
I told you.

122
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,662
I don't believe so.

123
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,450
Go fuck yourself!

124
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,468
- Shit for brains!
- Would you take that outside?

125
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,878
This isn't funny?

126
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,920
<i>Ass licker!</i>

127
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:08,239
Yeah well, make it funny
over at the no name.

128
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,668
<i>Fuckin' idiot!</i>

129
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:14,078
I always cared more about
my feet than I should have.

130
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:18,583
An infantry man's feet are
as important as his weapon.

131
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:20,818
I couldn't help...

132
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,422
Charlie c or...

133
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:26,190
Pencilhead,

134
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,125
slowdump.

135
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:30,764
None of 'em.

136
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:34,167
I'll bet my daughter's eyes
you did everything you could.

137
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,523
Oh god, forgive me.

138
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,700
You want me to hold that?

139
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,553
I'm not gonna use it.

140
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:53,675
I guess...

141
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,734
However him I found knew,

142
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:59,257
you didn't tell him.

143
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:01,327
No.

144
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,429
I should've told you.

145
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,676
- Where is fucking Kal?
- I don't know.

146
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:22,323
Jesus Christ!

147
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,591
All right. You stay in the store.

148
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:28,206
You keep the doors locked.

149
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:31,371
- Who was it outside the house?
- You do not open the door for anybody.

150
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:32,394
Reporters?

151
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:34,865
Just don't open the goddamned
door unless it's Kal.

152
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,928
What if they try to get in?

153
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,497
Did you hear
what I said, Shaun?

154
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,030
Do you understand me?

155
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:45,660
I'm never gonna get
to surf anymore.

156
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:49,113
Well, that should be
the worst of our problems.

157
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:55,416
Have I ever hit you?

158
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,860
If I hit you, you'll know it.

159
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,117
He stopped
to check the time.

160
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:35,987
Gangbangers
messed up his briefcase.

161
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,477
Do you like your new
clothes from the gift shop?

162
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:41,001
I like my new clothes.

163
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:42,967
Do you think they
bought themselves?

164
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,030
Oh, fuck.

165
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:51,075
So, did you get your end
near the lady, my brother?

166
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:53,831
I got my end near
the lady, my brother.

167
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,613
I boned her
and broke her jaw.

168
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,309
Damn, I'll have to
give her a combat bonus.

169
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,389
Does she work for you?

170
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:06,288
Are you working?

171
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:10,121
Linc's gonna have to give
you a combat bonus, Cass.

172
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,872
Oh, yeah?

173
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,326
Well, linc can
take his combat bonus

174
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:17,822
and shove it up his ass.

175
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,299
Kal!

176
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,366
Get to the shop!

177
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,448
I'm sorry about yesterday!

178
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:38,717
Me and butchie
went looking for John.

179
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,486
Shut up and get
down there

180
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,688
and keep
an eye on Shaun!

181
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,025
- where should I pick him up?
- he's there now!

182
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,658
Lock the door behind you!

183
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,531
<i>Don't let anybody in!</i>

184
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,716
That porno slut who made Shaun

185
00:13:56,717 --> 00:13:58,703
<i>with my scumbag son</i>

186
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,306
<i>and left him on my doorstep</i>

187
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,875
<i>for me to raise</i>

188
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,777
<i>is back in I.B.!</i>

189
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,843
<i>Don't let anybody in!</i>

190
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:11,216
<i>She might have
hired a lawyer</i>

191
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,251
<i>to serve papers!</i>

192
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,771
<i>I'm going home so that
if she comes back.</i>

193
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,592
I will be there to put
a bullet in her heart!

194
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,931
- I'll see you later.
- unbelievable.

195
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,311
Fucking tina, that loser bitch.

196
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:31,169
Hey, butchie,
the less you say now,

197
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,038
the less you have
to take back.

198
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,954
You work here a lot?

199
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:52,891
Every 15 years.

200
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,097
I'll tell you
something fucked up.

201
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:58,745
It'll cost you an extra $500.

202
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:00,577
I'm having a little trouble breathing.

203
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:02,701
Having pain in my chest.

204
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,236
Have you got
heart problems?

205
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,137
Not that I know about.

206
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,772
Fuck.

207
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:14,846
I put frat boy
into my truck...

208
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,550
He took my hand
to his belly...

209
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,220
And said I could help.

210
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:26,691
And if I wasn't wasted,

211
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,760
or it wasn't a joke...

212
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,098
I did.

213
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,668
He took my hand
to his belly...

214
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,672
And he healed.

215
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:48,764
What do you think
about that?

216
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:55,705
What happened?

217
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,369
- he only hit the papers yesterday.

218
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,620
There was no way she was
keeping track of him before that

219
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:01,250
till there was
something in it for her.

220
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,329
So she does not know we have
a shop... The porn queen...

221
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,175
So that is
where I left him.

222
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:08,066
With Kal?

223
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:13,438
I got her out of the
trailer to go to the shop

224
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,340
to keep Shaun company.

225
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,543
Now let that bitch
come back here.

226
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,787
Do not smoke
in here, Cissy.

227
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,147
Jesus Christ!

228
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:30,322
- I levitated.
- What?

229
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,431
Listen, it wasn't a hallucination
like we...

230
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:34,659
Like we thought
when we talked before...

231
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,262
Me being up in the air.

232
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,766
So what about the fascinating
infected-sinus theory?

233
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,287
Cissy, the levitation
was witnessed.

234
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:45,370
And what did
the witness say, Mitch,

235
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:47,606
"whatever"?

236
00:16:50,196 --> 00:16:52,577
- Forget it.
- Thanks for the okay on that.

237
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,347
Let's see how long it takes me.

238
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:55,881
There. Done.

239
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,949
You know, if...
if you'd let me finish,

240
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,352
I was gonna suggest that maybe
there's some connection...

241
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,153
You're a jerk.

242
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:05,690
Instead of floating,
I wish you could fly

243
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,793
500 miles an hour
into a fucking brick wall!

244
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,165
You know what?
not in here.

245
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,031
Give me fucking cigarettes!

246
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,536
That whore...
is coming for Shaun!

247
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,053
That doesn't give you
the right to poison me.

248
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:23,446
Get out then. Get the fuck
out or I will poison you.

249
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,855
Okay, go smoke in the house.

250
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:27,687
You'll see me walking down the driveway.

251
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,209
You get out.

252
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:33,830
Cissy, I'm just
gonna be a minute.

253
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,989
I'm gonna pray for you.

254
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:58,563
Jeez, I wonder
who's smoking reefer.

255
00:18:01,098 --> 00:18:03,448
Shaun, are you trying to
get the place shut down?

256
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,250
Who's gonna catch me?

257
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,118
Gram said don't let anyone in.

258
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,004
Can we get out of here?

259
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:30,340
Go to black's or something?

260
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,713
I can hide in the back of the
car until we get out of town.

261
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,111
No, not right now.

262
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:39,800
Why?

263
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,898
I'm no good at putting
shit into words, shaunie.

264
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,999
Sometimes it takes sticking around
to give things a chance to work out.

265
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,481
We're gonna open for business.

266
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,952
And you're gonna hang here
and not give me any grief.

267
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,485
Better?

268
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:18,013
Yeah. Yeah,
a little better, but...

269
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:20,692
Oh, fuck me...

270
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:22,961
Feel how wet my forehead is.

271
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,306
What are you doing?

272
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,308
I'm wetting a washcloth.

273
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,397
How do you feel?

274
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:03,902
Better, definitely better.

275
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,939
Breaks my heart, but...

276
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,387
Gonna have
to pass on the sex.

277
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:15,180
We don't give refunds.

278
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,554
You want me
to leave you a midol?

279
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:26,907
No, I'm good.

280
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:31,123
What's your name?

281
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,308
Tina blake.

282
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:36,653
Really?

283
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,040
I'm supposed to believe
you didn't know?

284
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,730
Honest to god...

285
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,412
I never let myself
watch porn,

286
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,314
otherwise I'd never
do anything else.

287
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,519
I feel like I'm meeting babe ruth.

288
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,622
Did he fuck a lot
of people at once?

289
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:02,327
I'm linc stark.

290
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:07,833
I feel like
I'm meeting babe ruth.

291
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,076
Yeah, just to let you know,

292
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:30,522
wherever you're being
useless at the moment,

293
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,143
that piece of trash your son
came out of is back in I.B.

294
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:51,910
I hope you're fuckin' happy.

295
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:00,383
Did he rag on me
all the time?

296
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:03,134
Turn me
into a dartboard?

297
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:05,650
I never heard him
say your name.

298
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,709
'Cause he loved me
so much.

299
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,709
Knowing butchie...

300
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,079
That probably would be why.

301
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:16,561
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

302
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,866
10 people in a room,
butchie talks to nine of 'em.

303
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,868
Who does he want to meet?

304
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,879
When we were knowing each
other, he would less ignore you

305
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,947
than knock you
into the wall by accident

306
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,549
four or five times.

307
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:44,093
Did you want
to call him Shaun?

308
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,195
We'd come off tour
and butchie would go

309
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,394
to mitch and Cissy's house
threatening to burn

310
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:55,000
that place down because
they wouldn't call him that.

311
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,097
And those first couple of years,
he didn't care about anything.

312
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:04,564
I mean, I think that's why he started
going aerial... he just didn't.

313
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:07,383
And when he saw they were taking
points away, of course...

314
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:09,614
he just made it his fucking thing.

315
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,283
I thought "Shaun"
sounded like the waves

316
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:19,812
when they were going back out.

317
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,056
And you come back to see
how your boy grew up.

318
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,000
Being that his dad and I
don't talk anymore,

319
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,919
it's probably best you don't tell
butchie we saw each other.

320
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,574
I don't know yet
if butchie's talking to me.

321
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,692
Anything else
I can do to help?

322
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,282
Focus.

323
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:07,737
What do you want?

324
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,108
Not bad, how have you been?

325
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:12,511
Oh, you wanna play nice?

326
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:15,447
You left our baby
on my parents' doorstep.

327
00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:18,817
We didn't have a doorstep,
remember, butchie?

328
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,386
He was two hours old!

329
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,611
Or a bed or food
in the refrigerator,

330
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:25,390
and of course
no one knew where you were.

331
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:28,604
I had...
passport problems.

332
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:30,462
- I want to see Shaun.
- Yeah.

333
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,932
He's in all the papers and you
remember you're his mother?

334
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,003
I never forgot I was his mother.

335
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:50,034
Turn off the fuckin' faucet, Tina.
Give me a fuckin' break.

336
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,910
So you know what I do?

337
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:09,305
Everybody...

338
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:12,083
at the same time while every
dipshit on the internet

339
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,872
whips his skippy watchin'.

340
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:18,710
And you're president of
the I.B. Morality brigade?

341
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,616
Yeah, I know what you do.

342
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,490
I'd like to stop.

343
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,599
I'd like to be his mom.

344
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:37,548
Ain't gonna happen, Tina.

345
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:40,557
Cissy's a pretty good hater.

346
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:43,885
I suppose you putting a good
word in is out of the question?

347
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:47,572
Me coming out against you would
probably improve your chances.

348
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:50,842
I don't know what I'm doing.

349
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,293
Well, I never
let that slow me up.

350
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,551
I don't know what I
thought was gonna happen.

351
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:05,974
Tell her I'm gonna see him...

352
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:07,826
Once, anyway.

353
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,664
Tell her not to stop me.

354
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:16,200
Or what, you're gonna
set yourself on fire?

355
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,598
All right, okay.

356
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,562
You know my mom.

357
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,816
I'll suggest it.

358
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:33,679
Thank you.

359
00:27:58,184 --> 00:27:59,911
Get back up!

360
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:12,381
John... John, don't do that.

361
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:14,626
<i>Look, a new eco-warrior.</i>

362
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,924
Is shaunie still
in lockdown?

363
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:42,153
Who wants to know?

364
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:46,321
- She wants to meet her son.
- Her son?

365
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,963
And you come to me?

366
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,239
She's quitting...

367
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,021
the business.

368
00:28:57,022 --> 00:28:59,038
It's "the business" now?

369
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,843
Smilin' at the camera while
six guys come in your face?

370
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:04,220
Look, you can supervise
or have her sign something,

371
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:05,951
but just one visit
and she's gone.

372
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,018
It's not your fucking business.

373
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:12,208
It's not your business. And
if it were your business,

374
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:15,047
tell me what good could possibly
come out of letting him meet her?

375
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:16,821
Hey, I am the president for life

376
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:19,457
of the tina-blake-can-
go-fuck-herself club, okay?

377
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:25,931
I think she might do something stupid.

378
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,931
'Cause everything up
to now's been high math.

379
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:30,250
No, I mean
she might off herself.

380
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:33,004
That gives her a right to my grandson?

381
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,641
Because she's thinking
about killing herself?

382
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,578
Who doesn't think about
killing herself?

383
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:41,032
Who doesn't think about it
every day of her fuckin' life?

384
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,815
Just drop it.

385
00:29:44,427 --> 00:29:47,392
I thought you were an idiot
before you started shooting dope,

386
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:51,472
but you were a 12-year-old genius
compared to the stupid fuck you are now.

387
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,643
As much acid as I took, I was never
as stupid as you.

388
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,744
I'm outta here.

389
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,887
Tell her she comes
anywhere near Shaun,

390
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:03,568
she won't have to kill
herself, I'll do it for her!

391
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,760
Well, there's another day
of sensational business.

392
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:00,959
Is it my mom
gram's all pissed about?

393
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:03,849
I won't say you told.

394
00:31:04,387 --> 00:31:05,697
Will you give me a break?

395
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:08,992
Was it her this morning
outside the house?

396
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,613
I'm not saying
it wasn't, all right?

397
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:16,201
You keep that to yourself and
don't ask me anything else.

398
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,677
Why'd my mom come back?

399
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:20,545
Was it to see me?

400
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,872
Probably see you...

401
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:27,819
Probably see your dad.

402
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:36,190
Come on, get in.

403
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:39,316
I'll stick around and give
things a chance to work out.

404
00:31:58,513 --> 00:32:00,118
Tell your cunt mother

405
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:02,420
if it's 'cause I'm no good,
that's one thing.

406
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:04,601
But if it's 'cause
I left shaunie at the door,

407
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:06,358
I didn't leave him
'cause I didn't care.

408
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:09,471
I stopped an hour before
and I didn't leave him

409
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,331
'cause when I rang the bell and waited
across the street, nobody answered.

410
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:16,468
And I came back and got him
and sat with him in the cab.

411
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:20,560
And when she came home,
I came and rang again.

412
00:32:20,678 --> 00:32:23,451
And I didn't walk back to the
cab till I saw she'd got him.

413
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:26,344
I waited across the street.

414
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,401
I waited till she came out and
picked him up in his blanket.

415
00:32:29,402 --> 00:32:32,184
- Okay, Tina.
- You tell her I cared about him.

416
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:37,626
If shaunie'd been with me, I'd
have had to stay high to fuck.

417
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:40,150
I'd have been used up
in six months,

418
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:42,661
I'd have been tricking for
nickels outside the bus station.

419
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:44,866
he'd have wound up dead
or in an orphanage.

420
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:47,983
Ask her who I was supposed
to leave him with.

421
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:50,362
Was I supposed to mail him
to your dumpster in cabo?

422
00:32:51,504 --> 00:32:53,379
- Sorry.
- You tell her that's fucked

423
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,329
if it's 'cause
she thinks I didn't care.

424
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,168
All the problems you had with her,

425
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:00,416
as a big a ballbuster
as you talk about her being,

426
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:03,072
I knew with her he'd have
someone paying attention to him.

427
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:05,350
Yeah, mom was never
shy with the attention.

428
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:08,019
Problem was just getting
her out of your fuckin' face.

429
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,278
Would you tell him
he grew up handsome?

430
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:20,765
I was proud
he won his event.

431
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:28,149
Come on, tell him yourself.

432
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:48,466
What a day.

433
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:50,896
What a great day, huh, John?

434
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:53,828
Got to meet
some hare krishnas,

435
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:55,667
hang out with
some eco-warriors.

436
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:58,771
You got to dance in your
first little drum circle.

437
00:33:58,838 --> 00:34:00,805
Work here, Cass.

438
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:04,042
So what I'm thinking
in terms of getting

439
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,539
this wonderful work seen
by as many eyes as we can,

440
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,472
is you know, maybe...

441
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:11,283
Maybe I should get back
in touch with linc stark.

442
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,719
I mean, if I had
to eat a little crow

443
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:18,423
and go back to work
on some other project,

444
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:21,760
to access, you know,
linc's experience

445
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:24,362
and the structure
of his organization,

446
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,831
it'd be for the sake of
this great work we're doing.

447
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:28,952
You know what I mean?

448
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:30,364
I know what you mean.

449
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:34,549
Or, as an alternative, John,

450
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,842
you could take
your hand off my cheek

451
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:40,249
and go up in the air like I saw
Mitch Yost do in this very room.

452
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,785
I know that there's
something going on.

453
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:51,234
And I don't doubt that you're
in the middle of it, John.

454
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,959
But the thing...

455
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,629
You know
what the thing is,

456
00:34:56,842 --> 00:34:59,413
is that I am still a girl...

457
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:02,501
From hibbing, minnesota.

458
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:04,402
I still grew up hungry,

459
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,761
and I still want to have a say

460
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:08,006
what part I play
in the christmas pageant.

461
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:14,346
Show me that I have a little pull.

462
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:18,650
Go up in the air for Cass-Kal.

463
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:23,555
The camera's up in the air.

464
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:30,328
Get your hands off me.

465
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,992
It's in the camera?

466
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:35,487
It's in the camera.

467
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:40,472
Work here, Cass.

468
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:44,614
Okay.

469
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:49,481
Here we go.

470
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,883
Abracadabra.

471
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,854
Transforming my work area...

472
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:59,139
Into your sleep area.

473
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,431
I'm gonna find it
in the camera tomorrow.

474
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:15,207
Look, John,
a leap of faith, huh?

475
00:36:19,546 --> 00:36:21,378
Abracadabra.

476
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:57,849
Let's hang out all night
and steal their morning paper.

477
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:20,348
You saved their life, Tina...

478
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,208
Giving her Shaunie.

479
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:26,111
Man, things were
so fucked up back then.

480
00:37:27,758 --> 00:37:29,314
Dad was hurt.

481
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,385
They weren't that long
back from the islands.

482
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,854
I know a lot of shit went
down over there, I think.

483
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,757
Maybe stepping out
on each other.

484
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,033
A lot of acid.

485
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:44,604
Even after you were done
stealing from their stash?

486
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:47,630
That was a nature project for school.

487
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:58,240
It was coming apart at the seams
for my mom, what I'm trying to say.

488
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:00,245
Sure wasn't
doing you any good.

489
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:02,881
The second she'd lay eyes on
you, she'd start screaming.

490
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:05,613
Well, maybe it's because
she laid eyes on you.

491
00:38:07,377 --> 00:38:09,394
It wasn't a burden
you put on her.

492
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:11,656
You know, getting shaunie
to hold was a gift.

493
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,360
She held on real tight
a long fuckin' time.

494
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:58,270
Get inside.

495
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:01,598
Tonight is the wrong night

496
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,742
to be creeping around.

497
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:05,817
She's outside.

498
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:09,793
What?

499
00:39:11,188 --> 00:39:13,146
Like every other thing
you can't hide him from.

500
00:39:15,555 --> 00:39:17,658
Now let's go ask real nice
if you can go peek

501
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,155
on how good he turned out.

502
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,811
How do you know
she's out there?

503
00:39:26,812 --> 00:39:28,536
She's with butchie. I saw them.

504
00:39:28,537 --> 00:39:30,469
They send you in here?

505
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,646
I saw them, Cissy. I went around
back so they wouldn't see me.

506
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:36,708
To tell me to let
her in? And him?

507
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:39,376
So they can fuck up shaunie
like everything else?

508
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:48,787
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

509
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:52,691
Shoot me then. Take that gun and
shoot me if you want her to see him.

510
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:58,165
You sit down, Cissy.
you sit down at that table.

511
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:02,467
Light yourself a cigarette.

512
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:40,138
She only wants to look at him, mom...

513
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,257
Then she'll go.

514
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:53,741
He's sleeping.

515
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,638
Do not wake him up.

516
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:44,347
Thank you.

517
00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:22,974
Hey, where are you
going with my gun?

518
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:25,310
Out of your fuckin' house.

519
00:43:07,092 --> 00:43:08,689
What do you see?

520
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:14,182
The stars.

521
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:22,541
Clouds

522
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:24,558
Of course lower down.

523
00:43:30,517 --> 00:43:32,944
Partial moon.

524
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:39,072
Plane going

525
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:43,255
A bloodbath.

526
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:46,558
Destination bloodbath,

527
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:49,661
plane going who knows where. All aboard!

528
00:43:50,613 --> 00:43:52,209
Prepare for war, my brother.

00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,680
Prepare for war! all aboard!

530
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,604
Plane going who knows where!
All aboard!

531
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:06,411
I'm giving hawaii to moana.

532
00:44:15,412 --> 00:44:17,489
He's gonna think
I mean to kill him.

533
00:44:19,177 --> 00:44:20,790
Come try to kill me.

534
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:42,080
- He don't look dope sick.
- Ain't dope sick. He ain't using,

535
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:44,382
what I overheard
under the half-pipe.

536
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,255
Think maybe he's
coppin' somewheres else?

537
00:44:50,323 --> 00:44:52,958
I put it out there...
no harm, no foul.

538
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:55,442
You've got a special
history with him...

539
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,762
We just want to be notified.

540
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:58,213
Fuck you.

541
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:24,883
We know each other.

542
00:46:26,986 --> 00:46:28,987
I was wondering what
you wanted to drink.

543
00:46:31,316 --> 00:46:33,098
A cosmopolitan.

544
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:40,599
Did you get to see Shaun?

545
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:45,203
Any casualties?

546
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,056
How do you feel?

547
00:46:51,627 --> 00:46:53,309
Like now I've gotta leave town.

548
00:46:53,326 --> 00:46:55,413
It's nighttime, for Christ's sake.

549
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:57,612
It's bad luck
to leave town at night.

550
00:46:58,484 --> 00:47:00,788
- For the drink.
- I pay.

551
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,188
I pay.

552
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,893
- You speak spanish?
- No.

553
00:47:08,213 --> 00:47:10,481
I... Am mucho hombre

554
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:12,694
and we'll do our drinking
in the room.

555
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,166
Thanks.

556
00:47:18,237 --> 00:47:19,771
Keep me in the game.
