4
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:51,100
Hey, what are you doing?
Fucking homicidal prick!

5
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,400
Mark Lewinski, doctor.

6
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,634
We met at the ronald
mcdonald thing

7
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:57,300
- for the kids last year.
- Oh, yes.

8
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,665
Good copy in the morning paper

9
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,100
does not necessarily
mean uninterrupted sleep

10
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:06,600
for the hospital's
liability attorney.

11
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,164
Would you like me to
prescribe some barbiturates?

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,464
What I would like from you, sir...

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,400
What the hospital
very much would like...

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,300
Is some sort of accounting
as to how a patient

15
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,100
could be admitted
with a flatline e.E.G.,

16
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:26,000
be oxygen-deprived
for 27 minutes,

17
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
be worked up for a c2 fracture

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>then exit the side
door of our hospital</i>

19
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,600
within two hours.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,900
I believe he left piggyback.

21
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,900
Levity, doctor?

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,600
This family is not going to sue.

23
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,900
"Miracle boy"

24
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,500
does undercut pain and suffering.

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
The hospital has a public
relations problem,

26
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:52,700
this should alleviate it.

27
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,400
"In resigning,

28
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,800
I knowledge misreading
the Yost boy's tests,

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,500
which, on recognizing
my mistake, I destroyed."

30
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
well, that's very forthcomin

31
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,500
"inhuman hours,
incessant overwork"?

32
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:12,904
Put that in a "P.S."

33
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,200
Surfing... Shaunie?

34
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,899
Yeah, he had a slow day yesterday.

35
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:03,000
Ah. I'm going to go look
for that nut,

36
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,700
that guy for my friend John.

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Over the back fence,

38
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,300
fucking reporters are
having breakfast outside.

39
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:17,849
<i>Sometimes to save
what you love,</i>

40
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,433
<i>you have to oblige to lose it.</i>

41
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
It's like surfing.

42
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,865
<i>If you do I t
for the wrong reasons,</i>

43
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,200
<i>for the points,
it's just a dead game.</i>

44
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:29,751
Your poor leg.

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,545
Last night is as bad as it's gonna get.

46
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,300
Get some herbs, make up
a poultice and pffft.

47
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,300
You feel that?

48
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:50,000
The way the heat flows
just like chakra to chakra?

49
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,900
You see the colors?

50
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,600
<i>John?</i>

51
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
Are you dumping out?

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
<i>Cass, are you in there?</i>

53
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,400
No, it's Amelia Earhart.

54
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,980
<i>- Could you come out here?
- What?</i>

55
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>It's important.</i>

56
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
"Is two days off a crime?

57
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,862
Do I ever get to fucking relax?"

58
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,900
That was you, boss, in your
sleep during the night.

59
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,800
I don't talk in my sleep.

60
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,300
Physician.

61
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,900
It's that physician.

62
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,300
- Hello?
- Hello.

63
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
I'm looking for Butchie Yost.

64
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,653
The gentleman across the
way pointed out the room to me.

65
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,500
I hope you don't mind
I've come in.

66
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,500
You didn't read the paper this morning?

67
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,600
That family had a miracle last night.

68
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,900
At the hospital.

69
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,400
I was Shaun Yost's doctor.

70
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:58,277
Oh, I 'm sorry. Itchy.

71
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,365
I'm careful with germs.

72
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,900
I smelled smoke,
thought maybe I t was the stove.

73
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,321
You want to stay or something?

74
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:07,400
You could wait for Butchie.

75
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,300
I'll take my tools
and you can... Yeah.

76
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:11,900
Okay, sure.

77
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,400
Wait.

78
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,390
In other words, you want to talk

79
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:19,199
about all this strange
shit that's going on?

80
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,504
you're an expert in that field
that is what I brought you on for?

81
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,400
Okay, Linc, I get it.

82
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,300
If you got it, you'd still
be in that room with him.

83
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,600
He went out to get
a poultice for his knee.

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,300
You should be embarrassed
to have to tell me that.

85
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,700
Fuck you.

86
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,800
Fuck you.

87
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,800
The correct answer would be,

88
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,600
<i>"while you, Linc,
are signing Cissy,</i>

89
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm going to try to sell him on
moving out of his house for good."

90
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,500
"Share and share alike."

91
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,600
- Right, Carnal?
- Right, Carnal.

92
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,800
That's how we do it in I.B.

93
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,300
So, John from cincinnati,
it's time to chip in.

94
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,600
<i>We've done our last beer.
gas too.</i>

95
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,700
<i>How about
I fuck you up, joto?</i>

96
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,300
How about I fuck you up?

97
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:37,900
You being funny?

98
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,331
<i>Just get his
pinche wallet, man.</i>

99
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,800
<i>You think this is a joke, cabron?</i>

100
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,323
I think this is a joke.

101
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,748
I'll cut your fucking heart out.

102
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:49,152
- Cut my fucking heart out.
- You don't think I 'll cut you?

103
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:50,793
I'll show you your heart while you die.

104
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:51,839
Show me my heart.

105
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,900
- You ready to look, you fuck?
- I 'm ready.

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
Fuck you!

107
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,607
Fuck you, fuck!

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
You stare me down?

109
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,400
You stare me down?!

110
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,800
<i>I ain't afraid
to be the last you see.</i>

111
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,600
<i>Cold shot, Mano.</i>

112
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,000
<i>You did what you
had to do, Carnal.</i>

113
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,600
Get this fuck out of my ride.

114
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,700
Hey, doc.

115
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
How are you?

116
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
That guy's lost...
I was with at the hospital.

117
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,022
I thought he'd be here with Butchie.

118
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Butchie's not here either.

119
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,078
Things slow at the hospital?

120
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:29,600
I've resigned.

121
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,914
If you see Butchie will you
tell him I 'm looking for John?

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going to check
on Shaun in just a bit.

123
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,900
Good idea, Cissy.

124
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,400
Shaunie's surfing

125
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,300
with jo-jo and his othefriends.

126
00:10:57,484 --> 00:11:00,400
Out with the groms like
yesterday never even happened.

127
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,946
You got something you
need me to sign, Linc?

128
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,706
Today isn't yesterday, Cissy,

129
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:09,800
and I 'm not clear on
what the new rules are,

130
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,600
but I know the old ones
have been canceled.

131
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:15,248
And you find time
to come by and tell me?

132
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Do you know everything
that you need to know,

133
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:20,050
<i>dressing up like michael jackson</i>

134
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:21,265
<i>while your boy's in the water</i>

135
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,500
with 50 assholes
pointing a camera at him?

136
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,700
Works for me.

137
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,300
Of course, all those other
kids in the water with Shaun,

138
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,300
I've signed them already.

139
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,100
And I need you, right, Linc?

140
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,300
Your steadying hand?

141
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,300
Where's Mitch?

142
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,600
My money would be,
even seeing Shaun last night

143
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,665
didn't convert you
from the kind of asshole

144
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,640
<i>who only asks questions
he knows the answer to.</i>

145
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
You want to help?

146
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,500
Stay...

147
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Do the dishes.

148
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,964
<i>- Shit.
- What?</i>

149
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,051
I thought John would be with you.

150
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,884
Well, give me a fucking break, Kal.

151
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:37,000
He must've wandered
off when I was sleeping.

152
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,665
I looked for him at your motel.

153
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,265
I spent the night at my mom's house.

154
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
He could be anywhere
in the fucking world by now.

155
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,100
Don't stop there.

156
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,300
Did he freak out
about boning you?

157
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,999
He doesn't even know
what "boning" means.

158
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,565
Maybe I'd have wound up showing him,
except my pussy overheated

159
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:53,592
like I t was cooking
on a george foreman grill.

160
00:12:53,593 --> 00:12:56,200
My tits too... Like they
were in a blast furnace.

161
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,800
You got hardware in your box.

162
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,273
So?

163
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:00,798
Your nipple rings.

164
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,265
My implants were overheating too, kal.

165
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,900
That's why my head was
going up I n smoke. Fuck!

166
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,500
It was.

167
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,500
We were in my trailer
figuring out he was virgin,

168
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,700
and John says, "see god, kal".

169
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,300
Just like that.

170
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:19,102
And then I went into some
hallucinatory state.

171
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,900
And there was smoke
coming out of your head.

172
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,400
Fuck.

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,733
Do you want to go
looking for him with me?

174
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah, I'll go with you.

175
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
All right, let's check out he pier.

176
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,065
For not knowing what the word meant,

177
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,400
I wonder how John got
the idea to bone me?

178
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,200
I was trying to tell him that
he picked a nice person to like.

179
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,300
Look at this, Zip.

180
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,800
This fills me with misgivings...

181
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,500
Bandying words like "miracle"
in the newspaper headline.

182
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,440
This can only attract new types
of shitheel into that boy's life,

183
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
which wasn't short of shitheels before.

184
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,350
We're going to keep our distance,

185
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:10,900
I'm informing you of that rit now.

186
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
We're not going to jockey for attention

187
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:15,500
<i>or be looked at as a nuisance,</i>

188
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,100
like I saw last night in
Shaun's grandmother's eyes

189
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:19,385
when I was over at that house.

190
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Or stand in the street amongst mopes,

191
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,100
like that hawaiian
and his belt-high sidekick

192
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,950
or the soup brigade from that motel.

193
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,300
I have plenty of tasks
and chores within this house

194
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,000
that I 've been relict attending to

195
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,900
that will more than occupy our time.

196
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,800
There it is.
That's it.

197
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,700
That's the doomsday scenario.

198
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,941
May this pain come to clinton
for disgracing the oval office.

199
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,800
Oh! Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ.

200
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,655
That will never happen again...

201
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,600
A sequence of events so complicated

202
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
that Butchie Yost at the age of 10

203
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,300
could help the only woman in the world

204
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
that when I pass a remark

205
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,400
about some airhead
pisspot that I collar,

206
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,950
she has the sweetns to recall,

207
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:31,700
"I wonder if it's that Yost boy

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,900
that used to help me with my groceries."

209
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,700
I throw him a break
because of my darling lois,

210
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,565
keep one eye out after,

211
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
since I am unloosed him in society.

212
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
That that...
looking out for Butchie...

213
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,265
Would later cross my path with Shaun

214
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,200
when Butchie became
a junkie dumpster tenant,

215
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,300
now who in his right mind

216
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,200
would believe that that sequence
of events could be repeated?

217
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,800
That boy is gone from us.

218
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,400
And I don't regret one thing.

219
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,500
Children or not...

220
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,300
The time I spent with you...

221
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,200
Was the joy of my life.

222
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,665
<i>I've got a favor, guys.</i>

223
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,500
I'm looking for a buddy
of mine. We lost our friend.

224
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,400
He's about yea tall,
collar up like this,

225
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:33,077
walks around,"what do you want,
Butchie Yost?"

226
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Have you seen a guy that looks
like that around here? No?

227
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,100
<i>well, if you do,</i>

228
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,200
I want you to tell
this lady right here.

229
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,700
Can you do that?

230
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>Nice. All right,
give me a pound.</i>

231
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Mario brothers...
I got the high score on that.

232
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:56,400
The first place he asked
me what I wanted, right there.

233
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,900
"What do you want, Butchie Yost?"

234
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,400
Should we put up a plaque?

235
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Hello.

236
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,000
Shaun's surfing.

237
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,100
Mrs. Yost's at work.

238
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,300
And you're pitching in, cleaning house.

239
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,400
What, is this a restricted area?

240
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,700
That wouldn't be for me to say.

241
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
Michael Smith.

242
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,400
Linc Stark.

243
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,900
We didn't introduce
ourselves at the hospital

244
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:55,100
when you were
throwing me off the floor.

245
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
Well, that was for me to say.

246
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,900
People need room to do their jobs.

247
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Of course, your job's over now though.

248
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,900
Am I right?
Unless you get sued?

249
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,600
Negligent oversight,
incompetent evaluation,

250
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,400
emotionally damaging
for the family.

251
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:14,900
I'm not here to protect my ass.

252
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,800
That's a plus for the Yosts.

253
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,600
Now that Shaunie's out of the woods,

254
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,200
they've got new hills to climb.

255
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,600
They don't have time for hangers-on

256
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:26,500
and losers making the trip any tougher.

257
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,200
Are you related to the Yosts?

258
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,900
Not by blood.

259
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,900
Maybe you just smell it in the water.

260
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,300
Would that make me dangerous?

261
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,500
To whatever got Shaun well?

262
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,700
I wouldn't think so, no.

263
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,800
Which does it make me, Linc,

264
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
a loser or a hanger-on,

265
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,700
if I believe a miracle
might've got him well?

266
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,200
It makes you a fanatic.

267
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,500
Tell Mrs. Yost
and Shaun I stopped by.

268
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Absolutely.

269
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,700
What are you looking for?

270
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,300
I'm looking for a wetsuit.

271
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,800
Full suits, shorties,
two-mil, three-twos.

272
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Thanks.

273
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
Sick.

274
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,465
Yost totally surfs
faster than fanning.

275
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,900
Dude, my grandmoer
surfs faster than fanning,

276
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,300
<i>and she died last year.</i>

277
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,155
So what?
Yost died yesterday.

278
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,400
Who's that wetsuit for?

279
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,099
It's for me.

280
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:43,511
Surfing in drag
is a little rough on your nuts.

281
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,300
No, she asked me to look
for one for her too my girlfriend.

282
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,900
Is that what you call
our hand... Our girlfriend?

283
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,600
I guess it's a slow day
for train wrecks, right?

284
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:55,000
You piece of shit.

285
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
- You fucking ewspaper assholes.
- It's my camera, lady.

286
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,900
I'll give you your camera
and you take I t outside!

287
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,900
How are you feeling, Shaun?
How's your neck?

288
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,500
Get out of here,
you piece of shit.

289
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,800
Fuck out! Get the fuck out!

290
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,400
Miracle boy said "shit."

291
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:13,600
You get the hell out of here too.

292
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:14,900
<i>Look at the mess you made.</i>

293
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:16,000
what'd I do?

294
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,500
Stupid fuckers.

295
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,300
<i>Fuck me.</i>

296
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,700
Jesus, what happened?

297
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,700
It's not that bad.
I'm going to get you some help.

298
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,599
I'm going to my truck.
It's just up here...

299
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,300
It's not just up here, but
I'll be back I n just a minute.

300
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
I promise I'll be back for you.

301
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,215
Hey, I'm in my underwear,
and I don't want any magazines.

302
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,400
<i>It's me, Bill.</i>

303
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,200
That's Butch.

304
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:14,800
- Are you I n trouble?
- No.

305
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:17,134
Well, my testicles are on
display to the neighborhood.

306
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:18,200
Get in here.

307
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:22,800
That guy John is missing,
my surf student from cincinnati.

308
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:24,329
Where's your son?

309
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:26,499
He was surfing with sammy and them,
my mom said.

310
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,150
In relation to that guy going missing,

311
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:30,132
when I s the last time you saw Shaun?

312
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,445
-  Last night.
- It's Kal, Cissy.

313
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:35,400
If you haven't noticed,
I'm late for work.

314
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:39,499
I hear Shaunie got wet this morning,
he get any good ones?

315
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,946
She's got a couple of brains.
What's she doing with you?

316
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,798
Anyways, I'm helping Butchie
look for his loopy friend.

317
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
At the shop... Shaunie?

318
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
Not abducted, that was my concern.

319
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,500
<i>Now this John who is missing</i>

320
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>and not a pervert...
what do you know about him?</i>

321
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,800
He's got a credit card
with his name on it.

322
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,300
Yeah, "John Monad."

323
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,165
<i>You found no occasion</i>

324
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,645
<i>to garner further
information from other I .D.?</i>

325
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,865
Well, I asked him straight out, Bill,

326
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
and he says, "I don't know,
Butchie, instead."

327
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,500
Well, that would raise the
question of mental health.

328
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,100
Should we notify the cops he's lost?

329
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:23,319
You got a photograph?

330
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Anyways, they won't
list him for 24 hours.

331
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
I'll give them an informal heads-upping,

332
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,100
not that they pay
attention to me anyway.

333
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,100
Okay.
Thanks, Bill.

334
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,465
It's his attitude anyways...

335
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,900
He's going to end up on the
wrong end of a nightstick.

336
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
"I got my eye on you."

337
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,299
See you.

338
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,900
What's your goddamn hurry?

339
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,865
We gotta go look for John.

340
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,700
What do I look like,an formation
booth boted to the floor?

341
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:53,500
- Am I a recent amputee?
- Do you want to go look with us?

342
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,500
How is that going to
augment the effectiveness?

343
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,100
We divide the community into quadrants.

344
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,165
Good. Great.
That way Bill can't hit us.

345
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Sarcastic...
that's how he got so successful.

346
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,200
Okay, going out to help these two.

347
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,500
Something new every day.

348
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,200
Closed.

349
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
The alternative "apocathary"?

350
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,200
Apothecary,

351
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,500
and they're pretty casual
about their business hours.

352
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,100
What do you think about

353
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,100
my levitation?

354
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,600
I don't know what to think...

355
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,000
Like always.

356
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,365
You know, you feel over the years...

357
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,400
I don't know... that maybe
something about you is special.

358
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,165
<i>and you assume, I guess,</i>

359
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,900
that the thing that's
special has to do with...

360
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,800
What you're good at.

361
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:00,500
Surfing.

362
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,700
And now...

363
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,700
maybe I t turns out
Igo up I n the air,

364
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,700
<i>Shaun heals, and maybe</i>

365
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,765
all along

366
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,800
this feeling of being special

367
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:16,365
wasn't about athletics

368
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,200
or years of spiritual discipline.

369
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:21,300
You know, maybe it's about family.

370
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,300
Do you want to stay here, Mitch?

371
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,700
You see what i'm saying though?

372
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,165
- Yeah, I do.
- No, right. I mean,

373
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,900
- I go up I n the air.
- Shaunie heals, yeah, I know.

374
00:24:33,935 --> 00:24:35,600
And the joker in the deck is this...

375
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,065
Butchie's friend.

376
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,800
What's his connection to the family?

377
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,500
'Cause whenever I see him

378
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,400
he looks at me like
he knows something about me

379
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:51,600
that I haven't even known myself.

380
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,300
He sure is an amazing surfer.

381
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,800
How would you know that?

382
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,100
Don't get a restraining
order or anything,

383
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,400
but I have been watching you.

384
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,700
A couple of days ago?

385
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,700
Oh, yeah, when you were watching me.

386
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,150
Maybe it is about how I surf

387
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:16,200
and Shaun being my grandson.

388
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
I'd like to stay here, I think.

389
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,000
I mean...

390
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,400
Just till we get this all kind of...

391
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,500
Figured out.

392
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,300
I don't mean every single night.

393
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,649
I wonder if the store's open yet...

394
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,000
Where you get your poultice?

395
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,700
<i>I'm sorry about the bumps.</i>

396
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,300
<i>I'm sorry I can't help.</i>

397
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,000
<i>Pull over, Joe.</i>

398
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,300
<i>Joe, pull over.</i>

399
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,100
Good afternoon.

400
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,800
<i>Those are beautiful roses.</i>

401
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,900
You want a catalog?

402
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:12,200
- A cadillac?
- Yes.

403
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
Sometimes I 've...

404
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,500
- Oh, a "catalog."
- Yes.

405
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Yes, of course, I would...

406
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,500
Thank you.

407
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,700
Is this the way
to the snug harbor motel?

408
00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:46,800
Yes.

409
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,500
That's where I'm going.

410
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,400
Gonna look in on Butchie Yost.

411
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,559
I'm a physician. He have some...

412
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:58,400
festering implants.

413
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,300
Thank you for this.
I'll fill this out.

414
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
I'm sure there's some
wonderful products in here.

415
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,400
- Those are beautiful roses.
- Thank you.

416
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
I guess I'll wait here.

417
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,565
If he calls by the surf shop,
i'll call you right away.

418
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,800
- You're gonna go over there?
- Only six hours late to work.

419
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Well, no, good.
you know, in case he shows up.

420
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,400
You know, I'll catch you later.

421
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,600
Thanks for walking with me.

422
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,087
Well, thanks for the peck.

423
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:55,100
I know, right?
what the fuck was that about?

424
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,800
Abogado dickstein.

425
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,300
How are things, Ramon?

426
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,465
What's going on in the world?

427
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,400
Butchie's in his place with that blond.

428
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,050
Previously they were looking
for his surf student.

429
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,400
Then the hawaiians ver
there are working in their tan.

430
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,027
Some day yesterday.

431
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,800
And how.

432
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,100
Yesterday was a three-ring circus.

433
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:45,000
<i>Here's that physician.</i>

434
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
the physician.

435
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,600
Forget something, doc?

436
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,700
I left my dignity.

437
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,200
I was wondering if
Butchie had come back.

438
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,900
He got company now...
a young lady.

439
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:10,900
Escuse me.

440
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,292
El jefe.

441
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
Good day.

442
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:25,800
<i>Mr. Cunningham... </i>

443
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,600
The new owner of the motel.

444
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,200
As I risk repeating.

445
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
<i>Doc, how are you?</i>

446
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,100
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

447
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,000
<i>I'd like for us all
to work together,</i>

448
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,300
and I've blurted it out,
and I'm glad.

449
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,265
The name's palaka, doc.

450
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,465
No reason that you'd realize,

451
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,700
but last night you
were talking to Butchie.

452
00:31:55,735 --> 00:31:57,200
I was under that half-pipe.

453
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,700
You want me to examine your wrist?

454
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,100
Oh, do you do informal diagnosises?

455
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
I thought you already employed us.

456
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,000
Let's consider we're
permanently associated.

457
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,900
Oh, is that too overtly gay?

458
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:20,400
What association do you envision?

459
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,300
Oh, a working business partnership.

460
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,700
I'm referring to
the phrasing of the offer.

461
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,300
Butchie Yost?

462
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,000
In his room.

463
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,100
Apprising him on
the results of a search.

464
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,800
No cell phone.

465
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,100
I suppose you got
to explain that, these days.

466
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,900
I could give less of a shit.

467
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,200
He's with that strange-haired girl.

468
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,300
Doing what?

469
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,800
How the fuck would I know?

470
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
- Earache... Ringing.
- Getting back to the wrist,

471
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,800
you really should have
this x-rayed and set.

472
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,850
Well, I should file
tax returns too, doc.

473
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:24,700
The government, all these years...

474
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,000
What is this nonsense now?

475
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,400
Excuse me.

476
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,800
I fucking touched him
and he fucking healed.

477
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,300
I'm a physician.
what's the problem?

478
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,565
No problem, medic.

479
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,000
Let him make a fool out of you.

480
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:46,400
<i>Don't move him.
Put him down.</i>

481
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:48,100
He ain't fucking hurt.

482
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,700
<i>You helped me, Joe.</i>

483
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
Now you keep mouthing off
like that, frat boy,

484
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:54,400
and I'm liable to knock you out.

485
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,300
<i>- Do you feel any pain?
- I don't feel any pain.</i>

486
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,300
It's bullshit, right?

487
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,400
It's a healed wound with fresh blood.

488
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,500
I don't know what it is.

489
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,800
Phonied-up gag.

490
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,900
It's a bunch of goddamn nonsense.

491
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,233
Well, whatever's happened,

492
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,100
you seem to be all right now.

493
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,200
Well, I guess it's time to identify

494
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,567
which warped rear-echelon asshole

495
00:34:25,602 --> 00:34:27,865
at the v.F.W. Bar where I drink

496
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,700
thought something I confided
about events in country

497
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,700
was worth abuse for the
sake of a fucking chuckle!

498
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,100
You didn't leave me behind, Joe.

499
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,200
Now you listen to me, frat boy.

500
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,200
You're gonna tell me who I t was,

501
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,800
and then I am jumping in that van

502
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,900
and driving to that gin mill

503
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,100
and I am gonna do some damage.

504
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,001
Tomorrow is another day.

505
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,600
I'm undertaking inquiries tomorrow.

506
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,600
<i>You can guarantee
that goddamn much.</i>

507
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:32,100
- Oh.
- God, I'm sorry, kal,

508
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:34,000
but I haven't been high in three days.

509
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,300
I'll get hard over mud.

510
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,500
- Butchie?
- What?

511
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,900
Let's go to my place.

512
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:46,200
Anything could be
growing I n those sheets.

513
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,600
<i>Bill Jacks!</i>

514
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,500
Coming, Bill.

515
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,600
We just completed our quadrants.

516
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,000
Safe...
I- got-my-eye-on-you.

517
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,500
- Great.
- Where was he?

518
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,600
My god, you have an erection.

519
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,000
He's right outside.
Jesus Christ.

520
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,500
I want to bring down the hammer
back at your place.

521
00:36:20,197 --> 00:36:21,500
What if it's now or never?

522
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:24,300
We'll go see how he's doing.

523
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,656
Yeah, maybe he's having fun
with whoever he's with.

524
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:33,100
Let me just...
fix this unsightly bulge.

525
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,600
So every collar you
took in hawaiIthere,

526
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,200
that smart mouth buy you a beating?

527
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:49,800
You boys were too eager to earn.

528
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,400
Bill's not freddy's first "Bill."

529
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,806
See, I was never that type.

530
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,600
That's how you got your rolls royce.

531
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,000
Stay with the truck, I'm free
to beat humps like you.

532
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,600
Freddy's not Bill's first "Freddy."

533
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,200
<i>You're in the right place, doc.</i>

534
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,800
So you say.

535
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,800
Tomorrow is another day.

536
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,900
I suppose I could take tonight
to fill out this catalog.

537
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,800
Put that in a "P.S."

538
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,500
What the hell happened to you, monad?

539
00:37:37,095 --> 00:37:38,199
He's all right.

540
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,100
Well, his clothes are sure fucked up.

541
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,500
"That's how we do it in I.B."

542
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,800
I got my eye on you, Bill.

543
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,900
We've got all three rings working now.

544
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,000
<i>Check out the porsche.</i>

545
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,800
That chick works for Linc.

546
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
She was looking to slap it on your dad.

547
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,400
Cass needs a place to work.

548
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
What the fuck?

549
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,100
<i>Is she slapping it on him too?</i>

550
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,865
Look at my man John.

551
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,100
<i>styling and profiling, baby.</i>

552
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,100
I guess I'll say goodbye.
Okay, doc.

553
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,800
How's the implants?

554
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, good. No heat
or smoke all day.

555
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,300
We got a position
for a house physician?

556
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,600
I'll stop by and see you tomorrow.

557
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,908
Yeah, I 'll spend
the night hoping somebody

558
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:44,971
don't cut I n front of me.

559
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,600
Butchie wants to bring down the hammer.

560
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,600
Do you mind, John?

561
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,200
- I do mind.
- He doesn't mean it.

562
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,300
Get rid of the unsightly bulge.

563
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,465
The Yost surfing school:

564
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,500
24 hours I will have you
in the water or in some pussy.

565
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The alternative apothecary
has this lending library.

566
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,600
- Light reading.
- Sweet.

567
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,200
"Levitation for the illuminated."

568
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
But...

569
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,600
You know,  I don't think
you should stay here.

570
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,000
Sure.

571
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,200
Why?

572
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,200
He needs a place to stay.

573
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,900
He's all right.

574
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:09,700
Yeah, he looks great.

575
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,400
I'll be right back.

576
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,000
The joker in the deck.

577
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,200
I'd better have a good health plan.

578
00:40:25,718 --> 00:40:29,100
Do you need to stand
aside for me to pass, or are you...

579
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You just going to part
like the red sea?

580
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:56,600
I'll spare you the candles,

581
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,300
but you can't say the music blows.

582
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,300
Deal.

583
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,600
And no fucking laughing, Butchie.

584
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:10,000
Come on, Kal.

585
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,600
Was this playing the first
time I threw up on you?

586
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,200
<i>It was playing at our junior prom.</i>

587
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,400
Imissed our junior prom.

588
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah.

589
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:43,800
And no freaking out about my piercings.

590
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,100
You're kidding, right?

591
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,700
<i>Knowing about them is one thing,</i>

592
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Seeing them is different.
no freaking out.

593
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,300
All my ladies set off the
airport metal detectors

594
00:42:11,335 --> 00:42:13,000
or they're not my ladies long.

595
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,300
And let me say this:

596
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,500
with the compact metal detector
right here in my tongue,

597
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:25,300
I will find everywhere
your metal may be hidden.

598
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,300
Barry white is in the house.

599
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,300
I threw Mitch out.

600
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,800
Good thinking.

601
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,400
You know you're fucking fired, right?

602
00:42:58,014 --> 00:43:00,000
I mean, you're not
that bone-fucking-stupid

603
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,900
to think I would keep
you on the payroll.

604
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,600
<i>What guts.</i>

605
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,400
what honesty, what intelligence,

606
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,800
without the vaguest idea
of what is happening.

607
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:13,400
being sure, it means
you need to be broke.

608
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
<i>a couple of strange things
happen, you decide</i>

609
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:19,417
god's taking over for santa,

610
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:21,000
deciding who's naughty and nice.

611
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,100
He's firing up that coal log
to burn the naughty in hell.

612
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:13,600
Shall we try it again?

613
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,700
Through the door?

614
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,300
I'll work over here, John.

615
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,200
And then you'll sleep over here

616
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:42,000
<i>while I sleep on the bed.</i>

617
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,300
will you mind sleeping
on the floor here?

618
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,200
See god, Kal.

619
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,800
"Cass."

620
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,400
See god, Cass.

621
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:57,300
What do you mean?

622
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,300
Work over there.

623
00:45:23,505 --> 00:45:24,800
Sweet enough look to his mug,

624
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:25,900
I- got-my-eye-on-you,

625
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,300
When he restrains himself
from running his mouth.

626
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,908
Far as him being stabbed,

627
00:45:37,808 --> 00:45:39,566
I'm not doubting
it could've been a hoax.

628
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:41,992
I don't subscribe it definitely was...

629
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,300
...being I and a bird of my acquaintance

630
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,700
know a boy who survived fatal injury,

631
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,700
following the bird's own resurrection.

632
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,500
Sole change from what
I said to you previous, Zip.

633
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,300
Last overlap between me and the Yosts,

634
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:05,400
Butchie asking my help
with that search.

635
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,000
A "P.S.," my assistance...

636
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,450
An end to the concluding chapter,

637
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:14,900
the final completion and finish.

638
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,100
That is senselessand offensive.

639
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,500
Ideal with that shitbird
only to put him in bracelets,

640
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:33,800
and I 'm surprised
you'd need me to say so.

641
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,700
Is what you envision
relative to those people...

642
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,700
I balance the hawaiian's
bad influence?

643
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,000
Well, that, Zip, would outstrip
by a full triple-somersault

644
00:46:58,035 --> 00:47:01,200
every previous unlikely
set of circumstances.

645
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,800
<i>Yeah.</i>

646
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,194
otherwise I'd have
a moment's peace to myself.

647
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,100
Cup of Joe...

648
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,700
Winchell's assorted dozen.

649
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,300
Where's the dwarf with the dangling arm?

650
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,500
He's in our shared bathroom.

651
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,300
I'm here on orders from my bird.

652
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:58,523
If you're waiting for me to ask you
what you're talking about,

653
00:47:58,524 --> 00:48:00,800
plan on falling over dead before I do.

654
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:05,000
My bird Zippy conveyed to me,

655
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,751
despite the obvious
dissimilarities between us,

656
00:48:09,317 --> 00:48:10,610
we become friends.

657
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,300
He used the word "dissimilarities"?

658
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,500
He conveyed.
He conveyed...

659
00:48:17,535 --> 00:48:20,000
I never said he spoke.

660
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,565
Not that what else he can do,

661
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,200
he couldn't speak I f he wanted to,

662
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,600
and do knitting to keep himself busy.

663
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,365
Maybe he conveyed to make friends

664
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,940
with a different freddy,
your telepathic bird.

665
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,065
You'd think that,
you degenerate nitwit.

666
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,458
What, is there a room of
freddys somewheres around here?

667
00:48:36,153 --> 00:48:37,736
<i>what is that, a mustang pulled in here?</i>

668
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,500
The make of the car is what
I'm paying attention to.

669
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,800
I'm looking for Butchie Yost.

670
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,800
I'm him...

671
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,800
If he don't owe you money.

672
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,900
He's not him. Butchie's not here.

673
00:49:00,324 --> 00:49:03,000
You... care to leave a message?

674
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:16,500
On my face?
With your ass?

675
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:19,200
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ!

676
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,300
What my bird was thinking
to dispatch me to you,

677
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,600
I haven't the vaguest
goddamn idea.

678
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,600
I got a lizard back home,
changes shapes.

679
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,300
Chameleons, they call them.
