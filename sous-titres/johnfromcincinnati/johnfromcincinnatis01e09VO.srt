5
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,877
Shaun!

6
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,971
He's gone! My god!

7
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,307
Kai! Shaunie's gone!

8
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,567
You got my goddamn bird?!

9
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:57,948
Erlemeyer.

10
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:03,520
Mitch... Yost.

11
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:08,525
You know, I stopped by that
cantina down the road last night

12
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:11,762
And... there was this
inked-up asshole in there

13
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:13,397
Talking about "the chemist."

14
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:16,333
Yeah, and I remembered
that you live down here.

15
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:19,649
Well, I don't
do that anymore, Mitch...

16
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,272
If that's why you're down here.

17
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:28,011
So, not making
what you used to make,

18
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,691
Do you ever see
what we used to see?

19
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,928
I try to stay eligible.

20
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:35,616
I pray, I...

21
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:38,666
fast, I meditate.

22
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:42,492
I try not resent people
I haven't seen in 20 years

23
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,595
Coming down to take my temperature.

24
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,002
Look, I've been up in the air, I...

25
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:52,186
I've seen my grandson
come back from the dead.

26
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,297
In the cantina.

27
00:03:56,298 --> 00:03:57,969
No, in I.B...

28
00:03:58,288 --> 00:03:59,710
<I>With clear head.

29
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:04,220
You know, I...

30
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:07,708
I think maybe an extraterrestrial's
involved with my family.

31
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,745
My son especially.

32
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:13,185
The analgesic pioneer.

33
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:16,860
Do I cross a line, Mitch,

34
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:19,500
if I ask with all this
shaking up there...

35
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:22,406
Why you're down here?

36
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,733
I lost my nerve.

37
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:28,305
Use it up charging big pipe?

38
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:30,207
No, big pipe's easy.

39
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:32,853
Dry land is hard.

40
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:36,747
What's it take to get
across the border now?

41
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,950
You thinking of going back?

42
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,906
Aren't you, Mitch?

43
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,256
See anything in that
cantina worth staying for?

44
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:55,610
Maybe you came down
to renew my eligibility.

45
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,802
<I>Say something, you prick.

46
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,657
It's Tina.

47
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,241
<I>Has Linc got Shaun?

48
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:17,907
He's jogging.

49
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:20,901
<I>Some promo bullshit he didn't
bother to mention last night?

50
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,978
Shaun's not with Linc, Cissy.

51
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:24,344
<I>Is he with you?

52
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,898
<I> Another fucking jaunt to seaworld?

53
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,322
Maybe he's surfing.

54
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,675
<I>His wetsuit's right here! Don't you think
I know where his fuckin' wetsuit is?

55
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,936
You motherfucker!

56
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:35,005
<I>What did you call me?

57
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:37,580
I'll go tell Linc, Cissy. I'll take
him his phone, so he can call you.

58
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:39,776
<I>Yeah, and don't forget
to drown yourself afterwards!

59
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,456
I drew a full house
against a flush.

60
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,557
You want to ride up with me?

61
00:05:57,034 --> 00:06:00,463
Well, I studied engines
so I could make it run.

62
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,005
<I>Shaun's gone.

63
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:48,178
- What?
- He's fucking gone!

64
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,477
Disappeared overnight!

65
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,449
- Did you call Kai?
<I>- Yeah, she's probably surfing.

66
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:55,410
- And he's not surfing?
- His wetsuit's still at the house.

67
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:57,095
Those fucking assholes
didn't see him.

68
00:06:57,096 --> 00:07:00,088
- What assholes?
- I'm telling you he's gone!

69
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:03,160
And I want to know where your
friend is who said he would be.

70
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,095
That skinny bitch with
the camera’s place.

71
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:07,930
Okay, I'm on it, Ma.
I'll go over there right now.

72
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,207
I put him in against a
whole different weight class,

73
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,047
They wipe him from the face of the earth.

74
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,348
Christ!

75
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:25,741
Shaun is gone and Zip is gone
on my watch, do you understand?

76
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:29,186
And that's the sum and
substance of it from here on in.

77
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,251
Stand watch and fail

78
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:34,194
and stand watch and fail
and lose 'em all, one after another!

79
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,860
Cell phone on alarm,

80
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:38,962
relentless three minute intervals

81
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,214
however many hours
I was on watch, boss.

82
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,900
And boss, it never went off, boss.

83
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,835
And you wanna know why?

84
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:46,937
I'm gonna break
your other fuckin' wrist!

85
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,739
Because I never fell asleep.

86
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,675
<I>That kid had to have
turned into mercury

87
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:54,536
and oozed below my watch
post at that fence

88
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:56,468
and turned into a tiny silver ball.

89
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,782
<I>Meaning it was me he got past!

90
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,217
No, god forbid I think that.

91
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,399
Fuck!

92
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:15,888
<I>You do not buy
a gift and not give it.

93
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:17,917
<I>that's the oldest
bad luck in the world.

94
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:23,937
Bought for good luck, specifically

95
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:26,232
you on your visit to the mainland.

96
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,575
You break my wrist the minute I don't
give it, disaster on disaster since.

97
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,081
Never ever a streak as worse as this.

98
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,591
Excuse me.
If you'll allow me past...

99
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,051
Just as soon
you don't put a beating on me

100
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:53,170
Or a skull fracture, and I hope
this could break the bad luck

101
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,791
and please just take it. Take it...

102
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,174
under that set of circumstances.

103
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:01,578
For the boy.

104
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:42,019
<I>For the boy.
That boy Shaun's gone.

105
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,997
Cissy called you. Shaun's gone.

106
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,886
- Do you know where he is?
- No, how would I know?

107
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,073
'Cause you signed him, she thought
maybe you took him somewhere.

108
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:55,002
Tina, I'm right here with you.
You saw me go out for a jog.

109
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,024
What did I do?

110
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,635
- What, so you're the one who took him?
- I shouldn't have come down here.

111
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:01,468
I'll do what I do, I'll find
him. Get me to the hotel.

112
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,519
<I> You should go to Cissy's shop.
You need to be with people right now.

113
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,473
- That where Cissy's gonna be?
- You're the one who talked to her, Tina.

114
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:09,652
Hang on, jake.

115
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:13,012
Give her one more thing
to freak out about.

116
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,505
Maybe that's what she needs.

117
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:21,778
<I>It's conceivable this
is meant to be reassuring.

118
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,803
If you've lived your life
with your head up your ass.

119
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,883
The last tape showed one figure

120
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,551
on the sheet behind Butchie's friend

121
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:30,587
and Butchie's friend says,
"Shaun will soon be gone."

122
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,223
This tape shows
two figures on the sheet

123
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,928
and no speaker.

124
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,127
Assume one of the figures
is Butchie's friend,

125
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:39,363
the other is Shaun

126
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,597
and both are now gone,

127
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,434
That's a confirmation
of the previous message.

128
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,937
Proving Butchie's friend's a sadist

129
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:50,774
- and a kidnapper.
- It's only sadistic if he intends harm.

130
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:52,809
What the fuck but harm
would he be intending

131
00:12:52,877 --> 00:12:56,113
to fucking kidnap someone?

132
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:59,682
Fuck's sake, Dickstein.
- It's me, Meyer Dickstein!

133
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,554
Don't I fucking know who you are?

134
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,589
And doesn't that sign
at your balls say "closed"?

135
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,467
I had a dream I was supposed
to come here.

136
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:08,353
Go away.

137
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,706
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yes, Dickstein.

138
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,773
Lay down, take a nap and dream
you're supposed to fucking leave.

139
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:16,128
- Move, god damn it.
- Excuse me.

140
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,403
He's gone. Shaunie.

141
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,327
We know.

142
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:24,775
<I>It's Butchie Yost,
looking for John.

143
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:26,877
He's not here...

144
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,736
That I'm aware of.

145
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:30,714
<I>Can I come in for second?

146
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:40,458
Your roommate grabbed my kid.

147
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,059
- Oh my god.
- Are you gonna tell me what you know?

148
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:45,696
Yes. Yes, of course.

149
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,832
Food for thought, anyway...

150
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:52,169
As a basis for believing

151
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,338
Shaun's safe, I'm saying.

152
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:58,266
You would think sending messages
means he's looking for ransom.

153
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:01,712
People kill kids and ask for ransom.

154
00:14:02,266 --> 00:14:04,939
The notice before the fact is

155
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:07,584
what I'm proposing
as a basis for belief.

156
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:09,846
It certainly invites an answer.

157
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:12,789
Wouldn't this be a good time
to involve the police?

158
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:15,879
Sure, they hate us, and who
the hell do we say John is?

159
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,794
Don't you want
to help me write a draft?

160
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:20,497
I'm gonna look for him!

161
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:30,880
Hurry up!

162
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:34,134
"To whoever's gone with Shaun"

163
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:46,056
Where's the fucking
canoe trip to Yosemite?

164
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:48,025
It's what he wanted.

165
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,824
Well, he told you
these places to go?

166
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,932
No, he said, "drive,"
then he'd say, "stop,"

167
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,415
and then he'd say, "work here."

168
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,815
Okay, turn it off.

169
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:03,548
I think he's on some
kind of automatic pilot.

170
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,709
Yeah, maybe he's
a commercial plane.

171
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:07,878
Like, he hears something,

172
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:10,914
and then his program
tells him what to say back.

173
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,626
Yeah, but who put his program in?

174
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:16,062
I don't know. I mean, he
says, "my father did this"

175
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:17,621
or "my father did that."

176
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:19,423
The president of american airlines.

177
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,459
And he's like he's programmed
to fake "oh, I'm sad,"

178
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,913
"Oh, I'm happy" or whatever
else he fucking does.

179
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:28,110
Yeah, and he'll look like
something makes him sad or happy

180
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:30,500
If it's in his programming, I...

181
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:31,801
<I>I don't know.

182
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:33,268
And what’s the connection
to my father going up

183
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,185
in the air and all
that other fucking shit?

184
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:37,626
I don't know.

185
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:39,980
Well, I guess you don't know
fucking much now, do you?

186
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:41,445
No, I guess not.

187
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:58,549
So...

188
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:01,131
if he fuckin' shows up or anything,

189
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,647
or if he fuckin' calls.

190
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:04,468
<I>- Yeah, I call that number...
- Right.

191
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:06,236
That's mine. This is
my fuckin' mother's.

192
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,573
And here, this is
the other fuckin' mother.

193
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:16,580
Did I hurt your tit or anything?

194
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,211
No.

195
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,708
Okay.

196
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:23,175
You've got the numbers.

197
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,183
<I>You have one new message.

198
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:45,542
<I>Kai! Shaunie's gone!

199
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:26,838
Zip?

200
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:34,892
Zip, is that you?

201
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,155
Please forgive me.

202
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:43,734
How could I have been so mistaken?

203
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:49,409
Your wish is my command...

204
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:51,542
your ladyship.

205
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:54,811
It's Bill Jacks

206
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:58,282
Commencing recon
for both the missing.

207
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,618
And please forgive me

208
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,420
for being so slow on the uptake.

209
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,027
Never once commucated
previous 15 years.

210
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:25,202
Mr. Cunningham?

211
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:26,335
Go away.

212
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,346
- I'm serious.
- What's happened?

213
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:31,248
This is my property.

214
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:33,135
I'll have you arrested.

215
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,155
For what? Barry...

216
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,043
Just don't!

217
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:38,220
Don't touch me!

218
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:40,196
Don't put your hands on me!

219
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:44,895
I've had terrible dreams too.

220
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,310
Oh, not like this.

221
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:49,417
Yes, I have.

222
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,372
I dreamed about...

223
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:56,220
Butchie's son... there in the bar.

224
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,675
- You dreamt he was in the bar?
- Now he's gone.

225
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:02,138
Things don't happen
because we've dreamt them.

226
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,047
No one should go in there!

227
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:06,134
I should have leveled the place!

228
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:10,220
Why don't we go inside?

229
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:11,788
Are you crazy?

230
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:14,725
Definitely.

231
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,741
The doctor is in.

232
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:38,415
My grandson's missing.

233
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:41,308
Have you seen him?

234
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,906
Not today.

235
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:45,346
He was out here yesterday

236
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:46,378
With that frat boy.

237
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:47,714
What frat boy?

238
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:52,162
Tall drink of water
with the poodle haircut.

239
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,383
- John?
- Yeah, that's him.

240
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:58,502
I'll check into it.

241
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,804
I'll ask the boys
down at the V.F.W.

242
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:03,472
There's not much around here
they don't know about.

243
00:20:03,563 --> 00:20:04,740
Thank you.

244
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:09,178
I'd be the last one
to say he's not strange, but

245
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,476
I'd have said, till now, he's harmless.

246
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:15,219
He could be brainwashed,

247
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:18,119
he could be on automatic pilot
or any other fuckin' thing.

248
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,894
John would hurt himself
before he'd hurt Shaunie.

249
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,560
I mean, John, he,
he can't even take a dump.

250
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:25,195
how's he gonna
be a master criminal?

251
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:29,299
"Did you dump out today, Kai?"

252
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:33,767
That he said, trying
to make me feel better.

253
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,051
Sweet and stupid, like you.

254
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:39,027
When?

255
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,918
At the hospital when
Shaunie had his accident.

256
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:44,367
I said that at my crib, Kai,

257
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,053
trying to make him feel better.

258
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:49,599
Are you telling me John repeated
what someone else said to him?

259
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:51,880
Hey, Kai, what if John thinks

260
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:54,825
"A+ for fume control" means
he hopes you feel better?

261
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:57,116
If he wants us to feel
better, why'd he take Shaun?

262
00:20:57,378 --> 00:20:59,731
'Cause his pilot's
got him on override.

263
00:21:01,736 --> 00:21:03,767
Well, if John's on override,

264
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:05,955
How do we know
he wouldn't hurt Shaun?

265
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:08,906
Because John's automatic
pilot wouldn't be an asshole.

266
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:13,210
That's the secret code
to us from his pilot, Kai.

267
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:14,730
What?

268
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,067
"John can't dump."

269
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,435
"I'm not an asshole."

270
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,186
How in the fuck did I miss that?

271
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,627
We were just talking about Shaunie,

272
00:21:30,628 --> 00:21:32,129
How we know he's
gonna be all right.

273
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:33,942
How?

274
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:36,359
Kid needs to be looked for

275
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,059
and it has to happen under the radar.

276
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:41,371
That P.I. In del mar

277
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,789
Made wonder boy's
date rape thing go away?

278
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:45,323
Use him.

279
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,139
You know,
that congressman whose kid

280
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,289
tagged along with
the team in the tuamotus?

281
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,335
- Arliano.
- Yeah, he's part of some...

282
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:52,950
intelligence oversight committee.

283
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:54,836
He can notify
the bureau on the Q.T.

284
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,353
Good.

285
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:57,921
I'll do that right away.

286
00:21:57,922 --> 00:21:58,991
Thanks a lot.

287
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:02,790
Butchie's ride, no?

288
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,064
Should I be wearing kevlar?

289
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,621
He's helping find Shaun.

290
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,209
Christ, look at this.

291
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,284
Every fucking promise
I ever made, I broke.

292
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:30,420
Do what you gotta do.

293
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,641
There's one in a row you've kept.

294
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,321
<i>Not that whatever they're on</i>

295
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,762
about ain't making the boy's
recovery imminent,

296
00:22:47,937 --> 00:22:50,116
The harelip thinks
he's onto something.

297
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:02,686
Wake the fuck up.
Have you seen this kid?

298
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:05,151
Look at me when I'm talking
to you. Have you seen this kid?

299
00:23:05,623 --> 00:23:07,624
Have you seen this kid?

300
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:43,665
...Shaun. He's about this tall.

301
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:46,296
Oh, miss, pardon me.
Have you heard...

302
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,117
When we met just now,

303
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,806
I was coming back from the clinic
I've leased across the street.

304
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:04,060
I'd gotten scared there
in an examining room.

305
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:09,052
<I>I'd been imagining days to come,

306
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,788
the people I'd be caring for,

307
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:15,397
<I>their gratitude to a
physician of my credentials

308
00:24:15,627 --> 00:24:18,695
<I>choosing to work with
the poor and underserved.

309
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:24,301
<I>The day before,
standing in that room,

310
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,069
I had felt that I had heard

311
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,005
those patients' voices thanking me.

312
00:24:29,874 --> 00:24:32,090
Not hearing them today,

313
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,621
I saw that the room
was ramshackle and dirty.

314
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:43,754
Not hearing the hallelujah
soundtrack frightened me,

315
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:45,789
Made me run.

316
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,494
I'd better get
that place opened up.

317
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:06,590
Shall we go?

318
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:23,153
Church. Praying for the boy.

319
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,888
Just married.

320
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,250
Look what rosa gave me.

321
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,932
Avon. Wonderful.

322
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:42,784
The care that must go into creating
lipstick shades for women of color.

323
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:46,276
- Go to the middle.
- Oh, yes.

324
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:55,041
Please excuse me.

325
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:57,112
Stay right there.

326
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:59,456
- Thank you!
- I'm coming right back!

327
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:01,525
What an extraordinary man.

328
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:03,316
Listen to me.

329
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:05,829
Look at this.

330
00:27:05,897 --> 00:27:07,598
I am... looking.

331
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:10,167
I am seeing... Avon...

332
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:11,784
in an entirely new light.

333
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:14,705
This is big. This is huge.

334
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:16,940
I think it very well could be.

335
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:19,309
I want to cook something.

336
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,050
I could eat.

337
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:24,769
Look!

338
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,544
Come closer!

339
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,626
Look!

340
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:41,231
Those same marvelous figures.

341
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,400
What did she tell you about these?

342
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:45,382
Nothing.

343
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:47,738
This is huge.

344
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:51,267
Ramon's thinking of cooking.

345
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,042
I'm sure the Yosts
would appreciate that.

346
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,195
Yeah, we built a...

347
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:13,956
room in the back for our grandson.

348
00:28:14,907 --> 00:28:16,767
Is he different
after what happened?

349
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:20,755
Well, it's hard to say.

350
00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:22,193
You know?

351
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:28,965
So, you want a water?

352
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:48,610
Yeah, they're going green.

353
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,702
Dust to dust.

354
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:55,049
Thanks.

355
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:06,199
Anderson!

356
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:09,192
Get back in your vehicle, sir!

357
00:29:09,193 --> 00:29:10,209
A situation!

358
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:12,143
Individuals you want
to be looking for

359
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:15,034
- In an unofficial capacity.
- Stop right where you are!

360
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,326
Step off the street please!

361
00:29:16,327 --> 00:29:19,062
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ.

362
00:29:22,843 --> 00:29:24,468
Still skating, officer Jacks!

363
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,705
Until you break your goddamn neck.

364
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:31,208
I'm voiding your summons.
Wear your seat belt.

365
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:36,179
What a coincidence,
running into you, Bill,

366
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,948
seeing as you're
the reason I'm out here.

367
00:29:37,949 --> 00:29:39,917
Be on the lookout
for a white male, Anderson,

368
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:41,485
early to mid 20s,

369
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:43,235
6'2", medium build,

370
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:44,790
Brown hair in a poodle cut.

371
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:47,390
You know I'm writing summonses
on the street the next 10 days

372
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:49,626
because you stole the handle
off a drinking fountain

373
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:51,685
at the station house
and I covered for your ass!

374
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:54,531
Anderson! Anderson! You've gotta
focus on the matter at hand!

375
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:03,272
All right, tell me what's he done,
this guy

376
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:04,875
we're looking
for him under the radar.

377
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:27,016
- Neighborhood punks.
- Yeah.

378
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:46,338
God, God damn it!

379
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:48,197
- Cissy! God damn it!
- Fuck you!

380
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:49,219
<I>Fuck you!

381
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:54,725
Is that... that's
the fucking chemist, isn't it!

382
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:58,362
I hope you brought
a carload of acid, Mitch,

383
00:30:58,363 --> 00:31:01,135
and some beads and a fucking bong!

384
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:04,501
Shaunie's gone! He's been taken!

385
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,470
You want to tell me what you mean?

386
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:08,786
He was here last night...

387
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:10,001
in his bed!

388
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,808
- And now he's gone!
- And you looked...

389
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,212
Fuck you. Fuck you!

390
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:17,801
Everywhere!

391
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:23,457
Excuse me.

392
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:35,868
I've looked!

393
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:37,421
We've looked! Everybody's looking

394
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:40,821
who isn't soul surfing in baja
with fucking captain crunch!

395
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:42,172
Will you walk me through it?

396
00:31:42,173 --> 00:31:44,141
- Walk you through what?
- Well, everything.

397
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:45,463
- What happened.
- Why?

398
00:31:45,464 --> 00:31:47,581
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?!

399
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:49,179
God damn it.

400
00:31:49,484 --> 00:31:51,014
Maybe I can help.

401
00:32:18,824 --> 00:32:21,265
Okay, there's a tape
on the computer

402
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,818
and John says,
"Shaun will be gone."

403
00:32:25,158 --> 00:32:28,065
In front of a black curtain.
- Yeah, I know that.

404
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:29,607
I just don't know
why that's important.

405
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:32,206
- He looked like a fucking raghead!
- He was wearing a burnoose?

406
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:33,892
What's a burmoose, asshole?

407
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:35,745
- The covering they wear on their heads.
- No!

408
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,321
Well, what made him look like an arab?

409
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,830
It looked like one of those
terrorist threat messages.

410
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:41,955
- Oh, Jesus!
- There was a stick figure

411
00:32:41,956 --> 00:32:44,167
drawn on the curtain
in white chalk or paint

412
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:45,835
or some fucking thing!

413
00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:47,296
Bill questioned him about it!

414
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:49,907
How could Bill question him
if they've disappeared?

415
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:53,844
The message was posted,
we freaked out,

416
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:56,346
John came back, Bill questions him

417
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:58,046
- and Freddy-
- About where Shaun was?

418
00:32:58,047 --> 00:33:01,011
And Shaun was at fucking seaworld
with that bitch who spit him out.

419
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:05,151
All right, Cissy, I'm...
I'm trying to follow.

420
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:08,425
Bill questions him!
Freddy questions him!

421
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:10,594
The bitch brings him back
from the dolphin tank.

422
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:12,315
Everything looks
like it's all right.

423
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:15,141
- Linc signs Shaun to a contract...
- What the fuck?!

424
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:18,802
Are you piss in my ear about that
with Shaun kidnapped!

425
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:26,116
You know, if Freddy talked to John,

426
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:27,911
either John told him
what's going on

427
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:30,736
or he's in pieces
in a freezer someplace.

428
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:33,417
He walked out of that room
covered in blood.

429
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:36,914
- John?
- And happy as a clam.

430
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:39,574
Well, that's it! The guy's got
some kind of supernatural power!

431
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:41,960
- Really? You think so, Mitch?
- Yeah, and it's obviously

432
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:44,269
Part of something that's
bigger than he is, Cissy.

433
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,012
If you remember,
I went up in the air.

434
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:47,552
Why couldn't you have
gone off a cliff?

435
00:33:47,553 --> 00:33:49,399
Okay okay.

436
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:53,376
And there's been another
fucking message, okay?

437
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,308
Another curtain.

438
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:57,311
No John, two stick figures.

439
00:33:57,312 --> 00:33:58,475
<I>Any message?

440
00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:00,523
I just said there was
another fuckin' message!

441
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:02,546
But with... words,
like "Shaun'll be gone"...

442
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:05,165
...Like there was in the last one?
So… but they’re both gone.

443
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:09,712
Look, somebody
has gotta walk point.

444
00:34:09,872 --> 00:34:11,412
What do you mean "walk point"?

445
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:14,071
Like talk to the cops
and the press and the...

446
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,728
- That whole deal.
- And you would do that?

447
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:20,264
Yeah, well, I did the
public service announcements.

448
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:23,543
- "Clean up the sloughs."
- And you hated it.

449
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,370
Yeah, but I did it, Cissy.
That's the point.

450
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:30,325
I'm...

451
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:32,543
I'm just saying give me the weight.

452
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:37,130
That's all I'm saying. I'm here.

453
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:40,834
Let me take it.

454
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,471
Tell me what you see.

455
00:34:57,316 --> 00:34:58,318
You.

456
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,095
Looking at the gin mill,
what do I see?

457
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:11,048
Nothing since the...
They closed the door behind them.

458
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,450
The mexican, the doctor and the homo.

459
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:16,306
Find out what's going on.

460
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:18,603
Go over, just...

461
00:35:18,604 --> 00:35:20,535
Find out what they're doing in there.

462
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,659
I'll just ask 'em,
that's all, right?

463
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,628
It's supposed to be
a closed premises.

464
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:33,992
It's the lawyer
getting out of the lexus.

465
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:36,478
Hey! They're in the bar!

466
00:35:36,493 --> 00:35:39,808
Them two that I seen you with,
they're in with the physician!

467
00:35:44,556 --> 00:35:46,350
So now...

468
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,023
I go over, right?

469
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:50,086
"Did you get in all right?"
And so forth.

470
00:35:50,154 --> 00:35:51,788
How I open with the jew.

471
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,819
Ask him what happened to my bear.

472
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:14,600
I... we...

473
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:19,162
who has the cleft palate, spends
his time in the internet cafe...

474
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:22,586
- Wh about him?
- Dwayne and I sent a message

475
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:26,121
to those responsible for
Shaun Yost's disappearance.

476
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,603
Did they get it?

477
00:36:27,676 --> 00:36:28,911
We don't know.

478
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:31,003
<I>We don't know.

479
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,645
Hey. That's cool.

480
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,812
He wonders what did
you do with his bear.

481
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:51,014
<I>He's keeping company with teddy.

482
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,007
He'd also like to be ascertained
what's going on in here.

483
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:59,081
- Just boys being boys.
- Boys.

484
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:04,762
All right, I'll tell him.

485
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:18,442
This is big.

486
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:22,045
What do you got, anything?

487
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:26,101
Good?

488
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:29,786
Contact.

489
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,060
I didn’t know I’d placed an order.

490
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,936
Status quo there...

491
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:53,877
know what I'm saying?
At a table, the most part.

492
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:57,848
Physician, maybe off
to his... clinic.

493
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:13,130
<I>Well, actually, my wife and I

494
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:17,024
<I>are hoping this is just a case of
our grandson Failing to check in.

495
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:21,615
Now, when you say
his companion is strange...

496
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:24,241
Well, he might kind
of might give the impression

497
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:27,033
of having a mental disorder,

498
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,300
retardation.

499
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:31,479
And you believe he's
a danger to your grandson?

500
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:34,742
I'm not absolutely...
prepared to say that.

501
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:37,183
Well, what are you
absolutely prepared to say?

502
00:38:37,197 --> 00:38:39,923
Were they already friends when
your grandson had his accident?

503
00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:42,459
What we know for sure is
that my grandson's missing,

504
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,261
that's why we involved the press.

505
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:46,363
Dad looks like he wants to take poison.

506
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:50,929
What if he tells those
reporters he can float...

507
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:52,179
Like a blimp?

508
00:38:52,324 --> 00:38:54,358
He can, mom. I saw it.

509
00:38:55,302 --> 00:38:57,545
Who cares what you saw?

510
00:38:57,546 --> 00:39:00,434
<I>Or how many figures show up
on that harelip's computer screen?

511
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:01,742
Me.

512
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:04,744
It makes me believe
he's coming back.

513
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:06,822
Good. Good.

514
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:09,582
That and two dimes of dope,
you should be sitting pretty.

515
00:39:10,672 --> 00:39:11,892
Anyways...

516
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:13,374
<I>That's right. Now run.

517
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,068
I'm not running anywhere, Ma.

518
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:19,220
I'm going over the fence and
I'm going out on the water.

519
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:20,426
Good.

520
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:23,166
Try to find time to fuck
yourself on the way.

521
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:30,199
It's gonna be all right.

522
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:35,979
<I>Where's fucking Kai?

523
00:39:37,693 --> 00:39:38,782
I don't know.

524
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,530
Somewheres waiting for Shaunie.

525
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,881
Got dressed,

526
00:39:57,882 --> 00:40:01,036
headed over to the internet cafe
like a man possessed.

527
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:03,520
You go there every morning.

528
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:06,210
<I>I never felt bore
like I had to, Ramon.

529
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:08,206
And I went...

530
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:11,228
And I saw that they needed me

531
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:14,845
and I improvised
that communication.

532
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:16,987
And... it was answered.

533
00:40:17,627 --> 00:40:19,489
You gonna improvise another one?

534
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,360
"What does your last answer mean?"

535
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:25,144
<I>Them stick figures in them
catalogs and over the bar?

536
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:28,732
"To whoever's gone with Shaun..."

537
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,465
This is ready.

538
00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:33,874
There's some more stuff
packed in the office.

539
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,505
How about giving me a hand and
taking this over to the Yosts?

540
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,482
Of course.

541
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,119
I can barely see where I'm going.

542
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:06,980
Chemist, you want tuna?

543
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:11,695
Thank you.

544
00:41:11,696 --> 00:41:14,211
<I>Come down after you're done
if you feel like it.

545
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:24,354
There's no way he'll come
back if I'm here.

546
00:41:24,457 --> 00:41:26,623
When they're done doing
whatever it is they do to you,

547
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:28,799
what do they do, pile drive
your head into the floor?

548
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,651
What are you talking about?

549
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:33,864
What... you're making sense
and then you talk so fucking stupid.

550
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:35,666
Fuck you.

551
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:37,968
You came back
to be his mother, right?

552
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:40,921
Because that's who
you said you wanted to be.

553
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,626
Aren't you still
his fucking mother?

554
00:41:44,091 --> 00:41:47,344
Couldn't you do him some
good being his mother...

555
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:48,652
Right now?

556
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:51,325
How about if you go up there

557
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:53,897
and you say "Please, bring my son back.

558
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:57,238
I know I've been bad. Give me a chance,
I'll be better, but...

559
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,723
Please bring my boy back"?

560
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:03,370
I can't. I can't go out there.
I wish I could.

561
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:05,796
I'll fall apart. I'll fuck it up.

562
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:08,949
Then stay in here and tell god.

563
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:19,476
We're very grateful
for your cooperation.

564
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,884
What's the word, Jacks?

565
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:26,075
Anderson!

566
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:31,088
How you doing?

567
00:42:31,338 --> 00:42:33,891
They still haven't filed
a missing persons report?

568
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:35,559
Not at this juncture.

569
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:38,495
- You want me to spell you?
- No thanks, I'm fine.

570
00:42:41,566 --> 00:42:42,975
All right, Bill.

571
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:46,303
Thanks for stopping by.

572
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:02,042
Hold on there.
Let's see what you've got.

573
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:10,041
<i>He's grown a lot
since this was taken.</i>

574
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:13,430
I couldn't exactly say how much.

575
00:43:15,649 --> 00:43:18,649
I don't know what he's saying,
but I know he's fucking up.

576
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,729
That was the man back in the day.

577
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,949
And that chick
that hung with him...

578
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:35,758
The hottest piece of ass
on those beaches.

579
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:37,521
Yeah well, those days are gone.

580
00:43:39,794 --> 00:43:41,973
I still recognize the both of you.

581
00:43:46,506 --> 00:43:49,829
Whoever I fuckin' ran away from
in that volcano 25 years ago,

582
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,151
I'm talkin' to you.

583
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,240
I don't give a fuck.

584
00:43:56,906 --> 00:43:59,302
<I>I don't need to understand.

585
00:44:00,726 --> 00:44:04,548
I would ask you,
avoid harming that kid.

586
00:44:06,836 --> 00:44:09,920
I would say I am here to ask you.

587
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:13,254
I would say I came here

588
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:14,530
to be here.

589
00:44:16,477 --> 00:44:18,307
I came to california...

590
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,330
to ask.

591
00:44:25,257 --> 00:44:26,754
Whatever's gonna happen...

592
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,380
What are these tits
telling you, Rock?

593
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,920
Rubbing up against
those sexy jug ears.

594
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:44,500
Closing time?

595
00:44:45,023 --> 00:44:47,157
Correct.

596
00:44:49,983 --> 00:44:52,763
If you'll trust me
with the key, I'll lock up.

597
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:58,936
Spare's under the planter out back.
