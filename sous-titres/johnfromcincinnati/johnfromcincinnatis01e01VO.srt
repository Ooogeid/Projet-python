2
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,000
The end is near.

3
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
Amen, my brother.

4
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,600
Those illegals act like it's...

5
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,500
just another day at the beach.

6
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,000
You know mitch yost?

7
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,600
Mitch yost should get back in the game.

8
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,900
Couple of fun ones mitch?

9
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,600
You should get back
in the game, mitch yost.

10
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,100
You should mind your own business.

11
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,600
Go fuck yourself.

12
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,250
In case you're not crazy,
I go back 20 years with this family.

13
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:18,790
The deal with the kid is in the works,

14
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,400
So stay away, or whoever's paying you
better have you on a good health plan.

15
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,265
Sammy, sammy.

16
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,900
- Tell shaun he needs to stop by the shop.
- Okay.

17
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,065
Don't forget.

18
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,900
Give you a free bar of wax.

19
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:22,077
I got nothing to do with
that space cadet back there.

20
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,200
I would never disrespect
your retirement.

21
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,300
God damn it!

22
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,500
A syringe.

23
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,100
Maybe it's one of butchie's.

24
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:37,800
What's happened with butchie is
one of the biggest regrets of my life.

25
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:41,500
Yeah, now he's proven to the world.
He can fuck up, just fine without a sponsor.

26
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,220
Am I gonna see you
at huntington this afternoon?

27
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
Why would you see me at huntington?

28
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,500
Nobody's seen me there in 20 years.

29
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,300
Your grandson's breaking his cherry.
I just assumed you knew.

30
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,665
Well, I didn't.

31
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,365
And if it's for a competition,
don't assume you're gonna see him.

32
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,206
And for sure don't expect
to get your fangs

33
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:01,100
his neck like you did in butchie's.

34
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,400
He sent this to me.

35
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,600
"Sponsor me."

36
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,000
Fucking butchie wants
to get shaun signed?

37
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,200
- Shaun sent it.
- Jesus Christ,  what?

38
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:16,100
He's 13, mitch.

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, you sign eight-year-olds.

40
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,365
Look, this is gonna happen.

41
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,700
I mean he wants to get signed,
and he's the real deal, and he's a yost.

42
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,200
Trust the devil you know, mitch.

43
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,665
So fast after nothing so long.

44
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,400
I know the wmd fiasco in iraq is fresh
in both our memories, ramon.

45
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,403
- There were none.
- And I may be as wrong in

46
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:52,012
my intelligence estimate
as the cia,

47
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,800
but the man who just
purchased this motel.

48
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,000
Doesn't strike me
as the most pleasant person.

49
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:59,700
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

50
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,800
Butchie probably better split.

51
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,400
Certainly he can't stay
on the present terms.

52
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:07,800
As a deadbeat.

53
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,750
Say he paid you $200.

54
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:11,365
Like that's gonna happen.

55
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,400
We can tell the new owner
you just discovered butchie squatting.

56
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:17,800
What about the six months'
worth of garbage in his room?

57
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,100
Butchie yost revolutionized
surfing, ramon.

58
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:22,265
<i>He changed the entire idea of it.</i>

59
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,665
<i>This place was supposed to stay vacant,</i>

60
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,400
And I think you're a little old
for hero worship.

61
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
- Ladies.
- Butchie, a moment.

62
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,200
Was the brigade out today?

63
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,400
We were, yes.
The association of surfing attorneys.

64
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,900
Butchie, the motel just sold.
It's out of receivership.

65
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,665
I have to take a horrendous dump, ramon,

66
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,200
And after that,
I wanna hear every fucking detail.

67
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,600
<i>This is very important, butchie.</i>

68
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Can I show you something?

69
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,300
I settled yost's injury
claim with the city yesterday, ramon.

70
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,600
When he passed out under
the beach sweeper?

71
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:00,000
- He got $2,300.
- Yesterday.

72
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,400
If that's already gone,
I'm good for the $200.

73
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,400
I'm gonna get the truck.
You put these on,

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,500
And we neaten up for the new owner.

75
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
We do this fast.
I'll be back.

76
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,900
<i>Hey, frat boy.</i>

77
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,800
<i>Drove down to t. J.
To see the donkey show, did you?</i>

78
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,300
<i>Some dickhead spike your drink?</i>

79
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,800
50 bucks.

80
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,700
I drop you anywhere
within imperial beach.

81
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,300
Turn out your pockets.

82
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,600
Turn our your pockets.

83
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
$50 on the nose.

84
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,300
Let's go before
the migra jumps our shit.

85
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,500
God damn taco benders just ran past me
like I was homeland security.

86
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:27,600
Too goddamn ignorant
to realize who wants to help them.

87
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,850
Some things I know,
and some things I don't.

88
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:32,042
Spare me the babe-
In-The-Woods routine.

89
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:34,200
You just paid to see
a donkey fuck a woman.

90
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,000
No, I'm disappointed, freddie,
out here in California.

91
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm out the $2,300.
I got beat on the buy.

92
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,865
Freddie, I cannot make
myself believe that

93
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,600
that gland case and his fucking
ice-Cream truck

94
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:52,300
had the balls to fucking
screw me on an ounce

95
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,400
without your fucking say-So.

96
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Young Mr. Yost.

97
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,700
Butchie's son.

98
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,100
He shreds.

99
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,200
Butchie's parents have custody.

100
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,300
Probation situation.
I took care of it.

101
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,100
God damn it!

102
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,800
I'll come back at you, freddie.
No, I got too much downside.

103
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,500
All right, and you better
make it fucking right.

104
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,700
<i>- I'm not done with my dump yet, ramon.
- It's me, dad.</i>

105
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,700
Hey, shaunie.

106
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,700
How's it going, buddy?

107
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Come on in.

108
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,800
Sorry about the fucking mess.

109
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,500
The grom that I paid to clean up
got hit by a fucking van.

110
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,200
- How long ago?
- Yeah...

111
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,500
I gotta get a replacement, huh?

112
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,600
What's going on?
How's sixth grade?

113
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,553
- It was good.
- Yeah?

114
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,600
You want something to drink?

115
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,200
Tap water ain't fatal.

116
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm supposed to surf the event
at huntington this afternoon.

117
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,450
Your grandfather sign off on that?

118
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,900
Gram did.

119
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,400
That sounds more like it.

120
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
- Think you might want to go?
- No, fuck,

121
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,700
not if you want them
to let you on the water.

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
I'm fucking barred up there, buddy.

123
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:30,899
From watching, too?

124
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,300
What the fuck do I wanna go
up there for, shaunie, okay?

125
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:35,000
Those things are fucking bullshit.

126
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Okay.

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,100
Not for you.

128
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, you know, I mean,
I don't give a fuck if you want to.

129
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,400
Okay.

130
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,200
It's not that
I don't give a fuck, okay?

131
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,300
It's just ...

132
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,200
when did I ever tell you not to do
something is all I'm trying to say?

133
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,300
Okay.

134
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,090
You know everyone says you're great.

135
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:04,300
You'll probably fucking win the thing
and get sponsored and all that shit.

136
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,600
Anyways.

137
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,900
Just don't pull your left nut out.

138
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,700
Like you did your last event?

139
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah, it tends to get you d. Q. Ed.

140
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,800
How's it going?

141
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,700
Butchi wasn't that good when he was 13.

142
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,700
Were you?

143
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,199
- Did you take that footage?
- Some.

144
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,900
Some shaunie collected from his friends.

145
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,400
He put it together.

146
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,300
But you sent it to linc.

147
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,265
I sent one to everyone shaun thought
might want to sponsor him.

148
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,949
Including the bastard
who helped turn butchie

149
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:59,000
into the ditch-Sleeping doper
shitbird he is today.

150
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:01,165
Shaun doesn't have to be butchie.

151
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,806
Yeah, but you're still you, aren't you?

152
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,349
You entered shaun in the contest today.

153
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,700
He entered.
I signed the form as guardian.

154
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,600
- Hi, gram, gramps.
- Hey.

155
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,300
Sammy said you wanted me to stop by.

156
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,900
How'd that board feel?

157
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,300
<i>It was good.</i>

158
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,200
Not too stiff?

159
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
We're worried about those rails.

160
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,900
- Hey, shaun.
- Hi, kai.

161
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,100
Morning.

162
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,700
Go in the back.

163
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,900
Go in the back.

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,601
Come on, let's go in the back, shaun.

165
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,000
I guess I'm supposed
to be there by 11:00.

166
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,200
You are not taking him up
to that contest today.

167
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:10,599
And any permissions you've signed,

168
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I'll drive up there and I'll rescind.
I'll rip up the waivers.

169
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:17,200
I'll bury any money-Bitch
would-Be sponsor in a pit

170
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:19,800
<i>Starting with linc-Fucking-Stark.</i>

171
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,300
What happened to butchie
is not happening to shaun.

172
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,300
I understand.

173
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
The kahuna has spoken.

174
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,500
And I got fucking cancer.

175
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,700
Right here in my brain.

176
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,071
Get to Bill's house, shaunie.

177
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:59,365
Tell Bill I hoped he would
drive you to your event.

178
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,100
- Could you call him?
- You know how he is about the phone.

179
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,865
Here's your accident liability waiver.

180
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
I already mailed in your
entry and your fee.

181
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Don't show it to Bill
until you get to the event.

182
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:11,300
Otherwise, he'll be worried
about it all the way up.

183
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:13,806
Show it to him
when you get to huntington,

184
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:15,679
<i>When you're walking
to the registration table.</i>

185
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,100
But then you watch him give it to them.

186
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:19,300
Okay, gram.

187
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,700
'Cause they have
to get it from an adult.

188
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,100
Okay.

189
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,500
Then you put your jersey on,

190
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,300
and you paddle out.

191
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
And you kick some ass.

192
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
<i>You comfy cozy, sweat pea?</i>

193
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,000
Slip you a mickey
and then forget to roll you.

194
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Typical beaner behavior.

195
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Somethings I know,
and some things I don't.

196
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,100
Tell me something you know.

197
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,200
The end is near.

198
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,200
Feel that way half the time myself.

199
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Mitch yost should get back in the game.

200
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,400
I don't know mitch yost.

201
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,900
I should have a good health plan,
I see mitch yost again.

202
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,500
Butchie yost I know.

203
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
Flops in that shithouse on 7th.

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,800
<i>What do you want?</i>

205
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,600
What do you mean?

206
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,500
Some things I know,
and some things I don't.

207
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll drop you at butchie's.

208
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:28,700
He may know where mitch is.

209
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Get you your health coverage.

210
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,600
Then I'm gonna roll a fucking fat one.

211
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,100
How's it going, Bill?

212
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,599
How are you?

213
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,200
They're running the mexican wrestling.

214
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,400
I'll tell you one thing: they're
overexposing these masked midgets.

215
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,000
Grams asked me to ask you
if you wouldn't mind driving me today.

216
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,900
No no no, not at all.

217
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,300
Don't tell gramps about
any of it, okay, Bill?

218
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,600
You know, my neck is killing me.

219
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,500
Your fibromyalgia?

220
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,100
You making fun of me?

221
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,700
'Cause that'a written
diagnosis by a v. A. Physician.

222
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,200
What happened to zippy?

223
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,800
Oh my God.

224
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,300
- Is zippy dead?
- It's all right. This happens.

225
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,700
This is something you learn to accept.

226
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,900
<i>Zippy was a good bird.</i>

227
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,400
That's right.

228
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,300
That's correct.

229
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,100
When you're older you'll understand.

230
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
- Should we bury him?
- That's not for you.

231
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,300
You'll have more than
one occasion later.

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,400
I got twinkies around.
You want a twinkie?

233
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,499
I can help, Bill.
Let me help.

234
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,700
You don't hold on
to a bird once it's passed.

235
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
This is something that you learn.

236
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,100
Jesus, Mary and joseph.

237
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,400
He's alive!

238
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
Well, this is...

239
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,000
this is something.

240
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,500
Zip, we thought you croaked.

241
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,700
Gimme a kiss...

242
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
give the kid a kiss too,
as long as you're being stupid.

243
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,500
Hey, zippy.

244
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,900
I'll tell...

245
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,400
I don't know anymore if
I'm on foot or horseback

246
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Or if a bird's alive or dead.

247
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,700
- He was dead, Bill.
- Obviously, he wasn't.

248
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
When you're older,
you'll understand.

249
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,800
I saw him.

250
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,300
I'm losing my train of thought lately.

251
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,600
<i>Everything else.</i>

252
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,400
You'll understand more fully
when you're grown.

253
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,800
That is sick.

254
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,765
What are you doing?

255
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,400
Want to get fibromyalgia?

256
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:25,600
It's cool.

257
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,800
Christ,

258
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,500
moke ordered a fish.

259
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,700
You kidding me?
He's gonna sink that friggin' thing.

260
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,332
Why does what happened
to butchie make it fucked up

261
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,000
to help shaunie do
what any 13-Year-Old would want to?

262
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,600
He fucking forbids me
to let shaunie compete.

263
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,165
I'm not mitch's wife, cissy.

264
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,400
All the time you spend with shaun...

265
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,100
you know butchie better than anybody.

266
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,500
Or shaun's guardian or butchie's mother.

267
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,100
And he tells me he's got a brain tumor.

268
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,600
Mitch has got a brain tumor?

269
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,700
Wouldn't put it past him,
either, fucking jerk.

270
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,200
<i>It beeped.
Leave a message...</i>

271
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,900
Yeah, I know what to do at the beep.

272
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,565
Here's your fucking message, freddie.

273
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,500
In one more fucking hour
someone hasn't shown up to get me right,

274
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:49,165
You get hit in hawaii
by a law enforcement tsunami

275
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,600
and your fucking ice-Cream man goes over
a cliff in his fucking truck!

276
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Looks like we got a full load.

277
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,000
You're really good at this.

278
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,700
I have office business, ramon.

279
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,100
Have to go home and

280
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,700
wash up before I conduct it.

281
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,000
The new owner takes possession at 3:00.

282
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:19,100
Mr. Cunningham. I'll be back then.

283
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Don't forget: bring the $200 with you.

284
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,600
Here's another one
who has to change his ways.

285
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,500
Vietnam Joe.

286
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,000
The snug harbor's closed as a stop
on his underground railroad.

287
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,200
That guy doesn't fit Joe's profile.

288
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,900
The three stooges.

289
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,900
I could eat a bowl of soup off
the top of either of your heads.

290
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,300
Which room in the palace
is butchie yost's?

291
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
If he was here, He'd be in f.

292
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,500
Okay, you go over there,

293
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,900
you knock on the door.

294
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,000
Show me.

295
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah.

296
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,700
You're on your own.

297
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,200
Ramon wants to talk to you, Joe.

298
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
Try to keep that short.

299
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,600
<i>What do you want, butchie yost?</i>

300
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,800
I wanna see some dope come out
of your pockets, or my $2,300.

301
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,765
Here I am, eyes to see
the Sunset loaded,

302
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,200
and just flew off the handle
with your people.

303
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:09,000
What a fucking jerk.

304
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,700
Let's go call the ice-cream man
and tell him I'm sorry.

305
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,800
I'm coming in, mitch.

306
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,600
<i>The grand poobah's inner sanctum.</i>

307
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,900
Holy father, great tao,

308
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,700
fucking dalai lama.

309
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,700
<i>Why would you think
you've got brain cancer?</i>

310
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm hallucinating.

311
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,100
You been getting high?

312
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,000
No, it wasn't a hallucination.
It's not like acid.

313
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:47,765
You just said you were hallucinating.

314
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,200
- I used the wrong word.
- What's the right word, mitch?

315
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:51,665
<i>Your sinuses are plugged?</i>

316
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,000
'Cause that does point
straight at brain cancer.

317
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,500
In the lot, after I surfed, I...

318
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,600
I was up in the air,
is how it felt.

319
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,300
Half the time with ear infections
I get dizzy like that.

320
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,400
Go to see a doctor.

321
00:24:15,435 --> 00:24:19,100
If I've got a tumor, I don't want
their machines getting ahold of me.

322
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Welcome to the rest
of our fucking lives!

323
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,600
You surf when no one can see you,
me especially.

324
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:29,917
Rest of the day you're
in your clubhouse.

325
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,200
Next week or next year we get the call:

326
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,700
<i>Butchie's dead in some fucking dumpster.</i>

327
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:36,600
But the breaking news today:

328
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Shaun.

329
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,500
Doesn't get out either,

330
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,600
'cause big mitch fucking forbids it.

331
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,900
<i>Because 20 years ago
his knee got a boo-Boo.</i>

332
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,500
A boo-Boo, they nearly amputated.

333
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,400
Suppose you do have a tumor.

334
00:24:57,435 --> 00:24:59,800
Suppose you're fucking dying.

335
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,900
<i>How are you gonna kill the time
before you check out?</i>

336
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,400
What about the healing power of sex?

337
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,800
Right.

338
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,165
You give me $2,300

339
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,700
and the ice-cream man says
he doesn't know you.

340
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,200
Empty your pockets, bro,
so we don't start not getting along.

341
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:33,983
All right, show me something
with your name on it.

342
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
These fucking platinum cards
got that rocket fuel,

343
00:25:51,435 --> 00:25:53,365
don't they, John?
Vroom vroom.

344
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,900
- Vroom.
- What were you up to, John,

345
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:58,000
just before you came to see me?

346
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,900
What there a little bit of the...

347
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,300
wacky tabacky involved?

348
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,900
- Does that begin to ring a bell?
- Does it ring a bell?

349
00:26:08,122 --> 00:26:10,736
Where I'm going, John, is are you
fucked up at the present moment?

350
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,500
Speed, freon, tire sealer,

351
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:14,366
the little green chunks
from the cat litter?

352
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:15,700
Doesn't ring a bell.

353
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,500
Who I am rings a bell, right, John?
You know I'm butchie yost.

354
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,000
Butchie yost rings a bell.

355
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,565
All right, John,
we'll work with what we got.

356
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,700
Now my conclusion, not confusing
myself with sherlock holmes,

357
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,665
Is a: you're a little shy.

358
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,300
And b: you just broke your piggy bank
or you have a few dollars in the family.

359
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:34,400
C:

360
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,800
You're here to surf with the beast.

361
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,965
I am here to surf with the beast.

362
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Butchie "the beast" yost.
Bringing him out of semiretirement.

363
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,967
Bring butchie out of semiretirement.

364
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,865
Learn from the best,
fuck the rest.

365
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,300
- That costs top dollar.
- Top dollar rings a bell.

366
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,865
It wouldn't be the first time, John,

367
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,100
That worried parents were
part of the story.

368
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
How about worried doctors?

369
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,165
Worried doctors aren't
a part of the story.

370
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,166
Or worried parents.

371
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:06,000
Worried parents don't
ring a bell, butchie.

372
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:09,400
Of course, parts of my story
you don't know either, right?

373
00:27:09,435 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm no open book to you,

374
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,100
<i>whatever blshit you read
in those fucking magazines.</i>

375
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:16,621
Here's what we're gonna do,

376
00:27:16,622 --> 00:27:18,800
We're gonna take each other
at face value,

377
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:20,900
And get to know each other better
as we go along.

378
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,876
Now money's gonna have to
change hands between us.

379
00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:24,386
You're gonna be spending some of cash.

380
00:27:24,387 --> 00:27:26,500
You got expenses, fees.

381
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
I need to know that
you're down for that.

382
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,500
I'm down for that.

383
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,500
Let me hear it, John.
How big you are fucking down for it.

384
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:36,665
Hear it big, butchie.

385
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,100
John and his cash and his plastic are
down with butchie the beast!

386
00:27:41,135 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm down!

387
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,500
Don't do that, John.
Don't ...

388
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
okay, let's pick up our credit card,

389
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,100
and let's be adult around
our possessions.

390
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,800
Was shaun really disappointed
when you told him he couldn't go?

391
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,800
He never shows what he's feeling.

392
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,100
Yeah, he plays it pretty
close to the vest.

393
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,100
I think that's good.

394
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,300
Maybe we should get a camera.

395
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,000
Just to show it's not,
if I feel it happening again,

396
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,000
going up in the air.

397
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,600
I get it.

398
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,100
I'll pick you up one at jenco.

399
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,808
I hope you're doodling,
'cause we know you can't write.

400
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,500
Urgent care's down the street.

401
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,000
- Say hi to John, kai.
- Hi, John.

402
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,600
- Hi, kai.
- My student and main man.

403
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:19,900
We want an outfit, nose to tail.

404
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,700
Full-Goddamn-Pop on
every wetsuit and surfboard

405
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,865
- we fucking-A decide to buy, right?
- Fucking-A, right.

406
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,965
Full fucking quiver.

407
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,700
Special attention to the board
shaped by the little lady here,

408
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,972
meaning she will benefit from

409
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:34,700
that rocket propellant in
your fucking platinum card.

410
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:37,000
Maybe he just wants to start one.

411
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,365
Hey, check out those boards, John.

412
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,000
Examine 'em closely
while kai and me have a talk.

413
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:45,600
Every surfer needs a backup.
Dos minimum.

414
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,400
Dos minimum.

415
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:49,231
Wouldn't this be a day
to write home about

416
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:50,800
if I wasn't homeless and disowned?

417
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,289
I finally get that fucking
injury settlement,

418
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,600
and I fucking invest in a lid, and
that fucking samoan sells me quinine.

419
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:58,000
Too bad you don't got malaria.

420
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,969
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

421
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,200
Where'd you come up with him?

422
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,100
He came up with me.
He knocked on my fucking door.

423
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,200
<i>John monad.</i>

424
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,200
Sounds French.

425
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,700
What, the dragon lady call in sick?
'Cause she isn't.

426
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
She's taking fucking
shaunie to huntington.

427
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
Is that right?

428
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,600
Or maybe you already knew.

429
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,700
Shaun wanted to enter, butchie.

430
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,100
He's been working
on a "sponsor me" video for months.

431
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,601
Why don't you just enter him
in a jerk off competition

432
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:34,765
because he's been working his Johnson
in the bathroom?

433
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,798
I didn't enter him.

434
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,600
You didn't tell me when
I walked in here.

435
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,767
- It's your family.
- She signs your paycheck.

436
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:41,865
You haven't seen shaun
in six months, butchie.

437
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,810
You have no fucking clue, kai,
how much time him and me spend together.

438
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:45,999
Yeah, right.

439
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
He's a liar.

440
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:49,600
Hey, fuck you, kai.

441
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,209
I try to throw you
some fucking business,

442
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:53,665
and you put my balls in a vice?

443
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,600
I don't need you
to throw me any business.

444
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:58,100
Okay, sorry to fucking bother you.

445
00:30:58,135 --> 00:30:59,600
Give my love to my mom.

446
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,000
Come on, John.

447
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,200
Bye, kai.

448
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,100
Who does she think she fucking is?

449
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,500
She's kai, butchie.

450
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,300
I signed over custody
so I wouldn't louse that kid up.

451
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,800
Plus I had to to get fucking probation.

452
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,700
Where is my fucking phone?

453
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,900
Some things I know,
and some things I don't.

454
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,285
I don't suppose you have a phone,
John, do you?

455
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:24,911
Some things I know,
and some things I don't.

456
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:26,200
Jesus fucking Christ.

457
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,923
Every time you wanna say, "some things
I know, and some things I don't,"

458
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:30,700
Just say,
"I don't know, butchie," instead.

459
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,100
I don't know, butchie, instead.

460
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,300
I wanna see where my fucking old man
is in all this shit.

461
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,700
Where's mitch "the holy man" yost?

462
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,914
- I like kai.
- Yeah, you would, John.

463
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:49,316
I begin to seal about you, you know.

464
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:51,600
You probably can fucking bone her
if you try hard enough.

465
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:53,400
- I'll bone her.
- Yeah.

466
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,600
Might want to have to bust her jaw first
so she'd shut the fuck up.

467
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,399
Hello.

468
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,100
Congratulations on being
a fucking gutless cunt.

469
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,099
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

470
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,500
It means you're a selfish
fucking cocksucker, that's what.

471
00:32:07,535 --> 00:32:10,418
What, you tired of no one's asking you,
So you go ahead and okay for him?

472
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:12,800
Maybe you wanna tell me
what the fuck you're talking about.

473
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:14,400
Shaun in huntington.

474
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,800
He's not going.

475
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,600
<i>He's there then with you.</i>

476
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,150
What's that, dad?

477
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:24,400
I can't hear.

478
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,500
Well, I've forbidden it.
Your mother will see he doesn't go.

479
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,100
<i>Mother?
Did you say mother will see?</i>

480
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,268
That's a good one, pop.
'Cause I got news for you:

481
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:36,065
Mother will see to it that he does go,

482
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,100
and then you won't have a fucking clue
until the deal is done.

483
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:41,335
But that's gonna be okay
with you, isn't it? You know.

484
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,865
Mother does the dirty
spadework,

485
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,265
while fucking shaun wins
a few dirty competitions

486
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,462
and more dirty money starts flowing
into mitch's fucking ashram.

487
00:32:48,463 --> 00:32:50,366
<i>Yeah, don't forget
the dirty needles, butchie.</i>

488
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,400
<i>How about that other
dirty business you're not in?</i>

489
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:54,665
<i>Of being a fucking father to your son.</i>

490
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,252
<i>So your mother and I hat to
wind up taking legal custody.</i>

491
00:32:57,253 --> 00:32:59,183
I oughta drive down to
that shitbox you live in

492
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:02,600
- and kick your fucking ass!
- You could fucking try, dad.

493
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:03,965
I'm on my way, son.

494
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,400
Don't forget to lube up your
bone-On-Bone knee, you fucking goat!

495
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,300
Don't forget to shoot up some courage!

496
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,600
Fuck you!

497
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,700
What a dick!

498
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,200
I think he's actually gonna come.

499
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,365
God damn,
I gotta get high.

500
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,865
I gotta get good and fucking high

501
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,800
So I could kick that
cocksucker's fucking ass.

502
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,800
Fucking high, I gotta get high.

503
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,100
I gotta get high, man.

504
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,200
Are you from someplace cold, John?

505
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,065
I don't know, butchie, instead.

506
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,765
I bet if you're from
someplace cold,

507
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,500
that your mom clipped your mittens
to your fucking coat.

508
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:44,899
You want to meet a happy family,

509
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,500
Watch a saturday morning cartoons, John.
Meet the fucking jetsons.

510
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,865
Meet the fucking jetsons.

511
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,851
Hey, you wanna see my old man
get his ass kicked?

512
00:33:52,852 --> 00:33:54,700
Just take a ride with me, pal.

513
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,200
<i>Shift supervisor pick up 432.</i>

514
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,300
<i>Shift supervisor pick up 432.</i>

515
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,300
I'm looking for an instamatic.

516
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Would you consider a diabetic,
if hardworking and handsome?

517
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,500
An instamatic camera, Gary.

518
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,700
We don't have it.

519
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,000
- You don't?
- No, no instamatics.

520
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,583
I'm fully acquainted with our inventory,
ma'am. We no longer carry instamatics.

521
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:52,572
We have digital cameras,
and we have disposables,

522
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:54,800
And those are all in aisle 74.

523
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,550
Okay, those nearly hit me.

524
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:02,900
No, those nearly didn't.

525
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,300
Up your ass!

526
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,600
Up your nose with a rubber hose.

527
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,100
Fuck you!

528
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
Excuse me. I lost my temper.

529
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,500
Step out of the line, please, ma'am.

530
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:49,099
Why?

531
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,500
Please step out of the line.

532
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,500
You fucking idiot with your tin badge
and your stupid fucking goatee.

533
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,572
- 427.
- Oh, we up to a 427 now?

534
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:58,988
You going for the mace and tasers?

535
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:00,500
Please step out of the line.

536
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:02,600
Okay, these checkout lines
are closed, folks.

537
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:04,367
They'll help you over here.
Thanks a lot.

538
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:06,100
This guy made a half-Assed pass at me.

539
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,200
I am a diabetic.
I did no such thing.

540
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,800
Come with me, ma'am.

541
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,265
Just get your hands off me.

542
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,700
- Ma'am, ma'am.
- Hey, get your hands off of me.

543
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:15,900
Ma'am, please.

544
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,300
Maybe we should have had
one of those flower necklaces for him.

545
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,200
It's called a Lei.
It may come to that.

546
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,100
The snug harbor's new owner, ramon.

547
00:36:35,135 --> 00:36:36,400
<i>Mr. Cunningham.</i>

548
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,950
If attorney dickstein has been discreet,

549
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:45,092
it will now surprise
you to learn, ramon,

550
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:47,200
I'm a winner
of the mega millions lottery.

551
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,993
Whoa, congratulations!

552
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:52,565
I disclose this to explain,

553
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,100
that I am armed in accord with the state
lottery commission's pamphlet,

554
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:57,665
<i>"The challenge of sudden wealth."</i>

555
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,400
Which urges that winners be cautious in
the conduct of their business affairs.

556
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:02,500
Sensible.

557
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,600
In any case,

558
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:12,700
after a 20 years interlude in azusa,
I am returned to imperial beach.

559
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,850
I've told ramon that
you intend to keep him on.

560
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,865
In fact, ramon,
you won't continue as manager.

561
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,900
I told attorney dickstein
I'd be keeping you on salary.

562
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,565
Naturally, I'd assumed...

563
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,165
I'm going to level this place.

564
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,265
I have many cousins
that can help to level,

565
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,300
and my cousin margarita works
for the department of permits.

566
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,100
- Level it?
- Level it.

567
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,900
I will not be surprised
nor judge harshly, ramon,

568
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,810
<i>To learn that you've supplemented
your stipend from the court</i>

569
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:49,600
taking in guests off the libros.

570
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:53,400
That guest is my responsibility,
Mr. Cunningham.

571
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,165
A relative down on his luck?

572
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,250
I surf a little.
He was a great surfer.

573
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:01,300
<i>And, yes, he was down on his luck.</i>

574
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,500
Pull the handle,
push the door, John.

575
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:06,100
He did pay $200

576
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,400
for staying here a couple of days,
which ramon insisted on.

577
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:14,200
Yeah, he was a spokesman
for that tequila. Butchie.

578
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:16,899
Butchie.

579
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,700
Sit down and stay right here.

580
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,600
I'm gonna roll me a fucking fat one.

581
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,600
Full fucking quiver, right, John?

582
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,200
- Huh?
- I don't know, butchie, instead.

583
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Better have a good fucking
health plan you see mitch yost again.

584
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:35,600
Butchie yost, he changed surfing.

585
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,100
Butchie yost?

586
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,400
Deal with the kids in the works.

587
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,800
Jesus Christ!

588
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,200
This is a blowout.

589
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,200
This is a puncture of
the left front tire.

590
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,865
This is all fucked up, man.
My grandson's got a surfing contest.

591
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,700
My husband and I are
supposed to take him.

592
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,300
Mitch yost, the wonderful surfer
from before the talkies.

593
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:01,200
Does that make you
butchie yost's mother?

594
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
- Is that a crime now, too?
- Watch your head.

595
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:06,700
What the fuck does it even mean?

596
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,200
Stay out of this, John.

597
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:18,300
Stay back.

598
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,165
The end is near.

599
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,165
Right here, you ancient fuck.
Now's your shot.

600
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,600
Yeah, let me give you today's excuse
for shooting up.

601
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,100
<i>Bring it, you fuck!</i>

602
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,465
<i>Nothing to be ashamed of at any age,</i>

603
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,400
to be afraid to change
a tire in traffic.

604
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,500
I swear we'll get you to your event.

605
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,100
The pigs got grandma.

606
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,500
Have I told you not to use that word?

607
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:45,700
I'm gonna pull it over here.

608
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Probably completely obliterate the rim.

609
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,765
<i>This is my dad's motel.</i>

610
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,100
<i>I can't help it.
Circumstances have intervened.</i>

611
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,100
<i>Come on, you little shit.
What are you afraid of?</i>

612
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:56,800
<i>Right here.
Now's your chance.</i>

613
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:57,900
Motherfucker.

614
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
<i>- I oughta kick your fucking teeth in.
- Fucking bring it.</i>

615
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,400
- We are all frail vessels.
- Come on, motherfucker.

616
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,700
What's this nonsense now?

617
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,300
- Extraordinary.
- Butchie's mom hurt barry's head.

618
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:15,699
Stay down, shaunie.

619
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,465
<i>Even as I try to close the libros
Of this sordid edifice,</i>

620
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,650
<i>Write finis to the story
of my deflowering at 10</i>

621
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:26,700
<i>- In room 24...
- Room 24 will give up its dead</i>

622
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:29,082
<i>- And the dead shall be forgiven.
- I find characters from another</i>

623
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,300
<i>chapter of my life intruding.</i>

624
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,617
Not completely following,
Mr. Cunningham,

625
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:36,576
but so certain guns are not the answer.

626
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:39,200
Does your grotesque spawn still...

627
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,300
wield the old broom handle, mitch?

628
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,900
<i>Brain the occasional
12-Year-Old shell collector?</i>

629
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,165
What the fuck are you talking about?

630
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,000
Maybe he and butchie have
some history on the beach.

631
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,100
Where ramon is from,
they would build mitch a shrine.

632
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:56,900
<i>...from the slack-Jawed
mutant, butchie, on the beach,</i>

633
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:59,900
<i>- Lo, those many years ago.
- I remember him.</i>

634
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,600
We were in the sixth grade together.
It's barry the fairy.

635
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,500
And were you
not the surfer, mitch,

636
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:08,267
<i>who paddled in to see what happened,</i>

637
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:11,000
<i>then turned and paddled back out?</i>

638
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,900
<i>I was trying to hit you
with the broom part, barry.</i>

639
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,300
No one meant to hit you with the handle.

640
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,000
<i>Oh, why,</i>

641
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,943
I wonder if knowing that

642
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:25,600
mightn't have kept me from
contracting epilepsy in the aftermath.

643
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:27,300
<i>The broom part fell off.</i>

644
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,000
The broom part fell off, ramon.

645
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,600
Don't we find so often our bodies
are theaters of our resentments?

646
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:37,299
<i>Certainly, sens does...</i>

647
00:41:37,307 --> 00:41:40,000
One good blowjob rocked
the Jew lawyer's world.

648
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:42,000
<i>...in room 24,</i>

649
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,100
<i>Mine has hosted vaudevilles
of degradation.</i>

650
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,200
No no no. Hey, barry barry barry!

651
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,400
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

652
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,500
<i>And you two carrying on with your wife</i>

653
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,265
<i>and your mother in custody.</i>

654
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,543
<i>- My mother? In custody?</i>
- Shaun will soon be gone.

655
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,700
Get this fruit out of the sun.

656
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,900
- I'm shaun.
- I'm John.

657
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,100
How's it going?

658
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
It's disorderly conduct,
for God's sake.

659
00:42:29,635 --> 00:42:31,267
She's gotta be run for warrants.

660
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:32,900
<i>It's a citation and release.</i>

661
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:38,191
Expedite the warrant search. Let's
get this senile bastard out of here.

662
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,731
What is that little back and forth?

663
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,650
I'm behind the desk now, Bill,

664
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,342
and I'm asking you to sit down.

665
00:42:44,377 --> 00:42:46,000
How about if I don't sit down?

666
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,100
How about if I make your
circulars current?

667
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:51,200
<i>How about that?
Because they're a disgrace.</i>

668
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,600
Here's one:
hernandez Robbery and car theft.

669
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:57,665
I swear to God, this guy changed
my oil not two days ago.

670
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,100
It's an honor to be in the company
of a surfing legend.

671
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,400
Thank you again.

672
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,900
We lost you too soon to your knee.

673
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,400
I get around all right.

674
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,600
And your son
also, to his many difficulties.

675
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,865
<i>Well, you see him breathing there.</i>

676
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,300
Competitively, I meant,
we've lost him.

677
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,465
Does that about get it all said?

678
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Except for my thanks for the pleasure
you gave me as a spectator.

679
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,000
You're welcome.

680
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,000
So I guess you missed your event.

681
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,800
Are you proud of me?

682
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,700
No, I said I didn't want to go, shaunie.

683
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,000
'Cause it's so lame?

684
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,000
Which isn't saying
you should be missing shit.

685
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,300
Anyways.

686
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,400
How's it going?

687
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,800
I'll say just one more thing:
Trestles, 1979.

688
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,600
To see you surf was all I wanted
for my bar Mitzvah.

689
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,100
You're a fifth fucking wheel
around here, dickstein.

690
00:44:09,101 --> 00:44:10,899
You feel they'd want me
to make a statement?

691
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,700
I'll make a statement if need be.

692
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,100
I'm the department retiree.

693
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,700
- And I have the weapon.
- Please don't speakof any weapon.

694
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,700
Your assignment is to keep my truck
from being disassembled

695
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,800
by marauding lowlifes and to make sure
that that fruit gets home.

696
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,953
- He has a car of his own.
- Hybrid,

697
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:27,400
which the marauders won't bother.

698
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,664
And if the fruit's allowed at the wheel,
I'm liable to drive off a bridge.

699
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,200
For God's sake, dickstein,
only one hand can be at the helm.

700
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,700
Please tell everyone I left.

701
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,100
Like anybody gives a fuck.

702
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,100
If I ask,

703
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,900
is shaunie gonna tell me
Bill was taking him to huntington?

704
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,900
Well, he's not much of a liar.

705
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,400
Well, I guess that's between
me and your mother.

706
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,600
I went bullshit at a jenco.

707
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,600
I don't speak Spanish, honey.

708
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,000
<i>He must read some old fucking magazines.</i>

709
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,000
He signed up to be my student and told
me you should get back in the game.

710
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,000
Yeah, he td me the same thing
at the beach this morning.

711
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,900
He's harmless

712
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,900
And fucking rich.

713
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,300
I just found out I'm pretty sick.

714
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,200
That's why I short-Fused
when you fucking called.

715
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,000
I got beat on some dope.

716
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,300
I'm dopesick, dad,
is what I'm trying to say.

717
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,600
Gonna be.

718
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,500
I mean, that's why
I was cranky on the phone.

719
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,700
Am I up in the air right now?

720
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,099
<i>What do you mean?</i>

721
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,300
- Are my feet off the ground?
- No.

722
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,900
You don't even fucking look?

723
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,900
What do I have to look for, dad?
You're not off the fucking ground.

724
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,900
That's the tumor's big symptom.

725
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,100
Feeling like you're up in the air.

726
00:46:56,904 --> 00:46:58,995
So it's in your brain.
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

727
00:46:58,996 --> 00:47:00,400
When did they do the tests?

728
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,700
What difference does it make?

729
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,700
<i>- Does mom know?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

730
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,400
I had to tell her this morning.

731
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,900
Fuck, I...

732
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,800
I'm sorry I broke your balls. That's
the last fucking thing you needed.

733
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,400
You're up.

734
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,300
<i>It feels like I am.</i>

735
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,600
<i>You are.</i>

736
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,000
You're off the ground, dad.

737
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
You're like 2 1/2 inches
in the fucking air.

738
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,000
<i>Feels like more.</i>

739
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,700
Well, if that's a tumor,
where do I sign up?

740
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,400
What is your name?

741
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,400
My name is John.

742
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,100
- He's my friend.
- I'm his friend.

743
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,000
<i>Well, friend of shaun,</i>

744
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,200
I got my eye on you.

745
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,600
I got my eye on you.

746
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,500
No, I got my eye on you.

747
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,154
No, I got my eye on you.

748
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,800
I'll watch my own head.

749
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,000
Are you preferring charges, too?

750
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,200
We gotta get wet.

751
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,100
<i>Do you have another gun, Mr. Cunningham?</i>

752
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,700
I did not buy a backup,
against the advice of pete's pistol hut.

753
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,600
Do you feel at this moment you may
otherwise be a danger to yourself?

754
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,900
No, I do not feel at this moment

755
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,100
That I'm otherwise a danger to myself.

756
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,200
Do you surf?

757
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,200
I do not surf.

758
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,100
<i>You should try it sometime.</i>

759
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,500
It's fun.

760
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,300
Well, I...

761
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,300
hope I'll see you tomorrow.

762
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:50,199
I gotta ask you, John.

763
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,300
We're gonna be friends
no matter what, okay?

764
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,600
Could you have fibbed
as far as your skill level?

765
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,700
I could have fibbed.

766
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,200
For example, John,

767
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,100
is it possible that
you've never been on a board?

768
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,900
It's possible, butchie.

769
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,700
We cannot fold on dry
land right now, okay?

770
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,555
When we're outside,
you're gonna get a leg cramp,

771
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,457
Then we're gonna turn around
and paddle back in.

772
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:20,000
How does that sound to you, John?

773
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,000
That sounds, butchie.

774
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,400
Jesus Christ.

775
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,800
Jesus fucking Christ.

776
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Can I go out with dad and John now?

777
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,500
Yeah, go ahead.

778
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,600
- Oh, my fucking leg!
- You gotta grab the leg, John.

779
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,000
- You gotta sell it.
- Can you help me out, dad?

780
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,500
Yeah.

781
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,100
- You ready, shaunie?
- You ready, John?

782
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,000
- Hell yeah, John's ready.
- Hell yeah, I'm ready, shaun.

783
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,000
<i>All right, stunt,
do as teacher does.</i>

784
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,900
<i>One step fucking behind me.</i>

785
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,000
No no no no.
No hands, John. Come on.

786
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,300
Grab your board.

787
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,800
No no no.

788
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,900
Johnny, there you go.

789
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,500
Just when you think
he's run out of doofuses.

790
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,200
So Bill says he can't remember
when he got that flat

791
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,500
If he was taking shaun
to that surf contest.

792
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,300
He was.
I asked him to.

793
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,400
After I forbade it.

794
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,800
Maybe this is the time we admit
we don't have a perfect marriage.

795
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,000
Maybe it's the time
to say I don't have a brain tumor.

796
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,000
What do you got?

797
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,200
Surfer's ear,
like you thought.

798
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,100
You'd never mistake him
for a beginner, would you?

799
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,500
You're not paddling like a monkey
on crack over there, John.

800
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,400
I'm not a monkey on crack.

801
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,800
You all right there, Bill?

802
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,600
Waiting to hear from dickstein.

803
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,200
<i>Did he get my truck towed?</i>

804
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,700
Did he transport that suicidal fruit?

805
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,300
Waiting to find out.

806
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,900
Might as well be speaking russian.

807
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,800
Do you surf, teddy?

808
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,100
Teddy, you wiped out.

809
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,400
- Oh, my fucking leg!
- Just rest a minute, John. It'll pass.

810
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,100
I gotta sell it.

811
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,700
Go ahead, shaun, take one in
while John's cramp passes.

812
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,600
Shaunie yost!

813
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,400
I just needed to catch my breath.
We'll paddle back in a second.

814
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,300
No no no, whoa whoa.
Wait wait, John, John!

815
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,700
Somebody call an ambulance!

816
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,800
Johnny monad just put
that wave in the icu!

817
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,600
I don't think I'm gonna do it.

818
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,700
<i>Surf, you mean,</i>

819
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,300
before us fallen earthlings?

820
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,400
<i>Tomorrow's another day.</i>

821
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,200
Tomorrow's another day.

822
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,500
This kid's smart-Aleck friend
gets a stem-To-Stern checkout tomorrow.

823
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,100
I can guarantee you that much.

824
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,100
I got my eye on you.

825
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,000
Well, I got my eye on you,
pal, believe you me.

826
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,500
I got my eye on you, Bill.
