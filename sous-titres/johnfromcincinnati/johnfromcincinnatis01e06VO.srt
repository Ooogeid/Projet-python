4
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,104
<i>Thanks for supporting clean water!</i>

5
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:54,029
<i>- We've gone off the path now.
- All right, KC.</i>

6
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,714
<i>Way to go, buddy.</i>

7
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,029
That's good.
Perfect.

8
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,239
No.

9
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:50,747
Oh, I guess I'm just
a stick-in-the-mud.

10
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,287
Just 'cause every
degenerate in america

11
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,561
Jerks off to
his mother's videos...

12
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,278
<i>And she only showed up to make money
off of Shaunie being in the papers,</i>

13
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,967
Why would I think
she couldn't help him

14
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,080
Through his teen years?

15
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:09,274
Well, I hope it's pumping
at Salsipuedes, Mitch.

16
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:12,179
I hope you catch
some real soul-searchers.

17
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:15,993
Good morning.

18
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,016
You didn't have to shout
about her, gram.

19
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,393
Did I wake you up?

20
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,704
I knew already.

21
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,111
Where did you get this?

22
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:35,647
Shaunie!

23
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:41,691
You hurt my feelings, gram.
You did.

24
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:53,507
That extra grand is
for telling me how it was.

25
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:56,396
You think you might have
had a good time?

26
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,137
That's it, I think I might have.

27
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,765
You fucked me cross-eyed.

28
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,366
I never took a cock that big
and you handle it like a champ.

29
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:08,856
My god,
the perfect woman.

30
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:14,352
Do better than you did
with Butchie.

31
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,097
With Shaun?

32
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,872
I don't think
I'll get the chance.

33
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:20,698
You sure
you want to?

34
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,731
Stick around.
Help me think.

35
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,232
Yeah. That's what
I'm good at.

36
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,881
I had a good time.

37
00:04:57,704 --> 00:04:59,812
<i>Don't be afraid, Joe.</i>

38
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:12,710
That's a good way to get another
fatal injury there, frat boy.

39
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,514
How did you get
through the wire?

40
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:18,204
How did you
find this place?

41
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:22,685
Look, I got
close onto 500 plants

42
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:26,475
Less than a week from harvest
within 100 yards of here

43
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:29,130
And it makes me
fucking nervous.

44
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:33,495
Justice must be served, Joe.

45
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:36,872
<i>The vato must get his due.</i>

46
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,096
The one that stabbed you?

47
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:42,797
Well, if there ever
was a crime

48
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:45,022
That cried to heaven
for redress,

49
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:48,361
It'd be getting gutted
and left in a ditch.

50
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:50,021
The police should
be involved.

51
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:52,411
Well,
as far as that, I..

52
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,752
I flinch from it
in principle.

53
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,665
You saw enough
of that shit over there.

54
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:03,117
Bill should be involved, Joe.

55
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:06,520
- Bill jacks?
- I got my eye on you!

56
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,880
Him and me served
around the same time.

57
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,872
Different units.
Bill's good people.

58
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,457
I don't care
how much you say

59
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,548
that I'm thinking, frat boy.

60
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,409
I'm still not giving up herb.

61
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:28,575
Zippy told Bill we'd be over.

62
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,485
Hey.

63
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:47,219
No fire trucks headed
to your house last night.

64
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,340
I figure that
had to be a plus.

65
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,150
- Did he stop here?
- Shaunie?

66
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:53,787
Who else would I
be asking about?

67
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,679
No.
Is he surfing?

68
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,982
He took his skateboard.
He didn't take his wetsuit.

69
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,368
Well, I wonder if
maybe he's skating.

70
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,343
Could you go see?
You busy, Cissy?

71
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:05,783
Time for your ball-buster
booster shot?

72
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:08,820
Will you go
look for him or not?

73
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:10,231
<i>I guess
I probably will.</i>

74
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,635
Is he gonna hit me with
a brick when I find him?

75
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:15,158
He loves you.

76
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,141
Did you talk to him
after I left?

77
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:21,377
He was asleep.

78
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,647
<i>Well, did you tell him
this morning she was there?</i>

79
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,950
He heard me say some things
about her on the phone to Mitch.

80
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,589
Was one of them that
Tina had been to the house the night

81
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,203
before to see Shaunie?

82
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:36,743
He heard me say
she made dirty movies

83
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:38,618
and he storms
out of the house.

84
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:41,125
He knows she makes
dirty movies, Cissy.

85
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,661
<i>That idiot friend
of his gave him one.</i>

86
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,752
Well, he is barred
from the store.

87
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:48,159
Are you sure he didn't hear
you say Tina had been there?

88
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:49,902
I didn't say
she'd been there, Kai.

89
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,074
Which of those piss pots
gave him her fuck film?

90
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:54,015
Are you sure he was
asleep the night before?

91
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,407
What are you talking about?

92
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,067
What I'm
talking about is,

93
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,860
If he knew Tina
came to see him

94
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:02,715
and he didn't get to look at
her, maybe that's why he's upset.

95
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:06,117
Well, maybe if you'd go and
fucking ask him, we'd know.

96
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,574
Did you happen to
hear from Butchie?

97
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,587
No.

98
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,425
Big surprise.

99
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:16,500
Why?

100
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,483
For my website.

101
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:23,001
Me and the Yosts, information
I don't give a fuck about.

102
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:24,969
You ask Shaun
what he wants.

103
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:27,246
Does he want
to see her?

104
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:29,284
Is that what he's being
such a little jerk about?

105
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,687
How can anyone
help you, Cissy,

106
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:33,909
When you won't see
what's right in front of you?

107
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,973
Which is what?

108
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:38,082
Which is, whoever
you don't drive away

109
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,818
runs away on his own.

110
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:47,820
How do you stand
the constant cheeping?

111
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,662
Every one hatched
in this home.

112
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:53,789
Be aware, if you speak
in that voice again,

113
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,814
I will break every bone
in your body.

114
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:58,336
What's your policy on
guests smoking herb?

115
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,179
Not permitted.

116
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,149
And your smart-ass friend here
with his charlie mccarthy imitations

117
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,918
Skates on very very
very thin ice...

118
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,461
How about in the backyard?

119
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:09,614
Which I'm liable as not
to pound his head through,

120
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,456
with my fist,

121
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:14,552
and hold him gagging,

122
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,675
and thrashing beneath
the surface of,

123
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,456
till he drowns.

124
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:19,991
The ice.

125
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:24,862
Chamomile, Billy,
wonderful.

126
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:26,837
He's imitating my wife,

127
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:28,766
Who has passed!

128
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,937
Oh for Christ's sake!

129
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:34,799
What the hell
are we doing here?

130
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:36,475
Go ahead, Zip.

131
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:38,699
You're the big cruise director.

132
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:42,284
Entertain 'em while I
get back my composure.

133
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,439
This young man who's
had his eye on you

134
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,111
wants the vato who gutted
him to face arrest.

135
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:52,724
Oh god,
are you okay, honey?

136
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,448
Are you in discomfort?

137
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:58,041
No.

138
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,067
Is he lying to me,
to his own purposes?

139
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:04,603
No, Billy.

140
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:08,039
Oh for Christ's sake.

141
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,794
Get out of here,

142
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:18,583
Both of you.

143
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:20,251
Come on.

144
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,527
I'll do what you want.

145
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,257
Just let me get my composure.

146
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,712
Where is my food?

147
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,531
Where is my food?!

148
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:40,370
Come in!

149
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:45,043
You can just put it...
Yeah.

150
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,146
Thank you.

151
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,738
Oh, that looks good.

152
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:58,730
Fucking drum circle.

153
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:22,268
If those strings are
not drawn taut, Butchie,

154
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:23,781
There may as well be no strings.

155
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,351
Watch me tighten
these babies, Meyer.

156
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:28,720
No no no, I'll do it.

157
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:30,889
Thank- thanks for
the offer.

158
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,525
You might want to wait
for the painting phase.

159
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:35,160
Paint I huff.

160
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,516
Then that wouldn't be
a good phase either.

161
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:40,989
Motherfucker...

162
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:47,105
How are you today?

163
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:49,174
- What?
- How are you?

164
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:51,342
A morning pleasantry.

165
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:53,784
How would you be,
drowning in lowlifes?

166
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,081
I'm sure I'd be
gasping for air.

167
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,951
For your room.

168
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:04,118
Hawaii, I'm saying.

169
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:06,259
I was talking on the phone.

170
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,034
Oh yes.

171
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,486
Don't ask if
you don't want to know.

172
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,121
- Hey, doc!
- Hey.

173
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,150
How's your friend feeling?

174
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,206
Well, he's got his balls
in that blonde girl's chin,

175
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,972
<i>So if he's not doing good,
shame on him.</i>

176
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,344
And your boy?

177
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,713
Boy's doing good,
as far as I know.

178
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:31,149
There's lots of quick
healers in this Zip code.

179
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,654
Oh yeah!

180
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,022
Doctors. Patient's in critical pain.

181
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,758
Call Monday.
I'm playing golf.

182
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,627
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

183
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:45,363
How you feeling?

184
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,404
Good, fine.
Thanks for asking.

185
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,877
You giving me
a small surprise, doc.

186
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:55,406
What do the x-rays show?

187
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,842
My x-rays?
What'd they show?

188
00:12:58,252 --> 00:12:59,377
Yeah.

189
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,090
Everything's good,
you know.

190
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,364
Healing up good.
Like gangbusters, you know?

191
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,561
Thanks for asking, very much.
Appreciate that.

192
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,951
Which bones did it
turn out were broken?

193
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,337
- What?
- Which bones in your wrist?

194
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,648
Which of your metacarpals?

195
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,126
Oh most, if not all.

196
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,428
But they decided
not to cast it?

197
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:21,533
Well, you know
how they are.

198
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,936
My sense would be
you should have a cast on that.

199
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,806
Yeah, well,
chocolate-vanilla, doc, right?

200
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,975
You know? You had your chance
and then you didn't so...

201
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:34,379
The textbook approach would be not
to cast a patient before an x-ray.

202
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,582
Yeah, well,
push comes to shove,

203
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,317
Fuck all of ya.

204
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,492
You know?

205
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,289
Won't let
a sleeping dog lie!

206
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,458
Hey, take it easy,
Palaka!

207
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,570
What's going on?
You starting trouble?

208
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:51,694
Never mind!
Never mind.

209
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,217
An acquaintance
sustains a fracture,

210
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,714
Provides his boss entree to ask
after a stranger's condition...

211
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,956
Maybe you should
get out of the sun now?

212
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:03,541
Yeah, you and me, we could both
contract fatal fucking dysentery

213
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,577
before anybody gives
the first flying fuck!

214
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:09,047
Excuse me, I got to clean the 4.

215
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,922
Hold my string.

216
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:23,185
In some situations,
you moron piece of shit

217
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:25,430
maybe heard as
a blessed solicitor.

218
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,799
- What?
- Hello, Miss. Yost.

219
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,701
Yeah, hello.
I need to talk to Butchie.

220
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:31,219
You two know each other?

221
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,011
I'm sure your mother
doesn't remember me.

222
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:34,023
Yeah. Sorry.

223
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:37,622
But she expressed what I took for
a kindness a number of years ago.

224
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:40,410
Can we talk, please?

225
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,551
He's probably confusing
you with someone else.

226
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
Cissy.

227
00:14:55,882 --> 00:14:58,409
One mother's rebuke
of her son,

228
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,331
Even if vile and obscene,

229
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,658
may be taken as kindness
by another

230
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:04,035
whose mother is not at hand.

231
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,348
Why don't we go take
some pictures of your wrist

232
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:08,925
and then I can put
a cast on after?

233
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,551
Thanks, but no thank you.

234
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,044
I'll take care of it
my birthday after next.

235
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,803
Hey hey, wait!

236
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,251
Look at me, I'm talking
to you. Apologize to him.

237
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,922
- I'm scrubbing the pool tiles.
- No apologies necessary.

238
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,117
You shut up.

239
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:28,034
I jump down there, you'll be scrubbing
your own brains off those tiles.

240
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:35,033
Well I definitely better
climb out then, huh?

241
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:37,513
Who better than
the source of my fracture

242
00:15:37,514 --> 00:15:39,704
to force me to give up
enjoying myself?

243
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,956
Forcing treatment on a person
isn't my idea of good practice.

244
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:44,742
No one asked for your ideas.

245
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:46,678
Just take him to
get his wrist fixed,

246
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,513
or you're liable to need
treatment yourself.

247
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,604
Your speech pattern inclines
toward the megalomaniacal.

248
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,820
I also grind my fucking teeth at night.

249
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:56,028
But I'm not your fucking patient.

250
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:58,890
I'm happy to take you
if you want to go.

251
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,259
Here, drive my car.

252
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:03,857
Unless you want to ride
on his handlebars?

253
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,630
Just follow me.

254
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:07,432
I'm gonna follow a bicycle?

255
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,118
It's not far.

256
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,653
I want Tina to see Shaun.

257
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,617
Which one of us was high
last night, ma?

258
00:16:26,223 --> 00:16:29,587
I was not fucking high last night.

259
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:37,795
I'm just saying, unless I
was loaded, Tina saw him.

260
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:40,285
And I'm saying...

261
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,226
You mean with
his eyes open?

262
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,778
Is that what
you're saying?

263
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,115
I fucked up this morning.

264
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:58,888
I said things.

265
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,361
I- I mean,
I said the truth.

266
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,643
I was talking to your
asshole father on the phone

267
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:08,359
and Shaunie heard me talk about her.

268
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:10,844
You mean, he was
listening in on the call?

269
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,498
Oh, you fucking moron.

270
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,179
Well, I guess
you were yelling.

271
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:20,071
I hurt his feelings.

272
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,131
He walked out,
I hurt him so bad.

273
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:34,260
How bad was
what you said?

274
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:36,696
That she was a whore,

275
00:17:36,862 --> 00:17:39,257
porn queen, piece of shit.

276
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:43,608
He is 13, ma.

277
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,014
And Tina's tapes get around.

278
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:48,869
You know, there's half a chance
that it wasn't fresh news.

279
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,608
- He already had one of her tapes.
- There you go.

280
00:17:51,774 --> 00:17:55,428
He didn't even
open it, you moron.

281
00:17:58,183 --> 00:17:59,859
It was still in its wrapper.

282
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,748
I only came to ask you to...

283
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,684
To get in touch with her.

284
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:09,521
She left I.B., ma.

285
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,898
I asked if she was
staying last night.

286
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:16,027
What business did you have
asking if she was staying?

287
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,762
I don't know.

288
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,332
I'll never see him again.

289
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:24,661
Come on.

290
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,007
You didn't see his face.

291
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,075
You want me to go
looking for him?

292
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,578
I asked Kai.

293
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,836
Yeah, that's good.

294
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,055
I have her number, Tina.

295
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,947
<i>Do you want me to
try her on the phone?</i>

296
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:48,055
Isn't that what the fuck
I came to ask you?

297
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:04,209
What is this bullshit?

298
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,383
I'm afraid of my fiancee.

299
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:41,112
Hey, Tina!
How's your ass?

300
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:44,998
Got all your tapes.
Came to most of 'em.

301
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,958
I am gonna get high.

302
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:56,380
I've been fucking high in my life.

303
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:59,364
Higher than any other
fucking asshole I know.

304
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,466
And I am gonna get
twice as high

305
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:02,834
as I have ever been.

306
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:07,520
<i>Do you avoid having
guests in your home?</i>

307
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:09,047
<i>Do you make excuses to them</i>

308
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,751
<i>when you know you're
ashamed of your flooring?</i>

309
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,179
Are you ashamed
of your flooring?

310
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:16,748
I would like to know our motive

311
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:20,685
and our specific purpose, and
I will not directly ask a moron.

312
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,445
I would like to
know our motive.

313
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:24,155
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ!

314
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,851
I found him stabbed near this road.

315
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,993
And vato was in his vocabulary...

316
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,283
He doesn't have a vocabulary.
He's a human parrot.

317
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:32,810
I am a human parrot!

318
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:36,334
And being a human parrot,
and him now saying vato,

319
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,333
the more likely we're in
the right neighborhood.

320
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,871
Fried-brain hophead!

321
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:42,740
My fucking fibromyalgia
is in upheaval!

322
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,550
Justice must be served.

323
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:45,712
Quiet, John.

324
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,713
I'll give 'em justice
with my two bare hands!

325
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:50,668
Justice...

326
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:53,523
On the border with mexico.

327
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:56,178
I think we may all need a spliff.

328
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:58,389
Well, on that, I take no position.

329
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,959
I'll carpet four rooms
in your house.

330
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:03,328
Could you at least
turn the radio off?

331
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,328
Hello?

332
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:16,805
Where the fuck
have you been?

333
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,711
My cell phone just rang.

334
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,284
Oh did it just ring,
you fucking cunt?

335
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,158
I've been calling you for
the past 20 minutes.

336
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,968
It just rang, Butchie!

337
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:27,886
<i>Did it just ring, or were you sucking
some nigger's prick?!</i>

338
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,431
Yeah, don't answer it.

339
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,048
Don't answer, I will find you
wherever you are

340
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,156
and I will cut your fucking
cunt out of your body.

341
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,239
<i>I'm not gonna listen
to that shit.</i>

342
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,053
Don't fucking hang up on me, Tina.

343
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:52,161
All right, don't you
fucking hang up!

344
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:55,213
All right, just let me
try to figure out

345
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,382
what the fuck
I'm trying to do here.

346
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:59,692
Okay, listen to me.
Listen to me.

347
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,053
I apologize.

348
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:04,427
All right, listen to me.
Shaunie needs to see you.

349
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:05,987
Or Cissy wants you
to see Shaunie.

350
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:08,311
I can't come back, Butchie.

351
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:11,033
What? You got to go
suck some nigger's prick?

352
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:13,631
Don't hang up!
Don't hang up!

353
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:17,635
Fuck, listen to me.

354
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:20,307
Shaunie's feelings
are hurt, okay?

355
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:21,988
He's upset.

356
00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:23,408
About what?

357
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,243
<i>He's feelings are hurt.
Ok, he's lost.</i>

358
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,644
She doesn't know
where he is.

359
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:29,148
That I came to see him?

360
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,658
No, no, he wants
to see you.

361
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:31,804
<i>What's he upset about?</i>

362
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:34,686
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck do I know?

363
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,654
<i>Huh? What the fuck
do I know about it?</i>

364
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,845
<i>I can't even get
fucking high here!</i>

365
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,227
<i>- Are you high, Butchie?
- Fuck you!</i>

366
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,396
All right, fuck you! Why don't you
go mind your own fucking business

367
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:47,071
And go suck
some nigger's prick!

368
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,157
I'm coming back there.

369
00:22:50,158 --> 00:22:52,670
Don't get high, Butchie.
Don't let Shaun get hurt.

370
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:55,090
What the fuck do I care?

371
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:03,982
Oh fuck.

372
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,889
<i>There's someone down in that bush.</i>

373
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:50,786
How's the reefer treating you?

374
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:53,064
Believe me,
I've smoked more reefer

375
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,200
than carter made
little liver pills.

376
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,403
Confirm the sighting,
trooper.

377
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,705
I'll confirm it, trooper.

378
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,609
You see that guy there?

379
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,145
- I see that guy.
- Did he stab you? Yes or no?

380
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:08,941
You know what that's
gonna make him say.

381
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:11,895
- He stabbed me, yes or no.
- This could end in fisticuffs.

382
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:19,290
Better she tries to kill me and
fails than tries to kill herself.

383
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:25,563
Unconscious.

384
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:37,398
Cissy Yost.

385
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,174
What?

386
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:41,712
Are you sitting in your kitchen on
7th street thinking of blowing off

387
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:44,324
your head with your gun you
got back from Kai's trailer?

388
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:46,250
Have you completely run out
of whatever let you

389
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,706
put up with your
asshole husband for 31 years?

390
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:52,059
Do you feel that everything you
ever touched in your entire life,

391
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,802
you turned to shit and mud?

392
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,179
Are you ashamed, Cissy,

393
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,482
that once when Mitch was on
one of his bullshit retreats

394
00:24:57,483 --> 00:25:00,014
and you were loaded on acid
and Butchie was 13

395
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:02,727
and he'd just won his first
contest and you were so proud of him

396
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:06,337
For not being Mitch, and you went into
his room and he was whipping his skippy,

397
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,411
That you said, "let me
show you how to do that"?

398
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:29,131
Have you wanted to kill
yourself every day since, Cissy,

399
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,570
And not even known it

400
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,259
and turned yourself into the
worst ball-buster known to man

401
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,786
so no one would be with you

402
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:38,040
and you wouldn't have to be afraid That
you'd ever do something like that again?

403
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,605
That's how ashamed of
yourself you were?

404
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,915
Do you think now Shaun...

405
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,785
Who you loved so much
and tried to make a life for,

406
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:56,652
now you turned around and
hurt his feelings so bad?

407
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,194
Do you hurt so bad, you wanted
to just quit and be over?

408
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:04,662
Everything?

409
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:10,210
Well, let me tell you
about our offer, Cissy.

410
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:14,139
We prefer you don't.
We wish you wouldn't.

411
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:16,460
<i>Our offer is,
keep going,</i>

412
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,265
<i>Feeling just as miserable, or worse.</i>

413
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:22,352
Hold the gun under the spigot
and turn the water on.

414
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,615
Spare Shaun finding you
dead in the kitchen.

415
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,719
And as a bonus,
you'll also receive his love.

416
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:30,060
Act now, Cissy.

417
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:32,924
Baptize that fucking pistol!

418
00:26:58,643 --> 00:27:01,365
Instead of catering to a walk-in trade,

419
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:03,288
I'd be attorney to
a single client.

420
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,490
A homosexual psychopath.

421
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:08,493
"Psychopath" is harsh.

422
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:11,602
Lottery winners are not, Meyer.

423
00:27:11,603 --> 00:27:15,166
Men who hire their attorneys
at gunpoint are psychopaths.

424
00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:17,599
The salary he's offered,

425
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,785
exceeds by $12,000 my income

426
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:23,675
in any calendar year
since graduation.

427
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,346
What if his relatives
try to have him committed?

428
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:28,858
I don't think he has
any living relatives.

429
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:31,836
And I would contest
that motion.

430
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:35,454
What now, asshole?

431
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:37,867
<i>I rent this station for $6 an hour...</i>

432
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:38,868
Isn't this pleasant?

433
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:40,755
<i> ...in order to access and
maintain my website,</i>

434
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:43,958
Not spend 45 minutes
out of every hour

435
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,411
scanning for viruses
with outdated software.

436
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,034
Here's an idea then,Duane,

437
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,540
<i>I'll reimburse you $4.50,</i>

438
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:55,707
you take it and buy rat
poison. You bring it here to me

439
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,014
and I'll mix it
with your wheatgrass.

440
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:02,113
My Yost website got
10,000 hits last night.

441
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:06,151
It's from Butchie's son, but the
overflow for Butchie could be huge.

442
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:08,453
Imagine if he still surfed.

443
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:12,317
That's Butchie's lawyer
filing for bankruptcy.

444
00:28:12,864 --> 00:28:14,292
He must also do
criminal work.

445
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,765
You know what?
Just go away, okay?

446
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:19,294
Just go away.
Please.

447
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:26,805
Are you done?

448
00:28:26,962 --> 00:28:29,073
<i>Anytime you're ready.</i>

449
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,979
I want to meet him, this Barry.

450
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,781
I want to meet all of them.

451
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,616
Your new friends.

452
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:40,451
All right.

453
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:44,923
Fine.

454
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:17,589
$5 tip.

455
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,916
He'll get a migraine later.

456
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,475
I asked you not to do that.

457
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:30,034
<i>You're asking me to go
back to her empty-handed, Kai.</i>

458
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,769
You know, raking is
very relaxing.

459
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,273
You want to feel?

460
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:37,028
Of course.

461
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:43,418
Doesn't the Yost boy skate
as well as surf?

462
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,484
It's how he gets around
on land.

463
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,828
Suppose we were to
not fill the pool?

464
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:52,157
Tell me now before
I go for the hose.

465
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,271
Okay, that's good.

466
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:59,731
Kai, I called Tina
"what time are you getting here?"

467
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,897
Tina says, "what time is
Shaunie getting to Cissy's?"

468
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,607
And I said, "oh, Shaunie?

469
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:06,504
Well, Kai can't even get
Shaunie out of the fucking bowl

470
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,850
to ask Shaunie if
he'll go to Cissy's."

471
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:10,426
Young henry kissinger.

472
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:13,629
Jesus Christ!
If Shaunie's in the bowl,

473
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,420
he can't hear what you're
saying to me, Kai!

474
00:30:15,421 --> 00:30:18,158
<i>So why are you whispering to me, so
I can't hear what you're saying to me?</i>

475
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,583
I said, I'm not getting
Shaunie in the car,

476
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:22,219
<i>without telling him
where I'm taking him.</i>

477
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,160
Who told you not to tell him
where you're taking him?

478
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:27,357
I'm not taking him to Cissy's Until
I know Tina's gonna meet him there.

479
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,984
Tell him Tina's
gonna meet him.

480
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:30,776
And Cissy said
she'd host the lunch?

481
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:32,884
If Cissy says that she
wants Tina to see Shaunie,

482
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:35,390
why wouldn't she want her to see
him in her own fucking house ?

483
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:37,860
Now, I don't want to
ask her to host a lunch

484
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:40,051
until I know that Shaun's
in the car with you!

485
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:41,578
I better not get him
that house,

486
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,581
<i>and have Cissy freak out
in front of Shaun again</i>

487
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:45,793
'cause then he'll never want
to fucking go back there.

488
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:48,783
Thank you!
Thank you very much.

489
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:53,918
Oh god.
I gotta get fucking high!

490
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,805
That's how I relax!

491
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:12,360
All right?

492
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:14,338
Was he tuning up or
was that a tune?

493
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,707
Rogers and hammerstein.
Not their best phase.

494
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:21,150
Shaunie!

495
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,423
Your gram sent me.
She feels bad.

496
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:30,863
She wants to know if
you want to see your mom.

497
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:33,681
- At my gram's?
- Yeah, at your gram's.

498
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:36,139
Your gram's the one
trying to make it happen.

499
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,016
She hurts
everyone's feelings.

500
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:39,898
Your gram's your gram, Shaunie.

501
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,834
Hurry up and decide.
I got work to do at the U.N.

502
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:45,340
I don't want to
see her at my gram's.

503
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:56,147
Who financed your video,
Shaunie, with her own money?

504
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:58,705
Who got you in that contest?

505
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,886
An who's been there for you
every fucking minute of your life?

506
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:30,548
Hey. Calling my mom.

507
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:34,819
Where's Shaun?

508
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:37,512
Kai's taking him to my mom's.

509
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:40,648
Thanks for coming back.

510
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:42,727
Why is she taking him
to your mom's?

511
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,676
'cause that's where
you're gonna see him.

512
00:32:44,677 --> 00:32:47,166
- Why does it have to be at her house?
- Hey, mom?

513
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,909
Hold on for a second.

514
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,635
Because that's where it's gonna be.

515
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:53,441
You said you wanted me to see Shaun,
and your mother wanted me to.

516
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:55,627
Are you saying your mother
wants to make friends with me?

517
00:32:55,628 --> 00:32:57,815
God's sakes for god's sakes.
I don't know what I'm saying.

518
00:32:57,816 --> 00:33:00,005
Just let me talk to my mother!

519
00:33:01,084 --> 00:33:04,208
Yeah, mom, Tina's here and she wants
to know if you could host a lunch

520
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:05,885
<i>- for her and Shaun.
- What?</i>

521
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:08,186
She asked you to ask me that?

522
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,404
Yeah, she's here right now with me.

523
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,489
I'm not fucking talking to her.

524
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,070
No, I mean, yeah.
She's taking a piss.

525
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:16,912
But she is here and she's
ready to come over.

526
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,012
What does that mean, she wants
me to "host a lunch"?

527
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:22,436
What do I know? Just lay out some
tuna fish or whatever the fuck you do.

528
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:25,003
- She's got some balls.
- Yeah.

529
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,693
What do I know?

530
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:29,265
Anyways, is that the message?

531
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:30,942
What?

532
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,710
That you want to
have her over for lunch?

533
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,248
I'm not hosting any
fucking lunch.

534
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:35,924
I'll leave the fucking stuff.

535
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:37,999
Sure, leave it out.
She'll appreciate it.

536
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:40,285
You got a previous fucking commitment.

537
00:33:42,922 --> 00:33:44,334
Yeah, that's fine.

538
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:51,272
<i>Tina: how does he like his tuna fish?</i>

539
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,650
With salt...

540
00:33:57,272 --> 00:33:58,633
And pepper.

541
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:00,508
Pickles.

542
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:02,815
And lemon juice.

543
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,977
Two tablespoons of mayo...

544
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:09,647
Is how I make it.

545
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:13,845
I don't know how he likes it.

546
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,788
I never asked him.

547
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,725
- Hey.
- Your mom's got a gun.

548
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:12,161
Yeah, my dad's always in the tree house.
She's afraid of burglars.

549
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:14,472
Before you and Tina
came over last night,

550
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,794
she had that gun out, Butchie.

551
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:18,013
I took it away from her,
but then I just found out

552
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:20,220
she went to my trailer
and got it back.

553
00:36:21,194 --> 00:36:23,020
It's all right about
the gun, I unloaded it.

554
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:25,809
But I don't know if it's all right
that she wanted to go and get it.

555
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:28,049
I don't think she's gonna hurt herself.

556
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,932
She looked me in the eye like she had
centuries of ball-busting left in her.

557
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:35,387
You driving Tina?

558
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:39,404
What did I do with
my chauffeur's cap?

559
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,376
I walked down to see how
things were going

560
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,214
'cause I'm two fucking blocks away.

561
00:36:46,172 --> 00:36:48,807
Give me a ride back, I'm exhausted.

562
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,661
This is so much fun.

563
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,682
I explained to you before,
I made a commitment.

564
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:14,923
No, I'm just saying,
this is so much fun.

565
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:17,223
I'm so glad we reconciled.

566
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,778
Hi, pleasure, yeah. Just returned
from the clinic, dickstein.

567
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,280
Yeah, it's not my idea
of fun, but here I am.

568
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:31,216
Daphne, my fiancee.

569
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:33,047
- Hello.
- Pleasure.

570
00:37:33,048 --> 00:37:35,013
Yeah, it's not something
I'd want to do every day.

571
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:37,138
Medical treatment, but you know,

572
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:39,544
it's also something not
to be afraid of if...

573
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:45,730
Excuse me, excuse me.
There's the assassin!

574
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,781
<i>There's the murdering
cutthroat who treated me, huh?</i>

575
00:37:48,782 --> 00:37:52,452
And the prison torturer
from the abu ghraib prison.

576
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,440
<i>- Any changes?
- Oh, well...</i>

577
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,275
It's achy.

578
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,210
You know, throbs, somewhat.

579
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:02,015
Little bit, it's fine.

580
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,123
It's good.

581
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:10,113
Physician.

582
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:12,121
We should bring his mother
and your mother here

583
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:13,658
so they could both shep nachas.

584
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,680
Do my cast the first honor, please?

585
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,635
That's funny. It's very good. Right.

586
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:41,786
I played my saxophone before.

587
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:45,639
Oh, jeez. You all done?
Did you pack it back up?

588
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:49,043
Maybe.

589
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,130
So...

590
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:11,130
So you think
you'll be here a while?

591
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:13,803
I'm not sure.

592
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,430
Should we make one
for my gram?

593
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:29,939
Sure.

594
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:45,512
Hot dogs, hamburgers,
potato chips.

595
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,688
Hot dogs, hamburgers.
Seconds will be available.

596
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:01,922
Who's hungry?

597
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:08,046
If my words are yours,
can you hear my father?

598
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:11,976
<i>Can Bill know my father,
keeping his eye on me?</i>

599
00:40:12,044 --> 00:40:15,813
<i>Can I bone Kai, and Butchie
know my father instead?</i>

600
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:55,546
<i>My father's shy
doing his business.</i>

601
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:57,889
<i>Kai helps my father
dump out.</i>

602
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,562
<i>Bill takes a shot.</i>

603
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:01,305
Shaunie is much improved.

604
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:05,230
Joe is a doubting thomas.

605
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,586
Joe will save not aleman.

606
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,876
Joe will bring
his buddies home.

607
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:14,372
This is how Freddy relaxes.

608
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:17,041
Cup of Joe and
winchell's variety dozen.

609
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:20,594
<i>Mitch catches a good wave.</i>

610
00:41:20,595 --> 00:41:23,845
Mitch wipes out.
Mitch wipes out Cissy.

611
00:41:23,846 --> 00:41:26,117
Cissy shows Butchie how to do that.

612
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:28,143
Cissy wipes Butchie out.

613
00:41:28,144 --> 00:41:30,268
<i>Butchie hurts Barry's head.</i>

614
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:33,691
<i>Mr. Rollins comes in Barry's face.</i>

615
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:37,362
My father runs
the mega millions.

616
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:53,940
Boy we got some we got some
interesting footage, John.

617
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:58,464
Yeah, really got some great ideas
on what we could do with that.

618
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:01,519
- Really...
- I need your camera, Cass.

619
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:08,109
It's safe in
the trunk of my car, John.

620
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:32,784
Time to get back
in the game, Linc Stark.

621
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:07,340
<i>Fur is big, mud is big,</i>

622
00:43:08,203 --> 00:43:10,045
<i>The stick is big.</i>

623
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:12,219
<i>The word is big.</i>

624
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:14,734
<i>Fire is huge.</i>

625
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:17,555
<i>The wheel is huge.</i>

626
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:21,065
<i>The line and circle are big.</i>

627
00:43:21,406 --> 00:43:24,269
<i>On the wall, the line
and circle are huge.</i>

628
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:27,223
<i>On the wall, the man at
the wall makes a man,</i>

629
00:43:27,224 --> 00:43:28,966
<i>from the circle and line.</i>

630
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:31,350
<i>The man at the wall
makes a word on the wall</i>

631
00:43:31,351 --> 00:43:33,059
<i>from the circle and line.</i>

632
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:36,080
The word on the wall
hears my father.

633
00:43:41,304 --> 00:43:45,223
The zeros and ones make
the word in Cass's camera.

634
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:03,255
<i>In the word on the wall that
hears my father in Cass's camera,</i>

635
00:44:03,288 --> 00:44:06,044
<i>the good one Mitch catches
doesn't wipe Cissy out.</i>

636
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:08,217
In the word
that hears my father,

637
00:44:08,218 --> 00:44:10,613
Cissy shows Butchie
something else.

638
00:44:11,227 --> 00:44:14,945
<i>In my father's word,
Cissy shows Butchie and Shaun.</i>

639
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:17,833
<i>In my father's word,</i>

640
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:20,036
Tina raises Shaun at lunch.

641
00:44:21,182 --> 00:44:22,841
In Cass's camera,

642
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:25,746
Butchie lays the cord out for
Barry and Mr. Rollins watches,

643
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,887
and he doesn't come on Barry's face.

644
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:31,616
In Cass's camera, Butchie
knows Kai has kept the faith.

645
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:35,440
In my father's word,

646
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:37,542
the wave lifts them up.

647
00:44:51,924 --> 00:44:54,244
I think you overcame
a milestone in stride.

648
00:44:54,245 --> 00:44:56,551
Next thing, it's four hours
later, you've been napping

649
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:58,721
from unrecognized stress.

650
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,203
<i>in Cass's camera,</i>

651
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:05,670
<i>Bill doesn't bump
his head on the stairs.</i>

652
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:13,481
I cannot do this.

653
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:18,383
I am skating on very thin ice.

654
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:21,052
In Cass's camera, as long
as he's being stupid,

655
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:22,903
Bill gives lois a kiss.

656
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:43,925
In his word, in Cass's camera,

657
00:45:43,926 --> 00:45:46,544
The internet is big.

658
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,233
9-11 is big, but not every
towelhead is eradicated.

659
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:53,551
In his word, we are coming
9-11-14!

660
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:56,221
<i>In my father's word,</i>

661
00:45:56,324 --> 00:45:58,122
<i>Bill sees how Freddy relaxes.</i>

662
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:06,631
<i>In Cass's camera, Ramon
wants to know who's hungry,</i>

663
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:09,734
<i>In the courtyard and room 45.</i>

664
00:46:13,754 --> 00:46:16,474
<i>In my father's word
to come in Cass's camera,</i>

665
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,943
<i>Dr. Smith calls ocean properties.</i>

666
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:22,131
<i>In Cass's camera to come,</i>

667
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,183
<i>my father stares not aleman down,</i>

668
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:27,619
<i>and Freddy sees Bill
much improved.</i>

669
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:37,762
You will not note
my father's word,

670
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,031
no remember Cass's camera,

671
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:42,500
but you will not
forget what we did here.

672
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:05,432
You're even uglier than
Abraham Lincoln!

673
00:47:05,433 --> 00:47:08,104
Which happens he's got
the same birthday as mine!

674
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:11,229
February 12th, 1964.

675
00:47:11,702 --> 00:47:13,146
Yeah.

676
00:47:13,147 --> 00:47:15,585
100 years after his murder.

677
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,826
Both of us.

678
00:47:18,905 --> 00:47:21,212
We should make these
cook-outs a fixture.

679
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,445
Wanna go look for
the space commander?

680
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:53,987
Hit the floor, troopers!

681
00:47:56,228 --> 00:47:59,248
Judas priest!
The fucking sun's gone down.

682
00:47:59,431 --> 00:48:01,211
The sun does not go down, Bill.

683
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,037
Genius on science, too.

684
00:48:03,038 --> 00:48:06,373
My father is a genius on
science. The sun does not go down.

685
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:08,464
You won't get
an argument from me.

686
00:48:08,564 --> 00:48:10,788
Judas priest is
a genius on science.

687
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:12,995
Judas priest is my father's son too.

688
00:48:12,996 --> 00:48:15,252
I swear to Christ,
I've been playing my harp.

689
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:18,897
Bill won't note nor long remember
