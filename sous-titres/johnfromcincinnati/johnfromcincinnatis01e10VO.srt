5
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:06,231
Haven’t I told you not to leave
your fucking machine on

6
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,239
to spew incomprehensibilities
at passers-by

7
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:10,897
like a roadside fucking bomb?

8
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:12,599
I turned it off last night.

9
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,193
Did you turn it off twice?

10
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,525
Which would be back on, because it is.

11
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,281
Did you touch the keyboard or anything?

12
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,886
while I ran my tongue
in and out of the little sockets

13
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,528
on the back of the fucking box.

14
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:25,318
That’s Butchie’s motel.

15
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:27,444
Sharp as a tack, you.

16
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:35,909
Holy shit.

17
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:39,315
Come on, we got to change you
out of your fucking fatigues…

18
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,079
... or whatever those things are.

19
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,695
Hey, you wait here, John.

20
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:53,983
Is Shaun all right?

21
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:55,265
Shaun’s all right.

22
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:58,076
Here, these won’t fit you
and they’re dirty, but…

23
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:01,809
… put these on.

24
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:17,486
Where were you coming
from off the water?

25
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,599
Cincinnati.

26
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:21,712
You’re up, buddy.

27
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,855
It’s alright, John, go with Butchie.

28
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:34,783
Take that wetsuit off
and put these on.

29
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:37,272
No-no-no, w-w-w-wait wait wait.

30
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:39,636
Shaunie, you ready?

31
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:56,070
Fine, hurry up man.

32
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,500
Hey chick.

33
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,431
It’s Cass, Kai.

34
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,340
They’re alright. They’re back.

35
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,658
Good. Good.

36
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:30,002
Thanks for taking care
of him all this time.

37
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:38,967
I gotta cook.

38
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:43,902
I’m here with the mother.

39
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,029
I’m here on spec.

40
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:57,691
Hi mom.

41
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:02,500
Are you OK?

42
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:03,857
I’m fine.

43
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,408
Ya I gotta take you
to your Gram’s and Gramp’s, Shaunie.

44
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:08,741
I wanna stay with John.

45
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:11,131
Ya well, I want a seal
that barks my name.

46
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:14,377
You coming?

47
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:16,183
You stay here, John.

48
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:18,425
I’ll keep an eye on him.

49
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Thanks.

50
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:21,463
I’ll come back soon, John.

51
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:24,197
Yeah, yeah, let yourself in.

52
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,178
Let’s sit down, John.

53
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,107
Shaunie, Shaunie!

54
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,127
He came in
on the water, him and John.

55
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,861
Shaunie's not sure... from where.

56
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,587
Linc's talking to John
to find out what went on.

57
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:11,855
Linc is?

58
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:15,014
Hey, Freddy got squat when he tried.
Ya-know, maybe slick will work.

59
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,710
He’s probably
gonna sign him to a deal.

60
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,330
Where have you been, Gramps?

61
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:21,625
Haven’t you done enough?

62
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,578
Hey, what the hell did she do, Ma?

63
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,010
How much time have you got?

64
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,350
I’ll talk to you later, Shaunie.

65
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:28,833
I'm glad you're all right.

66
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:29,987
Thanks, mom.

67
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,620
Come on, I’ll drop you off.

68
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:35,678
Can you make me
a peanut butter-butter sandwich?

69
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:37,552
Not tuna?

70
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:43,555
So…

71
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,561
... I'm the guy that every time
you see, you tell the end is near.

72
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,209
You’re Linc Stark.

73
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,984
You should get in the game.

74
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:54,358
Like Mitch Yost?

75
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,017
Mitch Yost should get back in the game.

76
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:01,767
So I’ve never been in the game?

77
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,544
If my words are yours...

78
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,662
... can you hear my father?

79
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,050
Let’s say I can.

80
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:17,978
Let’s say...

81
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:22,337
... the zeros and ones in Cass’ camera
help you hear my father’s word.

82
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:25,756
Cass and I go back.

83
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:30,185
Let’s say you
and Cass go back, Linc Stark.

84
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:35,536
Let’s say, in my father’s word,
in Cass’ camera...

85
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,662
... the internet is big.

86
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,525
9/11 is big.

87
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:44,096
But not every towelhead is eradicated.

88
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,337
Let’s say I don’t follow.

89
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:50,954
Let’s say...

90
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:53,073
... without Cass’ camera...

91
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:56,158
... “big” and “huge” won’t mean dick.

92
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:00,386
Getting dusted won’t be an issue.

93
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:11,235
This is me grabbing
my balls and jumping here, John.

94
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,078
Grab your jump-balls, Linc.

95
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:18,970
You use my words...

96
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:23,449
... and when you speak them...

97
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:27,574
... if I listen right,
I can hear your father?

98
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:29,632
Yes Linc.

99
00:11:31,008 --> 00:11:33,182
If you are the end, I am near you.

100
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:36,505
Yes Linc.

101
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:41,138
Without...

102
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:44,250
... Cass’ camera,
whatever the fuck that is...

103
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:47,473
... we’re all toast?

104
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,303
You’re all going to be toast.
We’re coming 9/11/14.

105
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:53,292
Fuck me, John.

106
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:56,523
Fuck you Linc.

107
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,823
Is there any special purpose

108
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:01,576
to us burning
our ass-cheeks off on this asphalt?

109
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:04,498
I don’t know Butchie instead.

110
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,305
Is my order ready?

111
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,891
Not today.

112
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,295
I order smoothies
for me and the dogs, every day.

113
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,786
And every other day they’re ready

114
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,173
and today they aren’t,
so either piss off

115
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,672
or go behind the counter
and make them yourself.

116
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,143
Technically...

117
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:34,963
... there’s no way
we can be seeing what we’re seeing.

118
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,508
Hey, ah, back off a sec, will you?

119
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:41,670
Don't leave town.

120
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:46,135
I’m staying, and I’m trying
not to give Cissy a heart attack.

121
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,013
I’m all over it, ya know,

122
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,079
what Shaunie was up to with John.

123
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,307
John’s not an asshole,
or he’d know how to take a dump.

124
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:02,852
Give the guy a tip.

125
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,882
<i>Does your father have a father John?</i>

126
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,385
My father has a father.

127
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,948
What’s your father’s father’s name?

128
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,170
“Father”.

129
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:31,046
Like George Forman and his kids.

130
00:13:31,357 --> 00:13:32,666
Like George Forman.

131
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,652
Do you know your father’s father?

132
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:40,020
I know my father’s father’s words.

133
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:42,838
What are his words?

134
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,172
“Listen to your father.”

135
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:48,641
That’s what
your father’s father says to you?

136
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:52,150
That’s what my father’s father
says to my father.

137
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,774
You don’t talk,
you and your father’s father?

138
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:56,926
We don’t talk.

139
00:13:57,407 --> 00:13:59,930
But he’s alive, your father’s father?

140
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:04,999
I listen to my father’s words.

141
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:08,999
Let me ask you something right
from left fucking field, John.

142
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,065
Right from left.

143
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,185
What am I supposed to do?

144
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:13,234
I mean, tell me
what to do, my brother.

145
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:15,257
Just spit it right the fuck out.

146
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,674
Five words, maximum,
right now… pow boom!

147
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,242
Maximum, right now, pow boom!

148
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,279
Give me a pound.

149
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,207
No, you give me a pound.

150
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,185
<i>You got some “good ones”?</i>

151
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:36,725
“They” want to sponsor you?
That does that mean, Shaunie?

152
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:38,786
Your grandmother’s right.
We deserve to know.

153
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:41,611
I’d like to move in
with John and Dad.

154
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,041
It's time for me to go.

155
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:44,848
What are you saying?

156
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:46,957
<i>You don’t love us?</i>

157
00:14:47,214 --> 00:14:48,714
We did a horrible job?

158
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:49,928
What?

159
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:53,850
You know I have that pack
with the liner for wetsuits, out back.

160
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:55,976
That’s OK, Gramps. I’m good.

161
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,939
- Hey.
- What are you talking about?

162
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,301
I – you know

163
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,141
maybe it is time.

164
00:15:02,895 --> 00:15:04,238
You’re sending Shaunie

165
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,535
to live with Butchie and
that asshole just ran off with him?

166
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:08,393
How can you be that fucking thick?

167
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,199
He should be here, for Christ’s sake,
where we can watch him.

168
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,828
He was here, Cissy,

169
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,127
he was here,

170
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:15,235
you were here. you had

171
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:16,898
Bill and Freddy out front.

172
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:19,467
I love you Gramps.

173
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,181
I love you Gram.

174
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,107
I’m gonna hop over the fence.

175
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,502
Get back down here!

176
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:52,853
Could you turn off the fan?

177
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:56,797
How’s Shaun, Butchie?

178
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,781
My mom and dad are pissing in his ear.

179
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:00,360
Do you have a mother, John?

180
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,056
My mother is my father.

181
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,675
My mother’s a cunt with earflaps.

182
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,318
Your mother has turned herself
into the worst ball-buster

183
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,196
known to man so no one
would be around her,

184
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:13,025
and she wouldn’t have to be afraid
she’d do something like that again.

185
00:16:13,026 --> 00:16:14,932
That’s how ashamed of herself she was.

186
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,586
Mitch wipes out.

187
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,416
Mitch wipes out Cissy.

188
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,169
Cissy shows Butchie how to do that.

189
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:21,787
What the fuck, John?

190
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:23,443
Butchie hurts Barry’s head.

191
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,947
Mr Rollins comes in Barry’s face.

192
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:28,692
We are all frail vessels.

193
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:37,010
John is going all “psychic hotline
on us, huh?

194
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,030
Can I crash with you and John, Dad?

195
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:44,494
You can crash with me.

196
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:47,977
He keeps running his mouth,
John may be hospitalized by then.

197
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:53,043
What’s up with the flak suits,
my brother?

198
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:54,834
That’s what they came back wearing.

199
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:56,833
Showing up in camouflage?

200
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,666
John spouting,
“The end is near. 9/11 is big”

201
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,727
liable to push some
people’s buttons, Shaunie.

202
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:04,152
They want to sponsor us.

203
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:06,232
Who wants to sponsor you?

204
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:13,135
What the fuck’s going on, John?
Where the fuck did you guys go?

205
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:15,585
Hey, hey, hey, talk to Shaunie.
I’ll talk to John.

206
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,399
That sounds like a fucking plan.

207
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:19,307
Butchie hurt my tit.

208
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:29,728
It’s yours,

209
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,503
I picked it up by accident.

210
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:34,050
If it had rang, would you
have wanted me to answer it?

211
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:35,748
No.

212
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:40,479
It rang, I answered.

213
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,621
Moana’s coming, landed in San Diego.

214
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:46,016
Should I get the tools from the trunk?

215
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,389
He called ahead…

216
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,682
True…

217
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,289
Should I be strapped in my person,
on my room?

218
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,858
On the ear,
I can recognize the drift of things.

219
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,678
Let it play out.

220
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,921
Didn’t they used to have
bibles in these places?

221
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:14,870
Yeah, Gideons…

222
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:16,297
big distributor.

223
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:20,735
Don’t you understand, Shaunie?
This shit’s freaking me out.

224
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,284
You disappear with your mom…

225
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:24,419
- We went to SeaWorld.
- I know you went to SeaWorld

226
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,758
and mom brought you back.

227
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:28,304
But John told some people
that you were gonna be gone.

228
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,774
And before you came back,
everybody was already freaked out.

229
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:32,646
And then your mom brought you back,

230
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,703
and the next morning,
you’re fucking gone again.

231
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,112
I was with John.

232
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,797
It’s where you went with John, Shaunie,
that’s got everybody’s shorts in a bunch.

233
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,440
I don’t know.

234
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:46,789
So that has everyone worried that he half
hypnotized you or some fucking thing.

235
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,950
They had some pretty fun ones.

236
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,841
You remember that?

237
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:52,847
Sort of.

238
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:55,162
You remember they want to sponsor you.

239
00:18:56,212 --> 00:18:57,832
I sort of remember.

240
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,839
What does “sort of” mean, Shaunie?

241
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:01,749
I remember to say it.

242
00:19:04,797 --> 00:19:06,090
The waves were good.

243
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:09,812
Were the waves on water?

244
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,934
- I don’t know.
- Jesus Christ!

245
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:14,963
What did they do to you Shaunie?
Where the fuck did you go?

246
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:16,738
Cincinnati.

247
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,438
Cincinnati’s that way.

248
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:20,309
The sky’s up there.

249
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:25,017
Where’s your friend,
the fucking chemist?

250
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,216
At the Alternative Apothecary.

251
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:29,505
Who are you calling?

252
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,836
Bill Jacks.

253
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,846
You need to be watched, Mitch.
You always needed that.

254
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,701
Bill Jacks, can I help you?

255
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,765
Great news, Bill. Shaunie’s home.

256
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,212
Can you come over?

257
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,546
Thanks a lot.

258
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:48,678
Well, where are you going?

259
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:49,818
Errands.

260
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,173
Let’s say you’re not
from around here, John.

261
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:56,870
Let’s say I’m not, Linc.

262
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:57,871
Chocolate, vanilla…

263
00:19:57,872 --> 00:20:00,493
Everyone’s from somewhere,
so you’re not from here.

264
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:03,587
<i>On the other hand,
finding out you’re not from here</i>

265
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,447
is a bit of a nut-nudge
for us earthlings.

266
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:07,616
I can’t imagine
your old man wouldn’t know that.

267
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,303
I can’t imagine
my old man wouldn’t know that.

268
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,600
So that’s your father’s point…
with the camo and stuff?

269
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:13,777
Scare our balls off?

270
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,889
<i>You hear my father’s words.</i>

271
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:20,192
<i>You hear them better in Cass' camera.</i>

272
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:29,439
Who’s supposed to see this, John?

273
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:32,973
<i>You hear my father’s words, Linc.</i>

274
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,611
Me?

275
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:49,951
Your fuckin’ father’s
on the fuckin’ ceiling.

276
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:51,615
Fine.

277
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:52,867
Come here, Shaunie.

278
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,706
Something’s fucked
at the house, I’ll check in.

279
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:01,032
Here, hook up!

280
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:05,895
Meet the Jetsons!

281
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:10,005
<i>I wanna give you an address...</i>

282
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:11,394
... you meet me here...

283
00:21:11,877 --> 00:21:13,248
... and bring the tailor.

284
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,435
Why... why don’t
we just pull you down, Dad?

285
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:22,436
No!

286
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:27,715
What’s the difference if the ceiling
keeps you from flying off or we do?

287
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:30,969
Look, I want
as little complication as possible.

288
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,198
I need to know what this is about.

289
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,250
What about
the complications for us, Mitch?

290
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,933
Worrying you'll piss on our heads
every time we walk under you?

291
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:43,170
You could tell me about
where you went, Gramps.

292
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:45,716
Well, I can…
I can… I can do that from here.

293
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,324
Oh yeah? Then why aren’t you, Dad?

294
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,676
Just get out, get out.
Don’t look. Just…

295
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:58,314
Going to the restroom.

296
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:03,927
<i>Men!</i>

297
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:07,083
There’s a parade this afternoon
down at the pier for Shaun and John.

298
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:08,622
3:30, 4-o’clock.

299
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,308
Don’t be no-shows. You’re in it.

300
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:16,630
Our own celebratory barbeque, Ramon,
is thus somewhat impinged upon.

301
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:17,819
<i>You guys!</i>

302
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:19,747
You’re the island contingent!

303
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:24,305
We could take this stuff
to wherever the parade’s at.

304
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,825
No way to paint
this pattern on more wetsuits.

305
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:29,903
In the 2 hours, you mean,
before we put the play on in the barn?

306
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:31,390
The logo I could do.

307
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:33,761
Barbeque’s been 86’d, Dickstein.

308
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:37,541
The surf guy is having
a parade down by the pier, 3:30.

309
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:40,562
All right, Linc,
so as his personal manager now,

310
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:42,937
with Shaun back
from the dead and outer space too…

311
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,952
... and-and-and assuming
he’s signed you too?

312
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:47,186
I – I assume
you’ve signed “Ming of Mars”?

313
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,766
Your idea for the skit
in the barn is like,

314
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:51,119
"Stinkweed,

315
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:53,397
it's face on all this…"

316
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,410
“A miracle…"

317
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,422
"... half our base runs the other way.

318
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:58,465
<i>Do we make that up selling at shrines?”</i>

319
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:02,761
All right, so you tell him
something that I said to you

320
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:05,521
and I’m supposed to think, like,
“Whoa, he just came up with that.”

321
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:08,144
Then I’m supposed to like
wet my pants and OK the street fair?

322
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:11,041
“If I get you to Tijuana,
the kid can hear our confession.”

323
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,047
Something I didn’t say to him.

324
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,274
<i>“Do you want me
to write you another check?”</i>

325
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,340
<i>Something I didn’t say to her</i>

326
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:23,526
<i>that he could have heard
on her tape recorder.</i>

327
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:28,700
<i>“What room is she in?”</i>

328
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:42,227
- Do the t-shirts.
- Stinkweed logos on the wetsuits.

329
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:44,782
We need an El Camino.

330
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:46,367
Who’s logo is this?

331
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:48,454
“Mind your own fucking
business incorporated”.

332
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:51,508
I want to see that logo,
everywhere we set up.

333
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,445
In 2 hours?!

334
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,011
Amazing he can do
design work while up on a cross.

335
00:23:57,388 --> 00:24:00,468
Whoever John is fronting for,
he calls him his father.

336
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:04,806
I’m guessing if his father wanted,
we’d all be good and fucked by now.

337
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:08,676
So you guess his old man’s
got plans for the Yosts?

338
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:10,576
He talked to me
before he talked to Mitch.

339
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:13,839
So his... father’s got
plans for you too?

340
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:17,411
I’m a salesman. I’m guessing
he wants me to sell the family.

341
00:24:17,526 --> 00:24:18,599
Through Stinkweed?

342
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,362
Isn’t that how we built the brand...

343
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:21,918
<i>seeing the winners early?</i>

344
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:24,171
May I tell you
something about my bears?

345
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:25,708
Absolutely.

346
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,544
They were what my eyes
opened to this morning,

347
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:33,030
there on the floor beside my mattress
in my otherwise unappointed bedroom.

348
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Nice.

349
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:36,667
They were just as I had situated them...

350
00:24:37,147 --> 00:24:38,784
... before I laid my head to pillow.

351
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:42,648
Nothing untoward
had transpired in the darkness.

352
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,766
“My God”, I thought...

353
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:48,852
... “they’re just 2 bears
doing what bears do.”

354
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:52,259
I didn’t see Freddy’s teddy

355
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,579
and wonder how hard he may have violated
my Teddy the night before, or...

356
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,724
... how many times
he may have called Teddy “Faggot”,

357
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:02,490
or “cocksucker”, or “Sissy Mary”.

358
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:05,570
I chose to believe they played nicely…

359
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Live and learn.

360
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:09,632
And I choose to do so still...

361
00:25:10,113 --> 00:25:12,196
... even in their proximity
to the flame.

362
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:15,144
I’m standing
so they don’t get sparked on.

363
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:19,247
Tell the queer I don’t like
those bears sitting together.

364
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:23,447
That's your opener.

365
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:27,426
Then ask if him and the beaner
are wearing them clothes to the parade.

366
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,115
Go… go ahead.

367
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,094
We’re talking we’re talking.
You're listening, now you're listening.

368
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:45,051
<i>Look at the bears for a second.
Look at the bear, look at the bear.</i>

369
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,497
Hey? That’s good. Hey, you wearin’
them clothes to the parade?

370
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:49,705
I thought I would.

371
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:50,785
Fine.

372
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,072
Aren’t these parade-appropriate?

373
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:01,246
Dickstein had a life-changing
experience, why he’s been out of touch.

374
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,192
He’s wearing those.

375
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:09,118
We all right?

376
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:12,315
What did he say about the bears?

377
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:16,284
Segregated...
whenever they’re indoors.

378
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:19,329
Cherry Oldies, 8th and Palm.

379
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:21,823
Cherry Oldies, 8th and Palm, what?

380
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:24,332
Has an El Camino.

381
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:27,698
Then we better go check the fucker out.

382
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,221
Over there. Over there.

383
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:32,854
Miss, Miss, I told you once
about the Kodak.

384
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,314
Fuckin please... Not at us.

385
00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:39,513
Stare me down. Stare me down!

386
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,277
You want a picture.
You want a picture?

387
00:26:41,354 --> 00:26:44,089
Take a fuckin’ picture… of me, not him.

388
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,403
I'm taking a picture
of the entire scene, my brother.

389
00:26:49,217 --> 00:26:51,626
All the zeros and ones...

390
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:54,482
That’s how I work.

391
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:56,701
Fuckin’ ball-buster.

392
00:26:57,702 --> 00:26:59,776
Can we please get ready for Moana?

393
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:02,065
Kinda cute.

394
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:05,153
She just called you a zero.

395
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:09,828
<i>I feel that you boys
are ready for this Camino.</i>

396
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:12,099
Fuckin lug nuts on a T-Bird.

397
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:15,783
Between the two of us, we own
more cars than you have on this lot.

398
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:17,584
My guess
is your feeling’s probably right.

399
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:22,551
That’s not what I mean by ready...
number of vehicles owned.

400
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,018
<i>What do you mean, pops?</i>

401
00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:27,524
We gots to boogie.

402
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:32,775
So I have to know
what I mean before I can have a feeling?

403
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:35,290
Do I have to know
that you’ll understand me?

404
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:38,627
Do you have to know
you’ll understand before you’ll listen?

405
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:41,770
25 cars between you?

406
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:44,830
You shoulda let me
sit down before you told me.

407
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:49,753
I’ve got that many dealerships
in each of that many sectors,

408
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:52,531
<i>and brands on goddamn franchise.</i>

409
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,589
I gotta boogie! Me!

410
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:56,923
He feels you’re ready for the Camino.

411
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:58,793
You’re off-line now, country.

412
00:27:58,897 --> 00:28:00,348
I don’t know Butchie instead.

413
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:03,836
How’s he for high-performance?

414
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:06,537
And he ain’t who’s worst under-powered.

415
00:28:07,272 --> 00:28:09,477
Intrusions, evanescences…

416
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,055
<i>I’m a shepherd,
without crook or understanding!</i>

417
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:19,464
<i>Fits and stops and starts,
waves and ripples and ramifications!</i>

418
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:22,355
<i>Busted knee, mother-son handjobs.</i>

419
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:24,385
Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ!

420
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,922
Crosses… and shoulders to bear ‘em.

421
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,998
El Camino! $15,000, as is!

422
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:34,546
<i>Is it gassed?</i>

423
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:36,434
Fuckin’-A right it’s gassed. Linc.

424
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:40,663
You and your 25 cars.

425
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,773
Circle and line on the wall,

426
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:46,849
and zeros and goddamn ones is
what to turn the both of your gifts to…

427
00:28:47,604 --> 00:28:49,336
… and not one damn minute to waste!

428
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:51,907
Ragheads are gonna get
themselves eradicated.

429
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:53,082
<i>Country...</i>

430
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:54,699
... I took you off-line.

431
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:56,972
<i>Manuel!</i>

432
00:28:58,465 --> 00:29:00,080
Get a cage on this thing!

433
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:09,197
<i>So how was the flight?</i>

434
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:11,005
<i>It was good, you know, fair.</i>

435
00:29:12,243 --> 00:29:13,243
Got sick?

436
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,714
Small kind, not really.

437
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:18,402
What then?

438
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,063
Terrible fuckin' hurricane, tsunami?

439
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:25,455
What the fuck
you talkin’ about? Where?

440
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,360
<i>Five days since we spoke,</i>

441
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:29,201
maybe they had them at the airport.

442
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:31,949
Clear skies, brah.

443
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:37,460
Maybe you spent them
turning over and over,

444
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:40,275
“What’s he talking about,
this haole fuck..."

445
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:43,188
"... pretending to give me something?”

446
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:45,158
<i>Maybe you spent them…</i>

447
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,225
”He musta got old
fuckin’ fast over there,"

448
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:52,112
"thinks he gonna move on me,"

449
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:54,880
"confusing me for some other kanaka."

450
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:59,590
"Maybe handle his shit for him
before he handles mine for me.”

451
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,233
You know I got to think about that.

452
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,826
But you didn’t come in her blazing…

453
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:10,792
Come on, Freddy, you raised me up.

454
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,099
So I know you didn’t travel alone.

455
00:30:22,226 --> 00:30:25,235
You cocksuckers always need
someone to work for.

456
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,766
Tell the Chinaman,
“Freddy’s got 17 safe deposits.”

457
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:35,779
Tell him, “He’ll take

458
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:38,105
a taste for three years,

459
00:30:38,418 --> 00:30:40,294
but all he wants is out.”

460
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,444
But…

461
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,121
before you talk to him,

462
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,448
if you eat something strange

463
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,872
that puts a brain in
your fuckin’ head, Moana,

464
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:52,553
tell the Chinaman…

465
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,409
to go fuck himself,

466
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:58,140
and ask me for the keys on your own.

467
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:19,886
I got them, I got the fish.

468
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:21,762
Jake Ferris, Stinkweed.

469
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:24,908
Can anyone throw me a bone?
Who’s ride would this be now?

470
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,863
<i>Has Shaun Yost been found or not?</i>

471
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,934
<i>There may be some news on that.</i>

472
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,333
<i>We’re putting something
together for you guys soon.</i>

473
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:33,522
Is that Tina Blake?

474
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:38,408
Can I get some rhythm?
She’s part of my private life.

475
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,789
This ain’t the time
to break you’re his mother.

476
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:48,205
Think of a place we’re going.

477
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,570
There’s a fence around back,
we could climb over.

478
00:31:58,841 --> 00:31:59,896
Brah,

479
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:01,733
try take your glasses off.

480
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:08,658
Having it where we can see,
that’s the Chinaman asking to negotiate.

481
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:10,064
They’re already in the car.

482
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:13,309
Askin’ to negotiate with me…

483
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:18,859
…volunteering to off Moana.

484
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:24,116
That kid better be more than half-smart.

485
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:27,439
So what’s the buggah bulai to you?

486
00:32:28,044 --> 00:32:29,061
Brah,

487
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:32,241
I think the buggah like me take
over his turf in Hawaii.

488
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,242
What?

489
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,566
How come?

490
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:37,400
I don’t know. Maybe he had
a vision or something. I don’t know.

491
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:38,866
Fucking mahu.

492
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:41,211
So what?

493
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,380
He like give you his business?

494
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:46,253
So you can come and give ‘em back to me?

495
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:48,657
Brah,

496
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:50,318
I don’t give nothing to nobody.

497
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,862
If anything, I take.

498
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:55,008
Ah, Moana.

499
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:57,881
You remember small kid time?

500
00:32:58,135 --> 00:32:59,443
I used to hang you over the roof

501
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,542
so you can break in to
the window and rob the house?

502
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:03,079
You trust me then, right?

503
00:33:03,747 --> 00:33:05,955
Yeah, but that was hanabaddah days.

504
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,890
That was then, this is now.

505
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:09,825
And you know what?

506
00:33:09,942 --> 00:33:11,252
I may be pupule,

507
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,718
but I ain’t no lolo.

508
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,164
I never say you was lolo.

509
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:16,802
So what?

510
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:17,926
What?

511
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:20,053
What you like me do now?

512
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:22,920
I don’t know, I think mo’ bettah
you hele back to Hawaii.

513
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,447
Let me figure out
what’s really going on.

514
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:27,929
How’s that sound?

515
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:29,876
OK brother,

516
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:33,374
I’ll go hele back,
but remember one thing:

517
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:37,010
we go back a long long way brother.

518
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:38,339
Remember,

519
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,491
you and I,

520
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:41,328
we ohana.

521
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:42,951
Yeah.

522
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:46,859
What, I can throw my glasses
back on or what?

523
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:49,442
Shoot.

524
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:51,249
All right.

525
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:55,353
Aloha.

526
00:33:55,584 --> 00:33:57,167
Aloha no, brother.

527
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,200
Drove off.

528
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:17,470
The Chinaman.

529
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,167
Moana walked away on foot.

530
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:22,063
Let’s go to the parade.

531
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:26,896
You bring your cellphone
with you, definitely.

532
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:30,419
He won’t be using no cell phone.

533
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:35,642
One way or another, he’ll be comin’.

534
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:04,981
What do you want here?

535
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,215
This.

536
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:11,263
Times Square, new year’s eve…

537
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:13,237
only thing missing’s the ball…

538
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:15,739
which could be him in there.

539
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,001
This…

540
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:21,369
- Shaun…
- We sell it

541
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,222
as a Stinkweed drumroll,
hype for the Yost Family signing…

542
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:27,584
All the Yosts in Stinkweed gear,
tremendous coming-out party.

543
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:28,913
What about John?

544
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,320
He’s your student,

545
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:31,532
you made me sign him.

546
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:33,251
Fold him into the family package.

547
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:35,440
It lays down cover, Mitch,

548
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:38,333
for whatever’s going on,
as long as it’s going on.

549
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:41,312
None of those flesh-eaters
know about me yet.

550
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:43,677
You ever plan on going outside?

551
00:35:47,716 --> 00:35:50,237
Do I assume no permits were secured?

552
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:54,008
Stinkweed’s a good citizen of I.B...
We’ve got one to set up in the park.

553
00:35:54,164 --> 00:35:55,818
If you took your hat off indoors,

554
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:58,649
you might realize I was
I was referring to traffic control.

555
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,474
Form up adjacent to the surf shop

556
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,879
and I’ll lead your vehicles in.

557
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:31,029
Back in the game, Mitch Yost.

558
00:36:43,908 --> 00:36:45,159
Stare me down!

559
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:47,057
Stare me down!

560
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,526
I guess you’re back.

561
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:57,278
<i>The staging area that
I had designated was closed.</i>

562
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,601
I tried to get some citizens
to move their cars.

563
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:02,445
We got a report that you were
intimidating customers.

564
00:37:02,446 --> 00:37:04,283
I wasn’t intimidating customers!

565
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,745
Ask her!
I have coffee in there every day.

566
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,836
And now I’m in cuffs,
for Christ’s sakes!

567
00:37:09,462 --> 00:37:10,908
You want to make yourself useful?

568
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,432
Cite him!

569
00:37:12,784 --> 00:37:16,087
Because those things cut
the legs out from under oldsters.

570
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,063
Just when you think things can’t
get worse, the man with the dog.

571
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:22,545
It’s the albatross around my neck.

572
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:24,754
Mr Mandatory retirement.

573
00:37:24,796 --> 00:37:26,995
What the fuck is this circus?
I’m on my way to the vet…

574
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,793
This is obstruction of a peace officer.

575
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:30,161
We’re peace officers!

576
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:31,607
And you’re retired.

577
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:33,542
Look at the vehicles.

578
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:35,136
Look at the vehicles.

579
00:37:35,137 --> 00:37:37,872
This situation is deteriorating
by the second.

580
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:42,192
Excuse us officers, we have a limited-use
permit for an event hear the pier.

581
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,384
They had a permit,

582
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:46,383
and my strategy was
to stage the vehicles here

583
00:37:46,852 --> 00:37:49,803
Why stage the vehicles here
if the event is three blocks away?

584
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:51,719
Why now just go there?

585
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,951
<i>Listen, gives these guys an escort,</i>

586
00:37:54,952 --> 00:37:57,298
<i>get them off the fuckin’ street
and set up down there.</i>

587
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,413
Because your poodle’s
late for his haircut?

588
00:37:59,746 --> 00:38:02,716
Dog has a fulminating fungus on his pad.

589
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,189
Hey Tina,

590
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:06,632
I’m the guy that jerks off to your tapes!

591
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,137
Shut up, you perv!

592
00:38:08,254 --> 00:38:10,345
How would you like to suck
her ex-husband’s dick?

593
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:12,597
Yeah, see if you can tell the world

594
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:15,249
what a useful life you’ve led
with that kind of mouthful!

595
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,258
You perv-dick-mouthful 24!

596
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:21,406
Go ahead, you’ll be lead through!

597
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,985
Follow the police officers!

598
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,038
You’ll be led through.
Lead them through!

599
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:29,634
Go on through, you’re being
led by the police officers,

600
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:33,150
the cocksuckers that forgot
to take my cuffs off!

601
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,749
<i>Go on through,</i>

602
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:39,248
go on. Here’s a drug casualty…
thinks this car’s normal.

603
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:44,556
Go ahead, it’s the homosexual
in the hybrid… go on!

604
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,803
You’re being led through.

605
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:51,322
Look at the breasts on these women!

606
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:53,492
This country is doomed!

607
00:38:53,843 --> 00:38:55,661
But go ahead, have fun!

608
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:09,898
Low rent and half-assed…

609
00:39:10,288 --> 00:39:12,028
hardcore Stinkweed.

610
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:16,230
But we always roll with
the lovely Stinkweed ladies!

611
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,095
We got some free t-shirts right here.

612
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:26,166
Ladies, throw them out!
Check out the new design.

613
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:29,017
Come to the booth.
Check out the new Stinkweed logo!

614
00:39:29,877 --> 00:39:32,574
Hey press, don’t forget to take
these gift baskets on the way out.

615
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:34,938
If you don’t take ‘em,
Jake won’t be able to write them off.

616
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,952
Take a good look ma.

617
00:39:38,183 --> 00:39:39,551
We’re them now.

618
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:40,736
<i>If I look familiar,</i>

619
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:42,690
probably some time in your life

620
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:44,801
you’ve seen Linc Stark’s car

621
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:46,287
<i>getting detailed.</i>

622
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:48,065
Link Stark,

623
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,425
founded Stinkweed!

624
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:53,923
Our C.E.O. and in-house visionary.

625
00:39:54,197 --> 00:39:57,030
Linc’s got plans and
he’s here to tell you all about them.

626
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:59,298
And I guarantee you, they’re big!

627
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:03,656
<i>Standing down here,</i>

628
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:07,623
at surfhenge because they do not want
to be on the same stage as me…

629
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,289
Linc’s going to sell the family.

630
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:10,599
… ladies and gentlemen…

631
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,201
Cissy and Mitch Yost!

632
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,113
Tina Blake…

633
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:17,947
the name might be familiar
to some of you.

634
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,543
Butchie Yost!

635
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:23,924
Somebody check that man for a weapon.

636
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:25,624
Shaun Yost!

637
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,754
Butchie’s new surfing discovery,

638
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:30,880
Johnny Monad from Cincinnati!

639
00:40:35,553 --> 00:40:36,745
Stinkweed,

640
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:37,957
a wing and a prayer

641
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:41,299
until we signed Butchie Yost
15 years ago.

642
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:43,800
Butchie Yost put Stinkweed on the map,

643
00:40:44,015 --> 00:40:47,110
and we did all we could
to help Butchie crash and burn.

644
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:50,139
‘Cause business is business.
In our business,

645
00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:51,898
we sell crash-and-burn

646
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:53,774
like Ford sells tough.

647
00:40:54,146 --> 00:40:55,827
You got a hankie?

648
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:57,331
<i>Time passes,</i>

649
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,430
I see Butchie Yost’s son surfing.

650
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:02,108
Shaun Yost surfs like an angel,

651
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:04,648
and when I pitch it
to Mitch and Cissy Yost,

652
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:07,776
they agree to let Shaun sign with me
because it’s what he wants.

653
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:10,305
And maybe I make a promise

654
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:13,530
that I won’t do the same thing
with Shaun that I did with Butchie.

655
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:15,621
Huntington Beach,

656
00:41:15,797 --> 00:41:17,400
Shaun goes down.

657
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:19,943
Sorry Cissy,

658
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:21,448
sorry Mitch.

659
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:23,324
Do not think for a second,

660
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:25,239
no matter what he says,

661
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,014
that the leopard will ever
change his spots.

662
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:31,309
Stinkweed markets Shaun’s sprained neck

663
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:32,756
as a miracle journey

664
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,058
back from death by surfing’s
new young superstar.

665
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:38,365
Shaun and John go AWOL surfing,

666
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,191
the leopard decides to sell it
as a disappearance.

667
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:43,751
He calls the grandparents,

668
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,234
gets them all freaked out.
They call the media,

669
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:47,836
tell ‘em Shaun’s missing.

670
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:50,455
Shaun and John come home.

671
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:52,542
Cissy and Mitch are down on the leopard.

672
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,926
Butchie wants to bust a cap in his ass.

673
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,229
Some people just will not see
the business angle.

674
00:41:58,366 --> 00:41:59,988
Which is how and why

675
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:01,954
the leopard is here before you now.

676
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,553
The Yosts have thrown
a collar on the cat.

677
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,664
They’re making him climb in a cage.

678
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:10,221
They will stay with Stinkweed
only if I get out.

679
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,861
Stinkweed lays down cover for my father.

680
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:17,161
I’m out folks! Jake Ferris,
the new C.E.O.

681
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,920
Linc is El Camino.

682
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:21,773
We will never do bad again.

683
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:23,973
Linc Stark, ladies and gentlemen.

684
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:28,468
Get off my fucking foot
or I’ll kill you.

685
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:29,836
Look…

686
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:31,790
other side.

687
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:43,368
Talk or get the fuck out of here.

688
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,115
Brah,

689
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:49,480
give me the keys.

690
00:42:57,626 --> 00:42:59,170
Check out the new wetsuits,

691
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:00,694
Stinkweed’s new design.

692
00:43:00,968 --> 00:43:04,310
<i>Dr Smith comes back 20 years
younger from Cincinnati.</i>

693
00:43:05,886 --> 00:43:07,470
<i>Cissy gets knocked up.</i>

694
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:09,756
<i>She’s bigger than Leona Helmsley.</i>

695
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:13,665
<i>Earth puts Dickstein on retainer.</i>

696
00:43:13,997 --> 00:43:15,815
<i>Daphne keeps his head straight.</i>

697
00:43:21,908 --> 00:43:23,862
<i>Jerri meets a slew of new hairlips.</i>

698
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:29,178
<i>My father four-walls Barry’s bar.</i>

699
00:43:29,913 --> 00:43:32,278
<i>Dr Smith trains Dwayne and Ramon.</i>

700
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:36,871
<i>My father freelances in Cass’ Camera.</i>

701
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:00,987
Saying I’d not climb those stairs again

702
00:44:02,043 --> 00:44:03,626
or come back in this room…

703
00:44:06,206 --> 00:44:08,121
I guess now you know I’m a fibber.

704
00:44:24,352 --> 00:44:25,954
Why I came up here, sweetheart…

705
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,606
that son of the Yost boy…

706
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:34,006
Butchie who helped you
with your groceries?

707
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,301
His son went missing.

708
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,959
The long and short of it, Shaun…

709
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,679
Butchie’s son…

710
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:44,318
safely returned.

711
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:46,959
Happy outcome.

712
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,662
On the downside,

713
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:56,203
the green one’s gone.

714
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:58,005
I was remiss,

715
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:01,797
trotting him places outside the house.

716
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:04,357
Although I’ll say,

717
00:45:04,924 --> 00:45:06,409
first excursion out

718
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,996
I took him to the hospital.

719
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:11,475
It was a…

720
00:45:12,785 --> 00:45:14,075
worthwhile visit.

721
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:20,914
See, this is why…

722
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,744
this is why I don’t come up here.

723
00:45:26,738 --> 00:45:28,784
Where do you start and stop?

724
00:45:29,155 --> 00:45:31,598
Every event and incident…

725
00:45:31,794 --> 00:45:33,826
“Oh, if she could have only seen this!

726
00:45:33,827 --> 00:45:36,406
Wouldn’t she have laughed
to have seen that?”

727
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:49,322
If I took the mouth-harp
to hand to come up with,

728
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:51,296
I’d have never made it up the stairs,

729
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:53,352
or I’d play to you.

730
00:45:57,378 --> 00:45:58,746
Here I go down.

731
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:07,676
God love you, my Lo’,

732
00:46:09,357 --> 00:46:10,745
and hold you tight.

733
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:16,972
Lois…

734
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:18,481
Lo’,

735
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:20,490
look at this!

736
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:27,799
Mother of god, Cass-Kai.
