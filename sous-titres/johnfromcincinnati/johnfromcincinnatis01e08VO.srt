4
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:20,637
My dad’s here.

5
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:21,715
So’s Sonny Mac.

6
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:24,341
That’s his ride next to your dad’s.

7
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:27,684
There’s a nice peak north of the pier.

8
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:29,168
Why can’t we go our here?

9
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,108
‘Cause maybe your dad
would as soon we didn’t.

10
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,517
In case he gets dusted?

11
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,066
Shootout in I.B.?

12
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:35,949
Like in Fiji 12 years ago.

13
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,075
What the fuck do you know
about Fiji 12 years ago?

14
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:41,697
I know more than I let on.

15
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:57,513
We made a tape last night.

16
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:01,796
We did?

17
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:06,353
Why don’t I remember?

18
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:07,954
Why don’t I remember?

19
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,054
Obviously you do remember,
John, you just said so.

20
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:20,439
Oh! What did we make
the tape about?

21
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,205
Are you saying we made a sex tape?

22
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:27,512
I am saying we made a sex tape.

23
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,877
See, the head scratcher,
John, for me is...

24
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,937
that you’ll know to say something

25
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:38,765
but you won’t know what it means.

26
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,031
Today will be a three-ring circus.

27
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,502
You want to do something
and you’ll do it, but...

28
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,938
you won’t understand what you did.

29
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:53,745
I will be murdered twice.

30
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:56,628
I will stare me down.

31
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,202
Shaun will soon be gone.

32
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:04,407
You said that to me last night.

33
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:06,133
I said it to you.

34
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,218
Why didn’t I remember?

35
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:12,260
We don’t remember
my father’s words.

36
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,193
Why do I remember now?

37
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,869
Work here, Cass.

38
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:30,154
So how’d you do?

39
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,618
I was gonna ask you that.

40
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:36,980
You know how you did.

41
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,782
You will find our tape
in your room.

42
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,264
I will see you at Barry’s motel, Cass.

43
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,237
We do not remember my father’s words.

44
00:08:38,074 --> 00:08:39,122
Yeah,

45
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,209
It’s Cissy Yost, Dickstein.

46
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:43,909
You can turn on your meter
‘cause I’m divorcing

47
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,836
my asshole husband.

48
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:47,930
To see who?

49
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,479
Oh, well, good for you
for not disclosing, Dickstein.

50
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,740
You said the motel,
I thought my son

51
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,174
might have another

52
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:57,971
settlement coming for his

53
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,492
other big toe.

54
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,493
I’ll see you over there.

55
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:11,995
“Levitation For the Illuminated”!

56
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:44,596
You dream?

57
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:47,402
Breakfast.

58
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:49,607
Oh yeah,

59
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:50,890
I’m all over that, yeah.

60
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:52,628
I’ll convey that much right now.

61
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:21,176
“We don’t fucking deliver.”

62
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:22,326
<i>As a rule,</i>

63
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:23,700
we don’t fucking deliver.

64
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:32,430
Me first?

65
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:34,692
That’s the usual order.

66
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:37,260
I realize… um…

67
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:41,083
the bullshit yesterday
with Stinkweed, um…

68
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:44,482
I was making them take me out…

69
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:50,925
Which is connected
to the greater mystery

70
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,034
of why in the hell I’d be hanging
around here without

71
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,381
trying to close Shaun’s deal.

72
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,670
And the mystery’s solution is?

73
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:03,629
I couldn’t…
couldn’t close the deal…

74
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:05,350
to protect him…

75
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:07,818
from myself.

76
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,195
And then this morning,

77
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,436
I wake up...

78
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:15,334
you’re just laying there beside me…

79
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:17,758
like an angel.

80
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,046
Which does just go to show you…

81
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:23,213
If someone’s watching,

82
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:26,060
and they’re letting me keep operating

83
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:28,502
<i>even with the inkling that I’m not…</i>

84
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:31,598
the greatest guy in the world

85
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,613
… maybe they want me to sign him.

86
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:36,902
<i>“You have a new message”</i>

87
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,041
Would that go for me?

88
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:43,228
Well I’d sign you
without even giving them a vote.

89
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:45,518
I mean…

90
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,025
that they’d let me be operating too

91
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,082
seeing Shaun

92
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:51,473
sticking around.

93
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:52,850
In my opinion,

94
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:54,400
definitely.

95
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,546
You win one free fuck.

96
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:02,497
Thank you very much.

97
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,196
Wouldn’t come to the counter
for their fucking drinks.

98
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,971
I’m afraid.

99
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:08,596
License got revoked.

100
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,996
So Lawyer Dickstein informed.

101
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,163
Yeah, we have to reapply

102
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:16,049
before you can serve liquor.

103
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,110
Thank goodness I’m not a felon.

104
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:21,415
I’ve had another vision, Ramon.

105
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:25,426
Like when you got
the lottery numbers?

106
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,250
Oh, I’ve wondered if you were
ever gonna say that-daily,

107
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,899
and uh, ever since I met you.

108
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,818
Rows of faces,

109
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:34,289
rapt.

110
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,295
In, in what?

111
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:38,813
It’s some sort of a performance.

112
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,237
We-we used to do karaoke

113
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:52,392
Are you having...
having an epileptic?

114
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,613
You have any medicine
in your man-purse?

115
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:57,827
A spoon?

116
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:58,973
No?

117
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,161
More?

118
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:05,765
A vision again?

119
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:11,433
Go, Barry.

120
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:13,805
Go Barry.

121
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,016
<i>Go Barry.</i>

122
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,434
Go Barry, go Barry.

123
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:20,755
Get your vision.

124
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,539
Get your number.

125
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:24,626
Go, go Barry, go.

126
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,708
Go Barry, go. Go Barry.

127
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:27,874
I see

128
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:30,139
columns.

129
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,604
OK, get your vision.

130
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:34,227
Get your number.

131
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:36,423
Put your number in the column.

132
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:37,837
It’s a theater.

133
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,375
The money from
the new lottery numbers?

134
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:49,934
The money I’ve already won.

135
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,303
No numbers, this vision?

136
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:56,452
Here,

137
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:57,856
from the ruins

138
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,616
of a venue of tawdry

139
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,584
assignation will arise
a temple of art.

140
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:11,820
Let me check how they’re stenciling

141
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:14,098
the shuffleboard court out there.

142
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,617
Shut off the lights
when you’re done.

143
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,724
- How’s it going?
- Good.

144
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:32,817
Good,

145
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:34,502
it’s good to see you.

146
00:15:36,675 --> 00:15:37,907
You wanna give me a ride?

147
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:40,605
I mean, sure?

148
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,348
I’ll give you a ride home.

149
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:43,520
Thanks.

150
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,392
<i>Ah now, come on!</i>

151
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:48,553
<i>Nice day like this,</i>

152
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,299
<i>don’t get in an indoor stupor.</i>

153
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:52,877
Wanna play shuffleboard?

154
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:00,219
Don’t you know,

155
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,586
something bad is gonna happen?

156
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:05,140
Don’t lift heavy equipment

157
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:07,625
with light equipment isn’t
that what you always tell me?

158
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:09,750
Don’t do heavy liftin’

159
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:11,515
with light equipment.

160
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,652
Or that’s what you tell me,
right, so…

161
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,043
why ask me?

162
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:16,140
Ask you what?

163
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:17,268
What’s happening.

164
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,821
I halfway think

165
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,961
that pain-in-the-balls
retired ex-cop

166
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:25,025
aught to stick his donkey nose in.

167
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:26,970
- Should I get him?
- What?!

168
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,630
Oh nothin’ nothin’, nothin’.

169
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:31,393
<i>I was just, you know,</i>

170
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:32,950
talking.

171
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:35,686
You know what I think?

172
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:36,874
Know what I think?

173
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,392
I’m goin’ to the fuckin’ beach.

174
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:41,996
<i>The fuckin’ beach...
whataya think of that, huh?</i>

175
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:44,328
Anyways,

176
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,100
<i>I’ll go get a position
before 8000 mutts</i>

177
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:48,659
<i>lay their towels out.</i>

178
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:51,218
Taking the car.

179
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:52,958
Taking the keys.

180
00:16:58,508 --> 00:16:59,585
I’d just as soon

181
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:02,398
not get involved with the nuts
and bolts of all this.

182
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:03,651
Too fuckin’ bad, Dwayne.

183
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:06,912
Being the information’s conduit is
where I prefer to draw the line.

184
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,938
But before I scare
the bejesus out of Cissy,

185
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:11,921
I want to at least talk to Butchie
about this fucking guy.

186
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:17,090
Oh, fuck!

187
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:24,194
I guess Mick’s right again.

188
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,358
I don’t want to know, Dwayne.

189
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:29,871
Jagger?

190
00:17:32,704 --> 00:17:34,573
I’m moving my husband in here...

191
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:35,812
So I see.

192
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:41,332
Saving him a trip to the house.

193
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:43,682
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

194
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,950
Surfing!

195
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,691
Is that right?

196
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,371
we need to talk.

197
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,350
What?

198
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:58,272
His door’s open.

199
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,697
You are insatiable today.

200
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,954
One final

201
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,203
illuminating tidbit
and then we must leave.

202
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,290
Did you know, Teddy,

203
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:15,283
that having built
the Lyceum Theater,

204
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,407
Daniel Frohman had an apartment
placed above the stage?

205
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:21,709
Best seat in the house.

206
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:27,862
Mr Bear?

207
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:29,109
Mr Bear!

208
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,375
Teddy, that is not polite.

209
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,722
To think…

210
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:39,963
that this place

211
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,252
could be a setting for some

212
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:44,540
building up of the spirit.

213
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,931
<i>Mr Cunningham, Mr Cunningham,</i>

214
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:52,585
<i>good evening to you sir.</i>

215
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,158
<i>Mr Cunningham, thank you so much</i>

216
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,103
<i>for letting me run a tab.</i>

217
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:00,726
<i>That’s so kind,
that’s very gracious of you.</i>

218
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:03,783
<i>All right, have a good evening, sir.
Thank you…</i>

219
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,068
<i>ya faggot cocksucker.</i>

220
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,117
<i>Look at him.
Look at him walk over there</i>

221
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,469
<i>like he’s a normal fucking person.</i>

222
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:15,881
<i>Yeah, don’t go out
and suck a fast prick</i>

223
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:18,552
<i>in the alley, pal,
before you can...</i>

224
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,177
<i>Mr Cunningham, good evening.</i>

225
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:23,841
<i>Good evening.</i>

226
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,699
<i>How are you?
You look very well...</i>

227
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:29,133
you almost look like a human being

228
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:33,464
<i>Congratulations on imitating
a human being, Mr Cunningham,</i>

229
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:36,507
<i>you fuckin’ faggot.</i>

230
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,246
“Oh, and Frank,

231
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:46,755
a Roy Rogers for my young friend.”

232
00:20:03,406 --> 00:20:05,755
Young Mr Yost…

233
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:08,868
How’s it going?

234
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,401
Roy Rogers,

235
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:29,258
short and tall.

236
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:37,706
It’s OK.

237
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:39,695
I’ll be gone pretty soon.

238
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:49,989
<i>Go Barry.</i>

239
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,036
<i>Go Barry.</i>

240
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,938
Chief of all angels…

241
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,295
got one mission:

242
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,365
Orbit alert

243
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:06,154
for a latino trying
to catch a break.

244
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,814
Alert! Alert!

245
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,091
Alert!

246
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:13,684
Alert! Diving in,

247
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:16,050
latino verging on luck!

248
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:25,526
Mission boss...

249
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,002
chief angel.

250
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:31,118
Wipe interference
off my flight path

251
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,443
so I can flip
feet first before I hit,

252
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,260
to crush the latino’s balls
with all my speed

253
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,576
and force.

254
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,963
<i>He’s waiting for ya!</i>

255
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:55,149
Lawyers together...

256
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:56,701
can’t be good.

257
00:21:57,613 --> 00:22:00,093
What is inside the envelope,

258
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:02,762
O great seer of the east?

259
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:10,653
If the image of currency

260
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:13,428
is coming to you, O great seer,

261
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:17,448
you are warmer than the sands
beneath our feet.

262
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:21,593
I’m gonna open this now,
alright Mark?

263
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:25,344
I am but your will’s instrument,
O my liege.

264
00:22:28,062 --> 00:22:30,561
That is a smoking gun, Meyer.

265
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,347
Mercy Hospital’s head
of neurology has admitted

266
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,595
to incompetence,

267
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:38,271
to the destruction
of hospital records

268
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,209
during the treatment of the Yost boy.

269
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:42,802
As the Yost’s family attorney,

270
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:44,395
notwithstanding your

271
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:46,893
diminutive stature,

272
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:50,691
I would say this is a slam
dunk out-of-court settlement.

273
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,900
You represent the hospital.

274
00:22:56,104 --> 00:22:57,378
Why give this to me?

275
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:01,598
The physician is being insured
by another carrier.

276
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:07,145
As to any gesture,

277
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:09,025
financial or otherwise,

278
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:12,101
you wish to make towards me
after the settlement,

279
00:23:12,953 --> 00:23:15,218
that of course would be a matter

280
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:17,919
separate entirely,

281
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:20,684
and for you alone to determine.

282
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:39,190
The-the message didn’t come

283
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:41,206
to Butchie’s website.

284
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,402
If it came to Butchie’s website,
I’d know how

285
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:46,613
I got access, because

286
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:50,114
I’m the webmaster. So...

287
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,382
that-that’s kind of a mystery
because…

288
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:56,805
I’m kind of secretive about my...

289
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,696
my personal screen name.

290
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,003
You know, if you haven’t gotten

291
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:03,002
that many messages

292
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:04,864
and now you get a message,

293
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,536
and...

294
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,556
the content is unpleasant

295
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:09,898
and disconcerting

296
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,891
you know…

297
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:14,526
And Butchie’s asshole
surf student signed it?

298
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,317
Uh, it was a video message.

299
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:19,346
Like that fuck Bin Laden?

300
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,818
“Shaun will soon be gone.”

301
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:29,599
<i>So sorry to intrude.</i>

302
00:24:30,632 --> 00:24:32,331
- Several matters to discuss.
- No.

303
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,620
She got a message
about her grandson.

304
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,136
It’s got her upset.

305
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:38,281
- About Shaun?
- I’ll tell you the truth.

306
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:39,999
I actually think…

307
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:43,051
at least as far as evaluating it,

308
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:46,108
<i>I think maybe the police
should be involved.</i>

309
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,108
If this is an intervention,
I’m clean.

310
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:11,965
My Gram’s not home

311
00:25:12,972 --> 00:25:14,845
Do you have to have someone home with you?

312
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:16,397
I’m 14.

313
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:18,097
No, sure.

314
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:25,908
You’re almost out of gas.

315
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,175
Yeah, I’m gonna get some.

316
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,448
Now?

317
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:36,738
Sure,

318
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,216
we could get it now.

319
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,809
Would you like to go someplace?

320
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:46,164
Sure.

321
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:50,254
Should we go to SeaWorld?

322
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:52,540
Sure.

323
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,784
Do you need to leave a message?

324
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:00,868
Yeah,

325
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,662
I’ll leave one at the store

326
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,265
It’s a lovely home.

327
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,444
- And?
- And, uh…

328
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:19,992
sensitive to things my boss,

329
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:22,939
the shit he sees: “Don’t you get
me started, you,” I mean

330
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,780
You’re about to get 86’d.

331
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:28,453
There’s a there’s an incident,
incident coming up.

332
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:34,420
Ugh, your birds… greasy feathers.

333
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:36,419
There’s no grease on these birds.

334
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,848
Allergic…

335
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:44,123
Done. Done.
Yeah, totally erased the tickle.

336
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,774
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

337
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:50,111
My boss has had a vision, sir.
It scares his pants off.

338
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:51,641
Of what?

339
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:54,967
Don’t make me imagine that beating,
him giving me chapter and verse, right?

340
00:26:54,968 --> 00:26:56,791
I can only tell you...

341
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,329
I can only tell you
he does not mess with that shit.

342
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,911
Even…even refusing to admit it,
he would appreciate it

343
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:05,350
if you came to consult.

344
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:06,715
- Go outside.
- Yeah.

345
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:10,264
And on that score…

346
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:12,161
when you and he converse,

347
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:15,118
if you confide to him I told you
he asked me to come get you,

348
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:17,909
this is the last I would speak off
of the ventilator.

349
00:27:18,993 --> 00:27:21,655
Thank you. Thank you.

350
00:27:27,368 --> 00:27:29,265
Hey Shaunie, my phone’s fucked.

351
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:31,434
Give your Grams a call when you get this.

352
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,859
This is bullshit, you know.

353
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,598
John’s a good guy.

354
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,668
Only you would think he wasn’t strange.

355
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:41,157
Oh, and Dwayne’s not strange, Ma?

356
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:45,124
Ask him about the halo effect
the next time you got a free month.

357
00:28:05,471 --> 00:28:06,876
What do you want?

358
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:12,328
I’m looking for Butchie Yost.
He owes me 20 bucks.

359
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:14,521
Yeah? Good luck.

360
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:17,404
Well anyway, he wasn’t in.

361
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,780
Then I guess your work here
on earth is through.

362
00:28:22,223 --> 00:28:24,219
I guess your mission is complete.

363
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:27,521
How you sleeping?

364
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:30,494
- What?
- Sleep-ing.

365
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:33,081
If I spoke monkey,
I’d put it in your language.

366
00:28:33,744 --> 00:28:35,986
I’d as soon as not go back into the joint.

367
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:37,440
That’s why I don’t tune you up.

368
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:40,495
Then why don’t you just fucking
tell me how you’re sleeping?

369
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:43,846
- Why?
- Are you having visions,

370
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,579
when you’re sleeping,
you half a fucking ape?

371
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,319
See I could give less of a flying fuck,
but I’m here, see?

372
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,970
So I ask the questions.

373
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:53,631
And believe me, I give less of a fuck!

374
00:28:57,897 --> 00:28:59,302
I dreamt...

375
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:01,273
of that kid gone.

376
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:07,803
Who’s your reference?

377
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:10,325
Butchie’s son, Shaun.

378
00:29:10,326 --> 00:29:11,582
That kid.

379
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,855
Excuse me.

380
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,516
I’m in a hurry.

381
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:28,004
- Yeah...
- It’s important.

382
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:31,747
Listen. What up with
the party at the Yost suite?

383
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:35,739
I can’t speak to that.

384
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,029
Can’t... speak to it?

385
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,651
- Will you let me out please?
- Yeah.

386
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,235
My domain has been hacked, alright?

387
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,428
And?

388
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:52,015
And we’re all a bit concerned
for Butchie’s son.

389
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,818
This will bring matters into focus.

390
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:02,909
Just take a moment.

391
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,757
Let’s see.

392
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:20,370
Rebooting…

393
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:27,583
When did you start that again?

394
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,582
When I stopped shooting dope.
You know what?

395
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,191
Fuck your fucking computer.
I don’t give a fuck what’s on there.

396
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,645
Here we go! Here we go.

397
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:38,478
“Shaun will soon be gone.”

398
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,749
That’s it.

399
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,843
Look, not that we even know
what the fuck he’s talking about.

400
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:53,972
Words mean something different for him.

401
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:56,606
“I’m shy about dumping out.”

402
00:30:57,098 --> 00:30:59,341
“I’m gonna bone her and break her jaw.”

403
00:30:59,342 --> 00:31:00,671
Who does he do that to?

404
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,150
For Christ’s sake!

405
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:04,367
My sole concern…

406
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:07,134
how he infiltrated my domain.

407
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,036
It’s because he’s got strange
fucking powers, alright Dwayne?

408
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,161
He makes money appear and
every other fucking thing.

409
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,167
I mean nobody said he hasn’t got
strange fucking powers and abilities.

410
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:17,289
Without being argumentative,

411
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,964
I’d think that should...

412
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:21,502
raise our index of suspicion…

413
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:22,907
somewhat.

414
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:25,174
Yeah well, fuck you too, Meyer.

415
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,976
Gonna. Quick piss,

416
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:38,105
Why should either of us pay
any attention to what you think?

417
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,407
- Fine!
- That’s all.

418
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:42,033
Alright.

419
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,930
- Drive Safely.
- Excuse me?

420
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:46,412
Drive safely, get the fuck out.

421
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,344
Done.

422
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:55,012
Listen to that toilet, huh?
Runs, runs, runs.

423
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:58,124
You yell at me why I should flush
at night, huh?

424
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,070
That’s the ensuing reason.

425
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,130
He was just leaving.

426
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:02,627
You ain’t just whistling Dixie!

427
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,948
Listen to me. List…
listen up for a second.

428
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,648
Boss,

429
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:08,200
as far as your vision,

430
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,147
I just ran into a hairlip,

431
00:32:10,246 --> 00:32:11,379
apparently has...

432
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:13,498
- partial confirmation.
- Of what?

433
00:32:14,122 --> 00:32:15,724
That boy…

434
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,744
and so forth.

435
00:32:30,897 --> 00:32:32,819
Where the fuck did he come from?

436
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:36,239
Cincinnati?

437
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:53,411
What the fuck, John?
You’ve got everybody shitting bricks!

438
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:55,678
You sneaking onto
other people’s computers now?

439
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,811
The internet is big.

440
00:32:56,812 --> 00:32:59,067
Fuck the internet, buddy,
what’s this shit about Shaun?

441
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:00,978
Shaun will soon be gone.

442
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,654
Don’t…don’t say that any more.

443
00:33:02,752 --> 00:33:05,093
Do not say that. Understood?

444
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,984
We don’t remember our father’s words?

445
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,585
What in hell is going on here?

446
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:11,409
- Shit!
- Shit.

447
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,838
- Shut up, John.
- Bill…

448
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,238
look at this.

449
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,008
I don’t use those.

450
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:20,757
I can turn it on for you.

451
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:22,063
Outdoors?

452
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:23,074
Yes.

453
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:25,070
Well, do it then for god’s sake!

454
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:27,263
You’d never hurt Shaunie,

455
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:29,552
You’d never hurt Shaunie,
would you, John?

456
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,001
Hurting Shaun doesn’t ring a bell.

457
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:35,128
What the fuck are you he’ll be gone for?

458
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,922
We don’t remember our father’s words.

459
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:45,989
Aw shit.

460
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:48,140
Me and “I got my eye on you”

461
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:49,650
are gonna have a little conversation.

462
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:53,078
- I don’t think he knows what he’s saying.
- Well, I’m gonna help him with all that.

463
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,676
Try to tell him what you mean, buddy.

464
00:33:58,677 --> 00:34:00,194
- I’ll try, Butchie.
- Come on.

465
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:14,348
This is incorrect.

466
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:15,964
It... it’s supposed to be...

467
00:34:16,082 --> 00:34:17,324
“10 Off”.

468
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:19,553
The bottom tier is 10 off.

469
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:22,234
You don’t reward failure, Ramon.

470
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,586
Come over here.

471
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,566
Now, let me just say
that sending that message

472
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,971
means you’re not as stupid
as you sometimes appear,

473
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:52,553
so we’ll have no more of the parrot talk…

474
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:54,788
right here, right now...

475
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,937
under the present circumstances.

476
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,150
When you leave this room,

477
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:02,441
you and I are gonna have gotten
to the bottom of things.

478
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,912
You’re gonna tell me exactly...

479
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,671
what that message means.

480
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,268
Do we understand each other?

481
00:35:09,662 --> 00:35:10,687
Yes, Bill.

482
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,025
“Shaun will be gone soon.”

483
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:17,869
Alright, let’s take
the first word “soon”.

484
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:20,528
Some people are concerned “soon”

485
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:21,691
when you made that tape…

486
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,229
would now mean…

487
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:25,949
right now.

488
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:27,770
Is that true?

489
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,043
Is Shaun gone now?

490
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:33,684
What does “soon” mean?

491
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,847
Could it mean a thousand years?

492
00:35:37,438 --> 00:35:39,488
It could mean a thousand years.

493
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:42,681
Now I don’t want to get violent with you…

494
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:45,569
but I told you no parrot talk.

495
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,434
What does “soon” mean?

496
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,281
Could it be 10 minutes?

497
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:59,139
It could mean 10 minutes.

498
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:02,626
What does it mean!?

499
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,327
There will be no more parrot talk.

500
00:36:17,526 --> 00:36:19,227
Shaun calls you his friend,

501
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:22,479
yet you send this message like…
like… like some terrorist.

502
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:25,077
Now you cannot be this stupid.

503
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:28,773
You managed to send a message...

504
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:31,779
with a camera, on a computer,

505
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:34,169
this goofball from the computer place,

506
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:36,236
he says he still don’t know
how you did it!

507
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:40,030
How does that happen?

508
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:43,825
I don’t know Butchie, instead.

509
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,864
Your suitcase…

510
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:56,363
dad’s clothes.

511
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,703
You know, that shuffleboard’s really
got the parking spots ass-fucked.

512
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:07,895
Shut up.

513
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:15,706
Fuckin’ steal it,
I’ll split the insurance with ya.

514
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,072
This other guy outside, this Hawaiian,

515
00:37:21,688 --> 00:37:23,758
he says you’re a shape-shifter.

516
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,577
Pothead Joe, he says you died,

517
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,809
came back to life.

518
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:33,336
Stare me down!

519
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:34,346
Just stare me down!

520
00:37:34,347 --> 00:37:36,637
What’s going on? Jesus Christ!
What’s happening here?!

521
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,460
He’s yours.

522
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:53,432
Was he hurt?

523
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,083
Tried to hurt himself.

524
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:56,463
He doesn’t get hurt.

525
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:01,194
Forget about Cincinnati.

526
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:06,696
Hello?

527
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:08,397
I don’t know his whereabouts.

528
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,964
Oh fine,

529
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:13,714
complicit in a second felony.

530
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,498
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Do not come near me.

531
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:18,198
Fair notice, miss!

532
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,638
Certain outcomes or circumstances,

533
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,608
you’re not leaving here with
your fucking Kodak, OK?

534
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:25,777
I apologize in advance.

535
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:27,181
Bye.

536
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,311
He’s alright.

537
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,028
The porn queen had him at SeaWorld.

538
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:37,642
Fuck…

539
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:41,313
Excuse me, excuse me.

540
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:42,314
Crucial information...

541
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:44,998
Crucial information: Western Union!

542
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:47,565
The lost telegram has been located.

543
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:49,315
<i>Yeah, help me with something, Kai.</i>

544
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:50,827
<i>If Shaunie left a message at the shop,</i>

545
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:52,992
<i>why do I have to find out
from his whore of a mother,</i>

546
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:55,080
she took him to SeaWorld and
now she’s dropping him home?

547
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:58,136
<i>The lost surfing telegraph boy</i>

548
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:00,177
<i>has been located.</i>

549
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:01,704
- Located.
- This is fucking bullshit.

550
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:04,883
If he’s old enough to be with her,
I’m signing him tonight with Linc.

551
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:07,175
He’s safe!

552
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,731
Located! Located!

553
00:40:09,732 --> 00:40:13,230
He’s located! He’s safe!
Don’t kill anybody! Don’t kill anybody!

554
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,377
SeaWorld.

555
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:26,756
That’s where he was?

556
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,368
Yeah, the mother took
the kid to SeaWorld.

557
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,293
Did you kill him?

558
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:40,324
Nah. Palaka caught me.

559
00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:43,193
Shape-shifters!

560
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:48,835
I’ve seen on many occasion.

561
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:50,790
You don’t know what the fuck he is.

562
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:56,335
No.

563
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:01,439
But whatever the fuck he is,
he’s gotta come through both of us.

564
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:12,497
Daphne, he was proposing
a corrupt collusion.

565
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,609
- To which you replied to him?
- Fuck these people.

566
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:22,311
I’m outta here.
I don’t take this abuse from anybody.

567
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:25,644
Who are you talking about, Kai?

568
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:27,147
Who’s keys are those?

569
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:30,819
Fucking Cissy
queen-of-the-ballbusters Yost.

570
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:33,505
Thinks I gotta eat
her shit on the telephone.

571
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:36,702
Just so happens I laid my foot open
getting out of the water this morning…

572
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:40,767
a fucking Coke can some asshole tears
in half and leaves in the fucking sand.

573
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,101
No health plan on that 8 dollars
an hour those jerks see fit to pay me.

574
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:48,646
So I drive clear to Huntington to see
this quack that I know will treat me.

575
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:51,160
Take me 2 hours just to see the asshole,

576
00:41:51,283 --> 00:41:53,624
another two in traffic getting back here.

577
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:57,367
And Shaunie didn’t leave any message,
that lying little jerk.

578
00:41:57,811 --> 00:42:01,482
I try to keep tabs on him,
and Butchie too, and she knows that.

579
00:42:01,578 --> 00:42:04,042
So fuck her, fuck them!

580
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:07,639
I’m gone. I’m outta here.
Tell her to go fuck herself. I quit.

581
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:17,982
I could be disbarred.

582
00:42:20,158 --> 00:42:22,031
I’m not the fair-weather type, Meyer.

583
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,308
That isn’t who you’re engaged to.

584
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,386
What have you gotten me
in the middle of, John?

585
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:36,924
Work here, Cass.

586
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:40,128
“Work here. Work here. “

587
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:44,461
What is it that you have me working on
when we do whatever it is that we do,

588
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:47,403
so that I don’t remember afterward?

589
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:51,744
I helped you make that video,
didn’t I John,

590
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:55,302
with my zeros and my fucking ones?

591
00:42:55,303 --> 00:42:58,695
And I helped you scare
all of those people.

592
00:42:59,768 --> 00:43:01,664
You helped me.

593
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:03,036
You know what?

594
00:43:03,265 --> 00:43:04,862
Get out!

595
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:09,452
Get out, you goddamn twitch with
your little-boy-take-care-of-me act!

596
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:12,396
My father had more big and huge for me.

597
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:15,986
Who is your father, an Arab fanatic?

598
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:19,376
Those fuckin’ towelheads are going
to get themselves eradicated.

599
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:21,946
My god. Oh my god.

600
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:24,393
What is going on?

601
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:28,984
Tell me something.
Tell me something big and huge.

602
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:31,927
My father tells me, Cass.

603
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:36,973
Can’t you tell me anything else?

604
00:43:44,314 --> 00:43:46,088
Does your father mean well?

605
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:14,692
He called the shop,

606
00:44:14,727 --> 00:44:17,240
he left word on the machine.
I heard him do it.

607
00:44:18,374 --> 00:44:19,803
Maybe he just faked it.

608
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,725
I do that about half the time.

609
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,474
How pissed off was Cissy?

610
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:25,889
Not too bad.

611
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,920
- Bullshit.
- Cissy wakes up pissed off.

612
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:36,740
This fucking John, you know?

613
00:44:37,948 --> 00:44:40,116
He’s a good guy,
but he acts like a pea brain…

614
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:42,261
saying shit is gonna happen to Shaunie.

615
00:44:43,444 --> 00:44:44,848
What was he saying?

616
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,066
He’s going to be gone, stupid shit.

617
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:49,382
That’s why everyone freaked
when we couldn’t find him.

618
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:54,514
- Could he hurt Shaun?
- Fu... no. Fuck, no.

619
00:44:56,189 --> 00:44:57,766
Who am I, Dr Phil?

620
00:44:57,767 --> 00:45:00,255
Hey! Jack and Coke if you’re working.

621
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:08,131
She thinks I’m working.

622
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:11,679
Maybe she’s checking your moves.

623
00:45:19,725 --> 00:45:21,302
He turned out so good.

624
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:25,584
Shaunie.

625
00:45:26,988 --> 00:45:29,575
Well, I guess we have
to give Cissy that much.

626
00:45:32,138 --> 00:45:33,138
Sorry.

627
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,021
Asshole.

628
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,823
Shaun wants me to stay in I.B.

629
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:47,669
I want to.

630
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:50,158
Would you be OK with that?

631
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:54,741
I signed him over, Tina.
I don’t get a vote on that shit.

632
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:02,047
Yeah, I’d be OK with it.

633
00:46:05,522 --> 00:46:07,394
I’m fucking Linc.

634
00:46:12,496 --> 00:46:14,344
Why would you tell me that?

635
00:46:14,714 --> 00:46:16,414
If I was here, you know,

636
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,402
- around Shaun…
- I don’t talk to Linc.

637
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:19,591
I know.

638
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:21,414
And I wanna be in your life.

639
00:46:21,415 --> 00:46:24,568
That would be my part, writing
permission slips for who you bang?

640
00:46:25,357 --> 00:46:27,237
- I wouldn’t have time to eat.
- OK.

641
00:46:32,954 --> 00:46:34,974
Not for nothing, Tina, but…

642
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:37,538
you don’t fuck Linc.

643
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:39,041
Linc fucks you.

644
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:42,733
You keep watch on that boy, boss,
and I’ll keep watch on you.

645
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,583
It’s my… It’s my friend.

646
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:52,357
Yeah.

647
00:47:54,328 --> 00:47:56,373
Lovely, uh, flowers.

648
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,135
Thank you very much, sir.

649
00:47:58,136 --> 00:47:59,146
Nice …

650
00:47:59,663 --> 00:48:00,772
puppy.

651
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,281
It’s like a goddamn matchbook car.

652
00:48:06,045 --> 00:48:07,523
It’s a rental.

653
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,024
I told you about that fucking bird.

654
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:14,833
Yeah. Mortal combat with unseen forces,

655
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:19,059
I should deprive myself of telepathic
information to spare you...

656
00:48:19,305 --> 00:48:21,843
irritation from cheeping.

657
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:28,375
Butchie’s friend.

658
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:31,036
Jesus Christ almighty!

659
00:48:41,758 --> 00:48:43,753
A terrible person.
I’d rather stand outside.

660
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:15,256
15 years…

661
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:17,468
a nice round number.

662
00:49:22,445 --> 00:49:24,096
Would you rather I move?

663
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:26,190
Why?

664
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:29,600
I don’t understand what you’re saying.

665
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:32,508
I’m keeping an informal

666
00:49:32,509 --> 00:49:33,740
watch on the boy.

667
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,387
I resigned that position this afternoon.

668
00:49:40,015 --> 00:49:43,465
You let Cissy piss in your ear,
Kai, every day.

669
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:48,787
You surfed with Shaunie
every day he wanted to.

670
00:49:50,557 --> 00:49:52,356
You kept Butchie’s boards…

671
00:49:52,578 --> 00:49:53,834
every day.

672
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:57,629
Shaun will be gone.

673
00:49:59,053 --> 00:50:00,802
Butchie will need you on the water.

674
00:50:02,724 --> 00:50:04,326
Should I stick around?

675
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:11,759
Staircase situation in my own home,
failed to alleviate it going on a year…

676
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,322
probably I’m not who to ask.

677
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:20,993
All nice inside.

678
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:22,249
All lit up.

679
00:50:25,724 --> 00:50:28,040
This ain’t over, believe me.

680
00:50:29,775 --> 00:50:31,204
Shut up.
