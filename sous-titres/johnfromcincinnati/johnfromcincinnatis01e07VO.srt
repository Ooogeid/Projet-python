4
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,885
Some day
yesterday, Cass.

5
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:55,839
Yesterday was
a three-ring circus.

6
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,878
I'm going to be
with my father today.

7
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:07,418
My father has more
big and huge for me.

8
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,142
Without the zeros
and ones, Cass,

9
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,999
Big and huge
won't mean dick.

10
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,414
Work here.

11
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:41,541
Two-stop bus ride, Dwayne,
from lurking outside the door

12
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,825
To fucking turning
into a full-blown homo.

13
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,456
Can I come in?

14
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:47,325
No, stay the fuck outside.

15
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,709
Still brooming the spider
webs off our website?

16
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,695
1244 hits.

17
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,023
1244 hits
in, like, 24 hours.

18
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:04,409
No shit.

19
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:06,778
It's the halo effect
from Shaun.

20
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:10,347
Far out.

21
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:14,031
Bottom line, I think
Shaun needs his own site.

22
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:16,653
Well, he's already on mytube,
or whatever the fuck you call it.

23
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:18,381
A site, Butchie,

24
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:20,992
commercial
portal capacity, like

25
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,545
five years ahead of the curve

26
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:25,449
I thought to put in yours and
you never fucking exploited.

27
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:31,869
You think that's where
it all went wrong...

28
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,408
Me not exploiting
my portal capacity?

29
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:37,608
No, I'm not talking about
you at all, Butchie.

30
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,685
I'm just saying,
if Shaun doesn't do it,

31
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,555
Whoever sponsors him will,

32
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:44,296
And he'll end up getting
used like some street whore.

33
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:47,452
Does any of that
sound familiar to you?

34
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:51,856
I guess
that makes sense.

35
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,358
Well, you oughta go talk to
him, and now's a good time

36
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,194
'cause Mitch is
at the restoration center.

37
00:04:56,683 --> 00:04:58,796
Or whatever the fuck
he's doing in Mexico.

38
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,159
I don't suppose you'd
like to come with me.

39
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,335
Nah, I got a butt plug
exploiting my portal.

40
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,375
What the fuck am I gonna
say to him, Dwayne?

41
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:11,689
Yeah, okay.

42
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,395
In case he doesn't
understand how I talk was all.

43
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,917
Fuck, I used to work
at the U. N., baby.

44
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:25,038
Now I'll have to cancel my
many previous engagements.

45
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,971
Yeah, I'll have to cancel
all of mine too.

46
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,360
That's right.

47
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:33,001
Where are we looking?
I'll meet you.

48
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,522
Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne!

49
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,015
Some gangbanger will
hit you upside the head

50
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:39,226
and I'll have to collect you
with a spoon and blotter.

51
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:43,929
So don't even try
to live green?

52
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:45,560
You got it, my brother.

53
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,398
Hey, Janie.

54
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,547
- Good or bad?
- Good.

55
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,587
Everything's good.

56
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,836
Good enough to get his
boards out of storage?

57
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:09,202
That's why I'm here.

58
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,148
See that?

59
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,726
Imperial Beach,

60
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,752
who's been here before?

61
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,223
A funky little
beach town,

62
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,660
A lot of history
for our sport.

63
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:27,303
Now...

64
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,924
Oh, my friend,

65
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:31,355
spread that food around.

66
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:34,316
If you see any hungry conventioneers
coming through here, feed 'em.

67
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:37,903
- Fires?
- No fires,

68
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:39,588
Learning opportunities.

69
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,102
Wonder boy...
e- commerce bitchfest.

70
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,383
Tremendous learning
opportunities.

71
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,193
We're rolling out
those P. O.P. Incentives.

72
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:49,879
Which you think
is money pissed away.

73
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,307
A wise man once told me that
"core shops are stinkweed's soul. "

74
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:54,568
Did you believe him?

75
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,893
We upped
the incentives to 4%.

76
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,301
Year-to-date,
domestic's nearly level,

77
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:00,987
Down.3%...

78
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,066
within the parameters
of plan.

79
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,233
International's
14 above plan.

80
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:07,358
Eastern europe's
a minor disappointment.

81
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:09,767
- China's on plan.
- Stalemate on that trademark headache.

82
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:11,935
<i>latin america stays
a pleasant surprise. </i>

83
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:14,383
The brazilians have
a boner for our shoes.

84
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:16,621
Really?
You got a boner?

85
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,276
Let me check.

86
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,606
Break.

87
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:39,297
They start wearing suits or we do.

88
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:43,023
What happened
in huntington, Jake?

89
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,896
I thought that's what we'd
be talking about in there.

90
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:48,616
I thought we would have talked
about it before we went in there.

91
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:50,898
I don't know, dude... the
fucking traffic, you know?

92
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:53,833
Shaun Yost.

93
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:57,885
At huntington,
Shaun Yost won.

94
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:00,227
He wiped out and hurt himself
at the end of the heat.

95
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:01,828
The doctor was wrong
how bad.

96
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,157
I was there when they
brought him out of the water.

97
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,127
He was drowned.
He broke his neck.

98
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:09,855
How is he alive?
A miracle?

99
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:13,864
I agreed he could be
the next one.

100
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:16,825
All the family downside, I
agreed we'd go after him hard.

101
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:20,067
A miracle... half our
base runs the other way.

102
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,787
Do we make that up
selling at shrines?

103
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,542
I'm here to try
to figure that out.

104
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,270
And I'm your hire, Linc.

105
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,778
I'm supposed to tell you
when people aren't happy.

106
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,895
Some people never are. Tell
them to go fuck themselves.

107
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,580
Yeah, I thought I wouldn't do
that till after they bought us out.

108
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,093
Let's go deal
with these clones.

109
00:08:41,463 --> 00:08:42,936
Can I hang
a couple days?

110
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,212
I get you to tijuana, the
kid can hear our confession.

111
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,655
Lucky coincidence.

112
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,531
Are we happy,
wonder boy,

113
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:56,543
When domestic sales are level?

114
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,768
Level is on plan
for the quarter.

115
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,606
Wait a second... treading
water is getting ready to drown.

116
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,529
- The salmon makes me thirsty.
- Get a drink.

117
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,775
Level's on plan 'cause
domestic's a maturing market.

118
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:14,490
And do we suppose that domestics
have matured due to e-commerce?

119
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,487
I don't know how you'd
measure correlation.

120
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:19,382
We don't have
an M. C. Paradigm?

121
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:20,572
No.

122
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,434
So what will you do,
grab your balls and guess?

123
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:26,493
Did I do something
to piss you off?

124
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:28,631
- Eat your buffet.
- I'd like to sit down.

125
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:29,906
Go ahead.

126
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:32,527
You call that sitting down?

127
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:34,694
I want to go back
to the table.

128
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:36,508
This is why I hired
wonder boy...

129
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:38,397
He just comes right
from his fucking gut.

130
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,692
- What are we doing here, Linc?
- I'm not 100% clear.

131
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:42,647
Maybe you'd like
to google it and find out.

132
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:45,537
If this is a referendum
on information technology,

133
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:47,466
Our target demographic's for it.

134
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:49,349
Oh, so that ship has sailed?

135
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,806
The best we can do is hope to jump onboard?
Does that summarize your position?

136
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:55,243
If you're treading water,
you're getting ready to drown.

137
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,984
If I'm treading water, fuckface,

138
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:00,465
<i>I am not swimming toward
a ship that has set sail</i>

139
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,734
And begging them to
pull me in their dinghy.

140
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,604
If I got a surfboard beside
me, I'm getting on that fucker

141
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,588
and I'paddling out,
turning around

142
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,342
and flipping the bird to all
the assholes on that ship.

143
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,352
<i>And maybe 3% of them
weren't sure</i>

144
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:14,521
They ever wanted to be on
that boat to begin with.

145
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,320
And some of them...
they're diving off.

146
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:19,451
Now them... them, I give
them a big fucking smile,

147
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,411
I ride up to them
on my board

148
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,401
And say, "hey, how would you
like to buy one just like it?

149
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,149
Or my jockstrap
or my boardshorts,

150
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:30,665
wetsuit, ski jacket, snowboard that
I always take with me when I'm surfing?

151
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,898
I am such a tremendous

152
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:36,450
boardshort-wetsuit-
ski-jacket-snowboard ripper.

153
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,572
What I'm not is
a fucking asshole

154
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,507
<i>With allergies
trapped on a boat</i>

155
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,156
Or jerking off to the internet like

156
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,878
97% of my target demographic.

157
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,775
And the upside
for me is,

158
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:51,416
I like being on the water.

159
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,852
So if you're not too
salty from your salmon,

160
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,077
Maybe I can interest you
in a little ham.

161
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,472
- Give me a fucking break.
- Okay, we're done.

162
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:01,409
I'll be in Imperial
Beach till further notice.

163
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,030
I'll tell you something else:

164
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,934
That kid was saved
by a miracle.

165
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,300
What room is she in?

166
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,469
44.

167
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:13,538
Yeah, it's your wife, Mitch,

168
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,427
Cissy Yost.

169
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,012
Well, if you're not dead, just a
quick message to go fuck yourself

170
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,173
for not checking in
to say you're all right.

171
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:23,515
And have loads of fun

172
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:26,618
on whatever beach or whatever
astral plane you're on.

173
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,191
Use the cafe
across the street.

174
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:34,925
Excuse me?

175
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,523
Our toilets are for employees.
Go across the street.

176
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,051
My question,
or my desire, was...

177
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:45,337
How long has that
ink store been open?

178
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,573
We don't sell bongs.

179
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:51,176
We don't sell incense
or rolling papers.

180
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,979
A good reputation,
that pete, hmm?

181
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,610
No fatalities?

182
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:59,001
We're not a walk-in clinic.

183
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,288
The salamander
was highly valued

184
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:05,290
In certain...

185
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,727
Extinct island tribes.

186
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,826
God damn it!

187
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,068
My name is mark lewinsky.
I'm an attorney.

188
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,377
Is this some slip-and-fall bullshit?

189
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,893
Hardly, madam.

190
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,656
Am I pointing
at my neck?

191
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,880
Is it painfully swollen
and inflamed?

192
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,625
It's red.

193
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:33,451
Tattoo... a tribute
to my employer,

194
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:36,321
Possibly... fatal.

195
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:40,240
I am a counsel for mercy hospital,

196
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:42,436
The place that saved
your grandson's life,

197
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:47,265
And I just need one signature
to close Shaun's file.

198
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,434
All right, give me a pen.

199
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:50,742
Certainly.

200
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:53,292
Merest of formalities...

201
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,675
Departure against medical advice.

202
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,668
Here I go.
Here I go.

203
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:08,474
Take off.

204
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,223
You won't have
to ask me twice.

205
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:14,359
Get out. You're giving
me a bad fucking feeling.

206
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,356
Can't we at least accomplish our
little bit of wrist business here?

207
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:19,749
Get out of my store or you're
gonna get kicked in the balls.

208
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,666
Fine. Fine.

209
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,702
- Ma, is that you?
- Shut up.

210
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,704
<i>They sent me home, ma. </i>

211
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:28,061
Principal sent me home.

212
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:36,114
Strange way to show your
appreciation, Mrs. Yost,

213
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,850
to the hospital
that saved your grandson.

214
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:42,420
Bill's bird
saved my grandson.

215
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:46,424
And I'm showing this form
to Meyer Dickstein.

216
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:50,629
Oh yeah, the errol flynn look-alike
on the back cover of the yellow pages.

217
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:53,231
Oh, you sure you wanna
go there, frankenstein?

218
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,071
You got anybody
I could call?

219
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,545
No, I can boil
my own toast.

220
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,137
Yeah?

221
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,235
I'm a friend of Linc Stark's.

222
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,705
And?

223
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,518
And I work for him.

224
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:43,389
I'm vice president of
his company, Jake phort.

225
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,471
What do you want
from me?

226
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,248
Linc's having some sort
of midlife crisis.

227
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:03,846
And you're here
to help him through it?

228
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,443
10:30 in the morning, no
wonder they're going broke.

229
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,273
Hey, where is everyone?

230
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:15,143
She opened up
and then she split

231
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:17,240
with some little guy
in her car.

232
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,307
What's going on,
Shaunie?

233
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,376
Nothing.
The shop's locked up.

234
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:48,501
Put the joint out.

235
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:54,834
You know Dwayne?

236
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:58,109
- How's it going?
- How's it going, Shaun?

237
00:15:58,272 --> 00:15:59,591
Dwayne wants to talk to you

238
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,119
about some informational
superhighway shit.

239
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,796
Could we do it another time?

240
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,007
- Give us a second.
- We can do it another time.

241
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,750
Stand by the bicycles.

242
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,145
Hey, what's the matter
with talking to him now?

243
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,314
I don't feel like it.

244
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:24,661
Don't give me
that smart look

245
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:27,379
when you're sitting here smoking
when someone wants to help you.

246
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,957
That guy from stinkweed
wanted to help.

247
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:31,957
You wouldn't let me
sign with him.

248
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,491
The fuck if I wouldn't.
Who told you that?

249
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,686
I haven't seen Linc Stark
since you got hurt, Shaun.

250
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,365
It's been a busy
couple of days.

251
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,434
So are you saying
I can sign with them?

252
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,700
Little weed on your brain, you get
a real smartass tone of voice going.

253
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,077
That guy looks
like a tool.

254
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,718
That's just great. Hurt a person's
feelings comes looking to help you.

255
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,872
I didn't say it so he could hear.

256
00:17:03,963 --> 00:17:05,384
Why don't you
just leave me alone?

257
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,229
Yeah, good, great, fine,
okay? If I see Linc Stark,

258
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,603
I'll tell him
to come sign you.

259
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:12,343
Oh yeah, I forgot, you signed
me over to gram and gramps.

260
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:14,941
Tell him to go talk to them.

261
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,170
Yeah, good.
Let me get away.

262
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:23,683
Me being a fuck-up doesn't mean
I suldn't try to give you good advice.

263
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:27,045
Is my mom staying in I.B.?

264
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:29,839
I don't know.

265
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,851
Maybe you could give her some
good advice and ask her to stay.

266
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:42,911
He'll be all right.

267
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,764
Yeah, looks like
he's doing great.

268
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,089
That little pisspot.

269
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,873
So what should we
do now?

270
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:56,875
Well, Dwayne,
I guess you're gonna get

271
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,877
Your dipshit scooter
out of my van.

272
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:00,735
Yeah, we can
work this out later.

273
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,716
And I'm gonna get
good and fucking high.

274
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:08,720
Where are you, Kai?
The shop's locked.

275
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,864
Shaunie's out back
smoking weed.

276
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:13,089
Find a fucking shorter jingle!

277
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:29,708
Room service?

278
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:33,211
A really good friend of yours
wants to pay me to ruin your life.

279
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,075
Doesn't work.

280
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:06,813
Doesn't work either.

281
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,056
Is it chilly in here, ma?

282
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,761
He's burning up...

283
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:24,671
Maybe from your
hot garlic breath.

284
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,944
Why don't you get out
the line of fire?

285
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,030
Well, twist my fucking arm.

286
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:32,509
Boss, purple salamander,

287
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,973
Honoring a certain someone.

288
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,284
If yours hadn't have
come out green,

289
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,777
<i>I'd be having mine
burned off</i>

290
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,179
As to not get us took
for the bobbsey twins.

291
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,845
I was poisoned and miscolored?

292
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:46,211
- Right up here.
- Excuse me.

293
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,053
Okay, we have docked.

294
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:51,691
Is that the torturing
murderer that casted my wrist?

295
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:54,893
It's me, Palaka.

296
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:57,967
I am fucked up, doc,
to a fare-thee-well.

297
00:19:57,968 --> 00:20:01,109
Hey, thank god me and you
became friends, huh?

298
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:04,035
What does he need?
I'll run to the pharmacy.

299
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,037
Let's get him examined first.

300
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:14,860
What is that?

301
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:17,127
There.

302
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,768
When did you get
that tattoo, Palaka?

303
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:23,283
Uh, today, yeah.

304
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,591
- When did he get this?
- He told you... today.

305
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,026
Yeah, I'm asking when.

306
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:30,835
He came in my store,
like, an hour ago,

307
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:32,294
<i>Said he'd just got inked. </i>

308
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,327
We're gonna need to get
some antibiotics into you.

309
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,424
Won't be the first time, doc.

310
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:39,662
I been batting clean-up
since little league.

311
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,072
We're gonna need
more room.

312
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,580
Here, come here.
Come on.

313
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,215
This wall does need
to come out.

314
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:47,955
Come on. Get out of the
way. Put him in my room.

315
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:55,754
I have an account
around the corner.

316
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,454
<i>- CVS?
- I'm happy to get that filled. </i>

317
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,156
No, he needs an I.V.
And a few other things.

318
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,423
I want to see
what they have stocked.

319
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:08,567
You thinking of going
anytime soon?

320
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,381
I understand
you're concerned.

321
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,449
I'm not concerned.

322
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:16,808
I'll tell you when
I'm fucking concerned.

323
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,554
Nice working with you.

324
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,844
Tommy turtle's a blur
compared to that fuckhead.

325
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:36,361
Wile e. Coyote's a blur. The
road runner's a fucking blur.

326
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,530
Just shut your mouth, okay?

327
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,339
You're going to be fine.

328
00:21:45,657 --> 00:21:47,484
Thanks, ma.

329
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:52,801
Hello!
Hello. Come in.

330
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:56,428
Just missed
feeding time.

331
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:01,962
Birdseed.

332
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:04,937
Can I offer you a soda?

333
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:07,119
Twinkies?

334
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:10,661
- No, thanks.
- I see.

335
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:18,853
<i>Birds are good.</i>

336
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:23,323
I wish zippy
wouldn't have kissed me.

337
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,020
Okay.

338
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:31,862
Hey, okay.

339
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:34,511
Okay, goodness' sakes.

340
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:43,326
Oh, I can't see.

341
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,098
And I wouldn't
understand it anyway.

342
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:50,930
What did Mitch think?

343
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:53,594
Mitch is maintaining
radio silence.

344
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,172
Fucking Dickstein
will know what to do.

345
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:59,572
Probably in some ashram
in the downward dog position.

346
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,317
Hello.

347
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:06,278
How are you?

348
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:10,160
Why would they want me
to sign that?

349
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,027
She's already showed it
to me, fuckin' douche bag.

350
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:22,424
- Butchie's fucking Kai's brains out.
- Good.

351
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,371
Not that anyone comes in,
she's never at fucking work.

352
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:27,468
Shaunie could use
spending time with her.

353
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,768
His buddies still teasing
him after the accident?

354
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:33,545
This is a boilerplate for you.

355
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,115
The doctor's the sacrificial lamb.

356
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:42,538
Typically, the halo effect
in these documents

357
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,129
bathes the physician
in the hospital's light.

358
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:48,983
This absolves the hospital,
but your right of action

359
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:51,748
against the doctor is not impaired.

360
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,013
The harelip's going on and on
about what he's talking about.

361
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,097
- What harelip?
- I've warned him off

362
00:23:58,098 --> 00:24:00,591
talking about miracles until
the altar boys are safe.

363
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:01,937
What harelip?

364
00:24:01,951 --> 00:24:03,935
That sits there every day,
Dickstein,

365
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:06,768
pretending to make a life out
of maintaining Butchie's website.

366
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,769
And he's so excited
how Shaunie's accident

367
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,112
affected his halo effect,
whatever the fuck he's on about,

368
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:13,614
I'm afraid to let him
out on the street

369
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:16,065
on that stupid scooter
he fucking drives.

370
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:19,758
The number of hits
on Butchie's site...

371
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:21,293
The halo effect.

372
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:24,653
What the fuck was I just saying?

373
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,948
43 days in arrears.

374
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:29,634
82 days in arrears for you.

375
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,971
I got an arrears for you
right here, Doris.

376
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:39,530
Don't let anything happen
to that doctor.

377
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:42,914
That may not be in our hands.

378
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,429
How do you live in here?

379
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:49,142
Thank you.

380
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:52,316
Soup-to-nuts renovation
in the offing.

381
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,512
Well, you oughta off it
pretty fucking soon.

382
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,465
I'll use this rollaway in case
what you got is transferable.

383
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,770
I'll bring in
fresh sheets.

384
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:04,433
Stop answering if I'm talking to him.

385
00:25:18,493 --> 00:25:20,491
Don't you fucking die.

386
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:24,327
Could you tell me
your name, where you live

387
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:25,765
And your marital status?

388
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:28,556
Tina blake,
Van Nuys, single.

389
00:25:28,557 --> 00:25:30,235
- Van Nuys, California?
- right.

390
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:31,836
Do you have any children, Tina?

391
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,882
One...
Shaun Yost.

392
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:36,780
I gave him away
the day he was born.

393
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:39,826
And do you know
who Shaun's father was?

394
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,427
Yeah, I fucking know
who his father is...

395
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,142
Butchie Yost.

396
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,068
I left Shaunie
with Butchie's parents.

397
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,321
What do you do for a living?

398
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,683
Adult film actress.

399
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:53,247
Do you know
Linc Stark?

400
00:25:53,545 --> 00:25:54,551
Yes.

401
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:56,296
How did you meet him?

402
00:25:56,594 --> 00:25:57,812
He picked me up.

403
00:25:57,827 --> 00:26:01,510
Do you have a contractual arraement with
Stark involving your son Shaun Yost?

404
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:03,366
He's offered me
a contractual arrangement.

405
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:04,380
What are the terms?

406
00:26:04,507 --> 00:26:06,689
$4,000 a month while
Shaun's under contract.

407
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,021
- To stinkweed?
- Yeah.

408
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,802
Have you had sexual
relations with Linc Stark?

409
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:12,837
I'm not gonna talk about that.

410
00:26:16,818 --> 00:26:18,276
Have you ever
been arrested?

411
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:20,204
Yes.

412
00:26:20,332 --> 00:26:22,971
<i>- What was the charge?
- Accessory to extortion. </i>

413
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:25,437
- And did that involve blackmail?
- I was acquitted.

414
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,788
- I bet that had to be a big relief.
- Are we done?

415
00:26:29,662 --> 00:26:30,724
Can be.

416
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,280
You ever do drugs
with Linc?

417
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,780
Are you asking me to fib?

418
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:48,904
Are you asking me
to write you another check?

419
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:58,000
Al's car is red.

420
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:06,458
I mean, if he was really sick,

421
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,439
you'd take him
to the hospital, right?

422
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,978
I'm trying to remember

423
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:14,514
how I practiced before I met you.

424
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:17,078
Was it without
a fractured skull?

425
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:21,303
Some of the ice is yellow
with rust from the machine.

426
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:22,959
- It's all right.
- We don't have to use it.

427
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,085
The yellow is segregated
in the silver pail.

428
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:26,856
Just dump it all in the tub.

429
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:30,124
Now...

430
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,235
A little pin stick.

431
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:35,651
Oh, Christ.

432
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,068
How's our patient?

433
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:05,938
It's a holding action.

434
00:28:05,939 --> 00:28:07,851
We have to let
the antibiotics kick in.

435
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:10,804
Was that all overdone
about cigarettes?

436
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:12,929
No.

437
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:17,863
In any case,
I now have some sense

438
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,739
how the great astaire felt
the day he put on tap shoes.

439
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,366
Well, they're always
looking for candy stripers.

440
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,427
Yeah.

441
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:36,659
What?
You're shitting me.

442
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:05,544
Could I get one of those
thimblefuls?

443
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:07,579
Yes, Ramon.

444
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:11,449
- Orange juice?
- No, thanks.

445
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:14,886
Or, well, yes.

446
00:29:15,364 --> 00:29:16,402
Thank you.

447
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,868
Excuse me.

448
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:22,877
Please, Ramon,
have another.

449
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:25,668
And know that I do not rise
to your taunt about my cups

450
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:28,096
because I am all nurse.

451
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:39,546
Butchie's about
to get caught wrong.

452
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:40,977
Isn't he alone
in there?

453
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,843
Got your message...
shortened my jingle.

454
00:29:57,597 --> 00:29:59,640
Couldn't find Shaunie.

455
00:30:10,215 --> 00:30:12,226
I copped.
I didn't use.

456
00:30:12,612 --> 00:30:14,408
I didn't want to use.

457
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:18,177
I think it's off me.

458
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:25,480
Give me a break.

459
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:47,025
Is it sound judgment,
Palaka,

460
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,094
Treating you here,

461
00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:51,545
or fear of humiliation?

462
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:55,133
Resigning my position
to shield that boy...

463
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:59,015
Grand self-sacrificial
gesture that was one thing.

464
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:02,174
I'll go weeks without
selling a sherbet.

465
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,705
Not much grandeur for me
steering you into the E. R.

466
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:09,601
Like some defrocked
storefront operator

467
00:31:10,105 --> 00:31:12,499
waiting hat-in-hand for a resident

468
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,459
to decide to admit you.

469
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,713
I pray to god that's not
what holds me back.

470
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,419
Now now, ma.

471
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:33,146
Let me avoid this lady's
tone of voice.

472
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:38,880
Have you seen
Meyer Dickstein?

473
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,934
No, ma'am.

474
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,620
He hasn't arrived yet.

475
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:45,939
Are they fucking in there?

476
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:47,965
Hard to say.

477
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,096
What an hour has wrought.

478
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:54,142
Water, sand and mud when
you delivered our patient...

479
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:56,216
Now about to become
concrete.

480
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:58,341
How is that guy?

481
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:01,444
Well, we are waiting for
the antibiotics to kick in.

482
00:32:03,441 --> 00:32:05,857
Are they fucking in there?

483
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,929
The merest beginning
of our renovation.

484
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,125
I'm looking for Meyer Dickstein.

485
00:32:11,352 --> 00:32:14,473
Yes, well, I haven't seen him.

486
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,104
I saw you out in the water
this morning.

487
00:32:22,011 --> 00:32:23,102
Yeah?

488
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:27,055
I got your boards outside.

489
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:44,432
Every call I make, afterwards
I gotta use cuticle scissors.

490
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,259
<i>It's Butchie.
Leave a message. </i>

491
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,008
Butchie, message
from Bill jacks.

492
00:32:50,014 --> 00:32:51,605
<i>Shaunie's over here
with me,</i>

493
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:54,528
<i>so you may wanna call or just,
you know, get over here. </i>

494
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:58,658
Voicemail.
Not there.

495
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:07,687
Now...

496
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:12,971
Here's a book that
deals with anniversaries

497
00:33:13,864 --> 00:33:15,193
of people who are dead.

498
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,440
You see?

499
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,055
There's various chapters,

500
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,781
helping the bereaved

501
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:25,651
be at ease.

502
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:31,309
Now what in god's name
this has to do with you...

503
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:33,299
- 13 years old?
- 14.

504
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,885
14 years of age.

505
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:39,035
And thank god you've lost no one
to feel grief over the anniversary of.

506
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:42,680
Now...

507
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,684
I'd like to say this:

508
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:49,084
People are sad for various reasons

509
00:33:49,877 --> 00:33:52,527
And sometimes an outside
source is required

510
00:33:52,612 --> 00:33:55,301
Even to help them
know they feel sad...

511
00:33:57,072 --> 00:33:58,631
<i>Or if they know, then </i>

512
00:33:59,268 --> 00:34:00,827
offer helpful hints

513
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:03,537
And suggestions, ways
to deal with the problem,

514
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,212
Which is why I showed you the book.

515
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:14,816
Can I be frank with you?

516
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:17,155
Sure, Bill.

517
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,235
You reek of marijuana smoke.

518
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,394
I smoked a joint today.

519
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,072
And you tell me that
without shyness or remorse.

520
00:34:29,628 --> 00:34:32,617
That doctor is about to get an
ass-fucking from his hospital.

521
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,277
- Hey, Cissy.
- Yeah, good to see ya.

522
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:42,459
I remember when we used
to meet at work.

523
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,238
I feel like a duck
at as shooting gallery.

524
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,570
Hey, ma.

525
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:07,284
Hid 'em before I could
sell 'em.

526
00:35:24,862 --> 00:35:26,393
<i>Shaunie's over here with me,</i>

527
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:29,254
<i>So you may wanna call or just,
you know, get over here. </i>

528
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,887
It's Bill.
Shaun's there.

529
00:35:34,703 --> 00:35:36,233
I may take a ride over there.

530
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,659
Did you tell the doctor?

531
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,103
No.
Go ahead.

532
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:20,074
About the ass-fucking?

533
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:28,307
Don't do nothing stupid, doc.

534
00:36:28,308 --> 00:36:30,277
No, he needs to be
in that ice bath.

535
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:32,208
If that's what he needs,
then the regular doctors

536
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:35,013
<i>- will ice him at the fucking hospital.
- I am a regular doctor,</i>

537
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:36,962
And these are just
the several hours

538
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:39,464
that your friend shouldn't be
subjected to the disruptions

539
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:41,433
Involved in being
admitted to a hospital

540
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:43,297
to resume treatment
he's already getting.

541
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:45,670
Fuck you.
Open the fucking door.

542
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,239
Oh, another county heard from.

543
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,885
You're fucking lucky
I got my hands full.

544
00:36:49,886 --> 00:36:51,630
Take him back inside.

545
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:54,605
Thanksgiving.
Make a wish.

546
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:56,688
All your smartass
fucking talk...

547
00:36:56,689 --> 00:37:00,585
It was me that broke
his fucking wrist.

548
00:37:02,192 --> 00:37:05,111
It was a dirty needle got your
friend sick, not a broken wrist.

549
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:08,667
Stop trying to force an outcome
'cause you're upset for your friend.

550
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:17,421
Quick review... how to
put people at their ease?

551
00:37:18,037 --> 00:37:19,065
I'm good.

552
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,924
Upstairs.
Talk amongst yourselves.

553
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:28,213
Twinkies, soda and the like.

554
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:41,744
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, Shaunie.

555
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:44,229
Where's Bill?

556
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:46,264
He went upstairs.

557
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:47,614
Oh, right on.

558
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:52,559
You can go ahead
and sit down, dad.

559
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:06,054
Pretty pissed?

560
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:11,215
Hit me, buddy.
Come on.

561
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,267
I want to go back to normal.

562
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,562
I'm with you, brother.

563
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:24,698
What's fucked up about it is,
as much as it pisses you off,

564
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:26,853
the hand that you were
dealt ain't going anywhere...

565
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,363
Mine,

566
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,644
your gram's, gramps's.

567
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,245
My mom's.

568
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:37,447
Or your mom's
or any-fucking-body else's.

569
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,953
So fighting it
only gets your ass kicked.

570
00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:43,146
So if you can learn that now
instead of 20 years from now,

571
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,761
Fuck.

572
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,659
You know, just smack me
in the back of the head.

573
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,703
I've been thinking about
getting in the water.

574
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:09,225
You've been going out.

575
00:39:09,703 --> 00:39:11,530
Getting in
the way I used to.

576
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,871
Competing?

577
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:17,856
I don't know.
I guess, maybe.

578
00:39:21,452 --> 00:39:23,790
You wanna run by gram's
and grab your stuff,

579
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,830
trade a few,
see who busts bigger?

580
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:28,712
If you can handle
being dusted.

581
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,770
That's not gonna be
an issue, grom.

582
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,469
Thanks for the room, Bill.

583
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:36,665
<i>Shaun and I are gonna go get wet. </i>

584
00:39:36,735 --> 00:39:38,067
Fine.
Good.

585
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:48,305
- Thanks, Bill.
- Fine.

586
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,160
<i>Stinkweed's in great shape.</i>

587
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:58,463
<i>You're the fucking mess.</i>

588
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,066
Linc, the money wants you out.

589
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:06,039
<i>I'm your friend. </i>

590
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:08,349
You made the company.
I'd like to see you go

591
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,850
with your pockets full, but...

592
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:13,846
You are going, Linc.

593
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:15,503
<i>Buy you out, throw you out,</i>

594
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:16,793
Blow you out...

595
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:19,528
They'll play it
the way it fucking lays.

596
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,920
<i>Yeah, I fucking know
who his father is...</i>

597
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:24,047
<i>Butchie Yost. </i>

598
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,988
<i>I left Shaunie
with Butchie's parents. </i>

599
00:40:26,753 --> 00:40:28,150
<i>And what
do you do for a living?</i>

600
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:30,233
<i>Adult film actress. </i>

601
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:34,044
<i>- Do you know Linc Stark?
- Yes. </i>

602
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:37,090
<i>- How did you meet him?
- He picked me up. </i>

603
00:40:37,403 --> 00:40:39,718
<i>And do you have a contractual
arrangement with Linc Stark</i>

604
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,333
<i>involving your son
Shaun Yost?</i>

605
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:43,430
<i>- He's offered me a
contractual arrangement. - </i>

606
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:47,247
She's his mother.
The company wants him.

607
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:50,400
I don't want to have to play the
rest of the tape for you.

608
00:40:50,945 --> 00:40:52,121
Go ahead.

609
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:55,035
<i>No. I've been
your friend too long. </i>

610
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:59,101
Maybe it's what I need to
hear. Do what you gotta do.

611
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:00,489
No, Linc.

612
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,748
I want you to leave the company
so I can give you the tape.

613
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:06,127
You can do whatever the
fuck you want with it

614
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:08,110
and you can
walk away rich.

615
00:41:09,073 --> 00:41:10,377
<i>Are you asking me to fib?</i>

616
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:14,288
<i>Are you asking me
to write you another check?</i>

617
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:17,094
<i>- 'cause I will if you will. - </i>

618
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,872
Isn't that a felony
in this state...

619
00:41:28,977 --> 00:41:31,163
Offering someone money to lie?

620
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:37,014
What's their number
to buy me out?

621
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:46,931
$35 million.

622
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:51,106
$65.

623
00:41:54,818 --> 00:41:56,653
With a five-year no-compete...

624
00:41:56,951 --> 00:41:58,580
And you give me
that tape.

625
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:02,986
Okay.

626
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:05,353
Money want the yes on tape?

627
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,971
I hope you're not saying
they don't trust me.

628
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,562
Watch your back
with wonder boy.

629
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,767
<i>Pretty lady feeding the birds.</i>

630
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:31,031
How did that go?

631
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:34,352
Turned the tables
on that cocksucker,

632
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,903
Thanks to your wily ways.

633
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,609
Then I agreed
to get bought out,

634
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,508
Which is what
they'd sent him to do.

635
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:43,109
$65 million.

636
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:47,895
Bonus is, I get
to be scared to death.

637
00:42:48,285 --> 00:42:50,013
Is that a change?

638
00:42:50,906 --> 00:42:52,209
Maybe not.

639
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:59,237
For a million,
can I hold your hand?

640
00:43:04,196 --> 00:43:06,795
When I strike, it's gonna
be for the big money.

641
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:39,352
<i>Cissy Yost. </i>

642
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,103
Hey, captain kirk.

643
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:47,659
You were right about
being more miserable.

644
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:50,146
Getting dusted
won't be an issue.

645
00:43:51,586 --> 00:43:53,683
Don't get hit by a bus.

646
00:43:56,516 --> 00:43:59,425
"I know I am getting
better and stronger when

647
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:02,122
I can be alone at home

648
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:04,995
even though the person who
died is no longer there. "

649
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:08,525
Where else
am I gonna be?

650
00:44:09,964 --> 00:44:13,487
"memories of the person who died
make me smile, not cry. "

651
00:44:15,305 --> 00:44:17,155
Well, that one's easier
said than done.

652
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,352
"I laugh at my friends'
stupid jokes. "

653
00:44:21,353 --> 00:44:22,942
I don't have
any friends.

654
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:25,306
"I make stupid jokes. "

655
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:28,668
Well, I try to amuse the kid.

656
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:31,426
I mean I'm not a comedian.

657
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,305
"M. D."... it's not like
I'm a doctor or anything.

658
00:44:38,794 --> 00:44:40,067
<i>Dale, veni, dale. </i>

659
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:48,885
- What's that?
- I don't know.

660
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:56,338
Okay, this is for free,

661
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:58,868
<i>for nothing. </i>

662
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:13,230
Shape changer.

663
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,336
Oh, yeah?

664
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:18,972
If they weren't looking
to embarrass the poor girl,

665
00:45:18,973 --> 00:45:20,940
They'd blur out
where her dress came up.

666
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:28,994
<i>Gracias, gracias. </i>

667
00:45:36,102 --> 00:45:37,428
<i>Oh, gracias. </i>

668
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,163
<i>Oh, si. Gracias. </i>

669
00:46:09,493 --> 00:46:11,636
Shaun will soon be gone.

670
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:21,657
<i>How much is that worth?</i>

671
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:35,048
<i>'cause the big money
is staying in escrow</i>

672
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:38,548
<i>For whoever can tell me
what the fuck is going on.</i>
