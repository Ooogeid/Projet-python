1
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:10,138
Would you watch it?

2
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:15,573
Hey, we really...

3
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:18,980
We really need to get Navarro...
to a hospital.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,824
Yeah, well, you see one around here?

5
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:24,810
OK, all right, Point, could you please
just watch the road?

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,029
- You wanna drive?
- No, I'm just sayin'...

7
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:29,055
You're always just sayin'.
Give it a rest.

8
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:35,432
Could you please just tell me exactly
what it is that we're doing here?

9
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:38,285
And why this all seems like
a really bad version of deliverance?

10
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,401
- And why we didn't take the interstate?
- You really need an answer to that?

11
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,229
I do, because you're turning this into
some kind of wilderness vision quest.

12
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:46,572
We've been through this.
We stay off the main roads.

13
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:48,670
The last thing we want to do
is attract attention,

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,021
End up with some cop
looking through our stuff.

15
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:52,722
Yeah, I get that...

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,761
What was that?

17
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:03,537
Come on.

18
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:14,361
Damn it.

19
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:21,441
You wait here with Navarro.

20
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,853
We're screwed.

21
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:41,217
You think?

22
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:45,211
Guys, Navarro's coughing up
a lot of blood.

23
00:02:05,298 --> 00:02:07,144
Let's get the gear out of the truck.

24
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,923
<i>So, what are we gonna do?</i>

25
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:41,160
<i>About what?</i>

26
00:03:41,716 --> 00:03:44,746
Navarro? I mean,
what will happens if he dies?

27
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:46,747
He's not gonna die.

28
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,913
I never thought anyone
was gonna get hurt.

29
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:51,359
Yeah, well...

30
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:54,868
When you play in the big leagues,
you gotta take some chances.

31
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,340
All right, fine. Why couldn't
we {\have} just taken our chances,

32
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,203
Stuck to the highways,
or rented a puddle jumper and flown?

33
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,222
The real question is...

34
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:08,212
Why did I even bother
letting you come in the first place?

35
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:11,124
You're lucky to even be here.

36
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,902
Well, if this is luck,
I'd hate to see misfortune.

37
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,437
We're going in there?

38
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,155
Hello!

39
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,408
Hello!

40
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:56,782
Could you wait up a second?

41
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:30,493
Hello?

42
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:33,737
Is anybody here?

43
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:38,081
Hello!

44
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,076
Come on.

45
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,251
You're all right.

46
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:09,981
This place is nice and creepy.

47
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,171
Are you just here to annoy me?

48
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,936
No, I'm here 'cause I'm your brother
and 'cause you love me.

49
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,680
- Half right.
- And 'cause I made a deal. So...

50
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,670
There's a big difference between
making a deal and closing it.

51
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,366
The minute we get home,
you're not my problem anymore.

52
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,070
Blood's not enough.

53
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,443
I'm done fixing your problems.

54
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,881
- You wait here with Navarro.
- Yup, I got it.

55
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:40,572
Hello!

56
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:42,492
Anybody?

57
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,259
Hello!

58
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,311
Look... I told her to stop touching him,

59
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:38,288
- But she wouldn't listen.
- OK, OK.

60
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:40,932
Get away from him.

61
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:43,164
I said step away.

62
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:45,112
- He's dying.
- Come on, love.

63
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,211
Be a good girl, back away from him.

64
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,161
Stay back.

65
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,003
Do us all a favor... and drop it.

66
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,624
Freeze!

67
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,120
Lemon...

68
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:19,381
Relax.

69
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:24,712
My sister Virginia.

70
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:27,770
Sister? Very nice.

71
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:30,822
I'm Point. This is Diego and Lemon.

72
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:34,290
- This is Navarro.
- We gotta get him some help.

73
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,442
We had some trouble on the road.
We drove over something

74
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,108
- that tore the bottom out of our truck.
- Gutted like a trowel.

75
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:45,291
- If we could just use your phone?
- No phone.

76
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,883
How about a car?

77
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:51,068
We do not care much for
the bonds of modern society.

78
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,003
{\Well,}What are you saying? This is one of
those hippy, grow your own vegetables,

79
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:58,477
smoke a lot of weed,
free love kind of places?

80
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:01,865
Nothing is free.
Your friend is in no shape to travel.

81
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:04,543
- You're welcome to spend the night.
- Thanks. We appreciate it.

82
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:06,685
Get the blankets.
Prepare the guest rooms.

83
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,477
I... could use a little help...

84
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,316
in the barn.

85
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:18,875
I'm all over that.

86
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,863
The reverend was injured.
Lay your friend here.

87
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:54,990
We were riding the river when the bar
ran into a low-hanging branch,

88
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,683
and it just... It broke
right through his chest.

89
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:01,229
What were you doing
on the river this time of year?

90
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:03,921
Just... lookin' for thrills.

91
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:06,455
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

92
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:08,964
Our people have lived here a long time.

93
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:12,717
- We know how to take care of ourselves.
- Well, the graveyard looks pretty full

94
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:14,902
for people who know how
to take care of themselves.

95
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:16,953
Life here is not easy.

96
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,665
Put your hands here.

97
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,943
- Where are you from?
- California.

98
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:40,831
I've read books about California.

99
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:44,834
- They say the sun always shines there.
- Most of the time.

100
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:49,570
I would like to see the ocean one day.
Must be impressive.

101
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:52,363
You mean, you've never seen the ocean?

102
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:56,135
- I've never been outside these walls.
- OK, come on. You must have been to...

103
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,486
to a movie or to a neighbor's house.
{\or, I mean,}There must have been somewhere.

104
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:01,685
You should go back inside
and get some food.

105
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:05,167
We're not gonna leave him here while
we go inside and fill our stomachs.

106
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,797
You're making me nervous
hovering over me while I work.

107
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:11,177
Besides, the stew is best eaten hot.

108
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,016
OK.

109
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:25,751
- Come get us if you need anything.
- I will.

110
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:11,448
This way.

111
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:19,807
Here.

112
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,519
Your boyfriend's a lucky guy.

113
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,753
No boyfriend.

114
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:35,699
Seriously?

115
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,669
I am... Um.

116
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:44,410
I don't... get out much.

117
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:48,182
Well, this place is kind of remote.

118
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,494
It gets...

119
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:52,436
lonely...

120
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:53,461
at night.

121
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:56,868
It's a good thing we came along, then?

122
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,830
Very... good thing.

123
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,101
I like your style.

124
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,878
Get ready for the ride of your life.

125
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:48,950
Help me.

126
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,227
Virginia, please. Come on, help me.

127
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,061
What are you doing?
No... what are you doing?

128
00:14:58,181 --> 00:14:59,612
You bitch!

129
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,541
Smells good.

130
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:16,747
Thanks.

131
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,676
My name's Lemon...

132
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:24,673
Which is short for Lemuel,
which sucks, but...

133
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,136
it was my grandfather's
name, my father's name.

134
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:30,054
So, I would be technically
Lemuel the third,

135
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,017
so it's just a lot easier to say...

136
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,330
It's... it's Lemon.

137
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:38,172
Thanks.

138
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:39,829
Thanks.

139
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,701
This is really good.

140
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,498
What... what is the meat? Is it...

141
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,983
the beef or lamb or...

142
00:15:58,711 --> 00:15:59,889
Is it rabbit?

143
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,539
You don't think this is squirrel,
do you?

144
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,566
Tara doesn't speak.

145
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:11,261
You can go now.
I'll finish up here.

146
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,507
Oh, could you tell her
that I liked the stew?

147
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:15,557
Her hearing is fine.

148
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:22,945
- How is Navarro doing?
- He has lost much blood,

149
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:25,749
but I believe he will be fine.

150
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:32,035
So, I was wondering, how do you guys
survive out here without electricity?

151
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,830
I don't know what I'd do without
my flat screen and my madden 08.

152
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,792
This is the way we have always lived.

153
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:40,663
But you don't have any
dial-up or anything?

154
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,879
- Or are you amish?
- Lemon...

155
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:44,688
Something like that.

156
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,803
I'm gonna take some of
this stew out to Navarro.

157
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:50,809
Not now.

158
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:54,768
He's sleeping.

159
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:57,932
He's sleeping?

160
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,145
Yes.

161
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:01,356
The herbs made him drowsy.

162
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,484
The best medicine is for him to rest.

163
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,653
He can eat later.

164
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:09,891
You're right.

165
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:15,244
I'm just gonna take this out to him...
so it'll be there when he wakes up.

166
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,036
- Lemon, go find Diego.
- Why can't we just finish...

167
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,754
Lemon, do what I tell you.

168
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:33,313
Navarro?

169
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:36,454
Navarro, you're awake?

170
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:54,568
Hello?

171
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:57,011
Hello!

172
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:13,720
- What is that?
- Morte.

173
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,109
I'm gonna get you out of here.

174
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:31,794
Leave me!

175
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,494
<i>Anybody out there!</i>

176
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,904
<i>Hey!</i>

177
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,353
<i>I mean, somebody help me!</i>

178
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,061
<i>Hello! Down here!</i>

179
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,178
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

180
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,017
What the...

181
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:04,047
Help me! Somebody help me!

182
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,069
Chelsea!

183
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:14,883
What the hell did you do to him?

184
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:17,268
Killing me will not save you.

185
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,600
I'm sorry. It is too late.

186
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,286
What? For what?
What are you talking about?

187
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:25,014
What the hell is out there?

188
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:30,106
Something in that infirmary
killed Navarro and the reverend.

189
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:32,025
The reverend is dead?

190
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:34,777
What's out there?

191
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,015
I gotta find my brother.

192
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,969
Point, don't go back out there!

193
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,115
Diego!

194
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:53,915
Diego!

195
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:56,636
Where the hell are you?

196
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:29,130
Hello?

197
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:32,930
I came to get more
kerosene for the lanterns.

198
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,879
It promises to be a very cold night.

199
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:43,816
Virginia...

200
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,807
Have you...

201
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,409
you seen Diego...

202
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:49,610
anywhere?

203
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:52,852
No?

204
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,551
Virginia, that's a nice name.

205
00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:02,157
Funny story, my name's
not actually Lemon.

206
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:03,788
It's Lemuel.

207
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:06,659
It was my grandfather's name
and my father's name.

208
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:09,248
So I would be Lemuel
the third, but that...

209
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:12,115
I think Lemon is sexy.

210
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:18,114
You mean like, uh...

211
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,475
The name...

212
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:22,903
or me?

213
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:24,803
Both.

214
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:29,866
Well, what are we gonna do about that?

215
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,695
I have an idea.

216
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,762
I think...

217
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,464
I think you're going to like it.

218
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,041
Well, I'm sure whatever...

219
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,328
it is, I'm all for it.

220
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:33,124
Help!

221
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,470
Help!

222
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,251
Help!

223
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,457
I am so sorry.

224
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:53,736
So sorry.

225
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:11,565
Please take him into your kingdom.

226
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,832
Allow him to live in your presence,

227
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:19,126
and bask in the warmth of your light.

228
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:25,967
Receive his spirit.

229
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:31,763
Cleanse his body... and his soul.

230
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:37,163
And deliver him from evil.

231
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,541
What the hell...

232
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:02,761
Damn it!

233
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:05,918
Damn it!

234
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:13,282
Hello?

235
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:16,254
Hello!

236
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,505
Somebody there, hello?!

237
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:24,933
Hello, can you hear me?!

238
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:39,023
Oh, thank god!

239
00:26:39,143 --> 00:26:40,266
I swear the...

240
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:03,001
Help!

241
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:05,895
Point!

242
00:27:11,774 --> 00:27:12,546
Help!

243
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:22,207
Tara!

244
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:24,529
Tar... Tara, thank god!

245
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,846
Come here. Come here, it's OK.

246
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,568
Come here, just come
over here and help me down.

247
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:35,414
Look, I... I have no... idea
how I got here, but...

248
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:38,814
I... the last thing
I remember was virginia, and...

249
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:42,913
Tara, just please
come... come help me down, OK?

250
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:46,768
You know, I really, I liked your stew.

251
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:50,494
It was... it was really nice of you to,

252
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:52,757
to feed us and everything.

253
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:57,043
Just, Tara, please,
I can't feel my feet,

254
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:00,389
so if you could come over
here and help me down...

255
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:04,225
There you go. That's it, OK.

256
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:05,808
The joke's over.

257
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:08,145
Just... just cut the rope, OK?

258
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:10,980
What are you doing?

259
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:14,022
Tara, what...

260
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:17,713
What?

261
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:19,972
Tara, please...

262
00:28:21,756 --> 00:28:24,833
Please! Please, just let me go! Please!

263
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,198
What...

264
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:31,227
What was that?

265
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,481
No, no, no, please!

266
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:37,142
Please, Tara, no! You gotta help me!

267
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:41,695
Please, Tara, no!

268
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:45,168
Lemon!

269
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:55,382
Lemon, you with me?

270
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,127
I'm comin', Lemon.

271
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:02,334
Lemon!

272
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:06,527
Hold on, man.

273
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:10,496
I got you, Lemon, I got you.

274
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:11,880
I got you.

275
00:30:12,223 --> 00:30:13,982
I got you, hold on.

276
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:17,373
I got you, I got you.

277
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:02,864
You're gonna be OK, man.
You hear me? You're gonna be OK.

278
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:05,431
Stay with me. Come on, stay with me.

279
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:07,241
I got you, I got you.

280
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:09,295
I got you, all right?

281
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,923
Here you go. Come on. I got you.

282
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,308
I got you, I got you.

283
00:31:14,428 --> 00:31:17,921
OK, look at me. Look at me.
Don't you go to sleep, you hear me?

284
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:19,800
Don't you go to sleep on me!

285
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:23,169
You're gonna be OK. All right?

286
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,542
You'll be OK.

287
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:27,222
Come on! Don't you go to sleep!

288
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:43,355
Get away from him!

289
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:45,156
- What happened?
- What have you done?

290
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,618
Bullets are useless against it.

291
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:52,205
Nine millimeter hollow points,
15 rounds per second,

292
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:56,629
I'll cut that thing to ribbons. See him
try to fight me without a damn head!

293
00:31:57,954 --> 00:32:00,531
I said stay away from him!

294
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:04,237
No more games.

295
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:07,220
It's time for answers.

296
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,180
What is that thing?

297
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:13,367
Diego's missing, my brother is dying.

298
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:16,353
The preacher and your sister
are already dead!

299
00:32:16,473 --> 00:32:18,332
Tara! What happened to her?

300
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:20,448
I saw the... the... license
plates in the yard,

301
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:23,684
- I saw that spike in the road!
- What did you do to our little sister?

302
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:25,836
You bring people here and you what?

303
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:27,907
You feed them to that thing?

304
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,113
- Tara is dead.
- She's dead, all right.

305
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:34,967
You must listen.

306
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:39,679
Your brother was bitten. You have
no choice but to kill him before...

307
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,420
- Kill my brother?
- It's too late.

308
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,786
He will become like the creature
unless he dies by fire.

309
00:32:43,906 --> 00:32:45,758
A stake through the heart, or...

310
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,510
We chop off his head.

311
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:51,131
What... what are you saying?

312
00:32:52,683 --> 00:32:55,839
You're saying that thing
is... is a vampire?

313
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,772
You're saying my brother is a vampire?

314
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:03,401
Not yet.

315
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:08,525
Come on.

316
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,155
Hey, hey, hey.

317
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:14,704
OK, come on, come on.
Lean up, lean up, breathe.

318
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:18,222
Look at me. Come on Lemon,
come on, look at me.

319
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:20,722
Breathe, you gonna be OK.

320
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:24,039
When our people came here from romania,

321
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,273
the creature hid among them.

322
00:33:28,246 --> 00:33:30,887
They built this fort away
from others to keep it in.

323
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,017
- As long as we supply it with food...
- You mean humans.

324
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:37,597
Stays here with us.

325
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:40,702
Do you think we want this burden?

326
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,608
We have dedicated our lives to saving
a world we've never even seen.

327
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:49,989
We know what we do is wrong,
but what choice do we have?

328
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:51,672
Kill the son of a bitch.

329
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,797
Over the years, many have
tried, none have succeeded.

330
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,968
- Many?
- We're the only ones who remain.

331
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:01,501
What... what... what
about that preacher?

332
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:03,795
He was our father.

333
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,329
A vampire was feeding
off of him until...

334
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,901
Until fresh blood arrived.

335
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,347
You sold out your own father?

336
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:14,450
He made the sacrifice for us.

337
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:16,105
I bet.

338
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:19,590
I can't... I can't see anything.

339
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:23,690
I am sorry for your brother,
but there is no other way.

340
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:28,361
It's OK... Lemon, look at me.

341
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:30,947
- You stay with me, you hear me?
- Point...

342
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:33,805
Thanks for letting me come, OK?

343
00:34:37,557 --> 00:34:40,867
Come on, Lemon. Come on.
Look at me. Look at me, Lemon.

344
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:43,376
Just breathe, OK? Come on.

345
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:44,970
Come on, Lemon.

346
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:48,799
Lemon, Lemon, come on!

347
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,441
Come on, don't you die on me,
don't you die on me!

348
00:34:57,425 --> 00:35:00,710
- Point, there's no time to waste.
- Back off! You back off!

349
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:13,930
Stop!

350
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:20,747
Lemon! Lemon, don't!

351
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:12,014
You know what you must do.

352
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:14,603
I can't.

353
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,103
It's him!

354
00:36:23,897 --> 00:36:25,212
He smells the blood.

355
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:28,996
Where is he?

356
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,071
We gotta get out of here.

357
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:44,539
Take me to the barn.

358
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:46,123
I won't let you.

359
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,291
Help me!

360
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:48,514
We gotta go.

361
00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:58,937
Come on! Let's go, let's go, come on!

362
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:08,798
Go, go, go!

363
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:04,408
Oh, damn it.

364
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,248
What is that? What are you doing?

365
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,154
What we must.

366
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:13,586
Is it a trap?

367
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:40,312
No!

368
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:49,009
- I love you!
- I love you!

369
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,325
Chelsea, Chelsea, we need to go.

370
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:04,695
We need to go.

371
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:07,531
We're gonna burn it.

372
00:40:07,651 --> 00:40:09,118
Punch it in, use the axe.
