Eddie?

The electricity is out again.

6
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,059
What's going on with all the sirens?

7
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,865
Did I do something stupid last night?
I can't remember anything.

8
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,829
Wake up! Open the door.

9
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,419
Mrs. Pribble?

Hello?

The power is out again.

12

Mrs. Pribble, it's Helen,
Eddie's roommate.

This is James.
Do what you do after the beep.

24
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,006
James, it's Helen.
I know it's the middle of the night.

25
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,320
Something is happening.
I don't know what is going on.

26
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:43,553
There's blood everywhere.
I can't find Eddie.

27
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,409
I love you.

28
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:05,588
Hello?

29
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:10,569
Who's there?

30
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,011
So, that was your brother?

31
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:50,792
He was really sick,
and the doctors just couldn't help him.

32
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,392
He looks pretty cool.

33
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,730
Yeah, he was pretty cool,
kind of like you.

{\a6}<i>Yesterday, New Year's Eve</i>

35
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:59,607
Kevin, your mom is looking for you.

36
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,901
Are you guys going to a party tonight?

37
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:04,024
I don't know.

38
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:04,862
Are we?

39
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:07,618
I'll see you next year.

40
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,100
Yeah. I hear your mom calling.
You better get going.

41
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:18,960
I think your tarantula is dead.

42
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:21,099
That's perfect.

43
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,320
All right, buddy.
You have a good night, man.

44
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,140
Bye.

45
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,232
So, why aren't you dressed?

46
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:35,509
- I am.
- Yeah.

47
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:38,813
It's still, like, a
half-hour to the barn.

48
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,805
We're gonna be late.

49
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:43,009
Whatever.

50
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,777
Come on.

51
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:48,573
It's my job to take
your mind off things.

52
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,349
So, get up.

53
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,412
You make it sound like
remembering him was a bad thing.

54
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:58,823
No.

55
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:00,570
It's not a bad thing.

56
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,430
- You just can't...
- mourn my brother?

57
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:09,911
No, um, stop living your own life.

58
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,471
It's time to have some fun again.{\It's time you started having
some fun again.}

59
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:14,754
But he was the only one
I had left of them,

60
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:16,809
and now everyone I love is dead.

61
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,359
I just...

62
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,898
I just can't help
but sometimes want to...

63
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,817
James will be there tonight.

64
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:26,093
So?

65
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,738
Don't "so" me.
I know how you feel about him.

66
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:32,509
And... I know how he feels about you.

67
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,745
- He said something?
- Yeah.

68
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:39,425
Well, no.
But, I mean, you can see it in,

69
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:43,069
the way that he looks at you.

70
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:46,007
Listen.

71
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,258
We are going to this party.

72
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,573
It's up to you if you're wearing that...

73
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
or this.

74
00:09:58,955 --> 00:09:59,945
Chrissy...

75
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,190
What the hell is going on?

76
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,981
Where are you? Are you OK?

77
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,026
No, I'm not OK.
I'm at home.

78
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,947
I... It's breaking up.
Have you looked at the news reports?

79
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,157
Yeah, I heard something.
I don't know.

80
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,443
OK. I...

81
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:17,514
Listen.
There's something really major going on.

82
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:20,717
You need to come to James' place.
It's safe here.

83
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:23,319
Listen...

84
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,837
I'm really...
I'm really sorry about earlier.

85
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:28,749
I mean that, OK?

86
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,885

89
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,073
Mrs. Pribble, what's going on?

90
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,344
There's blood everywhere.

91
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:09,064
Eddie, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

92
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,567
We gotta go. We gotta go, OK?

93
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:15,548
My God. Oh, my God.
There's blood all over you.

94
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,954
Eddie, come on. Come on.

95
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,537
No. No!

96
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,799
Somebody help me!

97
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:50,469
No!

98
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,440
No!

Please... help me.

105
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,680
Oh, God, OK. It's OK.

106
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,230
You're gonna be OK, OK?
You're gonna be OK. Let's go.

107
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,430
I'm gonna take you to
my boyfriend's house.

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,550
Please.

109
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:18,270
OK, you're gonna be OK.
Come on. Come on.

110
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,328
It's OK.
Stay with me.

111
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:28,060
God.

112
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,628
Hello?

113
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:42,550
Eddie and I are just about ready to go,
and we'll swing by and pick you up?

114
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:45,050
No, it's OK. I'll just meet you there.

115
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,506
I thought that you didn't want
to take your own car

116
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:49,516
in case you met someone and got lucky.

117
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,501
Actually, I called a cab.

118
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:54,180
In fact, I think I hear him
outside now. So...

119
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,189
a cab?

120
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:58,233
It's gonna be a great party, OK?
I'll just meet you there.

121
00:14:58,395 --> 00:14:59,145
Yeah.

122
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,219
God, please.

123
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,651
Oh, my God.

124
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,127
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

125
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,007
Hello?

126
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,626
- Bitch, I want your car.
- No, please.

127
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,915
You understand what I'm saying?
Give me your damn keys.

128
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:28,908
I'll take you wherever you want to go.
I'll take you. I really gotta...

129
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:40,419
What the hell?

130
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:49,834
Give me the damn keys.

131
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,496
My leg! Get off!

132
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,231
Hey, guys, where have you been?

133
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,642
Major jam up by the plant.
The police are rerouting traffic.

134
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:48,240
What happened
to the broken-down limoexcuse?

135
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,531
OK, doesn't matter. Let's go
get you guys some champagne.

136
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,560
OK.

137
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,167
- Hit me with 2 bubblies.
- You got it.

138
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:05,570
This place is pretty cool, Chrissy.

139
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,750
You do realize we're in a barn.

140
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:12,386
Have you seen James?
He's supposed to be here.

141
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:14,889
No idea.

142
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:17,612
All right. Who wants to dance?

143
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:18,748
Come on.

144
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,810
No?

145
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,240
Right.
Yeah, this is awkward.

146
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,539
I'll just go dance with myself.
You two talk.

147
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,583
So, how are you? Really?

148
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,420
Come on.
It's new year's.

149
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,762
Don't worry about it.
Just be happy.

150
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,845
All right, come on.

151
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,159
Excuse us.

152

159
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,325
<i>In the meantime, they are asking
people to avoid the east side of town...</i>

160
00:19:22,664 --> 00:19:24,917
I'm sorry I haven't really
been there for you.

161
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,721
It's OK.

162
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,570
I'm fine, really.

163
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,409
I'm OK.

164
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,441
Remember when you used to cry

165
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,750
whenever my mother
would pick me up from your place?

166
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,130
Yeah. I was 4 years old.

167
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,240
Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying.
We've been friends for a long time.

168
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,232
And...

169
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:44,353
I know we've drifted apart.

170
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,480
But I love you.
You're like a sister to me.

171
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,124
And I promise I'm gonna try and...

172
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:53,575
you are the only

173
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:56,155
real friend left in my life.

174
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:57,684
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

175
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:01,120
I mean, look around. Do you really
think I fit in with that crowd in there?

176
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,210
- Who cares if you don't fit in?
- I've never fit in anywhere.

177
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,323
Those girls in there are wearing masks.

178
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:07,950
They don't even know who they are.

179
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,170
You do. You're unique. You're special.

180
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,798
But guys are attracted
to women like that...

181
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,060
I don't know, women
who don't really have...

182
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,972
any real feelings that might
complicate a relationship

183
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,900
and that somehow can always smile,

184
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:27,650
regardless of
what is tearing them up inside.

185
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,023
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.

186
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm just saying that you're the only
person that really likes me for me.

187
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:38,048
And I cannot even tell you
how much I love you for that.

188
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:41,160
I'm sure I'm not the only
person here that likes you.

189
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,489
I'm gonna go find James.

190
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,682
<i>The exposure
to the ash is hazardous and...</i>

191
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,100
- James...
- Helen, it's...

192
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:18,172
- What is going on?
- Helen, is that you?

193
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,072
What?
James, I can't hear you.

194
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:22,843
- <i>I can't make out what you're saying.</i>
- Chrissy told me to come

195
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:24,513
- <i>to visit.</i>
- If you can hear me,

196
00:22:24,674 --> 00:22:26,722
- <i>don't go anywhere near them.</i>
- What?

197
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:29,204
You have to stay inside your apartment.

198
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:31,505
- James, I can't hear you.
- Helen...

199
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:34,188
What? I can't understand
what you're saying.

200
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,400
James, I said I'm coming over.

201
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:37,526
Listen...

202
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,288
There's something wrong with the phone.

203
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,751
God, I love you.

204
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:20,622
I... tried calling you.
I thought you said

205
00:23:20,742 --> 00:23:23,947
- you were gonna call before.
- Yeah. My phone died.

206
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:25,202
Sorry.

207
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,958
I'm sorry. My...

208
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,027
I'm sorry! My cell phone sucks.

209
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:31,895
I suck, OK?

210
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,950
I got busy, and then...

211
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,378
and then I was late,
and that's why I didn't call you.

212
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:43,236
But look, I promise
I'm not avoiding you. OK?

213
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,331
- You OK?
- What?

214
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,353
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

215
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,938
You don't look OK.

216
00:23:57,592 --> 00:23:59,701
- I'm fine.
- All right.

217
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:01,849
Let's get that drink. Come on.

218
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:05,997
Can we...

219
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,140
So, I'm sorry.
I just really don't like dancing.

220
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:14,926
It's fine.

221
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:18,533
- Eddie was telling me...
- Really? What did...

222
00:24:18,653 --> 00:24:20,462
What did he have to say?

223
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:23,548
He was just talking about relationships.

224
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:27,968
What would he know about relationships?
Has he ever been in one?

225
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,233
He wasn't talking about himself.

226
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:32,641
He was talking about,
you know, me and you.

227
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:34,834
Really?

228
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:40,093
And I know that it hasn't really been
that long, but...

229
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:43,240
but you're just...
one of the few people that

230
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,736
really understands me.

231
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,697
You're not that complicated.

232
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:55,915
I love you.

233
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:02,493
I know, I said it.
It's out there, I love you.

234
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:05,419
You do?

235
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,552
Look, I know I've been
outside of myself, but...

236
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:14,254
Look. You say that I never take chances.

237
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:20,979
What was that?

238
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:24,776
I'll be back.

239
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:53,802
We're gonna make it...

240
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:56,436
I promise you.

241
00:25:57,344 --> 00:25:58,514
We'll make it.

242
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:01,276
Wait!

243
00:26:01,848 --> 00:26:03,732
We've got to hide. Yes.

244
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:06,355
Wait!

245
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,546
You can't leave me.

246
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:44,176
I can't do this without you.

247
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:47,275
You have to be strong.

248
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,817
I'm so sorry.

249
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:19,316
Nothing to be sorry for.

250
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,060
We've had a good life.

251
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:24,112
It's not fair

252
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,214
that it ends this way.

253
00:27:27,198 --> 00:27:28,854
We can't choose

254
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,185
the way we leave this earth.

255
00:27:32,404 --> 00:27:34,114
But I can make sure that

256
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:36,658
you don't become

257
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,145
one of them.

258
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:42,998
Oh, God, my angel.

259
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,314
Do it quickly, Richard.

260
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:47,600
Get away!

261
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:53,410
What did you do?

262
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:55,468
Get away from us.

263
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,122
You did this!

264
00:27:58,781 --> 00:27:59,924
It was you!

265
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:02,511
You

266
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,478
did this to my wife!

267
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,313
You did this to her!

268
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:11,499
<i>It was you... all the time, you!</i>

269
00:28:12,188 --> 00:28:13,306
<i>You did it!</i>

270
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:15,576
<i>You did this!</i>

271
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,536
<i>I know what you did.</i>

272
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,493
<i>I know what you did.</i>

273
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:19,475
<i>4! 3!</i>

274
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:21,501
<i>2! 1!</i>

275
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:23,682
Happy new year!

276
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,010
Happy new year.

277
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:45,972
Have you seen James?

278
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,603
Come with me. I want
to tell you something.

279
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:02,065
<i>Action news has just learned from police
that despite earlier reports</i>

280
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:05,993
<i>from the fire at Compton Chemical,
there is no evidence of fatalities.</i>

281
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,211
<i>No one, it seems, has died.</i>

282
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:12,166
<i>However, we just spoke to
an eye witness who told us he saw</i>

283
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,250
<i>3 horribly disfigured plant...</i>

284
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,002
What do you think is going on?

285
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:18,721
Beats the hell out of me.

286
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:22,600
<i>A spokes person for compton
chemical is calling that report...</i>

287
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:26,346
Anyway, back to James.
Have you seen him at all?

288
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:29,478
He was somewhere over there.

289
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,936
He could be anywhere. I don't know.

290
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,129
I'm gonna go find him.

291
00:31:40,094 --> 00:31:43,196
Why don't you just forget about James?

292
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:46,866
Because I told him...
I told him that I loved him.

293
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,869
- You what?
- You said that he loved me...

294
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:53,030
- No, I... I never said he loved you.
- Yes, you did.

295
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:58,419
I said that I knew how
he felt about you, but...

296
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:03,007
damn it. James doesn't love you.

297
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:05,802
What?

298
00:32:05,963 --> 00:32:08,137
I just couldn't stand
to see you hurting like that.

299
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,640
Like what?

300
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:13,183
- What are you talking about?
- You really don't get it?

301
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:15,451
No. Stop playing games with me.

302
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:24,720
Before you say anything,
just please hear me out.

303
00:32:25,024 --> 00:32:27,824
James wants someone
who's like everyone else.

304
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:28,980
But you...

305
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:30,594
thank God...

306
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:32,412
you're so different.

307
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:35,177
Just stop it.

308
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:52,853
Oh, my God.

309
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:15,709
<i>Dozens of reports of infected people
savagely attacking victims</i>

310
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,650
<i>with the intent to kill...</i>

311
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,522
<i>in some cases, to eat.</i>

312
00:33:20,219 --> 00:33:23,254
<i>Avoid contact with these

313
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:31,140
- <i>Do you read?</i>
- Officer?

314
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,001
- <i>Are you there, officer Greenwood?</i>
- Officer? My God, I need your help.

315
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:42,730
OK, we gotta get out of the city.

316
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,452
- Officer? Officer?
- And go where?

317
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,028
I don't know.
Someplace away from these freaks.

318
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:52,951
Help me! No!

319
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:05,549
<i>If you're just joining us now,</i>

320
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,917

<i>Repeat. Avoid direct contact

323
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:19,792
<i>Again...</i>

324
00:34:36,794 --> 00:34:40,308
- But will you listen to me, please?
- No, I can't, I can't.

325
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:46,590
Don't walk away.

326
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,084
<i>Helen, wait!</i>

327
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,176
- Where is James?
- Helen...

328
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:53,085
Where is James?

329
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,988
- Oh, James!
- What?

330
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,040
Helen, please... James!

331
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,160
- What?
- Oh, my God.

332
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,788
What are you shouting at?

333
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:06,892
Oh, my God!

334
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:40,660
<i>Helen, wait!</i>

335
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:36,236
Looks like the power is out... again.

336
00:38:43,594 --> 00:38:45,080
Don't be mad at me.

337
00:39:05,465 --> 00:39:07,180
Oh, man. You are wasted.

338
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:09,306
Listen.

339
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,359
Hopefully, you don't remember, but I...

340
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:19,226
You OK?

341
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,878
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

342
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,690
7, 8, 9, 10.

343
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,172
Helen, breathe!

344
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:46,687
Hold on. Hold on.

345
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:58,519
What are you doing here?

346
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:01,983
What happened to you?

347
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:16,504
She's one of them.

348
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,101
She's one of them...

349
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,713
and has been all night.

350
00:40:24,585 --> 00:40:26,551
I can't make out what you're saying.

351
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:33,476
Get away! You did this!

352
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:40,416
