10
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:47,660
- Morning, Dennis.
- Morning.

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,094
- Kathy.
- Reverend

12
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:51,160
I can't tell you
how pleased I am to hear

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,244
you'll be making pancakes again
this year at the church breakfast.

14
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:56,618
Well, I had to, reverend.
You're my number 1 fan.

15
00:00:56,738 --> 00:00:58,280
Oh, you bet.
What's the secret?

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,646
No. Don't.

17
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:00,734
Ice cream!

18
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:01,959
Courtney!

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,959
Come on.
You gotta be kidding me!

20
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,021
Can we go with Spencer
and get donuts?

21
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:07,732
Oh. Sure. But just one.

22
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,538
- OK. You want to go?
- Yeah. Let's go.

23
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:10,594
Ice cream?

24
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:14,506
Yeah. It's in the batter.
It's an old family secret.

25
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,676
Oh, from your lips to God's ears.

26
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:18,615
See you next sunday.

27
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,041
I can't believe...

28
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,647
Hey, dad.
You want to play catch?

29
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:31,330
Uh, sure if it's still
light out when I get back. Yeah.

30
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,839
Do you really have to go into the office
again? It's 3 sundays in a row.

31
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:37,441
Honey, I have 6 hours
worth of numbers to crunch

32
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:39,018
and a 9 am deadline.
So...

33
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:40,867
- I know.
- I know.

34
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:45,232
Somebody's got to pay for
this beautiful house, right?

35
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:47,703
Be back as soon
as I can. Promise.

36
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:50,488
I'm going to color
a picture for you, daddy.

37
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:53,285
And I can't wait
to see it, punkin.

38
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:58,118
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

39
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,211
- See you later.
- Bye.

40
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,045
Hey, honey. What's up?

41
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:29,235
Would you mind stopping by Rigo's and
picking me up some milk for tomorrow?

42
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:31,529
Sure. Anything else?

43
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,524
Kids can you turn that down, please?
Mommy's on the phone.

44
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:37,189
Hey, do you want the big one
or the little one?

45
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:44,717
Dennis?

46
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:05,420
Dennis?

47
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:07,585
Dennis, what happened?

48
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,530
Dennis, pick up the phone.

49
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,054

Kathy?

54
00:03:56,443 --> 00:03:57,143
Sean?

55
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:02,839
Courtney?

56
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:04,979
Courtney?!
Hey, come here babe.

57
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:06,316
Come here.

58
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:08,691
Hey, sweetie. Hi.

59
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,445
Tell mommy I'm OK.
All right? Tell mom... Tell...

60
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,372
She can't hear you, bro?

61
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:42,676
She can't see you
either.

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,039
You're dead.

63
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,292
We both are.

64
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,595
No.

65
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,308
Come here.

66
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:24,689
Shot my ass good.

67
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,602
Look at all that blood.

68
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:42,237
This can't be happening.

69
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,015
See ya in hell, amigo.

70
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,890
I see we're awake.

71
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,603
- Where am I?
- County general.

72
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,397
Where's my family?

73
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:10,757
Your family?

74
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,193
You don't have a family. Unless
you count the ones you slaughtered.

75
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:16,439
Where am I?

76
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,039
Kathleen!

77
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:21,669
- Courtney!
- Settle down Brodigan.

81
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:24,205
Mr. Brodigan,

82
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:28,701
I'm your, uh, court-appointed attorney.
John Meere.

83
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:33,400
I just have a few forms for your
review before we get started.

84
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:35,874
Listen to me.
My name's not Richard Brodigan.

85
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:38,844
I'm Dennis Mahoney. And I'm a v. p.
in the mortgage trust department

86
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,551
at first world savings bank.

87
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:45,433
As I was saying,
you need to sign these forms.

88
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,971
They say I'll be representing you
on 26 counts of capital murder.

89
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:51,033
- 19 counts of kidnapping...
- No.

90
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:53,013
19 counts of unlawful restraint

91
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:56,105
- and false imprisonment.
- No. No. I'm not this man.

92
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,518
Saying this is not you?

93
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:17,615
- Ice cream!
- You wanna play catch?

94
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,217
I was driving my car.
Driving my car.

95
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:27,624
There was an accident.

96
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:30,221
There was an accident,
and I was in the emergency room.

97
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,046
What happened?

98
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,477
I must of...

99
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:36,347
What?

100
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:37,979
Died.

101
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:41,130
I must have died.

102
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,770
And when I woke up,
I was...

103
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:47,853
I wasn't in my own body.
I was in this body.

104
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:50,506
Brodigan's body.

105
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:56,555
I know it...
It sounds crazy.

106
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:01,736
All things considered,
I would say

107
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:05,577
spiritual transmigration
is stunningly crappy defense.

108
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:07,999
Richard...

109
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:09,781
Please,
don't call me that.

110
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,504
OK. Dennis.

111
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,538
Look, county sheriff
jumped the gun.

112
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:20,524
They've been under intense pressure
to make an arrest in this case. And...

113
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:21,535
as of now,

114
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:23,978
all they have on you is
a single shoeprint

115
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,824
and the testimony of
a 3 year old eyewitness.

116
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:28,946
Everything else is circumstantial.

117
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,115
- I'm innocent.
- Good. Fine.

118
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,417
You're innocent.
But you got baggage.

119
00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:38,394
The d.a.'s gonna move to include
your juvenile record into evidence.

120
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,800
Try to establish a pattern
that speaks to motive.

121
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,084
What juvenile record?

122
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,352
You murdered your entire
family when you were 12.

123
00:09:46,472 --> 00:09:48,863
- Mother. Father. 2 sisters.
- No.

124
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,426
You need to focus.

125
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:53,940
If we can alibi you for
even one of the abductions,

126
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,303
I'm trying to tell you
we can beat this thing.

127
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:58,476
Now please, Richard.

128
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:03,191
I need you to sign these forms
so I can begin to help you.

129
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,175
My name is not
Richard Brodigan!

130
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,684
I am not the family man!

131
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,540
My name is Mahoney!
I have a wife.

132
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,987
Her name is Kathleen.

133
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:12,627
- I'm trying...
- ... I have 2 children.

134
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:14,860
Please!

135
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,033
Check it out!
Check the hospital records!

136
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,272
Everything
I'm telling you is true!

137
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,167
You're the big,
bad family man, huh?

138
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:23,950
Genuine celebrity.

139
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,721
Actually I'm a little disappointed.
I thought you'd be taller, scarier.

140
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,451
You're a real bad man, huh?

141
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:40,189
They say you've been shot,

142
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,852
stabbed.

143
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,653
You just keep on coming.

144
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:47,115
So what are you,
family man?

145
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:49,961
Indestructible?

146
00:10:52,148 --> 00:10:54,464
Personally,
I don't believe it.

147
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:56,967
I think you feel pain.

148
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,132
Huh, you weenie.

149
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:02,581
Just like everybody else.

150
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:06,419
- Listen, I don't belong in here.
- Shut up!

151
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,040
My God!
Don't you feel anything? Freak.

152
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,390
Inmate, hands through the slot.

153
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:04,010
You've got a visitor,
family man.

154
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:06,437
- My lawyer?
- No. Personal.

155
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,091
Sit.

156
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:21,410
What the hell?

157
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:23,746
Who are you?

158
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,056
You know who I am,
Dennis?

159
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,708
We met
in the emergency room.

160
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:31,757
Remember,

161
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:33,135
<i>amigo?</i>

162
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:35,496
Brodigan.

163
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:40,349
I want to be able to
tell you that I'm sorry

164
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,432
for the way that things
turned out for you, but...

165
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:48,673
it's God's will.

166
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:50,011
You gotta accept that.

167
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:56,098
You're wearing my suit?

168
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,456
I didn't think
you'd mind...

169
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,930
Under the circumstances.

170
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,219
You got some nice stuff
in your closet.

171
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:07,978
Not...

172
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,240
my style, but...

173
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,003
I'll get used to it.

174
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:14,880
You were in my house?

175
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:18,324
- My family? What have you done?
- Easy, Dennis.

176
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,177
I swear to God,
if you touch my family...

177
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,114
I'm not gonna hurt 'em.

178
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,892
I would never hurt them.

179
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:28,588
They're a beautiful family.

180
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,892
You don't know
how lucky you are...

181
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:38,527
Your wife, your kids.

182
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:41,978
They love you.
Everyone... They look up to you.

183
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,910
- Even people at the bank.
- You've been to my job.

184
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,582
You can't just take over.

185
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:51,804
We'll see.

186
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:58,327
I'm gonna come back here
regular.

187
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,495
I'm gonna teach you...
Help you...

188
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:04,281
How to get along on the inside.

189
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,968
And you are gonna teach me

190
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:10,964
how to get along
on the outside.

191
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:12,562
You're crazy.

192
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,445
I'm not gonna help you.

193
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:19,247
OK.

194
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:23,741
But I'm the only connection
to your family...

195
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,317
That you're ever gonna have.

196
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:30,571
You want me to go?

197
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,696
I know it sucks for you.

198
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,195
You're innocent.

199
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,831
But even if they kill you...

200
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,691
You get your redemption.

201
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:48,593
Me?

202
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,531
This is my chance at redemption.

203
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:58,184
Understand?

204
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:05,127
So...

205
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:10,055
I'm gonna come back
in a couple of days.

206
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:11,552
Don't worry.

207
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,420
Everything's
gonna be fine.

208
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:18,574
I'm gonna take care of...
our family.

209
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:21,340
I'm gonna protect them.

210
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:25,859
And I am gonna
love them...

211
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:30,770
Just like you would.

212
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:36,739
Good times.

213
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,519
Did you check out
the things I told you?

214
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,158
We have a serious problem.

215
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,238
What? Did you check
with the hospital?

216
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,543
- They found the tapes.
- What tapes?

217
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,754
In the storage locker
you rented in Cleveland.

218
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:06,861
Videotapes of you raping,
torturing, and

219
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:08,699
murdering the victims.

220
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:11,039
Entire families,
one by one.

221
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,047
I gotta get out of here.

222
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:19,479
If you trust me
and you work with me,

223
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:22,318
I can possibly save your life.

224
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,728
We have one hail mary play.

225
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:28,483
And that's to plead you out
to a life sentence in exchange

226
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:30,653
for cooperation with the state.

227
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:33,636
- What kind of cooperation?
- A full confession.

228
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,414
And they want to know
what you did with the bodies.

229
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:38,463
A full confession?
I have no idea!

230
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:41,662
I don't know about any bodies.
I didn't kill anybody!

231
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,367
Please just hear my out, OK.

232
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,930
Just check out the names. I gave
you the facts and the details.

233
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:54,494
If it doesn't check out, i'll drop
everything. And I'll do it your way.

234
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:56,801
I promise.

235
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,402
I promise.

236
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,884
Come on sleepyhead.

237
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:28,308
You're gonna be late
for church.

238
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,383
Church?

239
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:37,155
<i>Amazing grace</i>

240
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:41,030
<i>how sweet the sound</i>

241
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:46,828
<i>that saved a wretch like me</i>

242
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:52,670
<i>I once was lost</i>

243
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,012
<i>but now I am found</i>

244
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,781
come on, sing.

245
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:59,164
<i>Was blind,</i>

246
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:02,564
<i>but now I see.</i>

247
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,880
It's so good to have you
back, Dennis.

248
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:10,383
- We said a prayer for you.
- Ah, just a little bump on the head.

249
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:13,387
So we can count on you for
the big pancake breakfast?

250
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:15,524
Sure. I love pancakes.

251
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:17,388
Dennis, he means to make them.

252
00:18:17,508 --> 00:18:18,758
Not to eat them.

253
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:22,223
Hey! Excuse me.

254
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,688
- Where are you going with my kids?
- What are you doing?

255
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,614
This punk was taking off with our kids.

256
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,747
That's Spencer. He was
taking them for donuts.

257
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:41,992
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,689
What is wrong with you?

259
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:47,769
I told you. I just didn't
recognize the kid.

260
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:50,772
- You've known him since he was 2.
- I know.

261
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:56,472
Wh... what, Dennis?

262
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,566
There... there are people
out there.

263
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:10,929
Bad people who are waiting
for the moment when you're distracted.

264
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,082
Just one moment.

265
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,027
That's all they need to take your kids.

266
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:19,787
- My kids?
- Our kids. That's all it takes.

267
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,166
- Well, I had my eye on them.
- No. You didn't. You can't.

268
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:26,276
No one can.
Not all the time.

269
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:29,212
And that is where
they get their edge.

270
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,711
Now you think about
someone taking your kids, what once?

271
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:33,831
Twice a day?

272
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,637
That's all he thinks about.

273
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,856
Every minute of every day.

274
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:43,303
And the only time he's
not thinking about it

275
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,483
is when he's already got 'em.

276
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:49,308
'cause then

277
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:52,486
he's thinking of all the horrible things
he's gonna do to them.

278
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,295
Sorry.

279
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,494
Just...

280
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,786
Ever since the accident...

281
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:11,402
I'm so scared of losing you.

282
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:20,809
As long as you're here
with us, we're fine.

283
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:30,593
Hello?

284
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,611
- Who's this?
- Me, punkin. It's your daddy.

285
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:38,683
Daddy?

286
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,908
God...

287
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,618
Yeah baby. It's me.

288
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,711
- I love you so much.
- Here, honey. I got it.

289
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:49,135
Hello?

290
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:52,134
Kathy. It's Dennis.
You gotta listen to me.

291
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:55,671
The man in your house is not me.
You gotta pack the kids and get out.

292
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,056
What's going on?

293
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:58,698
It's that man again.

294
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:01,054
Who is this?

295
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:02,431
You son of a bitch!

296
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,601
You need to stop calling this number,
or I'm gonna contact the police.

297
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,801
What a loon.

298
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,122
Don't worry.
I'll have the number changed.

299
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,158
It's all good.

300
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:32,903
What the hell is your problem?

301
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,456
You're wondering why there's
no other prisoners in here?

302
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,845
'cause we want you
all for ourselves.

303
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:43,297
One of the people that you
killed was named Cherie Davenport.

304
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,720
Remember her?

305
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,637
Pretty little blond.

306
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:49,969
She was my fiance.

307
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,976
- You don't understand.
- You shut up!

308
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:53,420
You shut up!

309
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:55,745
She was out having
dinner with her parents!

310
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:58,868
I couldn't make it
because I had to work late!

311
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:01,559
And then we got the call.

312
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,641
And I was the first one on the scene!

313
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:07,510
And there was so much blood!

314
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:09,328
It wasn't me.

315
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:11,875
You son of a...

316
00:22:16,516 --> 00:22:17,679
Let go.

317
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:18,835
Let go!

318
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:21,843
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Yes, you are.

319
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:35,785
Don't try calling the house again.
I changed the number.

320
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,486
This isn't gonna work. What do you want
me to do about it?

321
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:43,756
You want me
to turn myself in?

322
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:46,401
Hey officer,
this isn't Richard Brodigan.

323
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:48,438
I am. I'm just trapped
in the wrong guy's body.

324
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,208
You think they're gonna buy that?
You think that's gonna work?

325
00:22:52,743 --> 00:22:54,382
Come here.
Come here.

326
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:08,138
You can run.

327
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,411
I got stocks, bonds.

328
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:16,791
You can cash everything out.

329
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:20,787
- Go anywhere in the world.
- Well, who's gonna take care of Kathy

330
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:23,094
- and the kids?
- They can take care of themselves.

331
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:24,894
No, Dennis. They can't.

332
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,379
They need me.

333
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:29,849
They're my responsibility.

334
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:33,472
I'm not gonna abandon them
the way my father abandoned me.

335
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:36,126
Besides...

336
00:23:37,346 --> 00:23:39,023
who's gonna help Sean...

337
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:40,776
with his batting?

338
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:44,176
Someone's gotta make
that kid an all star.

339
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:46,002
And Kathy...

340
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,431
To be honest,

341
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:52,150
I've never been...

342
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:54,607
with a woman like that before.

343
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:56,235
She...

344
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,235
seems...

345
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,160
so shy.

346
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:03,481
But... you get a couple of drinks in...

347
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,759
- Don't even... don't you...
- Sorry.

348
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:07,674
It's uncalled for.

349
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:12,667
Forgive me.

350
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:17,147
I'll tell you what.

351
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,269
Gotta give it to you.

352
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,339
I don't know how you
do that job, man.

353
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,700
That... That...
That... boss of yours.

354
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:28,164
- Gerald.
- Yeah.

355
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,863
I mean, he's always...

356
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:32,695
on me.

357
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:38,002
And I go over... and over

358
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,068
the audit reports.

359
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,525
And it's never... ever...

360
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,239
good enough.

361
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,248
- You're right.
- Right.

362
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:51,655
You're totally right.
Gerald can be a real turd sometimes.

363
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:55,647
The trick is to use his template
and it's all boilerplate.

364
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,056
Hum, you get sally to fill out
the blanks from the monthlies.

365
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:06,591
- She can do that?
- Yeah. It's part of her job.

366
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:07,932
See?

367
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:12,514
This is what I'm talking about.
We can help each other.

368
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:14,230
Yeah. Sure we can.

369
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:19,311
I gotta go.

370
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:23,875
It's Courtney's school play tomorrow.
She's a bumblebee.

371
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:26,167
You... You should see the costume.

372
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:29,187
She's such... a cute kid.

373
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:31,270
So affectionate.

374
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:35,142
Ah, listen to me. I'm sorry.
I'm just going on.

375
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:36,934
Ah, tell you what.

376
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,166
- I'll bring you some video.
- Video?

377
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:40,264
Yeah.

378
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:41,976
Of the play.

379
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,870
Gonna be late.

380
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:46,798
Can't keep the old ball
and chain waiting.

381
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:25,396
Here's the situation, Brodigan.

382
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:29,259
The F.B.I.'s all over my ass
because they want yours.

383
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,511
Just so happens the crimes
you committed were in my jurisdiction.

384
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,569
So I can keep them
at bay for a while. But...

385
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,036
- not forever.
- But I didn't do...

386
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:42,636
Just let me finish.

387
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:47,335
I need to wrap
this investigation up quickly.

388
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:49,421
People in my county...

389
00:26:50,082 --> 00:26:53,907
deserve closure.
That means a proper burial of their kin.

390
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:57,455
For once in your life,
do the right thing.

391
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:00,678
Confess your crimes.

392
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,500
Tell me where the bodies are.

393
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:05,191
In return...

394
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:09,451
I'll personally go to the D.A.
and do my best to get you life.

395
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:12,670
The alternative...
is not nearly as attractive.

396
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,731
- I'm not the one who did it.
- Don't tell me you're innocent.

397
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,472
It insults my intelligence.

398
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:21,696
My offer is only good
until end of day tomorrow.

399
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:26,671
I'll go out for a while.

400
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:44,954
Oh, yeah. She's leaving.

401
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:54,344
No son of mine is gonna play
ball with a glove like that.

402
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:57,150
We just got him that last christmas.

403
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,489
This mitt's OK, dad. Really.

404
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:00,692
No.

405
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,665
No. It's garbage.

406
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:05,558
You need a real mitt so
you won't drop so many balls.

407
00:28:05,678 --> 00:28:07,509
You're embarrassing. Right?

408
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:13,911
What the hell?

409
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,314
- What are you doing?
- That's my spot.

410
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:18,908
We can find another spot.

411
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:21,847
No. He can find another one.
That one's mine.

412
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:28,575
Back in the car. Back in the car.

413
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,370
Hi.

414
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:35,841
- What's your problem?
- Oh, you stole my spot.

415
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:37,946
Your spot? You kidding me?

416
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:41,593
- Move your car.
- Or what?

417
00:28:49,265 --> 00:28:50,742
Oh, my God! Dennis!

418
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,319
- Honey.
- Don't touch me!

419
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:04,943
Can I have some more scabetti?

420
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:06,356
Spaghetti.

421
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,097
Sure, baby.

422
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:12,087
Seany, are you excited
about the museum tomorrow?

423
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:15,757
Yeah. We're gonna see dinosaurs and...

424
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:28,321
What?

425
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,975
- Do you want some dinner?
- No. I don't want some dinner.

426
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:34,283
Just go make me some toast or something.

427
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:37,779
- Are you sure? I have...
- I'm sure. Just make me some toast.

428
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:42,714
And you...

429
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:48,331
Stop playing
with this thing at the table.

430
00:29:57,765 --> 00:29:58,886
What's your problem?

431
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,578
I hate you! Sit down!

432
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:08,530
Eat your dinner.

433
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:12,930
Eat your dinner.

434
00:30:24,086 --> 00:30:25,743
What are all staring at?

435
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:42,964
There.

436
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:47,307
One big happy family.

437
00:30:57,124 --> 00:30:58,610
You seem distracted.

438
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,249
I was just expecting another visitor.
That's all.

439
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:04,673
Oh, really. Who?

440
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:09,761
Did you check out
those things I told you?

441
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:11,959
Yeah. As a matter of fact I did.

442
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:16,805
Dennis Mahoney.
Married. Wife, Kathleen.

443
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:19,726
Reside at the address you gave me.

444
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:22,216
- Has two kids
- And everything else?

445
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,601
Checked out. Names, birthdates,

446
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:28,214
social security number.
The colleges he attended.

447
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:31,355
And yes, he was admitted
to the emergency room

448
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,721
at approximately the same time as you.
Motor vehicle accident.

449
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:37,190
- See I told ya.
- Doesn't prove anything.

450
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,715
Come on. How am I supposed
to know all these things

451
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,989
unless I was telling you the truth?

452
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:48,489
This is Dennis Mahoney.

453
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:53,849
Unless if you're willing to stop
screwing me around and work with me,

454
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:56,461
- then I can't help you.
- But you just told me...

455
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,253
I know about the visits.

456
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:01,209
Dennis Mahoney's been here to
visit you half a dozen times

457
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:03,591
since you've been incarcerated. What?

458
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:07,447
You didn't think it was public record?
People can walk in and out of here

459
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,864
without signing in? Showing some i.d.?

460
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:12,933
No. I mean, what's that have
to do with anything.

461
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:15,717
It has to do with the fact that
he's obviously been feeding you his

462
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:18,158
- personal information.
- That... That... That's stupid!

463
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:20,552
- Why would anybody do that?
- I don't know, Richard.

464
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,001
Why don't you tell me?

465
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:25,071
He's your friend.

466
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:31,219
I want to win this for you.
But you got to get on board.

467
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:34,797
When you're ready to deal
with reality, call me.

468
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,561
Hey! What time is it?

469
00:32:57,116 --> 00:33:00,773
- What's it matter to you?
- What time are visiting hours over?

470
00:33:01,037 --> 00:33:03,264
They ended an hour ago.
Shut the hell up.

471
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,144
<i>Stand back from the door.</i>

472
00:33:06,614 --> 00:33:07,905
I said stand back!

473
00:33:16,484 --> 00:33:18,013
Where the hell are you?

474
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,968
<i>Amazing Grace</i>

475
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,916
<i>How sweet the sound</i>

476
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:38,264
<i>That saved a wretch like me</i>

477
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,302
<i>I once was lost</i>

478
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,975
<i>But now am found</i>

479
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,635
<i>Was blind, but now I see</i>

480
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:56,556
<i>T'was Grace that taught</i>

481
00:33:56,886 --> 00:34:00,059
<i>My heart to fear.</i>

482
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:05,227
<i>And Grace, my fears relieved.</i>

483
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:10,807
<i>How precious did</i>

484
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:14,569
<i>that Grace appear</i>

485
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:16,740
<i>9:00. Lights out.</i>

486
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:40,289
I'm bringing home a baby bumblebee

487
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,584
Won't my daddy be so proud of me

488
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:47,131
'cause I'm bringing home
a baby bumblebee

489
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:50,998
It stung me!

490
00:34:56,356 --> 00:34:59,308
I'm squishing up the baby bumblebee

491
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:02,749
Won't my daddy be so proud of me

492
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:06,475
'cause I'm squishing up
a baby bumblebee

493
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,172
It's yucky!

494
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,698
She's such a cute kid.

495
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:15,570
Really affectionate.

496
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:23,499
I'm wiping off a the baby bumblebee

497
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,813
Won't my daddy be so proud of me

498
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:30,866
'cause I'm wiping off
a baby bumblebee

499
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:36,095
- <i>No...</i>
- Now my daddy's very mad at me.

500
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:39,477
<i>Now my daddy's very mad at me.</i>

501
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,867
Guard! Guard!

502
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:16,266
You wanted to see me?

503
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,480
Tell the D.A. I want to make a deal.

504
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:24,054
I'm ready to show you
where the bodies are buried.

505
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:46,375
{\pos(192,235)}Pull over here.

506
00:36:52,797 --> 00:36:53,925
- Yeah? Weller here.

507
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,409
<i>Sheriff, the D.A. came by again.
He wants to know...</i>

508
00:36:56,529 --> 00:37:00,304
- <i>what you've done with the prisoner.</i>
- Tell the D.A. you can't reach me.

509
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:02,672
Out.

510
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:04,919
Come on, get out.

511
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:21,409
I told you I was innocent.

512
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:26,978
Really sorry about this sheriff.

513
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:35,373
I really am.
But I got to take care of my family!

514
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,696
- Where's my family, amigo?
- They're not home.

515
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:33,356
And you... are trespassing!{\pas sure du mot qu'il dit...}

516
00:39:19,214 --> 00:39:20,599
Remember Brodigan?

517
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,428
God doesn't make mistakes.

518
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:24,949
The Lord would never let this happen.

519
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:27,243
They will be done.

520
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:48,349
Clear!

521
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:52,664
We got him.

522
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:54,825
Are you OK, Mr. Mahoney?{\Faut-il garder le "are"}

523
00:39:55,925 --> 00:39:56,815
I'm...

524
00:39:58,205 --> 00:39:59,066
Mahoney?

525
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:00,841
You said...

526
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:03,321
Mahoney?

527
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:08,060
I'm back.
I want to see my family.

528
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:10,411
- I want to see my kids.
- Take it easy.

529
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,290
- I want to see my kids.
- Mr. Mahoney...

530
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:21,789
Kathy!

531
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:24,670
Sean!

532
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:30,573
Mr. Mahoney, wait...
You don't want to go in there.

533
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:36,520
<i>Got a survivor!</i>

534
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,072
It's OK, baby.

535
00:40:45,683 --> 00:40:46,659
It's OK.

536
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:48,854
You're gonna be OK.

537
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:50,997
You're safe now.

538
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:54,580
Honey, who did this to you?

539
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:57,910
Who hurt your mommy and brother?

540
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:16,505
No!
