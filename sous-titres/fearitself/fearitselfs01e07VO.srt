1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Five month earlier

2
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,680
Tracy?

3
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,310
Hey,sorry I'm late.

4
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,741
It took me 40 minutes to park,

5
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,480
and then the store was a madhouse.

6
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,780
Tracy?

7
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,310
Tracy?

8
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,450
Why aren't you cooking?

9
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,810
Scott and meryl will be here in an hour.

10
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,150
I was late.

11
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,610
Late?

12
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,550
There's only one stripe.

13
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,010
That means you're not pregnant.

14
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,610
Don't look so happy.

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,086
I'm not.

16
00:01:50,086 --> 00:01:50,559
I-- look,

17
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:55,880
You were the one who said that you didn't want to have a baby until we were able to move.

18
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,880
Ok. so,let's go. let's get out of here.

19
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,787
Let's go somewhere where we can have some space and,you know,

20
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:02,810
See some trees.

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,410
You know,that'd be great,but how are we going to do that?

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,569
All I know is that I want to have a baby,

23
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,450
And I don't want to raise it here.

24
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,250
The suburbs. are you sure?

25
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,910
No. uh,no.

26
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,750
We're just going to check it out.

27
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,150
What about the commons?

28
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,550
Oh,don't. don't put them through that.

29
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,880
Why? what is it?

30
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,638
A couple of years ago,we started looking,

31
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:32,410
Found this place-- fell in love with it.

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,280
A bunch of uptight snobs.

33
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,380
Incredible schools,the best sports programs, and the homes are amazing.

34
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,750
So what happened?

35
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,311
They loved us.

36
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,328
And scott thinks I'm crazy,

37
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,280
But I swear they lost interest when he started blabbing that we didn't want to have a second child.

38
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,280
Excuse me for being honest,you know?

39
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,610
Go ahead and check it out.

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,610
I wouldn't live there now if you paid me.

41
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,880
The commons,huh?

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,310
I have a really good feeling about this place.

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,480
Even after what scott and meryl said?

44
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,750
It wasn't right for them.

45
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,910
That does not mean it won't be right for us.

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,250
Maybe. I just can't get used to living in the suburbs.

47
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,110
Keep an open mind.

48
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,180
You may end up loving it.

49
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,080
This must be it.

50
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,880
Now what?

51
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,910
Is there a doorbell or something?

52
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,950
Hmm. ok. that's weird.

53
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,610
I guess that means we go in.

54
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,610
Community

55
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,750
The commons was created on the basis of a growing need for family values.

56
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:01,977
Now,

57
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:05,954
I'm sure you grew up in a neighborhood like we did where neighbors look 

58
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:10,380
Out for one other and crime is something that happens in another part of town.

59
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,980
These ideals are the cornerstone of what we're all about.

60
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,310
That sounds amazing.

61
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,680
So why'd the previous owners leave?

62
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,680
Oh,business. he was transferred.

63
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,180
Here we are. come on.

64
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,010
Don't get your heart set on this,ok?

65
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,850
Come on.

66
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,002
Did I mention,the previous owners couldn't take their furnishings,

67
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:44,810
So if you like it,comes with the house.

68
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,480
Take your time. explore.

69
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,310
Thanks.

70
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,980
Look. look at this kitchen.

71
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,480
Look at this kitchen!

72
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,510
Bet you the closet space is just amazing!

73
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,010
There's a fireplace! ugh.

74
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,510
Oh! look! ugh.

75
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,850
Come on. sit. sit.

76
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,710
We do not belong here.

77
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,310
Yeah. that's right. uh-huh. ok. I'm going to call you later.

78
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,310
They're coming back.

79
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,980
Well,what did you think?

80
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,480
I'm sorry,but I think we've wasted your time.

81
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:18,350
We were just wondering if maybe there was something a little bit smaller.

82
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,180
I'm afraid this is the only home available.

83
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,850
You guys are,what,25? 26?

84
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,010
No kids,but you want to start a family someday?

85
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,850
Yeah,that's why we're here.

86
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,010
But it's-- this is just too much.

87
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,880
We've helped a lot of couples buy new homes here,

88
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,180
couples just like you.

89
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,180
Do me a favor? fill out an application.

90
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,710
What have you got to lose?

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Two days later

92
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,410
Tracy,i'm home.

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,510
We did it! we got the house!

94
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,710
The commons?

95
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,350
Yes! yes!

96
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,680
It's going to be so amazing.

97
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,910
It's going to be amazing.

98
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,550
Wait a sec.

99
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,380
These great loans, way more house than we could afford anywhere else.

100
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,750
What's the catch?

101
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,050
Ok,bobby,what are you doing?

102
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,210
Oh,no,no. it's ok. I understand.

103
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,023
Buying your first home is a little scary,

104
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:30,550
Buyers jumping through hoops and everyone making a quick profit.

105
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,910
We'll make our profit,too.

106
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,250
But buying a house is not about money.

107
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,450
It's about security and comfort and family.

108
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,610
You want a catch,bobby?

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,460
We can't survive without people like you

110
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,110
investing in our community.

111
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,610
And that investment is the life you create here.

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,110
Now,here's a socioeconomic breakdown of our residents.

113
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,210
When I said this was a planned community,it was an understatement.

114
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,071
We are a finely tuned microcosm based 

115
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:04,012
Upon hundreds of years of research in

116
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,173
Communal living,

117
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:10,280
From african tribes to medieval villages to the american suburb.

118
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,754
The commons has thrived for the last 20 years because 

119
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:17,480
We know precisely what it takes to make a community work.

120
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,950
And right now,that's you.

121
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,411
Based on 73 separate criteria,

122
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:27,880
you as a couple meet our needs 97%.

123
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,673
So if we don't do this right now,

124
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:32,580
What are the chances of us meeting your needs again?

125
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,334
You're more likely to be struck by 

126
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:39,280
Lightning while holding a winning lottery ticket.

127
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,280
Are you sure this is what you want?

128
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,150
I want this for us. I do.

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Four weeks later

130
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,350
You're going to just love it here.

131
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,350
Welcome!

132
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,680
Welcome to your new home!

133
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,510
We're happy to call you neighbor.

134
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,680
Oh,thank you!

135
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,180
Ready? yeah!

136
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,710
Think they'll do this every day?

137
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,550
Well,here we go.

138
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,110
Shh. listen! do you hear that?

139
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,450
No. what is it?

140
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,950
Nothing.

141
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,610
Isn't it great? yes.

142
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,180
We did it. it's our house.

143
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm going to go put my thing in.

144
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,210
Ok? I'll be right back.

145
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,880
Hmm! what?

146
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,450
What are you doing?

147
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,510
Trying to make a baby with my wife.

148
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,350
Are you sure?

149
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,810
Yes? yeah.

150
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,610
Oh,see? they did keep the furniture.

151
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,980
Now I'm second-guessing my gift.

152
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,450
Well,they'll probably return it anyway.

153
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,350
Who cares?

154
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,150
We're the fabers,your next-door neighbors.

155
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,080
Try to say that after a few martinis.

156
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,410
Stop it. a mew fartinis.

157
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,680
Stop it!

158
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,910
Hi,i'm debra,and this smart aleck is phil.

159
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,380
I'm bobby. this is my wife,tracy.

160
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,750
You think we looked that young and cute when we moved in?

161
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,910
Well,i did.

162
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,910
How long have you guys lived here?

163
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,080
12 years august. worst 12 years of my life.

164
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,250
Philip,stop it! they don't know you well enough yet.

165
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,780
Oh,come on,honey,they know I'm just kidding.

166
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,650
I'm not kidding.

167
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,750
Well,bobby,you got a beer?

168
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,210
Uh,no,i don't,sorry.

169
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,250
It's still a little early for us.

170
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,080
Have one of mine.

171
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,410
Come on in. come on in.

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,750
Thank you!

173
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,580
You pay whatever you want-- one of the little perks of the commons.

174
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,610
I'm leaving. sit here.

175
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,380
Uh...ok. my goodness.

176
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,110
This place is amazing.

177
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,110
I'm spoiled rotten.

178
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,280
Arlene.

179
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,280
Hi. I'm tracy. we just moved in yesterday.

180
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,750
I know.

181
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,080
You getting settled?

182
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,750
Um,yeah. I mean,i already feel like I belong.

183
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,080
Any kids?

184
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,450
No.

185
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,850
You want mine? she's house-broken.

186
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm joking.

187
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,150
Well,i got to go.

188
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,937
I'm in charge of our subdivision's residents committee,

189
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:27,310
So I'm going to hit you up to volunteer soon.

190
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,650
Please. please,do that.

191
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,480
Great. bye! ok. bye.

192
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,010
Ok.

193
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,010
Ok.

194
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
Bye! see you tomorrow!

195
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,510
Wave at the nice lady.

196
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,180
She's beautiful.

197
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,450
Bye!

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:13,430
Christmastime I think you've had enough.

199
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,430
My love,there's never enough.

200
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,500
You play golf,bobby?

201
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,830
Uh,it's been years.

202
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,170
When it gets warmer,we'll get you out there.

203
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,730
Hey. hey. how's it going?

204
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,070
You having a good time at the party?

205
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,370
I'm all right. yeah?

206
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,370
But I think I got to make a liquor run.

207
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,870
These people drink a lot.

208
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,470
You can dress it up,but it's rotten and stinking to the core.

209
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,570
Will you please be quiet? no,i won't be quiet!

210
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,200
What,do you want to cut my balls off? huh?

211
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,370
Will someone stop him?

212
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,500
They're all just afraid to say anything.

213
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,270
They had no right!

214
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,730
Don't worry,kids.

215
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,630
Uncle phil's is okey-doke.

216
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,830
Let me help you up.

217
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,100
It's ok,bobby. we know how to take care of him.

218
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,730
Hi,debra. oh,sorry.

219
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,230
I just haven't seen you and phil since the party.

220
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,070
How's he doing?

221
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,900
Uh,i thought you knew. his brother died.

222
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,400
He had to go take care of it.

223
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,570
Oh,no.

224
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,130
Well,give him my best.

225
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,330
You're so beautiful,sandra.

226
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,330
Hey,isn't that sandra from across the street?

227
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,330
What is this? sandra!

228
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh,god!

229
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,600
How could you be so stupid?

230
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,770
Do you realize what you've done?

231
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,930
I'm sorry!

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,500
No! no!

233
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,230
Hey,you see that?

234
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,430
What's going on here?

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,630
Two weeks later 

236
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,700
hey,bobby,tracy. this is scott and meryl.

237
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,130
We haven't heard from you guys in a while.

238
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,630
We're wondering how you're doing over there in yuppie heaven.

239
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,300
Give us a call.

240
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,130
Hi,tracy. it's arlene.

241
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,130
I got you an appointment with my ob.

242
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,630
She's amazing.

243
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,070
I told her all about your problems conceiving,so...

244
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,000
Call me back!

245
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,830
Tracy,arlene just left you a message.

246
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,500
Why are you sharing our sex life with your friends?

247
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,230
Because they're my friends?

248
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
I don't know. they're moms.

249
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,370
They've been through this. why are you asking me this?

250
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,370
Because,i don't need their judgment.

251
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,370
We've only been trying for 3 months.

252
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,730
Until it happens,let's just keep it between us,ok?

253
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,630
I think you're being a little sensitive.

254
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,830
I'm going for a run.

255
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,300
Oh,wait. I forgot to tell you that candace called.

256
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,700
You've got a meeting with the resident's group tonight.

257
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,630
Ron and sandra, what we do is arbitrate.

258
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,630
We offer solutions to everyday problems.

259
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,670
It's how villages and tribes have functioned for thousands of years.

260
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,670
And it's what community is all about.

261
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,430
I trust her. it won't happen again.

262
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,600
Everyone in town saw her.

263
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,930
We can't just ignore it,ron.

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,070
That wouldn't be fair to everyone.

265
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,730
Infidelity rips at the very fabric that commons is created from.

266
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,670
What divides a single couple divides us all.

267
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,396
Now,in cases like this,

268
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:47,741
The offending spouse is sentenced

269
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:51,000
by the partner from a prescribed list.

270
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,400
Ron,do you understand that?

271
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,600
I choose her punishment.

272
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,170
Hold on. what are we doing here?

273
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,370
This is between sandra and ron.

274
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,170
We're not talking about someone who left their garbage cans out.

275
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,300
Why is this any of our business?

276
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,930
Becaus we are neighbors.

277
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,670
And we care.

278
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,770
Harlot! whore!

279
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,470
Disgusting! just a whore!

280
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,970
Why does she have to stand there?

281
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,300
She broke a rule,sweetie.

282
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,330
She's in a grown-up time out.

283
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Is this what you wanted? itth hey,how can you let this happen?

284
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,800
This is sick. this is medieval.

285
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,900
Only for a few hours.

286
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,230
What would you do if you caught your wife screwing around?

287
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,670
Divorce her? kill her? pretend it didn't happen?

288
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,830
We'd deal with it privately. they will,too.

289
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,370
But first,she's has to deal with what she's done to the rest of us.

290
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,230
Her neighbors will help her to throught it.

291
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,230
It'll strengthen the community.

292
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,930
And I guaran-damn-tee she won't screw around again.

293
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,870
This is how you chose to punish your wife. No,she chose it.

294
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm so sorry,sandra.

295
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,400
No! Don't interfere. please!

296
00:19:34,500 --> 00:20:02,100
B,stay out of there bobby.

297
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,100
bobby.

298
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,544
Sandra?

299
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:06,928
I just wanted to say if the community hadn't stepped in when they did,

300
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,770
Our marriage would be over.

301
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,930
Bless you.

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,130
And you two keep trying.

303
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,700
Don't give up on that baby.

304
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,170
Thanks.

305
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,100
Tracy? I just ran into ron and sandra.

306
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,400
Heather and Candace came by.

307
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,626
We like to check in on our neighbors after 

308
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:35,500
They've been here a while to see how they're adjusting.

309
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,670
Oh,and we're doing great,aren't we?

310
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,830
Yeah,great.

311
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,000
It's obvious. your house is wonderful.

312
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,400
Pride of ownership. absolutely.

313
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,321
Ok.

314
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,387
I don't mean to be rude,

315
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,000
but if you want something from me--

316
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,670
you want me to volunteer for another committee--

317
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,670
they're concerned about us.

318
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,000
Because?

319
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,300
Because we haven't gotten pregnant yet.

320
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,800
There's no need to panic.

321
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,300
It happens to lots of couples.

322
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,300
We just want you to know that we can help.

323
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,800
Oh,we don't want your help.

324
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,130
Our private life is none of your business.

325
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,300
We really are fine.

326
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,470
I know. I just want you to explore every possibility.

327
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,630
We have fertility specialists. we have donors.

328
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,470
Ok. you need to leave. now.

329
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,170
We truly want to help.

330
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,435
Now,

331
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,652
I suggest you take a look at the 

332
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:23,630
Resident's agreement that you both signed.

333
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,200
We have every right to be concerned.

334
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,200
Your house is lovely.

335
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,179
"child shall be conceived "within a period of up to and including,

336
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,430
But not to exceed, "6 months from the first day of residency.

337
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,100
"failure to do so will result in the foreclosure of your property--"

338
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,770
Can they do that?

339
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,930
I don't want to leave.

340
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,970
I don't either. but...

341
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,230
They're trying to control us.

342
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,570
Tell us when to have a baby? c'mon!

343
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,798
I--i know,but that's why we're here,

344
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:59,400
To raise a family in a safe environment.

345
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,770
They made that possible.

346
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,770
Look at their success rate. it obviously works.

347
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,730
It does! I want this for us.

348
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,570
What are we going to do?

349
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,500
Two days later

350
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,330
we want to do everything we can to uphold the contract.

351
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,730
But what if we're unable to conceive?

352
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,512
Oh,well,that's highly unlikely given your combined genetics,

353
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,400
But you would be in default.

354
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,360
You'd lose the house,any equity,

355
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,930
your credit would be damaged for years.

356
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,400
It would be unpleasant.

357
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,900
What if we had a miscarriage, or we just wanted to move?

358
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,570
Sorry,no. that's all covered in your agreement.

359
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,999
So,basically,we're trapped here,

360
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,030
expected to mate on demand.

361
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,570
No. you make it sound like it's a zoo.

362
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,449
You're saying that every couple for the last 20 years has 

363
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:53,570
Spit out babies on your schedule

364
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,930
and lived happily ever after?

365
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,970
It's a delicate biosocial balance.

366
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,070
We have singles. we have couples without children.

367
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,187
We've never asked anyone to conceive 

368
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:05,530
Who wasn't already planning on doing so.

369
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,809
Now,in the application that you signed,

370
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:11,530
You stated that you wanted to become pregnant within 6 months.

371
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,630
I can show you,if don't remember.

372
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,800
That's ok.

373
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,470
We've been doing this a long time.

374
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,500
We're very good at choosing our neighbors.

375
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,670
We have faith in you.

376
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,730
Yeah,i'm looking at this contract.

377
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,030
Why would you sign this?

378
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,900
Why didn't you call me first?

379
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,370
Is it legal.

380
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,700
It's a legal document.

381
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,270
It's a ridiculous breach of civil liberties, but you signed it.

382
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,800
I just want some control.

383
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,230
Move. I mean,there'd be consequences.

384
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,070
No,we can't. tracy doesn't want to go.

385
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,100
She doesn't know I'm doing this.

386
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,770
But if we have a baby,we're stuck in this place.

387
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,670
Tell me what you want me to do.

388
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,330
Help me find the previous owners.

389
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,330
Run a credit check. get a number.

390
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
They got out. I want to know how.

391
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,700
I can't believe we may lose this.

392
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,470
All I want to do is raise a family here.

393
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,970
Don't give up. it's all worth it.

394
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,176
Once you feel your baby growing inside of you,

395
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:11,800
You know you're not just living for yourself anymore.

396
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,800
Your priorities change completely.

397
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,760
I love my house,but what's important,

398
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,264
why we're really here,

399
00:24:18,264 --> 00:24:19,530
Is for our kids.

400
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,701
And unless your kid's a complete freak,

401
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:25,130
They'll be offered the best schools,the highest-paying jobs.

402
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,470
It's an unwritten rule of the commons.

403
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,630
We're not just neighbors in here.

404
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,630
We're neighbors anywhere we go.

405
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,271
20 years of ex-residents highly placed in 

406
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,470
Virtually every sector of government and industry.

407
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,600
Connections from this little neighborhood run scary deep.

408
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,500
Realize how lucky you are to be here.

409
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,000
And girl,do whatever you can to hold onto it.

410
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,300
No. he's not feeling well.

411
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,170
I just need to ask him a few questions.

412
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,976
I'm sorry about your brother,phil,

413
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:00,830
But I need to know-- what happened to the couple who owned our house?

414
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,170
Leave him alone,bobby.

415
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,999
This agreement we signed,we didn't realize

416
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:05,349
it's insane,

417
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:07,800
And I need to know how that family got out.

418
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,300
Phil. what happened to you?

419
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,370
Go home. we can't help you.

420
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
He disappeared.

421
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,870
What do you mean he disappeared?

422
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,870
All his credit accounts,his bank accounts,closed.

423
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,900
It's like your previous owner fell off the planet.

424
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,730
What do you think that means?

425
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,570
Either he's dead,or he's pretending to be.

426
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,230
Why would he do that?

427
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,900
What the hell's going on over there,bobby?

428
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,230
We're worried about you two.

429
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,830
We're ok.

430
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,870
Don't let meryl say anything to tracy.

431
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,600
Thanks,scott.

432
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,070
Valentine's day 

433
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,570
What's that?

434
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,700
I got you something. oh.

435
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,200
Can I open it?

436
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,970
Yes.

437
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,000
I got 2 stripes.

438
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,300
Bobby,i love you so much.

439
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,630
We did it.

440
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,800
Yeah.

441
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,176
I mean,i want to,you know,get officially checked out by the ob,

442
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:31,630
But arlene,she said that these things are pretty much foolproof.

443
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,800
So,i think that we're ok.

444
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,570
You told her before you told me?

445
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,400
I know. I just didn't want to tell you over the phone, and I had to-- no.

446
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,900
Hey,listen.

447
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,870
Don't get mad,ok?

448
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,100
This is our dream,and it's happening, so let's just enjoy it,ok?

449
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,900
Oh,you know what? I think it's my parents calling.

450
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,100
Ok.

451
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,770
Hello?

452
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,270
I know! it's so exciting,isn't it?

453
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,600
Yeah. he just can't wait.

454
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,500
He's--he's thrilled.

455
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,970
Look. yeah. oh-- check it out.

456
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,300
But yeah. this is,um...

457
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,470
That's a photo of our baby.

458
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,970
You're so beautiful.

459
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,130
I think I'm going to like this pregnancy thing.

460
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,630
You know so? yeah.

461
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,570
No. mmm.

462
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,530
Sandra! what-- and shouting she jumped in front of the car!

463
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,300
She's jump in front of the car

464
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,570
I saw it. she was definitely drunk.

465
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,070
No,no,no! she was terrified.

466
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,999
She wanted help. someone was chasing her.

467
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,105
did you see? she was

468
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,570
No. She jumped in front of the car.

469
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,930
It was suicide. we all saw it.

470
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,870
These people are insane.

471
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,500
Oh,my god.

472
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,730
What do you mean that they disappeared?

473
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,600
'cause candace,she said she said that they -candace lied,ok?

474
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,930
Something is very wrong here.

475
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,270
Will you just please,stop? please,stop?

476
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,600
Because you're scaring me.

477
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,000
You should be scared because -'cause why...

478
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,770
Come on.

479
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,130
Phil,debra! open up!

480
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,300
Hello?

481
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,630
Tell us what's happening.

482
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,130
We're scared. how do we get out of this?

483
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,700
We have a daughter. leave us alone!

484
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,300
Is that what they do? they go after your family?

485
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,670
Phil--phil,what happened to your brother?

486
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,870
What did they do to you?

487
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm sorry,honey.

488
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,970
Everyone needs to find out on their own.

489
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,130
Actually,it's kind of liberating.

490
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,700
We're all in this together.

491
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,370
Oh,did I tell you about gracie's report card?

492
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,530
She did great.

493
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,030
I'm so proud of her.

494
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,030
The teachers want to put her into the advanced learning classes.

495
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,370
She's already reading at the fourth grade level.

496
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,900
And she's the best speller in the class.

497
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,400
Bobby,get the hell out of there.

498
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:07,575
No.

499
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:10,548
I have to get tracy and the baby safe first-- hide them,

500
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:11,900
Get them new identities.

501
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,070
They'll come after us. they won't stop.

502
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,730
They own us.

503
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,730
How can we help?

504
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,230
I have an idea.

505
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,800
We're going to need meryl.

506
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,300
We should call your doctor.

507
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,730
Oh,no,no. it's probably just heartburn.

508
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,230
I just need to rest.

509
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,830
I promised arlene I'd help her organize tomorrow.

510
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,570
I'm so excited about this fundraiser.

511
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,900
The school library's going to throw a dinner for all the volunteers.

512
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,130
We need as many people to contribute as possible.

513
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,300
I think we need about 10 volunteers to work the phones.

514
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,430
Tracy,you look pale.

515
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,700
Do you want something?

516
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,800
Oh,um,yeah.

517
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,000
Maybe I should just get some water.

518
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,860
well,i'll take care of the emailing,

519
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,500
And I'll make sure they'll be at all-- oh,my god. the baby!

520
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,300
Someone call 911!

521
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,600
No,no,no. just,please-- just call bobby. please...

522
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,600
Just call bobby.

523
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,370
One of us will go with you.

524
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,730
No,that's ok. I'll call you just as soon as I can.

525
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,870
Ok,meryl. ok.

526
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,170
How you doing,meryl? nervous.

527
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,270
Here we go.

528
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,030
If the tv cuts to you,just cover up,ok?

529
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,870
We can't let them recognize you.

530
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,370
Hello?

531
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,530
Hi,arlene.

532
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,200
Yeah,no,tracy and the baby are fine.

533
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,370
She's just confined to the bed for a little while.

534
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,030
No,no,no. no visitors.

535
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,500
Thanks. bye.

536
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,100
Just stay covered.

537
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,230
thank you. thanks.

538
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,900
I'll give tracy your kind words.

539
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,730
Just let us know.

540
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,900
Pig!

541
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,830
they're suspicious.

542
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,830
We've been on tv for 2 days straight.

543
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,370
Why hasn't scott called?

544
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,030
Tracy and her parents should be reachihing the cabin at any time.

545
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,010
They'll let scott know,

546
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,370
and as soon as he calls us,we're out of here.

547
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,570
Oh! maybe that's him.

548
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,230
Hey,scott. hey.

549
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,070
Oh,she's better. 

550
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,730
No,no,no. no visitors tonight.

551
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,300
Ok. we'll give you a call.

552
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,400
Tonight.

553
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,100
Let's go.

554
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,900
You made a tragic mistake,bobby.

555
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,730
Who the hell are you? where's your wife?

556
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,300
Run! get out of here!

557
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,400
It'll be ok,meryl.

558
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,570
No meryl,it won't. bobby!

559
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,170
And you can thank your friend bobby for that.

560
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,600
Where's tracy?

561
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,230
Where's tracy?

562
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,730
Where is she?

563
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,900
You can kill me,but tracy and the baby are safe.

564
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,730
And everyone will know what happens here.

565
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,610
Kill you? why would we kill you?

566
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,900
you're our neighbor.

567
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,570
We just want you to be happy.

568
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,711
But your family and friends,

569
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:55,370
they may have a little accident,like meryl.

570
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,870
What is that?

571
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,570
Something to help you talk.

572
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,230
Don't worry,bobby.

573
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,230
We're your friends.

574
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,480
Welcome back. you've had quite the nap.

575
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,050
You must feel horrible. I'm sorry.

576
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,350
Are you up for a ride?

577
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,180
Where?

578
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,780
To see tracy. she came back.

579
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,620
You're lying. she wouldn't.

580
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,520
Where's bobby? I'm going to knock some sense into that son of a bitch.

581
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,680
Will somebody get him out of here?

582
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,450
Come on,phil. bobby's ok now.

583
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,080
What,he's ok?

584
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,750
Bobby's staying?

585
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,120
Bobby's staying!

586
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,820
Oh,bobby,you're staying.

587
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,550
That's so great.

588
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,650
That's great that you're staying.

589
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,820
That's so great.

590
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,020
This is for you.

591
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,480
Ron,will you do something about this?

592
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,780
What are you doing?

593
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,620
Oh,my god!

594
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,320
Candace! run!

595
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,320
Hey! run!

596
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,220
Bobby?

597
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,950
Bobby!

598
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,650
Bobby!

599
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,050
Come on back! bobby!

600
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,220
Bobby!

601
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,280
Bobby? bobby!

602
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,250
Bobby? bobby?

603
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,480
Bobby! it's me!

604
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,220
Hey,bobby!

605
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,050
Bobby? bobby,it's scott!

606
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,880
Tracy! bobby! bobby!

607
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,880
What are you doing? you were safe.

608
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,220
I had to come back for you.

609
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,720
They've got meryl. we have to get out of here.

610
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,220
No. bobby. bobby. I love you so much.

611
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,920
I am doing this for us.

612
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,950
Scott. scott.

613
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,950
It's an amazing house,bobby.

614
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,320
The schools are incredible.

615
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,650
We're going to be neighbors.

616
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,880
It's going to be great.

617
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,380
No! 

618
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,820
No!

619
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,680
No,no! no!

620
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,750
No!

621
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,320
No! stop!

622
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,680
It really is a lovely community.

623
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,520
Everybody watches out for each other.

624
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,566
Oh,and if you're planning on having kids,

625
00:40:10,566 --> 00:40:12,750
There's no better place to raise a family.

626
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,480
That's why we're here. he's adorable.

627
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,580
He's a handful.

628
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,120
So,i'm looking forward to meeting your husband.

629
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,950
Yeah. he's working right now.

630
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,980
Oh,there he is.

631
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,580
So why'd the previous owners leave?

632
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,080
Business. he was transferred.

633
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,580
We feel so fortunate to be here.

634
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,150
It really is a wonderful community.

635
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,150
Bye.

636
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,680
Bye.
