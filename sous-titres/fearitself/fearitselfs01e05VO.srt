1
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,064
Let's go.

2
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:18,199
Come on!

3
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:21,500
Come on. Keep movin'.

4
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,249
That's the serial killer.

5
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:40,616
That's the serial killer.

6
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:44,314
- Comin' through.
- Let's go!

7
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,435
You see the size of that guy.

8
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:02,774
Come on! Let's go!

9
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:22,598
- He give you any trouble?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:24,821
You gotta watch him. He's tricky.

11
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,670
Stop right here. Stay facin' the wall.

12
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,996
Down on your knees, knees spread apart.

13
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:43,140
We're gonna remove your shackles.
When we do, don't move.

14
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,551
Do you understand?

15
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:57,036
Gonna remove your left handcuff.

16
00:01:57,196 --> 00:02:00,206
When we do, put your left hand on
the top of your head. Do you understand?

17
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:08,893
We're gonna remove your right handcuff.

18
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:12,764
When we do, put your right hand on
top of your head. Do you understand?

19
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,086
- You patted him down, right?
- About ten times.

20
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:31,154
All right, stand up.

21
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:37,380
You know why you're here?

22
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:40,580
Are you sick or hurt?

23
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,667
Do you have any questions or concerns?

24
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:57,885
He's all yours.

Season 1 Episode 5

29
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,606
- Doesn't even know how to play.

30
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:56,671
- And I tried...
- All right, now.

31
00:04:58,551 --> 00:04:59,974
Let's see who's here.

32
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:03,599
- Bernard Taylor.
- Right here, boss.

33
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,632
- Steve Proctor.
- Yo.

34
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,865
- Sean Longway.
- Yeah, here.

35
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:10,591
- Danny Bannerman.
- Here, Sergeant.

36
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,482
Yep, she's here all right, Sarge.

37
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:16,177
Oh, man. Check this out, Sarge.

38
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:18,940
She's got the latest
issue of death dance.

39
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,158
"For all your horror needs."

40
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:24,860
- Give it back.
- Back off. Back off. Back off.

41
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,511
- You got it all over me.
- Let's take a look in here.

42
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:30,541
Death dance?
What kinda sense does that make?

43
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:33,336
'Bout as much sense
as officer Stephen King over here.

44
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:36,673
Freakin' boot. It's bad enough we have
to have a chick watchin' our backs.

45
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,967
- That's enough.
- She's not a chick.

46
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,560
She's goth cop.

47
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,639
And you better watch out,
or she'll suck your blood.

48
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,432
Yeah, she sucks, all right.

49
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:52,361
Now, what do you say we cut the
wisecracking and get back to work.

50
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,961
She's only been here 3 months,
and she's already busted

51
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:58,022
more knuckleheads
than any two of you combined.

52
00:05:58,142 --> 00:05:59,675
- Steinwitz.
- Yo.

53
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:02,424
- Mattingley.
- Yeah.

54
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:06,240
All right, Taylor, Proctor,
Longway, check your call sheets.

55
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,710
There's an updated list of
the stolen vehicle models.

56
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,963
Check your list. Keep your eyes open.

57
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:13,859
One more thing before I let you guys go.

58
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:18,840
We have a special overnight guest
staying upstairs in our holding cell.

59
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:21,632
His name is Dwayne Mellor, and he's...

60
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,344
an eater.

61
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:24,762
He's a what?

62
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:26,681
An eater.

63
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:28,086
Eater?

64
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:30,402
Over the last 2 years...

65
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,373
Mellor has killed
over 30 people in 5 different states.

66
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,994
In each case, took the victims home,

67
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:40,235
usually killing the males outright,

68
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:43,929
keeping the females alive for days,
sometimes weeks...

69
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:47,667
playing with them, torturing them,

70
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,289
and eventually...

71
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:52,787
eating them.

72
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:58,396
The feds will be here in the morning
to take him off our hands.

73
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:02,522
Report's right here
in case anyone's interested.

74
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:06,533
All right. That's it for tonight.

75
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,998
You're holdin' down the fort.

76
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:15,188
I'll see you in the mornin'.

77
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,708
Hey, Sarge, that guy,
he really ate those people?{\Serge?}

78
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:25,093
That's what the report says.
32 of 'em to be exact.

79
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,249
He got hungry, he'd...

80
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:30,650
carve a little meat off the bodies
and throw it in a frying pan.

81
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,371
They found intestines
and other body parts in the fridge

82
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:35,208
wrapped up in plastic bags.

83
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:37,126
Leftovers, huh?

84
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,705
You think that's weird?

85
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,798
Wait'll you hear about the wardrobe
they found hanging in his closet

86
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,738
custom made...

87
00:07:43,858 --> 00:07:45,843
from the skin of his victims...

88
00:07:46,753 --> 00:07:49,097
supposedly taken
while they were still alive.

89
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:52,475
Hey, that's like that,
Silence of the lamb guy, right?

90
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:55,339
- Hannibal Lecter.
- Yes, I ate his liver...

91
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,731
with some fava beans and a nice chianti.

92
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:03,600
Actually it was Buffalo Bill who skinned
his victims in silence of the lambs.

93
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,795
Hannibal Lecter just liked
to eat human flesh.

94
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:07,448
- Who asked you?

95
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:09,858
I was just trying
to keep the facts straight.

96
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:12,090
Nothin' worse than a horror movie geek.

97
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,687
What's that on your shirt?

98
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:17,503
- Fine.
- I don't know, Sergeant.

99
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,149
- Get it cleaned up.
- Sorry, Sergeant.

100
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,256
You know, it's never easy being a boot.

101
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:26,526
Being a female boot... even harder.

102
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,428
Just keep doin'
what you're doin'.

103
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,987
Make it through your year of probation,
you'll be a cop and they'll respect you.

104
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,685
They might not like you...

105
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:38,141
but they'll respect you.

106
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:42,132
- I will. Thanks, Sarge.
- Good.

107
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,466
Because if you don't...

108
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,805
they might feed you to Mellor.

109
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,564
Have a good night.

110
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:54,078
Hey, I wanna ask you.
Sarge, do you know that half

111
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:56,739
- of Bannerman's arrests are cita...
- Hey, Sarge.

112
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:59,461
You mind if I take a look
at that report?

113
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,670
Pretty gory stuff.
Don't let it spook you.

114
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,755
Don't worry.
I'm used to this kind of thing.

115
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:07,863
Yeah. You know, Hannibal
the cannibal is make-believe.

116
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:10,428
This guy isn't.

117
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,094
Marty, wait up.

118
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,693
- Goin' to check up on the prisoner?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:58,370
I'm gonna go see if he's hungry.

120
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:00,978
You wanna come see for yourself?

121
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:05,906
I'll be up in a little bit.

122
00:10:06,026 --> 00:10:07,626
I have to go change my shirt.

123
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:11,531
Oh, yeah. Listen, sorry about that.

124
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,411
You're not worried about bein' alone
with us here tonight, are you?

125
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,485
- Should I be?
- Nah, course not.

126
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,676
I mean, we're the good guys, right?

127
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:02,409
Bastards.

128
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:58,543
Please.

129
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,314
I'll do anything.

130
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,633
Please.

131
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:12,457
Please don't. I don't wanna die.

132
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,302
I don't wanna die.

133
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,570
My God. Oh my G...

134
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,304
Hello?

135
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,174
Did you hear that?

136
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:32,742
- Hear what?
- I was downstairs,

137
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:35,901
and I thought I heard something.
A crash, like, something fell,

138
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:39,920
- and then the lights flickered.
- No. Didn't hear a thing.

139
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:49,403
What kind of pizza is that?

140
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:52,209
Pancreas, large intestine.

141
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,053
Very funny.
You know we're not supposed...

142
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:56,713
to eat in here because of the rats.

143
00:13:56,874 --> 00:13:59,341
Well, if you don't
tell the rats, I won't.

144
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,108
You want some?

145
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,720
No, thanks.

146
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:06,932
So I was reading the report on Mellor.
I didn't know he was cajun.

147
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,054
Yeah?
So what?

148
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,772
So it struck me as kind of odd. I've
never heard of a cajun serial killer.

149
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,794
That's 'cause he's an eater,

150
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,694
not just a serial killer, OK?
There's a big difference.

151
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,949
Can you believe he made lampshades

152
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:26,630
out of human skin
and bowls out of human skulls?

153
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:29,787
I know.
That's pretty damn creative, right?

154
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,687
- No, it's pretty damn sick.
- Pretty damn resourceful if you ask me.

155
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:35,501
You know,

156
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,215
down on the bayou,

157
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,089
the cajun,

158
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,368
they use every part of their kill.

159
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:45,111
They'll take a big, ol'fat gator,
they'll eat all the flesh.

160
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:47,932
They'll take the hide.
They'll use it for shelter

161
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:51,392
and for clothing,
take the bones, use 'em as utensils,

162
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:52,435
weapons.

163
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,444
I think Mellor's doin'
the exact same thing.

164
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:58,279
He's just doin' it with
human beings, that's all.

165
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,764
That's even sicker.

166
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:01,819
Waste not, want not.

167
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:07,647
- Is there any coffee?
- I'll go make a fresh pot in a minute.

168
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,466
- Want me to do it?
- No, no.

169
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:12,957
I'll do it.
Let me finish my supper here.

170
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:21,220
So what did you think
when you saw Mellor?

171
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,066
- What do you mean, what'd I think?
- Come on, Steinwitz. What's he like?

172
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,439
What do you mean?
Does he have, like, horns or a tail,

173
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,037
- somethin' like that?
- No. I mean...

174
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:33,161
What's he like?

175
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,587
How does he talk?

176
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,430
How does he look?

177
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,934
He looks hungry.

178
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,445
How am I supposed to know
what he talks like?

179
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:46,360
He didn't make a peep
when I was up there.

180
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,957
You're so interested,
why don't you go talk to him yourself?

181
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:52,445
I'm sure he'd love to see
a pretty, young thing like you.

182
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:58,598
Didn't your parents ever
teach you any manners?

183
00:15:58,718 --> 00:16:01,671
My parents were murdered
when I was 10 years old.

184
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,969
Marty, I'm... I'm sorry.

185
00:16:08,374 --> 00:16:09,945
I did...I didn't know.

186
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,792
My parents weren't murdered.

187
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:19,547
They live down in Florida.
They're all fat and tan.

188
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,297
I'm just playin' with you.

189
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,824
I swear I don't know
what the heck's gotten into you tonight.

190
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,605
<i>Sergeant one to central.</i>

191
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:02,844
He's not breathing.

192
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,180
You need anything?

193
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,914
- Do you want anything?
- How about a plate of liver

194
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,844
and some eyeball risotto?

195
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:30,780
- You scared the hell out of me.
- Here you go.

196
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,515
Service with a smile?

197
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,637
- Is it good?
- Thanks.

198
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:39,232
Special blend.

199
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:40,972
You seen Mattingley?

200
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:44,464
No, not since he came up here
to watch the prisoner, no.

201
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:52,398
Would you check him out?
Guy's out like a light.

202
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:55,293
So...

203
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,554
you ever,

204
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,454
ever wonder why he does it?

205
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:01,716
Kill people?

206
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,277
And eat them.

207
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:07,204
I mean, that's the thing, right?
It's...

208
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:11,737
- It's the eating people.
- Maybe he gets a thrill out of it.

209
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:13,366
A thrill.

210
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,371
Yeah, you know, like some
kind of sexual turn-on.

211
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,248
Why don't you go ask him?

212
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:26,880
I mean, I'm sure he's agreeing
with everything you're saying.

213
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:34,849
You listening to us?

214
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:38,268
- You ever wonder what it tastes like?
- What?

215
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,304
I mean human flesh.

216
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:43,153
Same as any other meat, I guess.

217
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:46,271
You know, I think it's the power.

218
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:48,516
What is?

219
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,636
You know, that gets him off.
I think it's...

220
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:55,322
I think it's the power
that, uh, gives him the edge.

221
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,333
- How you figure?
- I mean, there's an old

222
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,220
voodoo saying that says that if you

223
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,324
cut a man's heart out and then you

224
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:06,085
eat it before it stops beating,

225
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,879
not only do you gain his strength,
but you also gain his spirit.

226
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,021
So you're telling me this...

227
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:15,396
What?

228
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,344
What was that?

229
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:19,870
- What is it?
- I thought I heard somethin'.

230
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:21,976
Maybe it's Mattingley.

231
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:24,119
No, it's not Mattingley.

232
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:27,429
I told you I thought
I heard something earlier.

233
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:29,639
Wait here.

234
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:56,382
Everything OK?

235
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,688
Come on.

236
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:11,662
No more games.

237
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,269
Damn it. Up and die on us?

238
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,636
I ain't so sure you wanna be doin' that.

239
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:38,857
I'm not sure you wanna do that at all.

240
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:44,408
Where have you been?
Didn't you hear me calling you?

241
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:47,000
If I'd've heard you, I'd have answered.

242
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:48,954
Someone left the cell unlocked.

243
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,367
- Not me.
- Marty thought he heard something

244
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:53,653
- downstairs.
- Wasn't anything.

245
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,392
What?

246
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:58,950
I just spoke to Marty. He told me
to tell you, it wasn't anything.

247
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:02,215
- Then what was the noise that he heard?
- I don't know.

248
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:03,606
The wind, a rat.

249
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,206
Who the hell knows, who the hell cares?
Stop bein' such a...

250
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:09,834
woman.

251
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,594
You just saw Marty downstairs?

252
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:14,479
What's he doing now?

253
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:17,330
He didn't say.

254
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:32,522
I tell you, this whole thing is really
startin' to give me the creeps.

255
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,751
What whole thing is that?

256
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:44,760
What's so funny?

257
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:48,263
What?

258
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,099
It's you.

259
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,478
You guys are doing this on purpose.
You're...

260
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,142
You are tryin' to mess with my head.

261
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:03,403
- How you figure?
- I see what you guys are trying to do.

262
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,907
What exactly are we tryin' to do, boot?

263
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,311
Nothing. Forget it.

264
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,249
You want another cup of coffee?

265
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,526
- How did you know I already had coffee?
- What's that?

266
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:22,129
Speak up!

267
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:31,647
Do you want another
cup of coffee, or what?

268
00:24:36,296 --> 00:24:38,688
Did Marty just ask me
if I wanted coffee?

269
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,479
Marty's not here. How could he
ask you if you want a cup...

270
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,609
- I thought I heard his voice.
- That was me.

271
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:46,988
- I asked if you wanted a coffee.
- That wasn't your voice.

272
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:53,430
- What's wrong with you?
- Tell you what's wrong with me.

273
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,047
How 'bout we're holed up in here
with some wacko

274
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,051
who eats people for a hobby,

275
00:24:58,244 --> 00:25:00,326
the guy up and dies on us
while he's in our custody.

276
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:03,420
- How is that gonna look in the morning?
- He's just sleepin', that's all.

277
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,733
I'm telling you, he's dead.
I have been watching him.

278
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:12,499
Where you goin'?

279
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:15,831
I'm going to tell Steinwitz
we have a problem.

280
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:27,339
Hey, Marty, we got a problem upstairs.

281
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,862
Hey, you hear me, Marty?
We got a big problem.

282
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:00,341
OK, guys, very funny.

283
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:18,926
Damn it, guys, this isn't funny anymore.

284
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:37,277
What the hell's the matter with you?

285
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,434
You know, the phone lines are down.

286
00:27:42,554 --> 00:27:44,950
- What's goin' on, Bannerman?
- He's out.

287
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,458
- Who's out?
- The eater.

288
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,267
- Listen, let's calm down.
- He's out. He's loose in the station.

289
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,047
- How?
- He killed Mattingley

290
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:55,626
and now he's disguised as... as Marty.

291
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,961
- Marty Steinwitz?
- Before that, he was Mattingley.

292
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:01,867
Listen, I don't know what you been
smokin' and boot but you...

293
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:03,440
Listen to me, damn it.

294
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:06,855
He's taken their appearance.
I know it sounds insane, but he has.

295
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,280
- How's that possible?
- How the hell should I know?

296
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,970
Steinwitz said... Steinwitz said
that there's this old voodoo legend

297
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,970
that if you cut outa person's heart
and ate it before it stopped beating,

298
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,870
that you wouldn't only gain the person's
strength, but their spirit, too.

299
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,680
Maybe this guy gets it all,
not just their strength,

300
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,458
but the hair, and the face,
the body, everything.

301
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,680
Like some kind of shape-shifter?

302
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,546
So you're saying he assumes
the identity of whoever he eats.

303
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:34,765
I know it sounds insane, but yes.

304
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:37,089
So wait. He broke out of
his holding cell

305
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:39,512
and ate Mattingley and Steinwitz?

306
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,020
{\All I know is}- I know that they're never together.
- Together?

307
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,141
They're never in the same room
at the same time.

308
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:47,760
When Mattingley came into the holding
cell, he sat the exact same way

309
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,110
that Steinwitz had sat
just a few minutes before...

310
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,225
and you know all this because Steinwitz
and Mattingley sat the same exact way

311
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,040
and they were never in
the same room at the same time?

312
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,280
Mattingley's body
is stuffed underneath a desk.

313
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,776
His heart is ripped
right out of his chest.

314
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,288
I swear to God, Sarge.

315
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,030
OK.

316
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,605
You believe me?

317
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,466
Let's just say I believe you
believe and leave it at that.

318
00:29:25,109 --> 00:29:26,151
Either way,

319
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,770
We've gotta go check this thing out.

320
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,106
What do we do now?

321
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:35,521
Go up and look inside that cage.

322
00:30:33,202 --> 00:30:34,626
You hear something?

323
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,855
You see anything?

324
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,912
Nothin'.

325
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,282
It's comin'from the holding room.

326
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,543
Let's wait for backup
before we go in there.

327
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,960
If Steinwitz needs our help,
we can't leave him.

328
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,690
Wait for me.

329
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:00,031
Take a look.

330
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,946
He ate his heart.

331
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,735
Freeze! Don't move.

332
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,657
What the hell?

333
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:31,974
Gotta be.

334
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,330
Check his face, Bannerman.
I don't like this.

335
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,372
You're one hell of a cop.

336
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,671
<i>J'ai faim. Il faut que je mange.</i>

337
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,937
What the hell are you doin'?
It's me, Marty.

338
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,440
What's gotten into you tonight?

339
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,828
- You're not Marty.
- I'm not?

340
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,843
Then who the hell am I?

341
00:34:52,972 --> 00:34:55,880
You're Mellor. You're the damn eater.

342
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:57,940
That's right, darlin'.

343
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,210
And you know us Cajuns.

344
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:02,300
We don't eat to live.

345
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:04,141
We live to eat.

346
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:06,693
Oh, come on.

347
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,314
I didn't think you scared so easily.

348
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:14,172
I thought you were used
to this kind of stuff.

349
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,039
Come on, pretty lady.

350
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,445
Aren't you tired of playin' this game.

351
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:29,144
Let me eat your heart out.

352
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,728
I guess Marty
never taught you the code.

353
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,139
You had it figured out
all along, didn't you?

354
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,856
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

355
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,148
I can't let you go.

356
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,050
Can't let me go.

357
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:14,170
How cute.

358
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:19,615
Such a trouper, right to the very end.

359
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:21,642
You see,

360
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,368
I particularly like it
when my prey is frightened.

361
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,718
Relax.

362
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,936
It only hurt a little while.

363
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:29,325
Woman!

364
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,278
No more games!

365
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,302
I'm tired of playin' with you.

366
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:14,605
Come here.

367
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:36,268
Time

368
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:37,878
to eat.

369
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,236
<i>RAT POISON KILLER POWDER</i>

370
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:36,228
You bitch!

371
00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:42,913
You killed me!

372
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,446
You killed me!

373
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:49,459
You killed me!
