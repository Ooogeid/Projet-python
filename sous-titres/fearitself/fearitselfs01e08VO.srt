1
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,070
Derek ! What are you doing ?

2
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,560
I'm going out there, uncle rowdy.

3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,280
You're doing no such thing.

4
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,680
Well, someone's got to do something.

5
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,760
Where's our daddy ?

6
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,820
I don't know, tim.

7
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,230
You know, if you cared,
you'd be out there.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,810
Marching into those mountains
in the middle of that storm ?

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,110
Only a fool would do that.

10
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,830
Well, with the weather, the
sheriff isn't looking either,

11
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,650
so you tell me what's being done.

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,400
Look at you. You're not
even dressed for the weather.

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,820
Where's your gear ?

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,570
Where's your sense, derek ?

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,680
You can't tell me what to do.

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,180
I can, and I am.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,230
This isn't even your ranch.

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,250
Yeah. You aren't our daddy.
You just work for him.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,940
Won't have a thing to do with it.

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,150
Making your mama sick with worry, wandering
into those mountains, you and your dad both.

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,660
- Think that's a good idea, son ?
- Whatever.

22
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,190
Leave it. Just leave it.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,840
I'll ride out there again.

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,330
Go on, get inside.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,880
Take your brother.

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,440
You know he needs looking after.

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,340
Come on.

28
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,780
Helena ?

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,070
What's going on ?

30
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,610
Your son just put me on notice.

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,430
I'm headed back out there.

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,320
The storm's still bad, rowdy.

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,740
Just going to check the foothills.

34
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,360
I'll be back tonight.

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,230
Grady had no businesses
leading that hunting party.

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,930
He may own this land. He
don't spend time on it.

37
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,300
He's no rider.

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,670
He don't know weather.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,770
He's no rider ? Like you ?

40
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,140
When we were little, we
played cowboy all the time.

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,650
He thinks 'cause he owns this
spread, he's a real one, but he ain'T.

42
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,180
Grady's still playing.

43
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,970
In these parts, that
will get you killed.

44
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,950
I know. I'm worried.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,630
But I can't help but
think that... Grady ?

46
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,600
What ?

47
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,290
Oh, my god.

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,380
Stay here. The kids !

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,560
Grady !

50
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,830
Dad ! Dad !

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,780
Eddie bear ! Help !

52
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,720
It's grady !

53
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,000
- Grady !
- Grady !

54
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,830
It's me. Rowdy.

55
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,500
- It's ok.
- Dad !

56
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,540
- It's ok !
- Dad !

57
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,110
We got you.

58
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,460
See, I told you. I
told you he'd come back.

59
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,000
He's ok !

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,770
You're going to be ok.

64
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,940
Did you see his fingers ?

65
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,430
And his ears ?

66
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,890
That's frostbite, tim.

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,620
He was up there over a week in the cold.

68
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,160
I want him to be better.

69
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,920
Look.

70
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,140
I know you don't understand
the way things are right now.

71
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,680
It's not your fault.

72
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,270
But this is serious, tim.

73
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,060
We got to be ready for whatever
happens, and it might not be good.

74
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,830
Is he going to die ?

75
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,560
I don't know. I don't know.

76
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,470
How is he ?

77
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,170
Alive, which seems like a
small miracle, if you ask me.

78
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,250
- He was out there 10 days ?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,060
- And he's the only one who came back ?
- Right.

80
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
How do you suppose he
survived all this time ?

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,660
He must have found something to eat out
there, but he's lost a lot of weight.

82
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,570
Well, is he going to be ok ?

83
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,120
Well, we need to keep him hydrated,
and he's got to eat something.

84
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,470
Make sure he rests, and I'll be back
in about 2 days to check on him. Ok ?

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,300
Did he... did
he say anything ?

86
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,670
Yes, he did.

87
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,900
Says he's hungry.

88
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,220
Need a hand ?

89
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,850
You need a hand with that ?

90
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,020
No.

91
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,270
Where's your brother ?

92
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know.

93
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,160
Derek !

94
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,010
You need to keep an eye on tim.

95
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,710
This has been extra hard on him.

96
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,820
Where do you get off
telling me what to do ?

97
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,730
You're not my dad.

98
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm just telling you
'cause it needs saying.

99
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,480
Where do you get off
telling me anything ?

100
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,510
My dad had to buy this
ranch for you to run

101
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,840
'cause you screwed up
everything you've ever touched.

102
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,020
He's taken a loss on it every year
just so you have a place to live.

103
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,550
You got a mouth on you, boy.

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,940
Yeah. So do you.

105
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,730
Maybe you should keep it off my mother.

106
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,510
You should be inside helping your mother
instead of trying to pick a fight with me

107
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,190
when all I do is keep this
place from falling apart.

108
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,950
Be a whole lot easier if my
dad just died, wouldn't it ?

109
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,430
You don't know what
you think you know, kid.

110
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,290
Helena...

111
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,400
derek would love to carry
that tray up to his dad.

112
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,300
Is that so, derek, honey ?

113
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,050
Yes, mom. I'd love to.

114
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,930
- Then you hang up that jacket
when you come back down. - Yeah.

115
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,660
You know, something's
not right with grady.

116
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,170
He doesn't even look like himself.

117
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,030
It's...it's...
it's in his eyes.

118
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,250
It's like his...

119
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,280
it's like he's somebody else.

120
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,450
He's been through hell, is all.

121
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,710
If he wasn't still frozen
right now, I'd go upstairs,

122
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,730
and I'd strangle the life out of him.

123
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,720
Dad !

124
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,970
Derek ?

125
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,390
Honey, what happened ?

126
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,170
He did it, mom.

127
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,400
Well, honey, your father's very sick.

128
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,970
You have to help him with these things.

129
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,400
You can't just set the
tray down on top of him.

130
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,300
Mom, he knocked the tray out of my hand.

131
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,250
What's the matter with him ?

132
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,570
Grady ?

133
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,860
Baby, are you awake ?

134
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,810
You...

135
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,010
what is it ? What can I get you ?

136
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,990
Taste good.

137
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,220
Eddie bear !

138
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,540
- Eddie bear !
- What ?

139
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,750
See anything ?

140
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,320
We heard the commotion, then it stopped.

141
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,730
Is that chestnut ?

142
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,640
Ah, damn it !

143
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,110
What would have done this ?

144
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,990
Maybe it was a grizzly.
Maybe it wasn'T.

145
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,640
Look, everybody knows that
I run things around here,

146
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,220
and with chuck and jasper still
missing, it's just me and eddie bear.

147
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,940
I think you should drive on out
here and take a look for yourself.

148
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,370
"Maybe thursday," huh ?

149
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,800
Sure don't want to put you out, gordon.

150
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,420
Come in.

151
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,630
- You find anything ?
- Nope.

152
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,480
- But I'd like to talk to grady.
- All right.

153
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,770
I still haven't told him about the mare.

154
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,120
No sense getting him riled up.

155
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,940
I'd say he already knows.

156
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,930
Eddie.

157
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,460
How is he ?

158
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,660
Well, I heard him
pacing around last night,

159
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,510
so I came upstairs to sit
with him and calm him down.

160
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,240
Do me a favor... wait
for me downstairs.

161
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,340
You, too.

162
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,540
So, what you got to say for yourself ?

163
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,320
You look scared. Should I be ?

164
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,830
When I was a boy, my uncle went missing.

165
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,500
2 weeks it was, lost in the mountains.

166
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,990
When he came back, he didn't
look right... not at all.

167
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,290
How did he look, eddie ?

168
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,790
He looked... like you.

169
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,640
I've seen what happened to my
uncle's family when he came back...

170
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,750
torn apart.

171
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,420
Well...

172
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,890
that's not what's tearing apart the
edlund family now, is it, eddie bear ?

173
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,060
You've been around.

174
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,820
What do you think ?

175
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,590
Whatever it is, you
best let it go, grady.

176
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,760
Whatever it is that's eating you,

177
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,900
if you don't let it
go, it will devour you.

178
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,220
It already has !

179
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,570
Now, you better put that big,
bad knife away now, eddie.

180
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,920
No one's going to take
kindly to a bitter, old indian

181
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:03,210
slitting the throat of a well-appointed
ranch owner from the city,

182
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,010
now, are they ?

183
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,750
You've been good to this place, eddie.

184
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,800
I'd be sorry if it was your undoing.

185
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,180
You expect me to believe that
my brother, who almost died,

186
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,600
hasn't strength even to get out of bed,

187
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,830
killed a horse in the middle of
the night with his own bare hands ?

188
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,860
Horse ain't the only thing he killed.

189
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,150
He's a whole lot
stronger than you think.

190
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,660
Ever hear of the windigo ?

191
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,080
Sounds familiar.

192
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,700
Spirit of the lonely places,

193
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,020
a hateful thing that lives in the
cold winds of the high mountains.

194
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,070
Gets inside people when
they're weak, starving.

195
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,420
What the hell you
talking about, eddie bear ?

196
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,420
My uncle...

197
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:26,870
lived on the res all his
life, had a rage in him,

198
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,790
felt like his people had been wronged.

199
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,170
When he got lost up in that mountain,

200
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,140
the windigo got inside,
took control of his spirit.

201
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,630
When he came back, he weren't the same.

202
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,810
And then, livestock
started going missing.

203
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,150
People started going missing.

204
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,620
The word got out.

205
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,140
The sheriff showed up
and gunned him down.

206
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,020
That's when I left the res for good.

207
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,460
You don't really believe your
uncle had a ghost inside him.

208
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,900
Don't matter what you call it.

209
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,100
It's a madness. It's fierce.

210
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,210
Its hunger can't be satisfied.

211
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,720
It's an anger can't be settled.

212
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,800
It's the windigo.

213
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,400
Seen it in my uncle.

214
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,150
Now, I see it in grady.

215
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,770
Baby...

216
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,770
Grady.

217
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,720
Baby.

218
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,040
Wh...
wh-where am I ?

219
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,700
What... what
happened ?

220
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,830
You're at home, and I
have no idea what happened.

221
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,980
You're going to have to tell us.

222
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,110
What's the last thing you
remember before waking up here ?

223
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,560
We...

224
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,390
we got lost. Turned all around.

225
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,430
Had to hole up in a
shallow cave to stay warm.

226
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,990
There was more and more
wind, and then, it snowed.

227
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,780
Chuck and billy went for help.

228
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,750
Never came back.

229
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,640
It was just me...

230
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,900
and jasper in the cave.

231
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,580
I couldn't even keep a fire lit.

232
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,050
And then, I remember...

233
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,010
a voice.

234
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,560
At my ear and in my head.

235
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,460
I'll save you.

236
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,730
Just let me... in.

237
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,300
That's what the voice said.

238
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,160
Y-you just have To eat...

239
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,010
You know, jasper was...

240
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,770
so weak by then...

241
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,780
I couldn't help him.

242
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,760
I had to eat.

243
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,840
I had to.

244
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,030
Well...

245
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,130
I...

246
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,970
I guess I'll tell the kids
that you're feeling better.

247
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,100
They'll be
so happy...

248
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,960
The kids.

249
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,050
Why don't you just lie down, honey ?

250
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,480
I mean, we should call dr. Morgan.

251
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,570
Oh, I don't need a doctor.

252
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,460
I feel fine.

253
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,250
Baby, please, go back to bed.

254
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,620
Let her go.

255
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,630
Or what ?

256
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,310
Don't make me answer that question.

257
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,640
You all right ?

258
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,600
What's happening to him ?

259
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,740
Please...

260
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,220
go back to bed, brother.

261
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,070
Where are the boys ?

262
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,190
Make it stop. Make it
stop ! Please, make it stop !

263
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,990
- Tim !We got
to... - no !

264
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,550
- We got to go !
- No !

265
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,740
Come on, boys. Out of there.

266
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,520
Go, boys !

267
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,030
What's on your mind, eddie bear ?

268
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,840
I'm sorry to say, you
should have shot him.

269
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,160
You know it's got to be done.

270
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,830
- No !
- He's insane !

271
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,240
I'd get the boys out of
here. Get them to my trailer.

272
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,040
I'm not leaving my dad, all
right ? I'm not leaving him !

273
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,800
You think that's your father
up there ? Well it's not.

274
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,760
- Rowdy !
- What ? What do you want me to say ?

275
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,540
I'd say get out of
here now ! It's not safe.

276
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,910
Derek.

277
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,650
- What's going on, mom ?
- Honey, did you see him ?

278
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,020
That's not grady anymore.

279
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,810
Something happened to
him in those mountains.

280
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,430
Come on. Let's go. Right now !

281
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,380
Go. Go with them. Make sure
they make it to the trailer.

282
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,440
- Could be... By now.
- All right. Go up.

283
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,450
See if he's there.

284
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,280
I'll flush him out if
he's not gone already.

285
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,530
You get him on the porch,
I'll get a clean shot at him.

286
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,740
Ok. I'm pretty handy with a hatchet.

287
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,250
See who gets him first.

288
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,360
It's ok. It's ok.

289
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,930
He's coming back.

290
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,230
Nothing. Ain't seen neither one of them.

291
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,830
I'm headed back. Take it.

292
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,890
I'm not going to kill my father.

293
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,310
You love your mother and your brother ?

294
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,040
- Obviously... - then
shut up and take it.

295
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm going to be out there. You
need to protect them. Take it.

296
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,880
Rowdy, you going back there,
you're going to need that gun.

297
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,240
I'll get another one from the rack.

298
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,330
No ! No, you can't hurt him !

299
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,530
He's just sick. He's not bad.

300
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,370
- Keys to the truck.
- Stay.

301
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,890
Rowdy !

302
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,820
If I don't come back...

303
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,220
tell the boys the truth for
me when the time's right.

304
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,810
He'll eat...

305
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,650
you all...

306
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,150
Grady !

307
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,540
Who do you think you're fooling ?

308
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,310
Get up out of that bed.

309
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,710
Can'T.

310
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,900
Too sick.

311
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,350
You killed eddie bear !

312
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,490
Had to.

313
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,180
Had to do it.

314
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:30,690
I'm so... hungry.

315
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,690
I can't help it, rowdy.

316
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,110
Please...

317
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,310
help me... brother.

318
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,850
I don't know how to help you.

319
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,990
Well...

320
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,650
that works out just fine
for you, then, doesn't it ?

321
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,100
What's that supposed to mean ?

322
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,890
You've always wanted to get rid of me.

323
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,600
No. You got it wrong, brother.

324
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,960
So you could have...

325
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,860
everything I worked for.

326
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,320
That's not how it is.

327
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,780
Everything...

328
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,060
I care about.

329
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,830
Well, I hope you're happy now...

330
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,330
brother.

331
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,530
Forgive me, grady.

332
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,860
It's over.

333
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,950
Up, up, up. We got to get out of here !

334
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,710
Up. Up !

335
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,860
- Now ?
- Now !

336
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,210
Get in there. Go.

337
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,750
Derek, give me the gun. Stay
back. Get all the way back.

338
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,690
Please, grady.

339
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,990
Please go away.

340
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,160
Don't do it, helena.

341
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,410
No, baby. Don't do it.

342
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,460
Where's rowdy ?

343
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,130
Just... just put the gun down.

344
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,690
What'd you do with him ?

345
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,360
I will tell you what happened,

346
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,570
just put the gun down.

347
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,180
No.

348
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,390
Helena.

349
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,800
I brought dinner !

350
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,500
Get out a nice-sized cooking pot.

351
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,470
Why are you doing this ?

352
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,420
Do it.

353
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,230
Fill it with a couple
of quarts of water.

354
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,880
Start the stove.

355
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,960
Do you even know what you're doing ?

356
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,480
Here's an onion and a carrot.

357
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,380
Are you still in there, baby ?

358
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,760
Stove, please !

359
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,690
Bring it to a rolling boil.

360
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,890
You were today.

361
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,100
When you look in my
eyes, I could see you.

362
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,480
You're not gone completely.

363
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,150
I want my husband back.

364
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,320
Well...

365
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,360
we need to have a family meeting.

366
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,120
Oh, god, grady.

367
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,720
You and me, the kids.

368
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,940
Where are the little buggers, anyway ?

369
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,030
Well, as soon as we've had a
bite to eat, we'll go find them.

370
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,510
I wonder if they're
still hiding in the barn.

371
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,930
You let it in, now
you tell it to get out.

372
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,520
Cut it up.

373
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,160
What ?

374
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,230
Cut it up ! And cook it.

375
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,160
No.

376
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,630
It's just meat.

377
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,340
- No !
- Do it !

378
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,540
All right, all right, all right,
all right. All right, I'll do it.

379
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,160
That's better.

380
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,410
Oh, god.

381
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,120
Oh, god.

382
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,360
Nice-sized chunks, please.

383
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,950
Into the pot.

384
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,140
We must tidy up for dinner.

385
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,080
Soup's on.

386
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,150
I've worked up quite an appetite.

387
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,630
How about you, helena ? Bowl.

388
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,860
Another.

389
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,500
Well, you haven't even eaten that.

390
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,420
For you.

391
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,630
It's all for you.

392
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,290
Another for you !

393
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,030
- But...but I'm
not hungry. - Eat !

394
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,690
You said for me to cook.

395
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,410
I cooked, I did it. Now sit down. Now.

396
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,770
Eat.

397
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,950
Look, I'm eating.

398
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,190
Your beloved rowdy.

399
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,570
My brother.

400
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:31,790
You know, when I was
up in those mountains,

401
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,360
lost,

402
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,270
thinking about all
I had to live for...

403
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:46,170
you, the boys.

404
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,960
My brother.

405
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,760
I could feel a rage
growing up inside of me.

406
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:01,760
A rage that would not let me die.

407
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,500
A rage inside.

408
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,680
And I let it in.

409
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,290
You did this to me.

410
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,820
You and my own brother.

411
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,730
You hit me.

412
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,790
Put my mother down, you bastard !

413
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,170
Mom !

414
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,660
Mom, are you ok ?

415
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,180
Don't worry about me.
Go help your brother.

416
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,020
No, mom, it's...it's
deep. It's deep.

417
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,160
- Ok. Go help your brother.
- No, no.

418
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,540
I'm fine. I'm fine.

419
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,620
- Don't die, please.
- I'm fine.

420
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,030
- Don't die.
- I'm fine.

421
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,510
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Mom.

422
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,360
I'm fine.

423
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,840
Tim.

424
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,640
Tim.

425
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,620
Tim.

426
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,990
Come out, boy.

427
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,150
Let him go.

428
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,120
- Oh, glad you're here.
- Don'T.

429
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:12,010
We should be together.

430
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:18,140
All of us... your mother,
rowdy, you, and tim,

431
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,970
inside of me, to make me stronger.

432
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,130
Daddy, let him go, please.

433
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,720
"Daddy" ? I'm not your daddy.

434
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,290
Didn't your mother tell you that ?

435
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,050
Tim ? Tim, get up. Get up, get up !

436
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,210
Come on.

437
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,670
Come on.

438
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,780
What are we gonna do now ?

439
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,350
Listen to me.

440
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,550
Mom's hurt bad, ok ? We have
to get her to the doctor.

441
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,030
I have the keys to rowdy's truck.

442
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,170
No, uncle rowdy said we're never
allowed to use his truck ever.

443
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,730
Uncle rowdy is dead, tim. He's dead.

444
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,240
And he's not our
uncle, don't you get it ?

445
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,640
I'm sorry.

446
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,740
I don't mean to ask so
many questions, it's just...

447
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,750
I know, I know.Me, too.

448
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,200
Look, we got to get
mom and get moving, ok ?

449
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,660
Derek.

450
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,440
It's over, boys.

451
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,060
Derek ! No ! No ! Derek !

452
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,920
No. Get your hands off my kids.

453
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,480
Derek. Derek.
