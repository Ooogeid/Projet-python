1
00:00:02,541 --> 00:00:04,912
Please. Don't. Don't hurt me. Please?

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,851
- Where's the boy?
- Stop!

3
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:12,361
You... You... You can't do this.

4
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:16,010
Don't hurt me!

5
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:21,316
You got one minute.
You got...

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,690
You got 30 seconds or
I'm going to put your eye out.

7
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:31,368
Where's the boy?

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,286
What boy?

9
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:37,290
Where's the boy?
The boy!

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,080
Rory? Rory? Rory?

11
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,842
Where is he? Where is he?

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,057
Where's the boy? Where's the boy?

13
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:52,564
Upstairs.

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,770
- Out of the way! Out of the way!
- What did you do to him?

15
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,192
Matthew?

16
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:14,001
Matthew?

17
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,654
Matthew, I'm a cop.

18
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:33,598
Coming through.

19
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,873
<i>He's in shock, dehydrated,
but he'll be OK.</i>

20
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,312
Everything's gonna be fine
now, kiddo. Wait and see.

21
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,019
- Good job, Harry.
- Thank you, brother.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,416
Way to go.

23
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,272
Better hope he lives.

24
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,247
It had to be done.
The bastard wasn't talKing.

25
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,270
I.A.D. is gonna be all over
your ass for this one.

26
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,546
- Put 'em back.
- Harry.

27
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:06,637
Harry.

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,309
You'll never forget this.

29
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,911
I won't let you.

Fear Itself
Season01 Episode02

34
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,005
Strangling suspects...

35
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,963
Beating suspects.

36
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,943
My God. Burning suspects?

37
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:36,735
15 pages of this crap,

38
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:40,856
and yet you never once used
your firearm in the line of duty.

39
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,809
Why not?

40
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,522
Self-control.

41
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,719
Aren't you apologetic at all, Harry?

42
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:50,145
Not really.

43
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,101
And why is that?

44
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,000
Sometimes you gotta do
a wrong to make things right.

45
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,776
I'm not so sure Rory Bemmel...
would agree with that sentiment.

46
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,657
What's it gonna be, counselor?

47
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:15,789
You gonna lock me up and
swallow the key? What?

48
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,858
You saved a senator's child, Harry.

49
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:21,014
That's a pretty big bargaining chip.

50
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,143
100 hours. Community service.

51
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,948
But...

52
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:29,341
say good-bye to your badge...

53
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,119
and your pension.

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,470
Son of a bitch.

55
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,260
<i>Yo, Harry?</i>

56
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,113
<i>FIFTEEN YEARS LATER</i>

57
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:44,649
<i>You get those caffeine pills I left you?</i>

58
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,630
<i>You know I got you
the cherry chewable ones.</i>

59
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:49,509
<i>For your old teeth.</i>

60
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,642
You young me one more time,

61
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:57,897
- I'll make sure you regret it.
- <i>You're gonna have to catch me first.</i>

62
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:01,985
<i>The label say take 2.
You know that means take 10.</i>

63
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:04,817
We got some here!

64
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:07,722
Lovebirds comin' your way, Harry.

65
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,830
<i>We saw action!</i>

66
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,325
You think they're gonna get

67
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,610
right to the eel
in the cave game or what?

68
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,751
No foreplay?

69
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,078
<i>Or just straight at it?</i>

70
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,166
Give me a name, babe.

71
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,200
Give me a name.

72
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
<i>I want to show you something.
I want to show you something.</i>

73
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
<i>Oh, Richard!</i>

74
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:37,442
I got a name.

75
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:38,631
<i>Oh, Janet!</i>

76
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:43,949
<i>- Get over here, get over here.
- Oh, I'm here, baby.</i>

77
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,811
<i>Oh, my wife never does that.</i>

78
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,115
<i>- I love that.
- What's wrong with her?</i>

79
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,600
<i>Do it again.</i>

80
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,710
Right there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,717
<i>- You like that? You like that?
- I love that.</i>

82
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,163
That is your husband's voice, right?

83
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,639
Yeah.

84
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,497
That's Richard.

85
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,872
This will help
with the divorce proceedings.

86
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,623
How much do I owe you, Mr. Bender?

87
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,479
2,000 dollars.

88
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,468
And 4,000 to destroy the other tape.

89
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,839
What other tape?

90
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,450
<i>- Douglas!
- Oh, baby.</i>

91
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,556
Richard know you're screwing his bro?

92
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,880
<i>You like it like that, huh?</i>

93
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,950
So, the ladies await.
Sure you don't want to go?

94
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,069
- No. I got paperwork to catch up on.
- All right. It's your call.

95
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:57,170
James?

96
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,333
What is that about?

97
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,372
Yeah. Just picked
this baby up the other day.

98
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:05,492
Sweet, right?

99
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,783
I thought I told you,
no guns on the job.

100
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,593
Come on, Harry, it's for protection.

101
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:13,594
There are a lot of sickos.
It's for protection.

102
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:16,560
I never want to see that gun again.
You understand?

103
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:18,107
I'm not kidding.

104
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,728
All right. Fine. You got it.

105
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,316
"Officer."

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,746
I'll catch you in the A.M.

107
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,680
Bender investigations?

108
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:37,150
Thanks, Tom.

109
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:48,239
Mr. Bender?

110
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,887
I'm Meredith King.

111
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,292
Of course. Have a seat.

112
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,079
I've got a very serious problem.

113
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:10,012
I hope I can be of help.

114
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:11,938
My husband is...

115
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,706
is having an affair.

116
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:20,135
Maybe more than one. I'm not sure.
He brings them...

117
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:22,313
back to our home when I'm gone.

118
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:25,109
I often work nights. I'm a
social worker for the city.

119
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,802
I want you to give me
the evidence,

121
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:34,308
Mr. Bender.

122
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,315
The evidence I need to make him pay.

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,504
That's my job, Mrs. King.
Making them pay.

124
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:49,996
Give me your address. I'll have a
van out front to eyeball the place.

125
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:51,380
A van? No, no.

126
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,489
Jack would notice a van
outside the house.

127
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,056
He already thinks that I know.

128
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:58,441
- That's pretty much how we do things.
- There's a place, a house

129
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,787
across the street.

130
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,843
It's vacant.

131
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,497
That's perfect, right?

132
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:07,193
That'll work.

133
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,191
Thank you.

134
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,442
Thank you for helping me.

135
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:47,191
Great.

136
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,983
Great.

137
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:17,968
Close the door, man.

138
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,990
Harry, I've seen some
hellholes in my day.

139
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:32,111
This looks like the helliest
and the holiest.

140
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,542
Oh, God.

141
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:40,615
I never thought I'd be looking
forward to that nasty old van.

142
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:42,857
Stop the chatter, man.

143
00:11:56,963 --> 00:12:00,199
It's not great, but set up the remote
camera here on a three-hour loop.

144
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:03,221
I'm gonna go find
a better angle upstairs.

145
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:06,379
You got it.

146
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,791
<i>You know what?</i>

147
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,820
<i>Now, that I look at it, we might be able
to fix this place up.</i>

148
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,448
<i>Make it into something nice, you know?</i>

149
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,555
- <i>Yo, Harry! I'm finished down here!</i>
- Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

150
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:04,616
Got a good angle up here!

151
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:08,185
Take the van, go down the road,
and find a good surveillance spot.

152
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:09,870
Be discreet!

153
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,590
"Discreet"'s my middle name.

154
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,915
I hope so, pal.

155
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,660
All right, so, it's 10:00, Harry.

156
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,884
Still nobody home.

157
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,644
Guess he's banging her
at the office tonight.

158
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,880
<i>Yo, Harry. I was wonderin'.</i>

159
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,592
<i>You, uh, you ever get, you know,</i>

160
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:47,647
<i>hot, excited listening in
on all these little trysts?</i>

161
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,148
James,

162
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,792
shut up.

163
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,146
<i>So, wifey's keeping you happy then, huh?</i>

164
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:57,135
What was that?

165
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:59,424
<i>I said, "so, wifey's
keeping you happy then, huh?"</i>

166
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:01,370
No, no. I'm picKing something up here.

167
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,150
Where? From the house?

168
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,490
<i>Before he could even open his mouth,
this guy starts hitting him.</i>

169
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,392
I got a light on. Second floor.

170
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,313
I don't see it.

171
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,571
Second floor. Far side.

172
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:17,690
Someone is in her house.

173
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,279
<i>How? I didn't clock any cars coming by</i>

174
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:31,660
Aren't you getting this?

175
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,499
<i>I got nothing but an empty house.</i>

176
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:35,060
<i>Before he left, he kicked him.</i>

177
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,713
<i>Once in the head, and then in the ear.</i>

178
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,007
<i>This guy's a monster.</i>

179
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,592
Must have been an auto timer,

180
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,630
radio frequencies, something.

181
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:02,890
Just keep your eye on the front door
this time. All right? Can you do that?

182
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,491
Harry. I swear to you.
Nobody went into that house.

183
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,146
James, someone's in here.

184
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:43,340
Where? Where you are? That old house?

185
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,844
Yo, Harry, you find anyone?

186
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,925
Let's go! Let's go, go!

187
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:38,500
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Nothing.

188
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,168
- Not good enough. What are you doing?
- Piss off, old man.

189
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:43,740
- Answer me.
- It was a dare. It was just a dare!

190
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,950
- A dare?
- To stay the night.

191
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,854
Don't tell my mom, all right? Please?

192
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:49,799
Why would someone dare you to stay here?

193
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,641
'Cause of what happened. To those kids.

194
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:55,531
What kids? What are you talKing about?

195
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,121
It killed them, man!

196
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,510
What killed them?

197
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,249
The house.

198
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:01,898
This house.

199
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,244
Get the hell off of me!

200
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,663
<i>Big, bad Harry wigged
out by a couple tweens!</i>

201
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,188
You all right, man?

202
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:16,853
- Punk kids.
- Working your heart out.

203
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,879
<i>Oh, God. Oh, God.</i>

204
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:56,574
<i>I don't want to do it.</i>

205
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:58,637
<i>Do it!</i>

206
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,604
<i>Oh, God.</i>

207
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,832
James, I got 'em.

208
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,636
Someone's in the house.

209
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,296
I got 'em, James. First floor.

210
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,670
<i>It's so hard.</i>

211
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:24,213
There you go, baby. Have a good time.

212
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,340
<i>Take your time.</i>

213
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,812
Just say his name.

214
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,021
Oh, God. He hurt me so bad.

215
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,740
<i>Good. Just tell me
exactly how it happened.</i>

216
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,600
<i>He burned me with his
cigar! All over my thighs.</i>

217
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,821
<i>Listen. Just give me
a badge number, a name.</i>

218
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:45,500
<i>I can take down a formal complaint.</i>

219
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,314
<i>His name wasSeigel!</i>

220
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,279
I came as soon as you called.

221
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,962
Mrs. King, I'm not going
to be able to...

222
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:40,242
finish the investigation.

223
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:44,128
That's yours. Minus
one night, of course.

224
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,520
I don't... I don't
want my money.

225
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,570
See, I want proof
that my husband is having an affair.

226
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:54,700
He never showed last night.

227
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,877
OK. Well, sometimes
he sleeps at the office.

228
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,219
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to try again tonight.

229
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:03,496
What is it? There's something else.

230
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,507
Tell me, Harry. What's wrong?

231
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,853
I'm a good listener.
It's what I do.

232
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,587
If you knew some of the stories
that people have told me.

233
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,534
Broken lives, lost souls.

234
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,809
But I can promise you this...

235
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,414
no one feels worse after telling them.

236
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,313
Come on.

237
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,629
I've done some bad things.

238
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,622
Lots... of bad things.

239
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,928
We've all got skeletons.

240
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:50,646
Well, mine are starting to come back.

241
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,913
What do you mean?

242
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,678
That house I'm staking out in...
It's making me see things.

243
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,229
It's just a old house, Harry.

244
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,857
It's...

245
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:05,598
bricks and wood.
It couldn't possibly...

246
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:12,659
Harry...

247
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:18,489
Listen... my brother...

248
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:26,084
my brother, he made some big mistakes.

249
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:28,566
Big mistakes.

250
00:22:29,701 --> 00:22:32,334
But every night my father would
come into his room and say,

251
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:34,607
"tomorrow brings another day."

252
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:38,372
Do you understand that, Harry?
We've all done...

253
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:39,626
bad things,

254
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:42,791
but tomorrow...

255
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:47,186
you can always try to make up for them.

256
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:54,230
But today...

257
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:59,793
Please, I'm begging you.
Please go back there, Harry.

258
00:23:00,976 --> 00:23:01,901
Please.

259
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:04,330
Help me.

260
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:08,268
And maybe...

261
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:11,849
somehow...

262
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:15,649
I can help you.

263
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:36,272
You're gonna die, man.

264
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:39,670
I had a date tonight, Harry.
I thought the gig was over.

265
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:41,196
Changed my mind.

266
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,042
- What's this?
- That's a video loop from last night.

267
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:47,721
Check it out. See if any lights go on.

268
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:51,020
"Lights"? Harry, nobody
came home last night.

269
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:52,532
Just check it out.

270
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,352
Yo, you all right?

271
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:14,297
Mercy.

272
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:33,320
Yo, Harry.

273
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,748
What's up?

274
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:40,384
Look... I'm watching that tape.

275
00:24:40,877 --> 00:24:42,400
And big surprise.

276
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,200
Nothing happened last night.

277
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,208
No cars,

278
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,404
<i>no lights, no voices. Nothing.</i>

279
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,725
<i>Now, don't take this personally,
Harry, but, um...</i>

280
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,980
<i>maybe you fell asleep?
You know, dreamed it all?</i>

281
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,989
<i>What time is it, kids?</i>

282
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:04,520
- <i>Look, I was thinking...</i>
- There are kids in the house.

283
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,340
James... there are kids in the house.

284
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:09,314
What?

285
00:25:12,184 --> 00:25:14,014
Did she say she had kids?

286
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,075
All right, Harry, you know what?

287
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:22,379
I'm done, man. I'm done.

288
00:25:22,714 --> 00:25:25,258
When you sober up, you can hit me back.

289
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,724
I'm signing off.

290
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,019
James?

291
00:25:56,594 --> 00:25:57,584
Oh, no...

292
00:25:59,564 --> 00:26:01,023
James! James!

293
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,030
There's an intruder in her house!

294
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:06,119
James! Come on, James!

295
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,994
- <i>Call the police!</i>
- How big is it?

296
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,660
Well, how big you want it?

297
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:16,620
Damn right I keep it loaded.

298
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,269
Don't you touch them. You son...

299
00:26:58,258 --> 00:26:59,249
FOR SALE

300
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:32,445
Who's messing with me! Who is it? James!

301
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,676
You wanna play games?
OK. I'll play games.

302
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:43,039
<i>He burned my face with a cigar!</i>

303
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:45,935
<i>- He kept slapping me!
- He cut me.</i>

304
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,341
Where are you?

305
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:05,644
I know you're in here!

306
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,009
James!

307
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,295
Where are you?

308
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:37,585
James! Look at me.

309
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:42,989
Why are you so bad?

310
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:05,979
Harry.

311
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:20,140
<i>You got the wrong guy, man.</i>

312
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:23,150
<i>Why are you so bad?</i>

313
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,914
Why are you so bad?

314
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:36,461
I told you I was gonna change.

315
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,341
But you killed me anyway.

316
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,539
This is a dream, dream, dream.

317
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:49,276
Why are you so bad?

318
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:56,200
I didn't deserve this, Harry!

319
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,680
I never hurt anybody
who didn't deserve it!

320
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,959
- That girl you burned?
- <i>He hurt me so bad.</i>

321
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,180
- She was innocent.
- <i>He burned me.</i>

322
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,800
- Now all she knows his pain.
- ??

323
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:07,100
She... she...

324
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,690
- That kid you kicked senseless?
- <i>You kicked me eight times, so stop.</i>

325
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,232
- He was just a witness.
- Guess what...

326
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,338
Why are you so bad!

327
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:21,340
I am not so bad! I'm not so bad!

328
00:31:21,943 --> 00:31:24,349
- Why are you so bad?
- I am not...

329
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:26,439
so... bad!

330
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,090
<i>Oh, well, howdy...</i>

331
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,800
<i>doody, boys and girls!</i>

332
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,260
<i>Hey, there, little guy.</i>

333
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,109
<i>And Clara Belle, look at
all the kids at home.</i>

334
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,202
<i>What time is it, kids?</i>

335
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:05,180
- Hey, you wanna see something neat?
- Sure.

336
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,885
Pop's gun!

337
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:30,709
Someday I'm gonna be a cop.

338
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,520
Just like him.

339
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:33,912
Bang!

340
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,246
Don't!

341
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,210
It's not loaded, dummy!
Pop keeps the bullets in here.

342
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:42,087
- You wanna hold it?
- No.

343
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:44,000
- Don't be a baby.
- I'm not a baby!

344
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:45,528
Then hold the gun.

345
00:33:01,032 --> 00:33:02,560
Do you wanna play one ranger?

346
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,880
- Sure.
- OK.

347
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,989
No.

348
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:12,479
No!

349
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:15,749
What was that?

350
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,710
- Oh my God!
- Max.

351
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,381
No, no, no, no, Max!

352
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,679
It's better that this never happened.

353
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,872
Better for you.

354
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:32,577
Better for me.

355
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:35,558
Harry?

356
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:37,906
Harry!

357
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:43,938
I need us to make a pact.

358
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:46,379
A secret pact.

359
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,791
For how long?

360
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,200
Forever and ever.

361
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:56,204
Until you and me are in heaven...

362
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,589
with Max and mummy.

363
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:04,567
You understand me, Harry?

364
00:34:09,124 --> 00:34:10,783
Do you understand me?

365
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,150
They were like you, Harry.

366
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,769
Didn't accept the darkness inside them.

367
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,558
Didn't understand
what it was capable of.

368
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,094
Now they understand.

369
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,084
This place made them understand.

370
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,975
Now they're at peace.

371
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:24,742
Don't you want to be at peace, Harry?

372
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:30,548
You deserve this.

373
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,010
Make things right.

374
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:45,163
<i>Make it right. You deserve this.</i>

375
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,941
<i>Come on. Pay for it, Harry.</i>

376
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,153
There were 4.

377
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,861
The girl...

378
00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:00,584
<i>I told you I'd never
let you forget this.</i>

379
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:03,790
It was her. She survived.

380
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,274
No. I won't let you go!

381
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,587
- She wanted this to happen.
- <i>Harry...</i>

382
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:12,255
<i>you have to pay the price!</i>

383
00:36:26,361 --> 00:36:28,648
Yeah. I'm not sleeping.
What's up?

384
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,831
Harry, what's going on!

385
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,571
Frank? Harry Bender.

386
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:37,364
I need a billing address, this number

387
00:36:37,484 --> 00:36:41,121
917-555-0177.

388
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,746
- Yeah. I'll hold on.
- Where we going?

389
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:45,971
- To meredith's.
- Didn't we just leave meredith's?

390
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:49,243
It was a set up.
She tried to set me up, man.

391
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:51,474
It didn't work. She tried to scare me.

392
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:54,005
What you got? Pemberton apartments?

393
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,345
Thank you, brother. I owe you one.

394
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,932
Harry, tell me what's going on.

395
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,813
If I'm not back in 10 minutes,

396
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,330
well... call the police.

397
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:10,690
Call the police for what?
What are you gonna do?

398
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,191
Make her pay.

399
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,194
Harry. Harry. Harry!

400
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:19,282
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

401
00:37:32,255 --> 00:37:33,087
Yeah.

402
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,064
If I have to...

403
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,639
I will.

404
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,616
I promise you.

405
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:45,833
I promise.

406
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:20,246
Harry!

407
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:24,972
You knew what that house can do!
And you set me up to get me inside!

408
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:26,243
Why?

409
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,816
Why?

410
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,344
You better tell me right now.

411
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,674
Tell me now. Why? Why?

412
00:38:34,794 --> 00:38:36,631
- They told me to!
- Who told you to?

413
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:37,571
Rory!

414
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:40,309
Rory Bemmel.

415
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:46,385
The man you murdered and
walked away from Rory Bemmel.

416
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:48,023
He was my brother.

417
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:01,424
They promised me... they promised me
that I could see him again,

418
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:03,500
that I could talk to him and...

419
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,305
we went into that houseand we tried.

420
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:11,176
But that house... that house it just
shows you what it wants to show you.

421
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:16,023
One thing about yourself
you can't live with.

422
00:39:18,352 --> 00:39:21,404
<I>Took the three of them but see...
Rory...</i>

423
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:24,198
He protected me.

424
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,192
He's always protected me. You know why?

425
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,726
He saved me so I could find you.

426
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:34,316
And make you suffer...
like he suffered...

427
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,665
Harry.

428
00:39:38,494 --> 00:39:39,797
HarrySeigel.

429
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:44,573
You didn't make it easy for me, did you?
Changing your name.

430
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,226
But 15 years is a long time.

431
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,710
I found you.

432
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,549
So you could do what, scare me to death?

433
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,370
Well, look at me, Meredith!

434
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,815
It didn't work! I'm alive!

435
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,936
No. No, you're not, Harry.
You're dead.

436
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:05,350
In here.
I knew it the minute I saw you.

437
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,409
Rory was right. You're so easy.
All you needed was a little push.

438
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:12,310
- Shut up.
- What did they show you, Harry?

439
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,930
- What's the {\one}thing you can't live with?
- Nothing.

440
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,059
What's the one thing that
made you a monster?

441
00:40:37,596 --> 00:40:39,967
Harry. Listen to me.

442
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,027
It wasn't your fault, son. But...

443
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,419
sometimes you got to do a
wrong to make things right.

444
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,739
No one can ever know, Harry.

445
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,783
No one can ever know.

446
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:15,005
- It wasn't my fault.
- He was my brother.

447
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,460
- It was an accident.
- I was going to save him.

448
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,280
I didn't have a choice.

449
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:23,521
- I didn't have a choice.
- And you took him away.

450
00:41:24,812 --> 00:41:26,610
No! No! No!

451
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,913
- Do it! Do it! Shoot!
- No!

452
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,951
Do it, you monster!

453
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:34,076
Do it.

454
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:35,790
Do it.

455
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,479
Shoot.

456
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,339
- Do it.
- No.

457
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:46,440
No!

458
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,950
- I'm truly sorry for what I've done.
- No, you're not.

459
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,910
I know what I am. And I know why.

460
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:55,369
- You're gonna pay.
- Things are gonna be different now.

461
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:58,268
I'm gonna do the right thing now.
The right thing.

462
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,270
Help me!

463
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:07,089
Harry!

464
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,097
Harry?

465
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:13,103
Harry! Oh, my God! Harry!

466
00:42:13,702 --> 00:42:14,530
Harry!

467
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,589
It was an accident! It was an accident!
