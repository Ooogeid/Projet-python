1
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:07,405
Gorgeous.

2
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,390
Absolutely gorgeous.

3
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,741
Sam, it's a beautiful dress.

4
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:13,617
It's breathtaking.

5
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,010
That's as much as we can do
before the veil.

6
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,623
It's perfect. Thank you.

7
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:21,237
I hear you're scaling Mount Everest
or something for the honeymoon.

8
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:24,253
- Carlos is a climber.
- He thinks he's gonna make her one.

9
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:26,452
Has anyone seen my groom yet?

10
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:29,747
Come on. Of course Carlos is here,
and if he's not, he soon will be.

11
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:32,804
Ove d the last-minute thing,
especially on the big day.

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,768
"Guys love to do
this last-minute thing"?

13
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,517
You'd think a girl never got cold feet.

14
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:38,601
Are you?

15
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,146
Getting cold feet.

16
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:43,836
Would you check on my groom, please?

17
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:45,394
Yes, your highness.

18
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:46,901
I'll go with you.

19
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:49,291
Wait. Wait. Come here.

20
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:51,720
- Hands.
- OK.

21
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:56,260
All of us being together today

22
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,252
and, Kelly,
you flying all the way out here,

23
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:02,026
I just want you all to know
how much this means to me.

24
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:06,204
I keep thinking about
how we would spend whole afternoons

25
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,505
in front of a little toy tea set

26
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:10,592
planning a day just like this one.

27
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:13,839
- I know {\some of }you think it's too soon.
- None of us think that.

28
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,429
- We all just want you to be happy.
- We all like Carlos.

29
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:19,016
- We think he's wonderful.
- We do, Sammy.

30
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:21,330
We're just cluckin'
like nervous hens here.

31
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:23,187
What if he doesn't show up?

32
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,468
Then we'll marry you.

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,859
I will go find him.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,475
In case you haven't picked up on it,

35
00:02:31,595 --> 00:02:33,260
people don't want this to happen.

36
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,200
Who? Ruthie?

37
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,285
- No one wants this to happen.
- I wouldn't say that.

38
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:41,623
That's the problem. Nobody's saying it,
but they're all thinking it.

39
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,580
Come on. You've been here for 3 days.

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,586
What's everybody saying?
They think it's a mistake, right?

41
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:49,588
I didn't hear anybody say that.

42
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:52,473
- They think it's too soon.
- They don't think...

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,223
Yeah. I did hear that.
They think it's too soon.

44
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:02,535
- But they don't know him like I do.
- I'm like Switzerland, OK? I'm neutral.

45
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,481
Although... it is kind of weird
your brother isn't here.

46
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,880
You always said Steven
gave you the creeps.

47
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,199
Your big brother
has always given me the creeps,

48
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,525
but shouldn't he be here?

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,282
Isn't he the only family you have?

50
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,090
Steven is just sulking
because I'll be moving

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,833
out of the house. That's all.

52
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,497
He'll get over it.

53
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:25,500
How long have you known Carlos anyway?

54
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:27,803
Now you sound like my brother.

55
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:29,425
How long is long enough?

56
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:32,381
You know, what is the acceptable
amount of time to know someone?

57
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,843
For sex, about 10 seconds.

58
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,137
For making a lifetime commitment,
I don't know.

59
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:40,832
But women marry men all of the time.

60
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:42,266
How am I any different?

61
00:03:42,428 --> 00:03:44,180
The difference is
we know{\ a lot of} your boyfriends

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,520
did not treat you well,
and then they just disappeared.

63
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:50,667
And Carlos is the first one I've met
who I didn't feel was gonna do that.

64
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,410
And I think that's great.

65
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:55,320
OK, he's here.
He's down the hall, getting ready.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,794
Anyone think his friend Alan is cute?

67
00:03:58,168 --> 00:04:01,140
Father Chris asked me to give this
to you. It's from some woman out there.

68
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,730
Oh, forget Alan. Carlos' uncle,
he's this government guy or something.

69
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,275
Have you seen him?
He's really interesting,

70
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:09,168
and he says he has a twin.

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,375
He's like 50 years old.

72
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,916
- Who was she?
- Who is who?

73
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:16,426
The woman who gave the note.

74
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:19,386
Oh, I don't know. Father Chris said
she was wearing a red head scarf.

75
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:21,797
- It's probably money.
- Money's good.

76
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:24,173
OK, seriously, it's time to suit up.

77
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:26,144
You wanna go pee before we strap you in?

78
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:29,810
That is an excellent idea.

79
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,321
It's down the hall
to the right, 3 doors.

80
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,412
Think I told her the wrong way.

81
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:47,707
Not to the right.

82
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:50,973
That's Carlos' dressing room.

83
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:53,046
You can't see him before the wedding.

84
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:54,060
I know

85
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,480
the person you are marrying
is a serial killer.

Season 1 Episode 4

90
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:48,494
Who is it?

91
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,040
It's Sam.

92
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,665
Don't... Don't do that with your face.

93
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:55,450
Don't even think that.

94
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,793
Can I come in?

95
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:59,866
- She wants to come in.
- So let her in.

96
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,425
And no foolin' around, you two.
I'm watchin'.

97
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,030
I'm late. I have no excuse,

98
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,990
but just... just listen.

99
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,420
I lost my gas card, only to discover
that I didn't have any cash.

100
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,620
And, Alan, of course,
is completely useless.

101
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:18,503
I ended up having to pump $20 off some
guy{\ at the gas station} who I told it was my wedding day.

102
00:07:18,623 --> 00:07:20,200
I had to put something in the tank,

103
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,365
because I lost my wallet because I was
so damn nervous, but no, no,

104
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,158
I do not have cold feet.

105
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,286
How'bout you?

106
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,827
You got the cold feet?
What's goin' on down there?

107
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,664
It's cold?
Are they cold? No.

108
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:45,491
If it's such bad luck for you to see me,
then what are you doin' in here?

109
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:47,096
I just...

110
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,721
wanted to make sure it was really you.

111
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,236
It's me.

112
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,732
Come here.

113
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,228
Come here, I said.

114
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:08,229
Let's just do it right here.

115
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,888
Our vows.

116
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,920
What do you say we just...

117
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,650
we just forget the priest

118
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,077
and the flowers and the rings and...

119
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,230
all that stuff and just get it over
with right now...

120
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:27,719
go down to the lake,

121
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,344
get started with the rest of our life?

122
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,430
Right now.

123
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,072
From this day forward,

124
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:40,140
in sickness and in health

125
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:42,658
- till death...
- don't say that.

126
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,251
- Don't say what?
- Maybe this is bad luck.

127
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:49,990
- Don't say, "till death"? That...
- No, please don't say that.

128
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:52,540
I'm sorry. I... I don't like that.

129
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,102
I don't know why anyone
would wanna talk about death

130
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:57,623
on the happiest day of their life.

131
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:00,134
I agree with you totally.

132
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:02,590
Now let's make sure
the priest knows that as well.

133
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,400
We'll tell him that we're making,

134
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,965
a few script changes.

135
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,980
Just a few last-second script changes.

136
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,529
No "death." No parting.

137
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:17,935
I love you, Sam.

138
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,020
Why you're not kissing back.

139
00:09:29,232 --> 00:09:31,010
It's jitters, I guess.

140
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,810
Oh, my God. Look at me. I'm shaking.

141
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,542
What's going on with you?

142
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,391
What's this?

143
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,213
That...

144
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:45,737
might just be bad luck
for the groom to see.

145
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,916
Just a little something for the bride.

146
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,465
I'll see you soon.

147
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,890
Hold it, Sam. Heels.
Can you just slow down?

148
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,200
Show me the woman who gave the note.
I need you to point her out to me.

149
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,581
You're walking down
in the aisle in 5 minutes.

150
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:42,560
Just do it for me, OK?

151
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:56,670
Well, she probably would have taken
her scarf off if she was in here.

152
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,800
Catholics wear scarves
in churches, don't they?

153
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,800
Ruthie, look.

154
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,330
What did she say?
What were her exact words?

155
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,036
He said she asked him if he
was performing the wedding. He said yes.

156
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:11,004
She said it was something
you might wanna see.

157
00:11:11,124 --> 00:11:12,030
That's how she said?

158
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,110
I don't know,
and {\you know}the father can't hear very well.

159
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,590
I need to know exactly what she said.

160
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,450
OK. We'll go ask father chris.

161
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,120
What is wrong? It's...

162
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,186
Sorry. Carlos just wanted me
to check out the crowd.

163
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,439
Anything else?

164
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,232
Yeah. Is this your wedding dress?

165
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,066
Is Carlos completely ready?

166
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,362
Yeah. He will be in a second.
But, hey, where's your veil?

167
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:39,100
God. Now, will you please just tell me
what is going on?

168
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:41,900
That's probably her.

169
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:54,000
OK, Sam, you are
really freaking me out here.

170
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,770
It was just a note.

171
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,138
Did you read it?

172
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:00,139
What?

173
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,043
You said it was just a note.
Did you read it?

174
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:05,969
No.
Why would I read it?

175
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:07,897
Ruthie, tell me if you opened it.

176
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:10,149
The envelope was sealed, remember?

177
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,010
- How bad was it?
- I didn't say it was bad.

178
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,370
- Something bad about Carlos, right?
- No. No.

179
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:20,790
How bad?

180
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,410
What are you guys doing?
Everybody's waiting.

181
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,022
- Are you getting dressed or what?
- Yes. Yes. I'm just...

182
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,140
acting a little crazy.

183
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,045
Girls.

184
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:33,279
Will you help me get on my dress?

185
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,405
Come on.

186
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:41,090
We gotta go quick.

187
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,507
This is a heavy burden to carry,

188
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:51,340
yet not impossible
with God in your lives.

189
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:53,234
Be good parents.

190
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,799
Then when you get old... and you will...

191
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,916
your children will bless you
as you have blessed them.

192
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:03,452
Now if you are ready to take on
this responsibility, let us begin.

193
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,830
And do you, Samantha Rachel Brighton,

194
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,678
take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband...

195
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:18,217
so help you God?

196
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,301
I do.

197
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:22,505
- You'll have to speak up.
- I do.

198
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,820
If anyone in this house of the Lord
has today any reason why these two

199
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,930
should not be joined
in the bond of holy matrimony,

200
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:36,779
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

201
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,389
Yeah. OK.

202
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,642
Then by the power vested in me

203
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,880
by the Lord God almighty,

204
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,914
I hereby pronounce you man and wife.

205
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,101
From this day forward,
in good times and bad,

206
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:21,992
in sickness and in health, till death...

207
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,912
so long as you both shall live.

208
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,958
You may kiss the bride.

209
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:46,095
There you go.

210
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:47,515
Big smile, Samantha.

211
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,583
Sweet.

212
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,645
Nice.

213
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,605
One more.

214
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,694
The road is long and sometimes tough,

215
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:04,217
but one of the reasons
we make it down that road

216
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:05,991
is we find someone
to walk with us.

217
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:10,246
To my nephew Carlos,
I wish your parents were alive

218
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:14,082
to watch as you start your journey
with your beautiful bride Samantha

219
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:16,609
down life's long
and treacherous highway.

220
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,422
And may I use
the language of your father to say...

221
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,529
Vaya con dios!

222
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,718
Cheers.

223
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,470
There you go.

224
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,627
- What?
- You tell us.

225
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:09,115
Ruthie told me about the note.

226
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,230
Ruthie doesn't know anything
about the note.

227
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,660
The three of us have been right
at each other's side

228
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,296
since before we had barbie dolls.

229
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,154
Now, if something's wrong,
tell us and let us help.

230
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:23,253
It was just a... a stupid note,
a prank, for all I know.

231
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,530
What kind of prank?

232
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,810
Did the note say
something bad about Carlos?

233
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,012
- Did it say he was seeing someone else?
- What?

234
00:16:29,132 --> 00:16:31,485
- It's something embarrassing?
- What are you saying?

235
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:34,371
You jumped into this without really
knowing him, and you found out something

236
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:37,332
you'd have known if you'd taken
more time. Is that what's happening?

237
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:40,376
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
We just wanna help you with this.

238
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:42,379
OK, that's it. Out.

239
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,759
Everybody, out. Let's go.

240
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,184
I'm not kidding. Come on. Right now. Go.

241
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:49,053
Right now.

242
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:51,287
OK. Go on.

243
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,590
You can't throw us out.
We're the bridesmaids.

244
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,900
- I want us to forget about the note.
- Just talk to us.

245
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,286
For tonight, can we just agree
that no one saw any note?

246
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,220
Across the street is the most expensive

247
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,952
and important party of my life.

248
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,951
Can we please just go enjoy it?

249
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:14,083
Why won't you just tell us?

250
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,328
You guys, just go on ahead.

251
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,135
I'll be right there.

252
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,625
Go have a drink!

253
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:51,085
You need one!

254
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,832
I am not in the mood for games.
Who is it?

255
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,742
Who is that?

256
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,770
Kelly?

257
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,628
Somebody there?

258
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,200
Is everything OK?

259
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:52,570
Crap.

260
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,980
Father, you scared me.

261
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:57,073
Oh, and I...
I didn't mean to say,"oh, crap."

262
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:59,858
I meant to say, "oh, rats." I'm sorry.

263
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,740
Did you just knock on my door?

264
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:04,816
Are you all right, my dear?

265
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:06,212
Yeah. I'm...

266
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,470
just a bundle of nerves today, I guess.

267
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:12,620
- Your guests are waiting for you.
- Yes. I know.

268
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:14,402
Can I walk you over?

269
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:17,094
- Father, who gave you this note?
- What note?

270
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:20,055
You gave my friend Ruthie
an envelope to give me.

271
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:23,829
Oh, yes. A tall lady gave it to me.

272
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:27,061
She asked if I was
the one performing the wedding.

273
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:28,581
Did she give you her name?

274
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,108
You know, dear, I don't hear very well.

275
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,836
Yes. I know.

276
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:34,847
Beg your pardon?

277
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:37,690
I said it was a lovely ceremony.

278
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:40,488
Thank you.
It was my pleasure.

279
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,506
Now, we really
should get over to the party.

280
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,180
After all, you and Carlos
are the guests of honor.

281
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,105
- Did you hear that?
- Did I hear what?

282
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:55,320
That noise.

283
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,933
No. Now come on.

284
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:06,183
That noise must have been the wind.

285
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:09,712
When it's very windy,
this church creaks like an old ship.

286
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,040
It was windy like this
when I married Carlos' parents.

287
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,097
It was one of the first weddings
I was asked to preside over,

288
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:20,323
sadly one I'll never forget.

289
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,963
I don't understand.

290
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,202
Well, because of...

291
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:25,704
because of what happened.

292
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,190
Ask him.
He should be the one to tell you.

293
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,510
Look, I'll walk you over.

294
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,709
Make sure you don't get blown away.

295
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:38,777
Thanks, but I'm gonna make a call.
I'll be right there.

296
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,886
- Well, I'd be happy to wait.
- Thank you, father.

297
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,360
You go on ahead. I'll be right there.

298
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,054
And you didn't just knock on my door?

299
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:54,775
You didn't knock on my door?

300
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:58,945
Sorry, dear. Wasn't me.

301
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,715
<i>We're sorry. The number you have...</i>

302
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,670
Well, look who's come to visit me.

303
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,360
And you don't even know who I am yet.

304
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,150
Oh, I bet I do.

305
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,110
Well, take a shot.

306
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,400
You are uncle Bob,
and you work for the government.

307
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,236
Wait. Or maybe you're the other one.
I know there's 2.

308
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,688
There's a government guy
and another one.

309
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:17,982
We're identical twins,
so it's pretty hard to tell us apart.

310
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:20,776
Well, I don't know
much about either of you, really.

311
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:22,962
I shouldn't think so,
your romance with my nephew

312
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,859
being so whirlwind and all.

313
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:27,309
We did move pretty fast.

314
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:29,869
Kind of broke the sound barrier
in that department.

315
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:32,306
You want my opinion?
I think he did all right for himself,

316
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:34,833
and I know his mom and dad
would've approved.

317
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,180
Carlos told me
they're no longer with us,

318
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,027
but I never did hear exactly
what happened.

319
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:45,231
Nobody knows.

320
00:23:45,652 --> 00:23:47,087
Probably never will.

321
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:51,225
I guess he won't tell you.
He doesn't like to talk about it.

322
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:53,370
It's one of those deals
where people disappear

323
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,437
and nobody knows how or why.

324
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,345
Carlos couldn't have been more than 16
when it happened.

325
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:01,114
Shook him up really bad.

326
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,566
I shouldn't be the one to tell you this,
but...

327
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,837
he actually had to go away for a while,

328
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,242
needed to.

329
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,335
That's how bad it shook him up.

330
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,101
He took some bad that would've shattered
most kids his age

331
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:16,792
and came out the other end.

332
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,160
You lost your folks, too, didn't you?

333
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,614
My brother Steve is the only family
I've got.

334
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,620
I think you might be
just the first bright spot

335
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,357
this family's seen in a long, long time.

336
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,140
Well, that's nice.

337
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,102
Thank you.

338
00:24:36,263 --> 00:24:38,479
And I'm sure Carlos feels the same way.

339
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,396
Carlos feels what way?

340
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:42,947
Hey there.

341
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:45,778
What's this drunken old bastard
telling you exactly?

342
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,195
She's just gettin' to know the family.

343
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:53,328
I sure hope you're not tellin' tales
outside of school, uncle Bob.

344
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,873
He was actually telling me
what a great guy I married.

345
00:24:58,034 --> 00:24:58,842
Good.

346
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,620
I was hoping nobody would scare you off,

347
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,210
at least not until after the honeymoon.

348
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:09,540
Sweetheart,
everyone's wondering where you are.

349
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,657
Come on.
It's time to crash our own party.

350
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:14,516
See you later.

351
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,902
- Do me a favor, would you?
- What's wrong?

352
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,468
Start acting like you're now my wife

353
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:33,869
- and that you're happy about it.
- I don't know what you mean.

354
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:36,440
I don't know what's going on
with your little friends,

355
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,708
- but maybe you'd like to tell me.
- My what? Who?

356
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:41,742
Kelly and Ruthie.

357
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,120
They've been givin' me
the stink-eye all night. What is that?

358
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,923
What did they say something to you?

359
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:50,549
Look, it's bad enough
that your brother isn't even here.

360
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:51,947
What the hell is going on

361
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,584
- with your bridesmaids?
- I don't know what you mean.

362
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:57,276
- I think you do.
- There's nothing going on.

363
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,616
Alan, go back inside.

364
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:02,990
OK.

365
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:08,777
- What did they say to you?
- What's going on?

366
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:10,780
There's nothing going on.

367
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:27,507
Steven. It's your sister.

368
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm actually glad
I got the answering machine,

369
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,479
because I've got a lot to say,

370
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:36,990
and I couldn't bear to hear you say,
"I told you so".

371
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,268
I may have rushed into this.

372
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,339
I know that's a really
stupid thing to say now, but

373
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,021
I'm just now starting to think
what everyone else has been thinking

374
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,141
for a while.

375
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:52,184
And I guess... I don't know.
I just wanted to tell you that,

376
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,310
maybe to tell myself.

377
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:58,868
Something happened today that changes
everything, and it makes me really,

378
00:26:58,988 --> 00:27:00,832
really afraid. It makes me

379
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,310
wonder if I walked down
the aisle with the wrong guy

380
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,395
just because I wanted to hurry up
and change things,

381
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:09,548
and that's why you're gonna get
this really strange message on

382
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,364
your machine when you get home

383
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:14,505
and why you might find me home
when you get there.

384
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:18,751
I don't know what's going on, and...

385
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,102
I think that I'm scared,

386
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:24,519
and I just wanted to tell you that.

387
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,541
I'm gonna go tell that Carlos
what I think of him.

388
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:42,913
Don't you go anywhere.
You stay right here.

389
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:57,830
Carlos, you gonna tell me
why my best friend

390
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,060
is over there upset on her wedding day?

391
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,798
- What you're talking about?
- You don't?

392
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:05,311
OK, Sam just got a note,
all right, about you.

393
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:06,271
What note?

394
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,184
A note about you, about something{\that you did}

395
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:10,607
- and she's upset and that's all I know.
- What did it say?

396
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:12,693
I don't know what it said.
She's protecting you

397
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:15,360
- for some reason that I don't know!
- Go back inside.

398
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,489
Don't say another word
and go back inside.

399
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,120
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

400
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,906
<i> you can tell me, baby</i>

401
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,446
<i>if I got you in my control...</i>

402
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,648
You said nothing was going on.

403
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,256
That's what you said.
You said nothing was going on.

404
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:37,498
- What did she say to you?
- Whatever it is, Sam, don't believe it.

405
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,380
You have to understand
that there are people...

406
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,874
That would say just about

407
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:45,550
- anything to keep us apart.
- Let go of me.

408
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:54,778
You can't just believe everything
that you hear.

409
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,281
What? What could they say?

410
00:28:57,796 --> 00:29:00,909
Look me in the eye and tell me
what could be so horrible.

411
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,820
<i>Come on and get to me, baby, yeah</i>

412
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,650
<i>Now, you can tell me, baby,
if I got you...</i>

413
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:10,752
Carlos, you're scaring me.

414
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,549
Am I?

415
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,882
Did you hear that?

416
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,847
I'm scaring her.
I'm scaring my wife...

417
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,173
because you 2 jealous little bitches

418
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:30,321
- couldn't mind your own damn business.
- Carlos!

419
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:35,316
Can we just talk?

420
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,833
Now, you wanna talk.

421
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:02,262
Whatever it is,
they have to work it out.

422
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,244
Carlos, I saw you come in here.

423
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:28,890
Are you all right?

424
00:31:29,912 --> 00:31:30,842
Today's...

425
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,831
supposed to be a happy day.

426
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:35,151
Right?

427
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:38,797
Happiest day in a person's life.

428
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,790
I don't know... what Ruthie said, but...

429
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,091
Ruthie said...

430
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:48,656
that you got an anonymous tip...

431
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:52,469
something I did or...

432
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,484
something you didn't know about me.

433
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:57,884
Well...

434
00:31:58,526 --> 00:32:01,612
Ruthie doesn't know
what she's talking about.

435
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,903
Is that right?

436
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,273
So, you didn't get an anonymous note
just before the service?

437
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:15,828
Is there...

438
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:18,253
anything...

439
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:21,067
you wanna tell me?

440
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,220
Don't be scared of me.

441
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:51,121
I'm not.

442
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:53,391
I would never hurt you.

443
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,314
I know.

444
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:03,649
Then why are you moving away from me?

445
00:33:05,264 --> 00:33:07,607
It was just a stupid note.

446
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,535
So just tell me what it said.

447
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:17,027
There was nothing in that note
that I could ever believe about you.

448
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:27,644
Then, why are you running away from me?

449
00:35:28,236 --> 00:35:29,408
Come on, Sam.

450
00:35:34,603 --> 00:35:35,774
All right!

451
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,191
Open the door, sweetheart.

452
00:35:40,718 --> 00:35:42,489
I just wanna talk to you.

453
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:53,645
Come on, Sam!

454
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:19,256
Please.

455
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,967
Carlos, just let me out of here.

456
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:29,261
I don't know what the note said exactly,

457
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,233
but what I can tell you

458
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:35,822
is that girl meant nothing to me.

459
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:38,954
I know that's what everyone says,

460
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,202
but with me, it is the absolute...

461
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:44,810
truth.

462
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,334
She meant... nothing.

463
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,139
- What?
- We met...

464
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:54,895
while you were on your trip.

465
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:57,617
We met at a bar. We had dinner.

466
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:02,639
She wanted more...

467
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:05,494
a lot more...

468
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:08,512
but I told her

469
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,186
that I was getting married.

470
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:12,816
That was it.

471
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:15,456
Somehow...

472
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,811
She figured out where I worked.
She started calling.

473
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:21,924
She kept calling.

474
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:25,272
She was really lonely,

475
00:37:26,116 --> 00:37:27,231
maybe crazy.

476
00:37:29,726 --> 00:37:31,811
But please, Sam...

477
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:38,410
Don't tell me that because I was stupid
and had dinner with someone

478
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,469
that none of today means anything.

479
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,763
You had dinner with someone?

480
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:47,111
I should have told you.

481
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:48,664
I know.

482
00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:51,001
I should have told you.

483
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,104
But I was not cheating, Sam.

484
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:56,617
I did not...

485
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,734
cheat on you.

486
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:04,478
It was probably her
that delivered the note.

487
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,278
She was probably hoping

488
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:11,570
to ruin our wedding.

489
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,678
<i>Steven. It's your sister.</i>

490
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,190
<i>I'm actually glad
i got the answering machine,</i>

491
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,404
<i>because I've got a lot to say,</i>

492
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:52,848
<i>and I couldn't bear to hear you say,

493
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,254
<i>I may have rushed into this.</i>

494
00:38:56,593 --> 00:38:59,281
<i>I know that's a really stupid thing
to say now, but</i>

495
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:01,630
<i>but I'm just now starting to think</i>

496
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:04,547
<i>what everyone else has been thinking
for a while.</i>

497
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:08,256
<i>And I guess... I don't know.
I just wanted to tell you that.</i>

498
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,034
<i>Something happened today that changes

499
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:14,858

500
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,818

502
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,530

503
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,448
<i>on your machine when you get home</i>

504
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,887
<i>and why you might find me home

505
00:39:28,293 --> 00:39:31,423
<i>I... I don't know what's going on, and</i>

506
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:34,093
<i>I think that I'm scared...</i>

507
00:39:36,314 --> 00:39:38,754
<i>And I just wanted to tell you that.</i>

508
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:40,548
Are you here?

509
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,778
I told you the truth.

510
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:50,896
I told you all of it.

511
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:56,565
Now, can we please,

512
00:39:58,716 --> 00:39:59,744
please

513
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:02,792
just forget about...

514
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:05,265
the note?

515
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:09,770
There's still a problem with the note...

516
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:14,490
but the problem

517
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,877
is that the note exists at all.

518
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:24,995
And Ruthie didn't know...

519
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:31,974
that father Chris told her to give it
to the wrong person.

520
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:36,141
What?

521
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:38,855
The note wasn't meant for me.

522
00:40:42,246 --> 00:40:43,875
It was meant for you.

523
00:40:45,314 --> 00:40:46,919
I don't care about the note.

524
00:40:48,973 --> 00:40:50,015
You won't

525
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:52,475
wonder what it says?

526
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:54,364
You'll show me

527
00:40:55,251 --> 00:40:56,582
when you're ready.

528
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,695
Promise.

529
00:41:06,437 --> 00:41:07,523
I promise.
