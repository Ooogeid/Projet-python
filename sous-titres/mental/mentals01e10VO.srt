Nora, as usual, is...

192
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:07,634
Very well-informed.

193
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:08,800
It's true?

194
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,900

you're joking about this?

a prostitute --

201
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,434
Christine.

202
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:32,334
Apparently, one of christine's
johns demanded a refund

203
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:35,167
And when she objected,
stuck a knife between her legs.

204
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:43,000
We managed to stop the bleeding,
but, uh, she's very close.

205
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,167
As we were finishing up
with chrtine,

206
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,701
Police brought in
the john --

207
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:49,534
He had a gsw
to the right shoulder,

208
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,134
Resisting arrest.

209
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,867
He was very lucky.
it barely clipped him.

210
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,933
Well, you've dealt
with similar situations

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,401
Dozens of times.

212
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,501
I probably would have helped
this case, too,

213
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,234
If he hadn't opened
his mouth.

214
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,634
And said?

215
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,234
"let the whore bleed."

216
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,601
You should go home.

217
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:14,234
I was thinking
the same thing.

218
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,334
Want to come?

219
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm in the middle
of my shift.

220
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,601
Right.

221
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:24,134
I could see you later.

222
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,401
I'm thinking about
driving up the coast,

223
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,800
Maybe spend a couple nights
in santa barbara.

224
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,000
We talked
about doing that.

225
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,100
You know i can't.

226
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,701
Then i'll see you
when i get back.

00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,367
Yeah, good.

He's not so good.

231
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,701
Damn.
i really liked that kid --

232
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:52,534
Always on time, good attitude,
smart, steady, you know?

233
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:54,034
And then this.

234
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
My business manager
keeps telling me

235
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,933
To expect a lawyer letter --
suing my ass for damages.

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,134
But i don't think
billy would do that.

237
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,534
Do you think the accident
was your company's fault?

238
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,100
It occurred on my site.

239
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,434
Is that really what started
all this?

240
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,768
It set something
in motion.

241
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,367
The timing's
too coincidental.

242
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:14,867
I don't know.

243
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,867
What can you tell me
about it?

244
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,867
Come on.
i'll show you -- that way.

245
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,367
It happened down here.

246
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,967
The ground just gave way
without warning.

247
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,467
It's all filled in now.

248
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:27,200
I didn't see the collapse,

249
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,567
But i came running
when i heard the shouting.

250
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:31,601
Wewhat did you see?

251
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:33,401
Must have been
an old air shaft

252
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,701
Predating the building
we were demolishing --

253
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,567
About six feet across.

254
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:40,301
Billy landed
about 20 feet down.

255
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,567
I suppose these things happen,
just not to me.

256
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,301
You saying it hurt
your business?

257
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,800
No, not really. it made all
the local news channels.

Everyone loves
a happy ending.

buried alive?

260

What? what's this
"buried alive" crap?

261
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,134
Billy wasn't buried?

262
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,601
Hell no!

263
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,334
Like i said, he fell
about 20 feet below the surface,

264
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,301
He could see out,

265
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,668
And the rescue team in
at all times.

266
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:03,668
He could breathe?

267
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:04,900
His legs were trapped,

268
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,134
But he could still move his arms
and his head.

269
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,833
He spent most
of the eight hours

270
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,501
Chatting up the cute little
paramedic looking over him --

271
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,800
Annie.

272
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,401
The only reason why
i know her name

273
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,100
Is because afterward,
billy and she dated.

274
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,800
Was it cold that day?

275
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,768

00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:34,434
Well, if he calls...

279
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,800
What are you expecting him
to say?

280
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,701
He'll advise me.

281
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,701
He'll tell me
what to do.

your grandfather, did you?

He died when i was

287

So, without knowing
who you are --

288
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:58,200
At least,
the man who you are today --

289
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,434
Do you think
it's possible

290
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,768
That he could dispense
good advice?

291
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,601

292
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:04,200
But he didn't say that,
did he,

293
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:07,000
The first time that he spoke
to you on -- on -- on the radio?

294
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,668
Not exactly.

295
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:11,067
No. what?
what exactly?

296
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:12,634
I told you.

297
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,134
He said, "stay tuned.

00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:20,501
Yeah.
but why not more?

on the line.

what he wanted you to hear?</i>

Well, i don't know.

that there's a problem?

isn't with your grandfather?

with you?</i>

No, ethan, it's okay.

308

What i'm actually
suggesting is that...

309
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:46,100

is waiting

Yep.

890
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:00,734
He called
about an hour ago.

891
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:02,901
You were right.

892
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:06,101
I needed to be ready
to listen.

893
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,934
What did he say?

894
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:14,200
"keep up the good work."

895
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:17,267
Congratulations.

896
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:20,567
<i>he did leave a message
for you.</i>

897
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:22,701
<i>for me?</i>

898
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,300
[ chuckles ]
well, what -- what was it?

899
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:27,534
"stay tuned.

900
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,467
Big changes are comin'."

901
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:52,967
You won't reconsider?

902
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:56,967
Quitting felt too right.

903
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:11,233
Uh...

904
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,801
Just so you know,
if we'd never met

905
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:15,801
Or, uh, gotten involved,

906
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:18,367
I'd be doing
the exact same thing.

907
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,300
It's time to go home.

908
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:26,701
Well, you knew
what my answer would be.

909
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:30,801
I was pretty sure.

910
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:46,034
Hey.

911
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:51,534
Yocan't feel like you're
the one being rejected here.

912
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:04,434
You know
where to find me.

913
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,333
[ door opens ]

914
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,434
[ door closes ]

915
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,101
[ doorbell buzzing ]

916
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:23,567
[ exhales sharply ]

917
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:33,534
Rebecca?

918
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
Mm.

919
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,068
[ moans softly

920
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:42,267
[ exhales sharply ]

921
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:52,467
[ moans softly ]

922
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:54,867
Rebecca?

923
00:41:54,934 --> 00:41:56,600
Mm.

924
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,467
It's gonna be okay.
