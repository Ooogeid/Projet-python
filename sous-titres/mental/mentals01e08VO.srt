Veronica: yeah.

183
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:56,998
Listen, if he's her
trainer, maybe he's
pushing her too hard.

184
00:09:56,998 --> 00:09:59,231
Maybe she's cracking under
the pressure of competition.

185
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,098
I've got a feeling
she might be in the closet.
Why, 'cause she's
an athlete?

186
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:03,298
She's got

No.

188

doesn't make you straight.

No.

193

are twice as likely

To attempt suicide
as straight ones.

on fire.

an eating disorder.
