00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,609
Yeah, it's fantastic,
isn't it?

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,156
Okay, i'm ready.

00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,075
You mean that?
yeah.

363
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,216
It's for a good cause.

364
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,458
Yeah, it is.

365
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:32,930
Glad you see it
that way.

366
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:35,338
Shame, really.
what?

367
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:36,915
Oh, that you're leaving.

368
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:38,723
I'm sure you've observed,

369
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:41,695
Uh, quite a bit
since you've been here.

370
00:14:41,774 --> 00:14:45,143
And i understand your movie
starts shooting monday?

371
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,621
Eh, it's too bad y can't
stick around till then,

372

Let it really soak in.

373
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,268
Yeah?
yeah.

374
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:52,777
I've never granted
that kind of access, of course.

375
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,320
I can swing it
if you're interested.

376
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,128
No way.

377
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,470
You think i should?

378
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:01,447
For purely selfish reasons.
[ chuckles ]

379
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,154
I'd like to see a, uh,
psychiatric ward and treatment

Portrayed realistically
for a change.

381
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,205
You can't --
you can't make this stuff up.

382
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:08,879
You've got to live it.

383

Yeah, no, no,
you're so right.

384
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:12,591
Otherwise it would become a --
what's the word? -- caricature.

385
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:14,002
Laughable, even.

I'll offer my services
as your personaluide.

390
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,134
Excellent.

391
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,483
Carl:
have you lost your mind?!

392
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:27,924
You talked him
into staying,

393
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,328
Even after the embarrassment
he caused this hospital?

394
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,436
And to you personally.

395
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:34,146
He used a public facility for
his own self-serving research.

396
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,389
He's a callous,
manipulative son of a bitch,

397
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,501
And i want him
off this ward!

398
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,972
What are you up to?
why'd you ask him to stay?

399
00:15:41,048 --> 00:15:42,449
Because
he's mentally ill.
he was putting on a show!

400
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:44,657
He said so himself!

401
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,364
He was also putting on a show
when he appeared on tv!
so?

402
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,606
When the cameras stopped rolling
and the lights went off,

403
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:49,877
He was still performin

404
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:51,486
Actually,
he wasn't performing.

405
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:52,961
I think he was having
a breakdown --

406
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,530
For real --

407
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:56,940
And only later came up with
the publicity-stunt cover story.

408
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:59,216
<i>so you actually think
he is psychotic?</i>

409
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,723
How would you assess
a patient

410
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:02,697
Exhibiting sexually
provocative behavior,

411
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,438
Melodramatic expressions
of emotion, easy suggestibility,

412
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,616
A desperate need
for excessive admiration,

413
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,691
And a grandiose sense
of self-importance?

414
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:14,335
Oh, you think
he has a narcissistic
personality disorder.

415
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:16,220
So do a lot
of creative types, too.

416
00:16:16,328 --> 00:16:19,297
Hmm.

417
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:20,540
So?!

418
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:24,479
Discharge him
and find him a therapist!

419
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,827
We just agreed he has
a personality disorder.

420
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,238
What we don't know
is why.

421
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,108
If we discharge him now,
we run the risk

422
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:31,250
Of another
psychotic break.

423
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,323
He needs to be here!

424
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:33,126
Absolutely.

of course i knew...

When i booked the show.

429
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,634
Liam thought it would be
a good opportunity

430
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,877
To promo the picture.

it was his idea?

And mine.

433
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:53,972
Liam might be a great actor,
but you're not.

434
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,281
When you brought him in,

435
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:56,787
You were genuinely
concerned about him.

436
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,026
You care about him.

437
00:16:58,096 --> 00:16:59,463
Obviously,
he cares about you.

438
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,070
You survived the massacre,
didn't you?

439
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,411

and publicist.

The last few months,
he's been cleaning house.

He also fired
his personal assistant,

and his stylist.

Hoffman -- he stays up
for three days

00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:26,840
So he can get that really
tortured look in "marathon man."

how dangerous it's gonna be

for your research.

Oh, i wouldn't have
missed it.

00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,184

the part

Of a dangerously
psychotic patient,

472
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:13,464
Which probably means
you'd be put in restraints.

Is that okay?

475
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:20,863
Radical-exposure therapy is,

476
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,638
Simply put, exposing people
to their biggest fears.

477
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:26,249
Like the rats in "1984."

478

Great book.

479
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:31,766
So, uh, let's say
you're afraid to fly.

480
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:34,381
Exposure therapy would involve
taking you up in a plane

481
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,925
And forcing you
to face that fear.

00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:37,299

00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:39,570

we're dealing with?

You tell me.

okay, brilliant.

of the dark or being alone?

Of being

that's -- that's good.

And -- and be sort of begging
to be sefree.

some serious work ahead.

893
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,251
Yeah, i know.

894
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,394
I'm ready.

895
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:49,534
[ elevator bell dings ]

896
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:52,880
[ camera shutters clicking ]

897
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:55,989
[ indistinct shouting ]

898
00:40:06,441 --> 00:40:07,675
What up, guys?

899
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,182
Liam, what was it like
in there?

900
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:10,919
It was quite humbling.

901
00:40:11,027 --> 00:40:13,828
Stay back.
there are a lot
of very sick people here,

902
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:16,274
But there are also
dedicated professionals

903
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:17,983
Trying very hard
to help them.

904
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:20,125
He's good?
better than good.

905
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,668
I called an old friend of mine
from med school,

906
00:40:22,741 --> 00:40:24,542
Specializes
in personality disorders.

907
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:27,284
Liam will start therapy
straightaway.
oh.

908
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,794
Do you believe your research
will make for a better film?

909
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,676
Yeah, bet on it.

910
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:45,294
Pretty smooth.

911
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:47,470
Eh, he's an actor.

912
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,614
Hypnosis, huh?

913
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,822
Any other tricks
you got up your sleeve?

914
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:02,966
Unfortunately,
i don't even have that one.

915
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,075
What do you mean?

916
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:06,450
I faked it.

917
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:09,089
A little de-inhibitor solution
also helped.

918
00:41:09,163 --> 00:41:10,797
There's no such thing.

919
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:12,671
Yeah, well,
he didn't know that.

920
00:41:12,747 --> 00:41:14,014
Saline?

921
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:15,451
Yeah.

922
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:17,658
All he really needed
was an excuse to let go.

923
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:20,506
Oh.

924
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,980
Well, you really missed
your calling in life.

925
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:25,257
An actor?

926
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:27,498
No way!
[ laughs ]

927
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:29,242
What i really want to do
is direct.
