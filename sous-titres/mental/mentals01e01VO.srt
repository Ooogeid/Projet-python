1
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,894
Commentary, Suarez.

2
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,007
Uh, the patient
suffers from depression,

3
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:20,873
anxiety,
and disorganized thinking.

4
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:21,948
Artis.

5
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:23,745
Mr. Sawyer's
all over the map.

6
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,527
He also has
a very good grasp

7
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,661
of medical,
psychological terminology

8
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:28,735
straight out
of the DSM-IV.

9
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:30,739
Leading you to conclude?

10
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,585
Factitious disorder.

11
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:34,655
Do you suspect
Maliering?

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,428
There's no indication of symptoms
manufactured for material gain, no.

13
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:39,836
Correct...
both of you...

14
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:40,910
this time.

15
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:46,428
Is there something else,
Dr. Belle?

16
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:48,675
Our new Director of Psychiatric
Services arrives today,

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,182
but make no mistake,

18
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:52,558
as senior staff attending
with the overall responsibility

19
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:54,497
for your supervision
and training,

20
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:57,433
ultimately, whether you find
a place at this hospital or not

21
00:00:57,514 --> 00:00:59,810
depends entirely upon me.

22
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,115
Any sign
of the new head honcho?

23
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:16,318
Nada.

24
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:18,258
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

25
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:20,390
Country mouse
adrift in the big city.

26
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,027
He ran a clinic
in Vermont, Carl.

27
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:23,566
He wasn't plowing
the back 40.

28
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:26,485
God,
what was Nora thinking?

29
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,718
I say give him
the benefit of the doubt.

30
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:31,634
Maybe Dr. Gallagher
has something to add.

31
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,265
Like zero experience running a
high-volume psychiatric facility?

32
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:36,688
You're taking this well.

33
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:37,988
After <i>I</i> was
screwed out of the job,

34
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,495
I suppose it could have
always gone to <i>you.</i>

35
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,795
<i>Should</i> have.

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,072
Not while I have a pulse.

37
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:46,089
<i>I</i> refuse to get hysterical
about it.

38
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:57,430
Last name Martin,
first name Vincent.

39
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:59,741
We matched him up
to a missing-person's report.

40
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:02,083
He was stark naked, no I.D.,
screaming his freaking head off,

41
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:03,716
standing in the middle
of the highway.

42
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:06,714
Okay, pal.
Behave yourself, huh?

43
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:09,490
Docs here are gonna
fix you up just fine.

44
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,295
I see you!
- Have a Code white.

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,668
Get it off!

46
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,578
Security, code 3,
first floor.

47
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,315
I know who you are!

48
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,725
I can't be the only one.

49
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,772
Look.

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,484
Flesh -- human flesh!

51
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,644
No, no!

52
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:43,589
Hold it right ere.

53
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:46,331
You'll never make me
like you!

54
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:48,272
Keep away!

55
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:49,603
Keep away!

56
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,478
You can't have me!

57
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:54,479
Hey!
- Get back!

58
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:55,953
I'm real, too.

59
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:59,902
Flesh -- human flesh!

60
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,775
You're not alone.

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,822
Get down on the floor and
put your hands behind your head.

62
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,602
What about them?

63
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,841
We'll fight em together.
I've got your back.

64
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,387
Except we're outnumbered.

65
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,278
Might be better
to choose our battles.

66
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,554
Not give up!
- Not give up! Not give up! Bide our time!

67
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:27,133
Live. Live to fight
another day.

68
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:28,301
Huh?

69
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,678
Trust me.

70
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,429
Trust me.

71
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:53,110
Scratch the Haldol,
doctor.

72
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,353
Let's take the patient
to seclusion and clean him up.

73
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,085
Excuse me?!
Who the hell are you?

74
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:58,304
Dr. Jack Gallagher.

75
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:00,867
I guess
I'm the new head honcho.

76
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,962
Staff meeting
tomorrow morning.

77
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:25,639
I'll introduce you to everyone.
And after that, it's all yours.

78
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:28,076
So, there I was,
first day in the big city.

79
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:29,790
Suddenly,
it occurs to me...

80
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:31,521
"take
all your clothes off.

81
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:35,097
Give the hardworking folks
in admitting a cheap thrill."

82
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,740
You have to admit,
it did the trick.

83
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:40,289
You acted to gain
a patient's trust. Fine.

84
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:43,221
But what about the respect
and trust of your staff?

85
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:45,257
You think getting butt naked
on your first day of work

86
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:46,698
helped you
to achieve that?

87
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:51,170
Couldn't say.
Never tried it before.

88
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,918
'Sides...

89
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:54,487
it'll be forgotten
by tomorrow.

90
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:55,529
Really?

91
00:04:55,593 --> 00:05:01,730
Posted
on the Hospital intranet.

92
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,373
Want the advice of a Harvard
Business School graduate?

93
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,783
Seek royalties.

94
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,660
It's been downloaded more
than Paris Hilton's sex tape.

95
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:13,907
You look great, Nora.

96
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:22,897
Move in, doctor,
but don't get too comfortable.

97
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:26,901
Another stunt like that,
and you'll be out...

98
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,771
...on your very public ass.

99
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,491
Did you hear
what happened?

100
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,094
I can't believe
we missed it.

101
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,362
Looks like we're about to become
a clothing-optional facility.

102
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:43,374
You have a problem
with that?

103
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:51,723
Mind says no,
but the body says follow.

104
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,588
Doctor.

105
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:05,997
Jack.

106
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:08,066
Veronica.

107
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,014
So, you worked under
my predecessor -- Dr. Friedman?

108
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,817
Yes, for 10 years
since my internship.

109
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,957
He was my mentor.
Can't believe he's gone.

110
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:19,297
Or that they brought in an outsider
from nowhere to take his place?

111
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,904
So, you're from the U.K.

112
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,872
Originally.
What tipped you off?

113
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:30,076
And you were in Somalia
with Doctors Without Borders.

114
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,822
That must have been
intense.

115
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:32,993
Yeah.

116
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:35,187
Huh.

117
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:39,273
Nice talking to you.

118
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,693
They're doing some
experimental drug therapy...

119
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:52,169
Vincent Martin,
I'm Dr. Gallagher.

120
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:55,771
We, uh --
we met earlier.

121
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,342
Do you remember?

122
00:06:57,406 --> 00:07:00,978
I don't.
They gave me something.

123
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:04,199
Eh. That's just enough joy juice
to take the edge off.

124
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:05,992
All right,
here's the deal, Vince --

125
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,043
I'm gonna cut you loose, and you're
gonna promise not to get too excited.

126
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,382
It's okay, Ray. Anyone gets
hurt, I'm in a world of trouble.

127
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:13,154
You buy a one-way ticket
to Thorazineville.

128
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:18,328
When can I go home?

129
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:19,927
Answer a question first.

130
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:22,058
Why did you stop
taking your meds?

131
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,574
The blood work came back
your system's clean.

132
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:26,450
Been off maybe
two or three weeks.

133
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,819
I don't know.
Maybe I just forgot.

134
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:31,013
It happens.

135
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:39,967
The thing is,
according to your records,

136
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,050
it hasn't happened to you
in 12 years.

137
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,761
What do you see
out there?

138
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,709
It's not real.

139
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,111
It's in my head.
I know. I know that.

140
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:05,450
Well, that puts you
way ahead of the game.

141
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:09,357
I thought I could do both.
I can't. I was wrong.

142
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,542
Thought you could do both what?
- Don't worry about it.

143
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:15,168
Just put me back on my meds
so I can get back to my life.

144
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,571
Just slow down there, Vincent.
You just got here.

145
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:18,885
Come on. Let's take some time.
- I don't have time!

146
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,886
No!

147
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:22,650
Okay?
- I got to get home.

148
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:25,099
Getting you home
is what this is all about.

149
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:42,861
Grayson, hi.
I'm Dr. Hayden-Jones.

150
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:45,165
I understand that you'd like
to attend my resident day clinic

151
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:46,513
once you've
been released.

152
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,074
It's a condition
of my suspended sentence.

153
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:51,843
I understand
that you're a cat lover.

154
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,622
Cats are very intuitive.

155
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:57,563
A cat person is about the
nicest thing you could call me.

156
00:08:57,627 --> 00:08:59,692
I agree. I just wish
I could have one now.

157
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:01,100
But my husband's
allergic.

158
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,895
And I like the longhairs
the best.

159
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:06,242
Mm. I have all kinds --
Tabbies, Siamese.

160
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:08,516
So I heard.
You had 20 in your apartment?

161
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,215
Mostly strays --

162
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,449
They follow me home sometimes,
or people give them to me.

163
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,257
I also heard
from the police

164
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:17,437
that you had a bunch of them
in your freezer.

165
00:09:19,696 --> 00:09:23,905
When they died, I-I-I couldn't
bury them in the ground --

166
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,938
so heartless.

167
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,788
And I couldn't burn them,
you know?

168
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,615
Their beautiful fur?

169
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,753
When we lose someone we love,
it -- it just plain hurts.

170
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:38,941
But eventually, we --
we learn to let go.

171
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,648
I don't know
how to do that.

172
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:46,755
Well, that's what
we can work on here.

173
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,939
<i>In-house pharmacist,</i>
<i>report to satellite pharmacy.</i>

174
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:03,212
Dr. Gallagher.

175
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:05,456
I'm Edolie Martin,
Vincent's sister.

176
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,993
Oh,
I'm glad you're here.

177
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,025
Uh, you can see Vincent,
of course.

178
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,594
But first, I've got
about a million questions.

179
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:11,826
Um, I know
he lives with you.

180
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:13,187
Did you know
he's discontinued --

181
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,837
I want Vincent released
to me immediately.

182
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:15,829
I'm having him
transferred.

183
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:22,713
No, you're
having him <i>committed.</i>

184
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,220
To Twelve Oaks
Psychiatric Facility.

185
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:28,623
Ms. Martin, Vincent shouldn't
be institutionalized.

186
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:30,350
He's self-aware,
self-sufficient for many years.

187
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:32,032
This is a mistake.

188
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:33,522
I'm not <i>asking,</i> doctor.

189
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:35,666
I have Power of Attorney.
Sign here.

190
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,804
By law, I have 72 hours
to observe him.

191
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,774
He's only been here 8.

192
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,887
Then I'll be back in 64.

193
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:13,314
Oh, Dr. Gallagher.

194
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,281
I was wondering,
have you had the chance

195
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:17,120
to go through
the department budget?

196
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:18,482
Gave it a shot
last night.

197
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,719
Man, talk about a cure
for insomnia.

198
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:22,833
You do understand, of course,
that it's a part

199
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:24,959
of the Director's job
to approve the budget.

200
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:27,054
I'll get around to it.
- Oh, you're gonna have to do better than that.

201
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:29,053
For one thing,
the funding is about to expire

202
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:31,101
on my resident
day clinic.

203
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,795
This program,
which I founded --

204
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,100
Sure.
Resident Day Clinic, RDC.

205
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:36,299
I'll drop by later
and check it out.

206
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:49,480
Uh, okay.

207
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:54,007
Our new Director of
Psychiatric Services comes to us

208
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,221
from the Pinewood Veterans
Post-traumatic Stress Clinic

209
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:58,851
in Killington, Vermont.

210
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,578
Dr. Gallagher is board-certified
in psychiatric medicine.

211
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,016
Please join me
in welcoming Jack Gallagher.

212
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:10,013
First staff meeting.

213
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:13,291
Hot coffee, juice...

214
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,594
Jelly doughnuts.

215
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:17,289
The, uh --
the problem is,

216
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,160
we're in here,
and they're out there.

217
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,295
Who's out there?

218
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,894
Patients.

219
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,731
You see, gang, I'm thinking
this whole secret-society thing

220
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,491
isn't the best way to go.

221
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:30,995
So, starting today,

222
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:34,097
I've invited a few
of the patients to sit in.

223
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:36,335
You want us discuss
diagnoses and treatment

224
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,599
in front
of the patients?

225
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,071
Bang on.

226
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,374
There's a tendency --
and I'm as guilty as anyone --

227
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,107
to wall ourselves up from
the people we're here to help.

228
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:46,668
But it's -- it's really more
their hospital than ours.

229
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:49,802
We work for them.

230
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,976
They have the right to be
involved in their own recovery.

231
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,311
We're M.D.s,
not social workers.

232
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:57,174
M.D. as in "medical doctor,"
not "medical deity."

233
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,613
It's their heads.

234
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,019
These people are in our care.
They're our responsibility.

235
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:03,314
There are
liability issues.

236
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:06,545
Find the joker.

237
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,855
It's not there.

238
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,324
Unlocking the mysteries of
the human brain is no easy gig.

239
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:24,153
So, why not use
every possible resource?

240
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,329
Experiment,
break the mold,

241
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,505
use every trick
in the book --

242
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,071
Anything that gives us
an edge.

243
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:32,166
And if you're uncomfortable
with that, look,

244
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:34,596
I'll respect your prerogatives
as medical professionals.

245
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:38,099
And I hear
they're hiring at County.

246
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,945
Gypsy, come on in.

247
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:46,048
Have a little seat
right there.

248
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:56,412
What's the task?

249
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:57,675
Oh.

250
00:13:57,756 --> 00:13:59,914
We're creating
personal agendas,

251
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:02,121
goal setting,
time allocation --

252
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,153
just determining
priorities.

253
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:08,055
Is there ever any, uh,
unstructured activity?

254
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,063
No.
- Oh.

255
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:10,518
You disapprove?

256
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,685
Hey, I'm just here
to observe.

257
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:14,885
Then observe.

258
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:22,563
Terrific, Steven.

259
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,679
Hi.

260
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:49,077
Oh, really? Okay.

261
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:51,540
I'll be right back.

262
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,522
Can I see you a minute,
doctor?

263
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,030
Ooh!

264
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:26,996
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

265
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:28,770
I heard the music.
It sounded cool.

266
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:30,530
I just figured --

267
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:31,970
you just figured
that you could waltz in here

268
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,440
and, on a whim, tamper
with my course of treatment.

269
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:34,799
It's a break from routine.

270
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,302
Three months ago,
most of those people

271
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,477
could barely get out of bed
and shower by themselves.

272
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,933
With the help
of my <i>routine,</i>

273
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:41,979
they're beginning
to lead productive lives.

274
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:43,307
All right.

275
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,105
You've created a safe,
quiet, controlled environment.

276
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:48,618
But reality is <i>loud,</i> messy,
and full of surprises.

277
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,839
The question is,
does it translate?

278
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,855
Just let me
ask you a question.

279
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,573
Do you honestly think
you're qualified for this job?

280
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,957
Probably not.

281
00:15:58,022 --> 00:15:59,413
Then why are you here?

282
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,187
New challenge,
new surroundings.

283
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:04,722
Do you really care?

284
00:16:04,786 --> 00:16:06,785
No, what I care about
is whether or not

285
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:09,552
you're planning on reading
the damn budget and funding me.

286
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:11,487
Can we finish this later?

287
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:19,691
What's going on, Vince?

288
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:22,603
Useless.

289
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,875
What is?

290
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,505
This is trashed.
I'll call maintenance.

291
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:38,614
Okay, Vincent,
you're an artist.

292
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,540
Not anymore.

293
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:46,674
"Can't do both."

294
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,755
Okay,
take another right there.

295
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,722
Oh, oh!
- Now take a left, take a left.

296
00:17:03,788 --> 00:17:05,625
Oh, got it.
- Hey, hey.

297
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,633
Hi?

298
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:07,928
Is your mum around?

299
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:10,230
Um, are you
a friend of hers?

300
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:11,797
I'm a friend
of your uncle Vincent.

301
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,398
Is he okay?

302
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:16,037
My mommy said
he's sick.

303
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,300
When's he coming home?

304
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,866
I'm not too sure yet.

305
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,395
One second.
Um, I made something for him.

306
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,233
I-I'll be right back.
One second.

307
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:24,673
What do you want?

308
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:27,633
Some information
about Vincent.

309
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,248
You have
his medical records.

310
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:31,247
I need to know what he's been
up to for the last few years.

311
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:33,869
What's changed?
- Joshua, honey, can you go watch TV for a while?

312
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:39,274
Night before last,

313
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:41,850
my kids and I were awakened
in the middle of the night

314
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,385
by Vincent
ranting to himself.

315
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,554
When I tried to talk
to him,

316
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,551
he pushed me down on the lawn
and ran off.

317
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:48,423
You had no idea
that he's gone off his meds?

318
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:50,853
If I had, I would have
done something about it.

319
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,747
The police found him standing
in the middle of traffic!

320
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,859
He could have been killed...
or someone else.

321
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:57,393
I won't let that happen.

322
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,184
<i>I</i> am responsible for Vincent,
not <i>you!</i>

323
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:02,750
Kids seem
pretty attached to him.

324
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:12,203
When I was 15,

325
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:15,626
Vincent chased me
and my 7-year-old brother Leo

326
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:17,671
around the house
with a screwdriver.

327
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:23,333
Joshua and Emily have never
seen him when he's like that.

328
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:25,268
I intend
to keep it that way.

329
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,643
I know how schizophrenia
can rip a family apart.

330
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,643
Does Leo have much to do
with Vincent.

331
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:34,209
Vincent can't live here
anymore.

332
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:38,274
I don't suppose
I could see his room?

333
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:40,878
Visiting hours are over,
doctor.

334
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:45,517
Um, will you give this
to Vincent?

335
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:50,683
Of course.

336
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:54,825
Thanks.

337
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,429
Nora, hi.

338
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:10,261
Well, how the hell did he
just walk off the ward?

339
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:15,632
All right. Never mind.
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

340
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:17,631
T-tell the police
not to confront him.

341
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:20,238
That's important. Tell them
to wait till I get there.

342
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:21,406
Yeah.

343
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:47,943
All right.
Come on in, doc.

344
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,723
Here he is.

345
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:58,596
Thank you.

346
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,482
Hey.

347
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:02,865
Go away!

348
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,929
I got to work.

349
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:07,488
If I lose this job,
I'll never get to go home.

350
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,232
Vincent, this is
what you do all day?

351
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:10,671
Uh-huh.

352
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:12,862
For 10 years.

353
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,366
They like me here.
I'm a hard worker.

354
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,573
Every day, I show up on time.
They can count on me.

355
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,540
That's all good.
- I'm independent.

356
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:27,037
I get my own paycheck
every week,

357
00:20:27,118 --> 00:20:29,052
and I take it
to the bank.

358
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:32,347
I'm not a problem.
I take care of myself.

359
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:45,563
Is my boss
gonna fire me?

360
00:20:45,629 --> 00:20:49,066
He doesn't <i>want</i> to.
You're a valuable employee.

361
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:54,601
How much trouble
am I in?

362
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,201
I can cover for all that

363
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,441
if we go back
to the hospital now.

364
00:20:58,506 --> 00:20:59,849
No, no, no,
I need to stay here

365
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:01,640
and show them that they
can still trust me.

366
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,112
You need to get well.

367
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,616
Everything will be okay

368
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,920
if you put me back
on my medication.

369
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:09,448
I was stupid to think
it would be different.

370
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:10,824
<i>What</i> would be different?

371
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:17,431
Oh, I really messed up
this time.

372
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:22,933
Hey.

373
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:30,103
This is for you.

374
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:31,509
It's from Emily.

375
00:21:33,574 --> 00:21:35,973
She sends her love.

376
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,212
<i>She</i> wants you
to get well, too.

377
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:49,188
Okay.

378
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:51,092
Okay.

379
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:05,809
Hey.
Hi, guys. Come on in.

380
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,602
I have an assignment for you.
- Sure.

381
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,033
I need you to find Vincent's
younger brother, Leo, and talk to him.

382
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:11,506
He works for
a nonprofit organization

383
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,946
called, um, Earth Now.

384
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,739
It's on the West Side.
- I'll make some calls.

385
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:18,178
No, no, no, no. No, I need you to go
there and talk to him face-to-face.

386
00:22:18,243 --> 00:22:19,921
You want us
to leave the ward?

387
00:22:19,987 --> 00:22:21,153
Yeah. Problem?

388
00:22:21,218 --> 00:22:23,954
We don't do that.
We're residents.

389
00:22:24,018 --> 00:22:25,984
We treat the person,
not just the disease.

390
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,392
Vincent's friends,
family,

391
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,056
relationships that are
outside this hospital.

392
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:31,088
It's -- it's all the stuff
you can't pull off the chart.

393
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:33,024
Anything in particular
you want to know?

394
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:36,369
Yeah. For starters, I want to
know why he went off his meds.

395
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:37,873
Got it.

396
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,842
Good.
Okay. Thanks, guys.

397
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:43,713
Are you always as pissed off
as you look?

398
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,569
I'm a doctor,
not a freaking detective.

399
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:51,778
Yes, my sister.

400
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:54,178
Man, talk about having
a stick up your ass.

401
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,048
I take it you guys
weren't close.

402
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:58,255
No way -- I've barely talked
to her or Vincent

403
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,695
since our folks died.

404
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,359
That is about a year ago,
right?

405
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:02,654
Uh, yeah
car accident.

406
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:05,230
But we were a pretty
dysfunctional family anyways,

407
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,903
especially after Vincent
went bonkers.

408
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:10,269
Hey, Planet Now, guys.
Thank you.

409
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:12,127
My parents couldn't deal
with it at all.

410
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:13,743
They just kind of
checked out.

411
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,998
Who looked after you?
Well, pretty much Edolie.

412
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,142
So, maybe that's why she's got
that stick up her ass --

413
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:20,910
taking care
of a younger brother,

414
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:22,973
worrying about an older one
with a mental illness.

415
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,573
I know. Leo the jerk.
What else is new?

416
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:29,244
Hey, do you guys know
how many harbor seals

417
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:32,412
die every year off the
California coast of pollution?

418
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:33,884
I'm guessing
more than five.

419
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:35,914
Can we put a pin on saving
the planet for a minute?

420
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,883
Why do you think Vincent
went off his meds?

421
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:41,163
Well, my mom and dad left the
house we all grew up into Edolie.

422
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:43,324
I guess they figured
Vincent was too out of it

423
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:45,689
and I was just a druggie,
which I was.

424
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:46,938
Not anymore.

425
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:54,746
Uh, anyways, Edolie had
just gotten a divorce,

426
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,906
and Vincent was living
with her and the kids,

427
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,545
so they all moved back into
the parents' house together.

428
00:23:59,611 --> 00:24:02,009
Vincent must have found
his old drawings.

429
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,944
It's just a guess.

430
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,585
Hey.
Are you seeing anybody?

431
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:13,353
So, if he'd never seen
the old drawings...

432
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,952
he never would have remembered
his old life.

433
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:16,488
Other than the carving
on the wall,

434
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:18,970
has Vincent tried to draw
anything since he's been here?

435
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:20,904
No. It's an interesting
thought, though.

436
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,767
Nice work, you guys.
You really should get out more.

437
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:40,022
Yeah,
I'd like a cab, please.

438
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:47,157
Ms. Martin? Anyone home?

439
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,420
Sir, put your hands
where I can see them.

440
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:31,852
Busted.

441
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:42,460
What's next?

442
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:45,563
Scaling the Hollywood sign?
Uh, celebrity stalking?

443
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:47,403
I made a house call.

444
00:26:47,468 --> 00:26:48,973
Without
the owner's consent,

445
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:50,843
it's called
breaking and entering.

446
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,717
You're a hospital
Department Head!

447
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:54,508
You don't
make house calls!

448
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,779
I played a hunch.
It paid off.

449
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:01,051
Nice ride --
very L.A.

450
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:02,747
I just hung up
with Edolie Martin.

451
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:05,387
She's prepared to drop
all criminal charges against you

452
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:08,363
and forgo any civil suit
against the hospital...

453
00:27:08,428 --> 00:27:11,131
if you agree...

454
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:13,066
to release Vincent
to Twelve Oaks now.

455
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,697
I still have 24 hours.

456
00:27:14,762 --> 00:27:16,392
What could possibly change
in 24 hours

457
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:18,056
except for
that you lose your license

458
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,400
and the hospital
goes bankrupt?

459
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:21,704
Thanks
for bailing me out.

460
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,497
This is serious, Jack.

461
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:28,103
I have to convene
a medical-review panel.

462
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:29,303
Bring it on.

463
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,752
This panel
is here to discuss

464
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:37,111
treatment options in the case
of patient Vincent Martin.

465
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,591
We're on the record.

466
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:41,750
Here's the plan.

467
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:44,582
Bag the Haldol.
Let's detox him completely.

468
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,294
No medication, nothing?

469
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,191
I'll stabilize him temporarily
without drugs.

470
00:27:49,255 --> 00:27:50,326
To what end?

471
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:52,261
12 years ago,
a doctor mixed Vince

472
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:54,262
a medication cocktail,
and he improved.

473
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:55,637
Since then, he's changed.

474
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:57,509
Hell, how we treat the disease
has changed.

475
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:58,965
Let's get rid
of the old chemistry

476
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:00,405
and figure out
how sick he really is.

477
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,341
Stabilize how?

478
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:04,277
Megavitamins, neurofeedback,
acupuncture,

479
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:06,149
homeopathic medies...
juggling tomatoes --

480
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:07,573
whatever works.

481
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:10,051
You can't treat schizophrenia
with aromatherapy.

482
00:28:10,117 --> 00:28:13,075
The pharmacology's
been successful for...

483
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:14,722
a dozen years, huh?

484
00:28:14,786 --> 00:28:16,209
Why deviate?

485
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:17,950
<i>You</i> call it a success.

486
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:20,478
I say the patient's
been crippled.

487
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,959
You mean creatively.

488
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:26,559
He's a gifted artist,
and for the last 12 year

489
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:28,525
he's been stuck
in a plumbing warehouse,

490
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:30,431
moving boxes
from one pile to another.

491
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:32,797
And that's
about to get worse.

492
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:35,869
He's about to be filed away
in an institution for life.

493
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,628
The preferred methodology

494
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,509
would be to restore Mr. Martin's
drug intake to prior levels

495
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:43,582
then reduce it incrementally
to establish a new threshold.

496
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:46,572
He's already gone through
most of the withdrawal.

497
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:49,421
We don't have the time
to go back to square one.

498
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:52,348
So, you said, "stabilize him
temporarily without drugs."

499
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,252
He's gonna need drugs.
Of course he is.

500
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,692
And counseling.

501
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:57,693
But the point is, we have
an opportunity right now

502
00:28:57,758 --> 00:28:59,789
to build him
a new regimen.

503
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:02,060
Y-you don't have time
for that, either.

504
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:03,692
I talked to the attorneys.

505
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:07,996
Even if this panel grants you
the 20 or so remaining hours,

506
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:11,194
after that, the sister gets him,
and we risk getting sued.

507
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:17,579
I want every single hour.
It's worth the risk.

508
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:31,974
What happened?

509
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,805
Well, they found another freezer
in Mr. Emerson's garage.

510
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:35,975
More felines?

511
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:37,781
No. His wife.

512
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:39,078
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,422
I wouldn't have taken him
for a sociopath.

514
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,294
Oh, no.
She died of natural causes.

515
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,389
He doesn't kill.
He stores.

516
00:29:44,455 --> 00:29:46,756
Cold comfort
to the wife.

517
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:50,868
Excuse me.
Could you give us a minute?

518
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:53,204
Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

519
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,939
Grayson,
are you all right?

520
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,906
Don't be disappointed with me.
- No, I'm not.

521
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,195
April was my whole life.

522
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:03,746
I wanted to stay close
to her until...

523
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,344
Until what?

524
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:10,479
The technology became available,
you know, to bring her back.

525
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:13,521
I just...
couldn't let go.

526
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:17,392
I-I enjoyed
talking to you.

527
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:20,592
I hope we can continue
our conversation.

528
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:22,159
We will,
because you'll come back.

529
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:24,591
Okay.
Take care, Grayson.

530
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:42,541
Go away.

531
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,918
Cut me some slack, Vincent.
I could use the company.

532
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:54,779
Huh?

533
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,626
What time is it?

534
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,963
It's late.

535
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:36,858
I-I can't.

536
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:41,163
That's all right.

537
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:42,938
We've got all night.

538
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:17,592
You got a minute?

539
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:19,304
Anything you need.

540
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:20,872
Oh, Jack wanted you
to be present today

541
00:32:20,936 --> 00:32:22,744
at his meeting
with Edolie Martin.

542
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:30,647
No.

543
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:32,008
I'm in no hurry.

544
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:34,519
You can take as long as you need
to find a replacement.

545
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,760
Ronnie, why?

546
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:39,847
You know why.
You made your choice.

547
00:32:39,928 --> 00:32:41,927
This is too quick.
Give yourself time to adapt.

548
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:45,735
Why should I adapt?

549
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,702
I'm worked here
my entire career.

550
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:49,893
This is my home.
And now <i>I</i> have to adapt?

551
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:51,093
The hell I will.

552
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,070
You me some guy
on a ski vacation.

553
00:32:54,135 --> 00:32:56,630
Next thing I kn--
First of all, it was a conference.

554
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:58,166
Second of all,
I saw his clinic.

555
00:32:58,247 --> 00:33:01,605
Can you help me out, nor
can you make me understand?

556
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,509
Jack Gallagher
hadn't been here five minutes

557
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:04,805
when he
stripped down naked.

558
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,212
Oh, I was there.

559
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,348
Would <i>you</i> have,
under any circumstances?

560
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:09,108
Would have found
another way.

561
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:11,188
Been more profession.
- Yes.

562
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,316
In that moment,
Jack didn't care about anything

563
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:14,851
but the patient --
not propriety,

564
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:17,283
not professionalism,
not ridicule.

565
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:20,099
That's why I hired him.

566
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:25,026
Sleep on this, please.

567
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:26,898
If you come back
tomorrow,

568
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,506
I won't try to talk you
out of it.

569
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,610
You never would have hired
Gallagher two years ago.

570
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:34,515
Go on, say it --

571
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:37,970
before I had cancer,
no, probably not.

572
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:41,872
That would have
been crazy.

573
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:53,392
Time's up.

574
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,601
Five minutes.
That all I ask.

575
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,801
Then you can lock the door
and throw away the key.

576
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,369
I love my brother.

577
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,242
I also know
what he's capable of.

578
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,064
I've lived with him
my whole life.

579
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:07,169
But now I'm a single mother
with two young children.

580
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,233
I won't put my kids
through that.

581
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:10,480
Sign it.

582
00:34:10,546 --> 00:34:12,336
Look at these.

583
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,150
I-I've seen them.

584
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,951
I have hundreds of Vincent's
old illustrations.

585
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,624
He was a prodigy
before he got sick.

586
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:22,189
He won awards.
He hasn't worked since

587
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:24,157
he drew these last night.

588
00:34:30,823 --> 00:34:32,260
He wanted that to be his last.

589
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:35,996
After that it's a quick
trip to the funny farm.

590
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:43,099
What are you proposing?

591
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:48,315
Vincent's now drug-free.

592
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:52,012
From here, we comprise
a new cocktail, get him stable.

593
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:54,316
This is Dr. Hayden-Jones.

594
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,291
She runs a day clinic here, and
it's shown remarkable success

595
00:34:57,356 --> 00:35:01,049
in bridging the gap between
full-time and part-time care.

596
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:02,858
I would be
more than happy to --

597
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:05,353
to tell you all about it,
if you're interested.

598
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:10,298
What does Vincent want?

599
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:15,641
Vincent wants to go home,
be with his family.

600
00:35:15,706 --> 00:35:17,210
And if that means
going back on his meds

601
00:35:17,274 --> 00:35:18,809
and giving up
on his amazing gift and --

602
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:20,744
and hauling boxes
around a freaking warehouse,

603
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,247
well, then, so be it.

604
00:35:22,313 --> 00:35:25,511
He's -- he's willing
to sacrifice everything...

605
00:35:25,576 --> 00:35:28,183
because he loves you
and the children so much.

606
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,814
I'm not offering
guarantees.

607
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:38,262
The last thing
anyone wants to do

608
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:40,293
is put you or your children
in danger.

609
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:43,093
This is a chance...
- No more.

610
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:49,573
Thank you.

611
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:52,131
Uh, Dr. Gallagher,
join me.

612
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:54,308
Please.

613
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:55,667
Thanks.

614
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:57,571
How are you
settling in?

615
00:35:57,637 --> 00:36:00,034
Sure opinions would vary.

616
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:02,305
Made quite an impact.

617
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,577
???A a change
from our last director.

618
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:06,945
He tended to operate
below the radar.

619
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:09,650
Probably very wise.

620
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,184
Dr. Friedman and I
had an agreement.

621
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:14,114
Hopefully you and I can achieve
a similar understanding.

622
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:15,649
Anything's possible.

623
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:18,225
As you may or may not know...

624
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:21,232
...I specialize in the fields
of addiction, pharmacology.

625
00:36:21,297 --> 00:36:22,369
Growth areas.

626
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:23,600
And I've been
fortunate enough

627
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:24,959
to bring major
pharmaceutical companies

628
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:26,671
here to Wharton to conduct
their research trials.

629
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,126
That's impressive.

630
00:36:28,192 --> 00:36:30,928
It is, and quite profitable
for the hospital.

631
00:36:32,912 --> 00:36:34,766
So,
about this understanding?

632
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:39,102
In the past, I've enjoyed
a certain degree of autonomy.

633
00:36:39,184 --> 00:36:40,445
Ah.

634
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,854
In exchange, perhaps
I can help <i>you</i> out, too.

635
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:46,445
I appreciate the thought.
Thank you.

636
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:52,124
I think you and I can become
great allies, Dr. Gallagher.

637
00:36:52,189 --> 00:36:54,124
Looking forward to it.

638
00:36:54,189 --> 00:36:56,764
You continue to have
a great day, all right?

639
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:06,730
Enter.

640
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:12,170
I just wanted to thank you
for supporting the clinic.

641
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:14,602
It's a good program.
Come in, come in.

642
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:16,169
Sit down.

643
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,553
Ay-Yi-Yi.

644
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:32,952
Yeah. Another roller-coaster day
in the fun house

645
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:34,488
and with you driving,
I have a sinking feeling

646
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,024
we're in
for more of the same.

647
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:39,273
Yeah.

648
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,433
You're married.

649
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:45,767
Yes.
To a jazz musician.

650
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,143
Eight years this June.

651
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,711
You're not.

652
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:53,142
Close...no cigar.

653
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,646
So, who was she?

654
00:37:56,712 --> 00:37:59,750
Someone I met in med school.
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:03,557
She was an oncologist.
Nearly went that route myself.

656
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:05,189
So, how did you
wind up a shrink?

657
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:07,924
I guess I've always
had brains on the brain.

658
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:08,886
Short story?

659
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,228
Dad was in the military.

660
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:15,460
Mum worked as a nurse
at the V.A. Hospital.

661
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,636
Sometimes I used to
go by there after school.

662
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:25,749
Hey, kid.
Comeere.

663
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:27,139
Come here.

664
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:31,379
Do me a favor,
will you?

665
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:34,547
Scratch my foot.
I can't reach.

666
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:36,882
No, no, no.
The other one.

667
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,154
Whew!

668
00:38:44,962 --> 00:38:48,289
Come on!
It's killing me!

669
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:50,226
Whew!

670
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,609
Thanks a million, kid.

671
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:01,201
So, here's this guy,

672
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:03,184
and his head's telling him
there should be a foot there,

673
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,881
even when his eyes
can't see it.

674
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:08,143
And I'm thinking,
"interesting."

675
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:09,951
Still is.

676
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,048
And I'm thinking,
"I haven't got a clue

677
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:15,920
who you are or if that story
is even remotely true."

678
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:22,831
Hang in there.

679
00:39:24,368 --> 00:39:25,903
It'll be fun.

680
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,663
Oh,
I'm not going anywhere.

681
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:34,478
How are you feeling?

682
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:37,981
I'm <i>feeling.</i>

683
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:40,350
Everything seems
really different.

684
00:39:40,415 --> 00:39:42,687
Medication didn't just take away
your ability to paint.

685
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:44,542
It took away the --
the passions, the pains,

686
00:39:44,622 --> 00:39:46,813
the highs, the lows --
everything that made you human.

687
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,389
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose control again.

688
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:50,717
It's possible.

689
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:52,797
It's got to be worth
the chance, though, right?

690
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:54,430
Look, if it comes down
to a choice

691
00:39:54,494 --> 00:39:56,062
between my drawing
and my family --

692
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,934
hey, no choice.
- Of course.

693
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:00,205
But be patient.
You've only just started.

694
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:04,173
Right over there.
See?

695
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:05,964
Uncle Vincent!

696
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,870
Finally!
I missed you!

697
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:13,307
I missed you, too.

698
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,883
Looking good.
- How's it been going?

699
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,314
It's been kind of rough,
actually.

700
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:21,978
Well, you're back.

701
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:24,187
Hi.

702
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:25,450
Hi.

703
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:30,186
Hey, guys.
It's good to see you guys.

704
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:31,624
Yeah.

705
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,045
Beck?

706
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:59,620
I'm glad you've called.
I was thinking about you.

707
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:05,124
Becky, please say something.
Let me know you're there.

708
00:41:07,189 --> 00:41:10,468
I'm in L.A., too.
Can you believe it?

709
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,197
Listen, Becky,
you don't have to,

710
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:14,340
but maybe you could give
mum and dad a call.

711
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,331
They're, uh...

712
00:41:17,397 --> 00:41:18,996
They'd love to talk to you.

713
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,706
You don't have to say anything.

714
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,738
You know,
just if you feel like it,

715
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:24,146
you could give them a ring.

716
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:32,417
I'm at Wharton Memorial.
It's on 3rd street.

717
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:34,480
You can always get me there.

718
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:43,088
Listen, Becky...

719
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:44,687
you know,
if you need anything --

720
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,336
Um, money or, uh...

721
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:09,950
<i>Hey, hey, it's Jack.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>
