1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,200
I'm, you know --

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,300
You pig!

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,500
Friend of yours?

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,100
I thought it was going so well.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,700
Actually,she was my date last night.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,300
And that was her roommate.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,600
- Not your day. - Not my year.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,900
Maybe it's your technique,or the fact
that you're a misogynistic pig.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,400
Maybe if you'd ever had
a relationship with a man,

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,000
You'd have something to offer here.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,900
This is what i love to see
first thing in the morning --

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,000
Two of my favorite colleagues exchanging
important behavioral diagnosis.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,100
What's the subject?

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,600
Dating, failed relationships,
suicidal ideations.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,000
- Ah.Comes with the territory.
- What does?

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,400
Intimacy issues, research,
on my desk tomorrow morning.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,300
What's the divorce rate
for psychiatrists

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,300
As opposed to, say,internists?

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,400
I'm assuming a little more?

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,100
Almost double.

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,700
Research, on my desk,
tomorrow morning.

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,300
You know, when i go to a party,

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,500
I don't tell anyone that
i'm even remotely attracted to

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,400
That i'm a shrink.

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, they just freeze up
and run for the hills.

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
You're dating an architect.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,800
You pass by a beautiful building.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,800
Suddenly, they start warbling on

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,700
About how aesthetically wrong
the whole thing is.

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,300
Fascinating, but you suck it up.

31
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,600
You're a shrink.

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,700
<i>Do you ever
start talking</i>

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,300
About how this person
or that person needs therapy?

34
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
- No. - Why not?

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,500
Well, it's too invasive.

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,100
All comes down to the same line --

37
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,600
"Stop analyzing me."

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,400
Stop analyzing me.

39
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,700
<i>Dr. Cutlett, dr. Briar,</i>

40
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,700
<i>Please report to pre-Surgery corridor.</i>

41
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,300
Craig! Hi!

42
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,700
<i>What are you doing down here?</i>

43
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,300
Hello, doctor.

44
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,500
I'm -- I'm gonna have surgery tomorrow.

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
What kind of surgery?

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
Uh, brain operation.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Dirty whore!

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,100
I-I don't understand.

49
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,400
When you left the resident day clinic,

50
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,500
You were doing so well --
What happened?

51
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,300
I was.I-I-I thought so, too,
but, um...

52
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,300
Things have changed.

53
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm -- I'm going downhill.

54
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm so sorry to hear that,craig.

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,100
Do you -- Do you know why that is?

56
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
I -- I have to go now. Uh...

57
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
M-Mimi's waiting for me.

58
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,800
I-I need you to focus for a minute.

59
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,900
Do you know what -- What kind

60
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,000
Of brain surgery it is that you're having?

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
It's called a cingulotomy.

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,200
Douchebag!

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
???

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
Look,i -- I have to go.

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,300
The last thing i need

66
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,400
Is to get in a-Another fight with mimi.

67
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,600
You're having troubles
with mimi? Since when?

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,500
Listen...i can't talk about it now.

69
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,100
Bitch!

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,900
All right, craig.

71
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,400
The irony is,behavior is our specialty.

72
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,100
We should be better at this than anyone else.

73
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,400
Why can't we sustain a relationship?

74
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,500
Wait a minute.You and --

75
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,400
Yeah,i got a "dear chloe" e-Mail.

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,700
Oh, i'm sorry.

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,000
What?No "i told you so"?

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,400
Hey, i've been there.
I know what it's like.

79
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,400
What happened?

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
I just think she couldn't handle

81
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,700
How involved i was in my career.

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,000
I mean, she has a life, i don't.

83
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,400
We're residents. We work 18 hours a day.
What does she expect?

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
It's not just the hours.

85
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,900
It's the fact that we're intimately involved

86
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,800
In every detail of our patients' lives --

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Their sexual needs, their fantasies, their dysfunctions.

88
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,300
What did you expect?
It's not the hours.

89
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,400
But you're always telling us
to ask more questions, dig deeper.

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,100
And the deeper we dig
into our patients' lives,

91
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,400
The more we're burying our own.

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
- I'm incredibly tuned in. - And humble.

93
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
No, i mean with my patients.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I sense what they're feeling,
what they need from me.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Women? I have no freakin' clue.

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,900
I always end up saying the wrong thing.

97
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,400
Or end up sleeping with their roommate.

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,800
Maybe we're just screwed up.

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,700
Is that terminology in the dsm-Iv?

100
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,900
No, i-I mean to begin with.

101
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,400
People who are drawn to this field --

102
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Like you guys --

103
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,500
Usually do so because something
in their own lives

104
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,100
Has led them to believe
that people are, in general,

105
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,200
Including themselves, totally screwed up.

106
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,100
So, basically,
you're saying that none of us

107
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,000
Is destined to have
a successful relationship?

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
That we're gonna go through life
lonely and miserable?

109
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
God, what is wrong with us?

110
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,900
What's wrong with you?

111
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,600
You're psychiatrists.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,900
A cingulotomy!
I mean, can you believe this?

116
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,200
Who ordered the surgery?

117
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
Some hack shrink
i've never even heard of

118
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
His wife, mimi,put him onto.

119
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,800
I mean, the wife calls the shots.

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
How long have they been married?

121
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,000
10 years, no kids --
They were happy.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,300
<i>Listen, this man was doing
so well in my clinic.</i>

123
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,500
When he first came to me,
his ocd had gotten so bad,

124
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,900
He was presenting with tourette's.

125
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,100
Six months later,i said goodbye to him,

126
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
The outbursts, the ticks --
Virtually gone.

127
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,900
He got himself a new job.
His marriage was back on track.

128
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,200
When's the surgery scheduled?

129
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,100
Tomorrow morning,8:00 a.M.

130
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,900
A neurosurgeon here at wharton's performing it,

131
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,300
A dr. Zan avidan.

132
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,200
What kind of name is that,
anyway -- Zan avidan?

133
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,600
I have no idea.

134
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Anyway,i can't find her.

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,100
I've been down to the neuro unit.

136
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,900
I've -- I've left voice-Mail
messages -- Nothing.

137
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,600
Anyone would think she's hiding.

138
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,200
"In recent studies,

139
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,000
"32% of patients previously
unresponsive to medication

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
"And behavioral treatments for ocd

141
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
Were at least partly improved
after a cingulotomy."

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,100
But that's just it --

143
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,800
<i>He had vastly improved</i>

144
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
With behavioral treatments and medication.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,500
Does it mention there the side effects

146
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,400
Of having the brain surgery?

147
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,700
"Deficits of focus and sustained attention,

148
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,400
"As well as mild executive dysfunction,

149
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,100
Loss of speech,loss of memory."

150
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,400
So he undergoes the surgery,

151
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,500
Has parts of his brain tissue burned off,

152
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,900
The success rate's below 50%,

153
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,500
<i>And there's side effects --
Nice.</i>

154
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,800
I'm with you.

155
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
The surgery's still
in the experimental phase.

156
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm not a fan of cutting anyone open
if an alternative exists.

157
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,800
Now, obviously, he wasdoing well
in your care

158
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,200
With therapy and medication.

159
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,700
Very well.

160
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,400
Right.I think i'll go down
to pre-Op

161
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,900
And have a little chat
with mr. Peters.

162
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,000
Really?I-I'll go with you.

163
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,200
Officially, he's not our patient.

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Well, officially, no.

165
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,800
My department,my responsibility.

166
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,100
Let me take the heat.

167
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,800
Okay.

168
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,600
- Craig? - Yes

169
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,400
Dr. Jack gallagher.

170
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,500
Are you the anesthesiologist?

171
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,000
Actually, no.

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
I'm the director of psychiatric services
here at the hospital.

173
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
Dr. Hayden-Jones -- Veronica --

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,300
She asked me to drop by.

175
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,500
She was very concerned about you.

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Why? Tch!

177
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Douchebag!

178
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,400
How much do you know about
the operation tomorrow, craig?

179
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
I was -- I was informed
about the procedure.

180
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,400
I-I was told that i would feel
much better afterwards,

181
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,700
And this surgeon --

182
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,700
Surgeon assured me that
the operating room was sterile.

183
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,800
Oh, yeah, it's sterile.

184
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,900
Did they tell you, though,
right before the operation,

185
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,000
Someone's gonna come down here with
a razor and shave your head?

186
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
My whole - My whole head?

187
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,400
But i-I don't have
very much hair to begin with.

188
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,900
And then they're gonna take you
down to the operating room,

189
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,100
Where someone's gonna drill
a hole in your skull.

190
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,000
But, uh... i'll be asleep by then.

191
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,300
Oh, yeah,there'll be no pain involved.

192
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,500
At least not till you wake up.

193
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,600
<i>You see, craig,most surgeons i know,</i>

194
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,000
They're very good at slicing people open,

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,300
But they're not so good with helping

196
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,000
With the months of recuperation afterwards.

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,600
Months?

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,900
Mm-Hmm. Afraid so.

199
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,100
But my, uh --My symptoms --
The ticking,the swearing,

200
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,100
The oc-- Ocd --
It's all gonna improve, right?

201
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,200
Maybe.At least for the ocd anyway.

202
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,300
No guarantees.

203
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Though were also no guarantees

204
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,500
With psychotherapy and medication,

205
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,800
And you did improve tremendously
in veronica's day clinic.

206
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Nobody had to shave your head,
drill a hole in your skull,

207
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,200
Kind of root around inside your brain.

208
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,700
Can i -- Can i still change my mind?

209
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,000
I was hoping you'd ask that.

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Thought he was growing on you?

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,200
No, he is, like a weed
invading on my territory.

212
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,300
It's not that he's doing a bad job.

213
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,600
<i>It's just that, you know,
craig peters is my patient.</i>

214
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,300
And, you know, he just comes in,
and he takes over.

215
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,900
- No more shop talk.- Sorry.

216
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,000
So, was the penne puttanesca
up to your standard?

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,200
Mmm. It was a little al dente. Yeah.

218
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
The goat-Cheese capellini
was just shy of perfection.

219
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,300
Okay.

220
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,200
You should come over one night.

221
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,300
I'll cook for you.

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Maybe i will.

223
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,200
You won't.

224
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
- What? - You won't.

225
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,300
I've asked you a dozen times
to come over to my place,

226
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,900
And every single time,
you've had some excuse...

227
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,500
Not to.

228
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,400
What are you afraid of?
What you might find?

229
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,700
Bachelor-Pad extraordinaire?

230
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,400
Lava lamps, water bed, animal-Print rug?

231
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,700
Moose head?

232
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,500
Not afraid of what i might find.

233
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
Just that, you know, well, maybe --

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,900
Maybe i'll like it there.

235
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,000
No. And want to stay.

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Rylan...

237
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
All right. Okay. All right.

238
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,700
How about tonight?

239
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,100
If i can get away early.

240
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,500
Okay.

241
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,200
Four seasons? Motel 6?

242
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
There's a park bench.

243
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,400
Your choice.

244
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,500
<i>About going to your place --</i>

245
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,700
That's all right. No, i get it.

246
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Ah, you're missing out.

247
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Steak tomato. Ahh.

248
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,600
Charm the pants off you.

249
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
My pants are coming off me anyway.

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,100
So are yours.

251
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,200
Mm, mnh-Mnh, mnh-Mnh, mnh-Mnh.

252
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,200
Nothing for him, mario.
He's not staying.

253
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,000
Arturo, what kind of game
are you playing?

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Not playing any game.

255
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,700
I gave you an assignment.

256
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,800
You're obviously not taking it seriously.

257
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,900
I need information.
You need to keep your job.

258
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm trying.

259
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,700
Have you had dinner with him yet?

260
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,000
I've asked.
Outside of work, he's kind of a loner.

261
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
Is he sleeping with anyone?
Anyone at the hospital?

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,600
I don't know.

263
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,600
The problem in a nutshell.

264
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,400
What do you want me to tell you?

265
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Dr. Gallagher's a good guy.

266
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,700
Be aggressive. Be inventive.

267
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,200
Tell him you're having a crisis of conscience.

268
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,400
You're wondering whether to continue spying

269
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Or be like mario here, serving lunch for a living.

270
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,800
Given the stakes,

271
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,000
I have every confidence that you'll find a way.

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,700
I'm not trained to do this, dr. Belle.

273
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,500
No?

274
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,700
I thought acting ran in your family.

275
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
What happened at the poker game?

276
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,400
Nothing.

277
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,200
He's a good card player. He won.

278
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,000
Did you see any drug
paraphernalia in evidence?

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,300
Other than alcohol, no.

280
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,100
Was he drinking?

281
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
We all were -- Beer.

282
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Do you believe
he has a problem with alcohol?

283
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,500
Not from what i've seen.

284
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,700
I don't know everything about you, arturo.

285
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,600
Mmm. Yeah. Thank you.

286
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
But i do know this.

287
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,200
You want, more than anything,

288
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,600
To be sitting right
where i'm sitting right now.

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
And i can make sure that that happens.

290
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,000
Or i can make sure that that never happens.

291
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,400
Dr. Gallagher. I got a page.

292
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,500
Excuse me. Are you dr. Gallagher?

293
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,100
Hmm. You got me!

294
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,500
Yeah, figures.

295
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
- Excuse me?
- Well, they told me you were a bit odd.

296
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,600
Who's "they"?

297
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,500
I'm here about my patient -- Craig peters?

298
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
- You must be -- - Dr. Avidan.

299
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,500
Ah.

300
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,900
You literally come down to my pre-Op,

301
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,200
And you kidnap my patient.

302
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,100
He left voluntarily.

303
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,000
Only after you scared
the living crap out of him.

304
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,600
Just had a little chat with him.

305
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,500
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

306
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,600
Uh, would you rather spend the next 20 years

307
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,400
In psychotherapy or an hour and a half
in an operating room?

308
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,800
Uh, i don't know --

309
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
<i>How do you like it?</i>

310
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,100
Where the hell do you get off

311
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,800
Talking my patient out of surgery?

312
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,500
"A," you have no business
even speaking to him,

313
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
And, "b," this operation
is extremely important.

314
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,300
- To whom? - Excuse me?

315
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,500
Cingulotomys are rarely performed.

316
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,100
It's a risky and unproven procedure.

317
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,800
Is your concern for your patient
or your résum?

318
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Listen, doctor --
And i use that term loosely --

319
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,900
You're about to cut a hole
in the head

320
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,100
Of a man you know nothing about.

321
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,200
I-I know that he's unable
to live a normal life.

322
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,300
I know that you geniuses
have had him on the couch

323
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,500
For six months,
and he still can't go to work.

324
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
He can't eat at a restaurant.

325
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,900
He can't have sexual relations
with his wife.

326
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,500
Why?

327
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,200
Because of his
obsessive-Compulsive condition.

328
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
But why?
Why exactly is he ocd?

329
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What's the root cause?

330
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,300
I don't see how
this has anything to do with --

331
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,000
You're treating symptoms, not the disease.

332
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Leave the medicine to the real doctors,

333
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
Will you, gallagher?

334
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,500
Oh. And who are they?

335
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I want peters back in pre-Op
by tomorrow morning,

336
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Or i'm filing disciplinary
charges against you.

337
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,500
It's craig's decision.

338
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,800
Not with you up his ass!

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
Well, you'll have
to arm-Wrestle me for him.

340
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,000
You'd lose.

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,600
<i>Orderly, 319. Orderly, 319.</i>

342
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,200
Wow.

343
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,500
I don't understand.

344
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,400
It was all taken care of.

345
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,800
Craig went to a psychiatrist,

346
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Who referred him to a surgeon --

347
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Dr. Avidan.

348
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Why is he back up in the psych ward?

349
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Mimi, you say you know
what's best for your husband.

350
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,500
- If that's true -- - Of course it's true.

351
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,800
He needs to have  surgery.

352
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,500
Well, unfortunately,
we're not convinced.

353
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,700
"We"?

354
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,300
You're not the ones
who have to live with him.

355
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,800
He twitches,
he screams out "dirty whore,"

356
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
He refuses to take me anyplace

357
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,600
Because of all the germs
in public places.

358
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
He carries a bottle of disinfectant

359
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,300
With him at all times, even in bed.

360
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,600
He sprays me with it!

361
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Last week, he put a plastic bag
over our cat.

362
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,300
She nearly died.

363
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm -- I'm very sorry, mimi.

364
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Look, i'm just trying
to save my marriage.

365
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
I love craig. You know that.

366
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,000
I've spent 10 years with him and this ocd.

367
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
But now it's...

368
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,100
It's just gotten so bad.

369
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,600
I don't know how --
How anyone can take it.

370
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,800
Mimi, there's no easy solution.

371
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,000
<i>We had a solution -- Surgery.</i>

372
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,600
This is mimi. This is craig's wife.

373
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,500
Uh, drs. Gallagher and suarez.

374
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,000
Thing is, mimi, we can always
reschedule the surgery.

375
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,500
<i>Good. Then we'll reschedule it now.</i>

376
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,700
After we've had a chance to treat him

377
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
With medication and therapy,

378
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,900
We can get him right back on track

379
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,200
Without such an invasive step.

380
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,300
No, no, no i'm done with that.

381
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,400
I want him back.

382
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
I want the man that i married back.

383
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,700
I can't wait years for...

384
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,400
We're not talking years.

385
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,700
It may just be a matter of months.

386
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,400
No.

387
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,000
Not months, not weeks, not days. I'm done.

388
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,700
He's having the surgery,
or i-I don't know what i'll...

389
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Arturo, would you take mrs. Peters

390
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,900
To the doctors lounge
and get her a glass of water?

391
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,900
Sure.

392
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Have you seen mimi?

393
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,000
She's, uh...

394
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,300
She's still with arturo, i think.

395
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,900
Well, there's something wrong with her.

396
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,600
What? Well, you know, it's like
she's -- She's changed.

397
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,400
She's like a completely different person.

398
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,700
Walk with me.

399
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,500
She dropped him off and picked him up

400
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,000
From the clinic every single day.

401
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
She was never late.

402
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,300
She'd hand him his lunch
before she left,

403
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,600
Remind him to take his meds.

404
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,100
You heard her. He's not
the easiest personto live with.

405
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,400
Perhaps she's at the end
of her rope.

406
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
I don't buy that.
She was a dedicated caregiver.

407
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,800
Her only concern was --

408
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Was making sure
that craig got better.

409
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,700
Even the way she looked.
What do you mean?

410
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Well, the low-Cut top,
the black stockings --

411
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,300
This woman used to dress
so conservatively.

412
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,500
<i>She would never wear a skirt.</i>

413
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,300
She was mousy, and she was shy.

414
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,700
And this was only a few months ago?

415
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,400
Yeah. The change in her is radical,

416
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,900
And i think it's affecting craig.

417
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,400
So, i'm still waiting
on those disciplinary charges.

418
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
- May i? - No.

419
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,200
I'm warning you, gallagher,

420
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
If craig isn't rescheduled for surgery

421
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
In the next 12 hours,
you're in a world of trouble.

422
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Nothing to do with me.
It's craig's decision.

423
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,100
Mm. Yeah, with you aiding and abetting.

424
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,700
This isn't a conspiracy.

425
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,600
That's exactly what this is.

426
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,600
This is a psychiatric conspiracy.

427
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
So, what, are you opposed
to all types of surgery

428
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,700
Or just neurosurgery?

429
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,600
No, you got me all wrong.

430
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,100
I like all forms of modern medicine.

431
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,500
But i also like good,
old-Fashioned ones like, um...

432
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,700
Talking to the patient.

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,300
More ways of getting inside a brain
than just sawing it open.

434
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,200
Tell me that the next time

435
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,300
You have a cerebral aneurysm, okay?

436
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,400
I'll pray you're on call when that happens.

437
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
So, how long you been at wharton?

438
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,200
<i>Longer than you have.</i>

439
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
Please, i'm just making conversation.

440
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, to what end?

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,700
What, you think your charm,
your personality,

442
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Your -- Your -- Your handsomeness

443
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,700
Is gonna win me over
after what you did?

444
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,100
I have charm and personality
and handsomeness?

445
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,400
Excuse me.

446
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,800
Hey, hey.

447
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,700
Hi.

448
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,000
How are you, craig?

449
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,000
Great.

450
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,800
I haven't ticked for at least 20 minutes.

451
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,700
That's good.

452
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,200
What's happened to you, craig?

453
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Since you left the day clinic.

454
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,600
Well, things were going pretty well.

455
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,100
Got a job as a teller
in the bank where mimi works.

456
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,200
Oh, yeah? You still on the job?

457
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,500
No, i got fired.

458
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,200
Money is very unsanitary, as you know.

459
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Yes, it is. Filthy.

460
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,500
You speak to the manager

461
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,300
About maybe wearing some plastic gloves?

462
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,100
I did. She said it wasn't allowed.

463
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Mimi's the manager.

464
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,600
Oh.

465
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,500
How are things with you
and mimi at home?

466
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
Not so good.
You know what it's like.

467
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,600
Actually, i don't.

468
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Never been married.

469
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,500
Well...

470
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,800
You've seen mimi,

471
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
So you know
what a sexual dynamo she is.

472
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,600
She wants to, you know,
do it every night --

473
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,600
Sometimes two or three times,
and...

474
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,600
I can't.

475
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,100
Because of her germs?

476
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,300
No.

477
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,800
I mean, i spray a lot,
so that's not it.

478
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,100
We used to have
a great sex life, but now...

479
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,900
You know, she's not satisfied... ever.

480
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
And it makes the...

481
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,900
Ticking and everything worse.

482
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I -- I don't want to have this surgery.

483
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,200
But...

484
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,300
...i'd do anything for her.

485
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,100
She -- She's put up with me
for all these years.

486
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
No one else would have.

487
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,400
She's my whole life.

488
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,500
Mrs. Peters.

489
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Please call me mimi.

490
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,000
Mimi, come on in.

491
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Have you seen craig today?

492
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,700
Yes. I just came from his room.

493
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,800
He seems calmer.

494
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,700
He's on the same medication
we gave him before.

495
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,400
It might be a week or so

496
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,200
Before you see any difference
in the ticks.

497
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,400
Mimi, if i thought this
operation would cure him,

498
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,300
I'd be wheeling him down
to the o.R. Right now --

499
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,400
That i can promise you.

500
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,700
Would you like
to sit down?

501
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,500
Well, yes,
actually, i would.

502
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,600
<i>We don't have to just talk
about craig, you know.</i>

503
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,600
No?

504
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,000
No.

505
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,500
We could talk
about other things.

506
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,400
Like...

507
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,800
...are you seeing anyone special
right now?

508
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,200
Is that important to you?

509
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm --

510
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm just curious.

511
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,800
I have to get back
to work, so...

512
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,800
I'll see you later?

513
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,100
Sure.

514
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,600
Mm.

515
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,800
- A garter belt?
- Uh-Huh.

516
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,900
What color?

517
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,500
I don't believe it.
She's not the type.

518
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,400
Still waters...

519
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,000
Sounds like she was
coming on to you.

520
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,200
Do you think it's possible she has
some kind of hypersexual disorder?

521
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,700
A nymphomaniac?

522
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
Why are women nymphos
and men popular?

523
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,700
I wonder if craig knows.

524
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,400
He could know.
He could even improve.

525
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
It's possible.

526
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,600
<i>Arturo, did you notice
anything unusual?</i>

527
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
So, what color
was the garter belt?

528
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Black.
Gray, actually.

529
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,400
[ Chuckling ]
sorry.

530
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,800
How did this happen?

531
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,300
I don't know.

00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,400
Craig has ocd.

711
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,900
It's interfering
with his life,

712
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And we must take steps

713
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
To improve the situation.

714
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,700
Immediate steps.

715
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,000
So, we can agree
that we're all here

716
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,300
<i>Because we want
to help craig.</i>

717
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,100
Nan: well, craig has made
his choice, doctor.

718
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,100
Craig hasn't even had a say
in this!

719
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,500
So, what are you
suggesting?

720
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,700
That he's being forced
into this?

721
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,400
Craig wants to have
this surgery.

722
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,500
What craig wants
is to please his wife,

723
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,000
Regardless of the risks.

724
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,000
What risks?

725
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,600
Loss of brain function,
including memory and stroke.

726
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,300
High-- Highly unlikely,
doctor.

727
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,500
Blood clots, blindness,
infection, death.

728
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,000
All this together adds up to less
than 1% of most surgeries.

729
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,800
Jack: all right.

730
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,600
Can i see you outside
for a moment, doctor?

731
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,400
[ Clears throat lightly ]

732
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,200
[ Door opens ]

733
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,600
I think
there's a strong possibility

734
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,000
That mimi's got
kluver-Bucy syndrome.

735
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,300
What hat did you pull
that one out of?

736
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,300
I know, i know, it's rare,
but i've been watching her,

737
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,700
And she's got a cluster
of symptoms --

738
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,200
Hyper-Reality, fearlessness,
hypersexuality.

739
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,700
Are we talking
about the same person here?

740
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,900
Mimi -- Craig's wife?

741
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,400
She's a sex addict.

742
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,900
Ahh.
And you know this because...

743
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,400
Because she slept
with half my staff,

744
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,800
And she tried to do the deed
with me, as well.

745
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,200
I see.

746
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,100
Have you even been watching her
in there?She's already fixated.

747
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,900
She's flirting with that
good-Looking young resident

748
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,500
That sat next to you.

749
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,400
You know, the one
you can't keep your eyes off?

750
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,000
<i>Yeah, you know, he is kind
of good-Looking, isn't he?</i>

751
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,500
And, just so you know,

752
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,700
Not every hypersexual person

753
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,600
Is suffering
from a brain lesion.

754
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,800
It's a long shot.

755
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Humor me.

756
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
I'll rule it out.

757
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,300
Mimi:
i'm not changing my mind.

758
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,400
Mimi, this is not
about a cingulotomy.

759
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,800
<i>This is about you.</i>

760
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,400
We're concerned.

761
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
We're concerned

762
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,700
About your compulsive
sexual activity.

763
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,700
<i>Well, that's none
of your business.</i>

764
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,600
Uh, it is, mimi.

765
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,500
Craig is our patient,

766
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,900
And we believe that your
behavior is affecting him.

767
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,300
How long has it
been going on?

768
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,800
I mean, you guys have
an open relationship?

769
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,600
No.

770
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,500
It's only been going on
for a couple months.

771
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,000
<i>But what does my behavior
have to do with craig's ocd?</i>

772
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Couple of months,
you say?

773
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,700
All right,
let's look at the timeline.

774
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,800
Craig leaves the clinic,
what, a few months ago?

775
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,100
A couple of months ago,
you start these urges,

776
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
And craig
can't fulfill them,

777
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,400
So he gets nervous,
he gets agitated,

778
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,800
His ocd comes back,

779
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,400
And his tourette's comes back
with a vengeance.

780
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,100
<i>So his condition
is my fault?</i>

781
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,100
Not saying that, exactly,
but you may have exacerbated it.

782
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,900
But even that
may not be your fault.

783
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,100
Mimi, look.

784
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,700
We believe
you may be sick.

785
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,600
We think that you may have
a condition

786
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,100
Called kluver-Bucy,

787
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Which is a brain lesion
or tumor...

788
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,900
Most likely not life-Threatening
or cancerous.

789
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,500
What, you're telling me
that i have a tumor

790
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,200
And that this tumor is
what's causing me to want to,

791
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
You know,
have sex all the time?

792
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
We think so, yes.

793
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,900
But we can't determine it
for sure

794
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,400
Until we do a workup --

795
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,700
Blood work, a physical,
cat scan.

796
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,700
So, i have
all of these tests,

797
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,000
And you find a tumor,
then what?

798
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
It should be removed.

799
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,900
And once it's gone,

800
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,300
The hypersexuality,
we think that'll go, too.

801
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,200
And i'll be back
to the way i was before?

802
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,900
And craig will have a very good
chance at improving, also.

803
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,800
[ Piano plays softly ]

804
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
Excuse me.

805
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,700
I think
i'm in the wrong house.

806
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,100
Honey.
It's just dinner.

807
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,700
I got home early, so...

808
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,700
Third time this week.

809
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,100
To what do i owe
the pleasure?

810
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,600
Now, i'm making
your favorite --

811
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Caesar salad, new york steak,
and strawberry cheesecake.

812
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,100
How was your session?

813
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,600
Actually, it was great.

814
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,800
They want me to sit in on piano
again tomorrow.

815
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,300
Really? Fantastic.

816
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
<i>How was your day?</i>

817
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,100
Oh, you know,
the usual insanity.

818
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,700
Tell me.

819
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,400
Well, um...

820
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,500
We're dealing with a real-Life
nymphomaniac on the ward.

821
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,100
She's the wife of one
of my ocd patients,

822
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,800
And she's putting the moves on
all the males in the hospital.

823
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,400
Really?
What's she look like?

824
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,600
Not like you'd expect.
Not at all.

825
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,400
But her poor husband,

826
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,900
Who's so ocd he can't even
hold down a job,

827
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,600
His wife's everything
to him, and he --

828
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,000
He hasn't got a clue.

829
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Maybe he does.

830
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,500
Maybe he knows.

831
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,100
I mean, a husband
can usually tell when...

832
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,700
When what?

833
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,100
When his wife
is running around on him.

834
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,700
You're having an affair,
aren't you?

835
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,400
Why would you say something
like that?

836
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,100
Because you're happier
than you've been in a long time.

837
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,400
And i know better than
to think it's because of me.

838
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
It's very small
and benign.

839
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,600
That's good news.

840
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,300
How long
has it been there?

841
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,700
There's no real way
to tell.

842
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
Uh, could have been there
for years.

843
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,300
Or it could have been there
just a couple of months.

844
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,000
Jack: couldn't it?

845
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,700
Yes, it could be
a very recent growth.

846
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,900
So, what now?

847
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Well, i'd like to schedule
a surgery to have it removed.

848
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
But you said it wasn't cancerous
or life-Threatening.

849
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Well, it could develop
into something more serious.

850
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,200
<i>But it's not serious now.</i>

851
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,200
I don't want
the surgery.

852
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,200
Mimi...

853
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,500
Look.

854
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,100
We believe that
this hypersexuality

855
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,000
That you're exhibiting
might be caused

856
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,800
By the tumor pressing down
on the brain tissue.

857
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,600
I could do therapy.

858
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,200
I mean, you're the one
who says it's better

859
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,300
To have a non-Invasive course
of action.

860
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
Well, this is different, mimi.
This is a tumor.

861
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,900
<i>There's a potential risk
to us not operating.</i>

862
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,000
You know, we can't be sure that
you won't lose vital cognitive

863
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,300
Or even basic
life-Sustaining functions

864
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,700
If you don't let us get
this thing out of your head.

865
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,700
Why don't you discuss this
with craig?

866
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,900
Oh, no, no, no.

867
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,300
Craig can't know
about my...symptoms.

868
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,500
Well, in fairness,the way
you're carrying on,

869
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,400
It's possible
he already knows.

870
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,900
<i>Maybe after
craig's surgery.</i>

871
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,000
Even if the cingulotomy
is successful,

872
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,900
It's not gonna help
craig's ocd

873
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,900
If you...carry on behaving
the way you're behaving.

874
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,000
Arturo: the real reason
she doesn't want the operation

875
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,900
Is because she's happy
with the way things are.

876
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,400
How can you say she's happy?
She's confused.

877
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,300
She doesn't know
what she wants.

878
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,700
- Her marriage is falling apart.
- What does she care anyway?

879
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,000
She's out there
hustling other guys.

880
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,800
- You should know.
- Suggestions, people.
