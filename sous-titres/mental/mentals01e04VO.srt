1
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:14,580
What did you do?

2
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,985
Nothing.

3
00:00:16,054 --> 00:00:17,958
Where are the painters?

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,532
I sent them home.

5
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:21,070
What do you mean you sent them home?

6
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:22,942
Do you know how much ass-Kissing I had to do

7
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,250
to get the board to approve repainting the
psych ward?

8
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:27,024
No, but I'm sure you're about to tell me.

9
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,796
A lot, you have no idea what I have to deal
with -

10
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:31,204
Inane questions like, "Do mentally ill people

11
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,279
Really notice the color of the walls?"

12
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:35,319
They're mentally ill. They're not blind.

13
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:37,694
Not to mention that I got it on the cheap

14
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:38,998
From a friend of a friend.

15
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,607
You can still pay them... if you like.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,878
You know, I know that you think

17
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,316
This is your personal playground,

18
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:45,654
But it's a bureaucracy.

19
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:47,327
It's a corporation. It's a hospital.

20
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:48,664
I have to answer to a board.

21
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:52,343
Yeah?

22
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:54,183
Can you hold these for a second?

23
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:58,968
Hi.

24
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:00,907
I'm dr. Jack Gallagher.

25
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,453
Oh. Thank you, doctor. Um...

26
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:06,861
they said it was gonna be an hour or so wait.

27
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:09,337
Uh-Huh. Well, let's see if we can't cut in
line.

28
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:10,373
What's your name?

29
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:27,231
Um, his name's Conor. He's 8.

30
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,773
Uh, he was in the kitchen

31
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,114
Making himself a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich,

32
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:33,151
And the knife slipped.

33
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,299
He's usually very talkative. He's just - He's upset.

34
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:39,741
Sure. Sure. Understandable.

35
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:42,617
He's... obsessed with video games.

36
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,122
Uh-Huh.

37
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,329
Why don't you guys come with me?

38
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,836
Come on.

39
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:53,187
Hey, Conor. I'm dr. Moore.

40
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:55,562
Heard you had a little accident, huh?

41
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:56,967
You're his mother?

42
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,175
Yeah. Dania Stephens.

43
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,114
Uh, my - My husband, Ian, is on his way.

44
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:02,152
Mind if I take a look?

45
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,296
Well, that's not too bad.

46
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:08,172
Nothing a couple stitches isn't gonna cure.

47
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,512
Conor, can you tell me if it hurts anywhere
else?

48
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,558
Conor, my buddy Ryan here wants to help you.

49
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:26,000
But you need to help us, too, okay?

50
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,877
He's a smart guy, but he's no mind reader.

51
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:30,817
Mrs. Stephens, I'm gonna give Conor

52
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:31,988
A quick physical examination,

53
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:33,727
If you'll kindly step outside.

54
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:35,934
But it's - It's just a cut. There's nothing wrong with him.

55
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:37,674
Standard operating procedure.

56
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:39,881
Conor, Ryan’s not gonna hurt you, okay?

57
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:42,123
He's just gonna listen to your heart and lungs,

58
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,594
Make sure everything's okay.

59
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,333
I'll be right outside, honey.

60
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:47,842
I'll be right back.

61
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:53,395
How's it going?

62
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:55,903
Well... David hasn't done anything

63
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:58,311
But sit in his chair and cry since he got
here two days ago.

64
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,482
Now look at him.

65
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,606
look at that!

66
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:08,212
Hmm.

67
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,384
You have an opinion, doctor.

68
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,591
I just don't think this falls

69
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,865
Under the category of "treatment. "

70
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:15,170
Mainly therapy.

71
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,211
Patients become agents in their environment,

72
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:19,317
Rather than just passive participants.

73
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,522
Beautifying and reshaping their surroundings

74
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,629
Gives them a pride of ownership,

75
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:24,936
Makes them more invested in themselves.

76
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,409
But if you disagree,

77
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:27,914
I'd be happy to see some research on the subject.

78
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:31,159
Great, have it on my desk first thing
tomorrow morning.

79
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,500
you know, I'm usually the first

80
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:35,473
To balk at any change in routine,

81
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,346
But this does appear to be working.

82
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:43,066
Where are you going?

83
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,805
To pay off the painters.

84
00:03:47,348 --> 00:03:49,923
Just give me one deep breath, Conor.

85
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:52,934
Mrs. Stephens, I haven't finished my examination.

86
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:54,573
Could you please wait outside?

87
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,412
I'm sorry, I just really don't want to leave
Conor alone.

88
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,362
I don't think I introduced myself properly before.

89
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:03,470
I'm the director of psychiatric services.

90
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:05,175
I'd like to do an evaluation of your son.

91
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:06,881
What the hell for?

92
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:09,925
Oh, Ian, I'm so glad you're here.

93
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:11,631
What's the problem? Just stitch him up.

94
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,805
He's a little boy, and he's had an accident.

95
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:15,544
And he's not talking

96
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,519
Because you're scaring the hell out of him.

97
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,626
He's not talking because he's internally
preoccupied.

98
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,465
Honey, what's the name

99
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,505
Of the woman you know here at the hospital?

100
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,578
Um, Nora Skoff.

101
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,753
I want her down here in five minutes,

102
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:29,928
Or I'm gonna take my son somewhere else.

103
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:31,634
Mr. Stephens, I'd really like

104
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:33,306
The opportunity to talk to Conor.

105
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,513
We're leaving.

106
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:37,755
Come on, Conor. Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

107
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:40,430
Conor! Conor!

108
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,638
Conor, what's wrong?!

109
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,515
Hey, what's the matter?!

110
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:10,167
How is she?

111
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:12,508
Fine. Superficial knife wound.

112
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,047
She tried to bandage it herself.

113
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,219
But, uh, she needed a couple stitches.

114
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:18,662
She say anything else about what happened?

115
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,034
New story.

116
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:22,508
Conor was making a sandwich, cut himself,

117
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:24,650
The knife went flying, and she got cut, too.

118
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,523
if that's the truth,

119
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:28,696
Why didn't she say so in the first place?

120
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:29,934
How's Conor?

121
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,240
Malcolm's keeping an eye on him.

122
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:33,446
He still hasn't said a word.

123
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:36,959
<i>Dr. Segal to the pharmacy. Dr. Segal to the
pharmacy.</i>

124
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:40,237
Maria, what are you doing here? Go home.

125
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,410
No. I have to tell someone.

126
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:44,787
I have to tell someone what happened.

127
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:47,663
Mrs. Stephens, she say it was an accident,

128
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:48,466
But it was not an accident.

129
00:05:53,183 --> 00:05:55,255
Where's Nora Skoff? I've called her.

130
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:56,526
As soon as she gets in,

131
00:05:56,627 --> 00:05:58,768
I'm sure she'll be happy to talk to you.

132
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,440
There's no way I'm allowing my son

133
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,246
To be admitted to a psychiatric ward.

134
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:25,526
do you know who he is?

135
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:26,830
His company, Stephens industrial,

136
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:29,740
Has factories all over the world.

137
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:31,279
Your point, Carl?

138
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:35,595
I know the Stephens’s. Maybe I can mediate.

139
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,066
Be my guest.

140
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:44,290
Mr. Stephens. Dr. Carl belle.

141
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:46,131
Uh, we've met before, actually.

142
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:48,238
My wife and I have a box next to yours -

143
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:49,609
The Hollywood bowl.

144
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,315
Good.

145
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,887
Then maybe you can tell me

146
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,830
Why this hospital is forcing my son to stay
here.

147
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:57,035
Let me get into it.

148
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,675
And if it turns out that your son

149
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:00,681
Is gonna be staying with us for a few days,

150
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:02,219
I will personally oversee his case.

151
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,660
Here's my card.

152
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:06,668
My home and cell number are on the back.

153
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,076
Um, of course, as director of psychiatric
services,

154
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:12,455
Dr. Gallagher will be on hand to observe.

155
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,706
Conor.

156
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:18,576
Conor?

157
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:29,212
We're gonna get to know each other really well.

158
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,861
Malcolm, uh, let's show the Stephens’s to my office.

159
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:55,436
We'll do the rest of the paperwork in private, shall we?

160
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:56,473
yes, sir.

161
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:05,370
Becky?

162
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:07,210
Hold on a second. Don't hang up.

163
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,082
I'm really glad you've called.

164
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,291
I haven't heard from you in a while.

165
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,264
I was, uh...

166
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,205
y - You had me a little worried.

167
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,629
You okay?

168
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,851
I'm starting to settle in here... a bit.

169
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,761
The truth is, I wasn't sure I'd last a week.

170
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:37,180
Can you imagine - Me, the boss?

171
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:39,421
I've made a few changes.

172
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:41,495
Quite a lot of changes.

173
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,468
I reckon there's some people around here

174
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,679
Who think I'm the one who's crazy.

175
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,184
Becky?

176
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:53,737
Becky, what's that?

177
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,149
That's church bells, right?

178
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:01,565
Where are you - Somewhere downtown?

179
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,069
Beck?

180
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:15,579
Dania, Ian, how are you?

181
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:17,787
How the hell do you think we're doing?

182
00:09:17,888 --> 00:09:20,495
As well as can be expected, I suppose,

183
00:09:20,564 --> 00:09:21,934
Under the circumstances.

184
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,372
I'm very sorry for what you're going through.

185
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,379
We're not going through anything...

186
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,055
except dealing with a couple of trigger-
Happy shrinks

187
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:29,728
Who want to keep Conor here.

188
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:31,266
There's nothing wrong with our boy.

189
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:32,704
we just want to take Conor home.

190
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,615
This hospital has no right to keep him here

191
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:36,919
Against our wishes.

192
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:39,529
I just got off the phone with the detective

193
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:41,971
Who interviewed the housekeeper, Maria.

194
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,847
The facts, as I know them now, is that Conor

195
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:48,124
Picked up a kitchen knife and was about to
stab himself

196
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:50,231
When Dania rushed in and grabbed the knife

197
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,173
And, in the process, injured herself.

198
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,149
She's lying.

199
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,457
Under the California code 5150,

200
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:01,236
We absolutely do have the right and the
responsibility

201
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:04,381
To keep Conor here for 72 hours if we believe

202
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:07,492
That he may be in danger to himself or to
anybody else.

203
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,970
Regretfully, we will exercise that right.

204
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:12,709
You'll hear from my attorney.

205
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,205
Hey, mom!

206
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:24,182
Hi. Wow.

207
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,861
I didn't expe - Expect you already.

208
00:10:27,963 --> 00:10:31,507
Dad and Chelsea decided to leave on the
camping trip early.

209
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,183
Huh. And you didn't want to go.

210
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,291
Yeah, because you know how much I love dirt

211
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,665
And bugs and no showers.

212
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,571
Besides, I wanted to get some stuff at the
mall, anyway.

213
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,382
Oh, great. Well, we can go later.

214
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,724
Um, actually, I was planning ongoing with
Mia.

215
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:47,329
Can I have some money?

216
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,071
I would like to spend some time with you
this visit.

217
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,376
Sure. Whatever.

218
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:56,393
Jack, no, it's okay. This is my daughter, Ainsley.

219
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:58,266
Hi, Ainsley.

220
00:10:58,368 --> 00:10:59,571
Hi.

221
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,815
Uh, Nora tells me you're in high school.

222
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,588
Yeah. How old are you, anyway?

223
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:07,633
I, uh... I just popped in

224
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,907
To see how it went with the Stephenses.

225
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:12,515
They're in denial and not very happy,

226
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,957
As you probably figured out already.

227
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:17,265
Okay. Nice to meet you, Ainsley.

228
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:18,804
Bye.

229
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,484
He is so hot.

230
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,563
Yes.

231
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:29,541
Hey, dr. Belle. You ready for us?

232
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,749
You can leave him here. Just wait outside,
Malcolm.

233
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,702
Hey, Conor.

234
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:41,750
Sit down.

235
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:46,600
You guys all right in here?

236
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:49,878
We'll be just fine.

237
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:52,587
You don't have to sit down if you don't want
to.

238
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:55,932
This is what is called, uh, an intake
interview.

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,307
This is where I ask you questions,

240
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,548
And, uh, hopefully, you' answer.

241
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,521
It's a chance for me

242
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,659
To figure out what's upsetting you.

243
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,643
Oh!

244
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,987
You like that one? You have good taste.

245
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:16,202
You believe that vase is over 600 years old?

246
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,907
Conor, let's talk about what happened in the kitchen.

247
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:22,123
I know you're a smart little boy. I know you remember.

248
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,660
Are you mad at your mother?

249
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,574
Hey, Malcolm! Aah!

250
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,587
I - Aah!

251
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,011
Hey, don't just sit there! Something!

252
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:40,886
I am, Carl. I'm observing.

253
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,984
I'm hungry.

254
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:02,930
Can I please have a tuna sandwich?

255
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,874
He's a little sociopath in the making.

256
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,483
Anything constructive?

257
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,792
Well, because he seemed to be in his own
world,

258
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:22,363
Selectively mute,

259
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:25,106
I thought at first maybe autism, Asperger's,

260
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:27,414
But, what, now that he's talking -

261
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:29,187
Obviously huge mood swings.

262
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:33,200
Seems elated, curious, then he rages with no
trigger.

263
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,108
I think we're seeing early-Onset bipolar.

264
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:36,647
Agreed. Agreed. Definitely manic.

265
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:39,289
We need to start him on, uh, antipsychotics
immediately -

266
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,396
Risperdal, depakote, lithium bicarbonate.

267
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:43,335
He's only 8 - We don't even know

268
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:45,309
What bipolar looks like in kids.

269
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,018
He scored a 7 out of 8 on the DSM-IV
checklist. We know.

270
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,059
50% of kids who are thought to have

271
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,100
A mental illness today are labelled "bipolar. "

272
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:53,738
It's absurd.

273
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:56,716
It could just be that there's increased recognition now.

274
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,090
Bipolar disorder is the diagnosis du jour.

275
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:00,495
You know the parents - How is it possible

276
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:01,933
That they haven't noticed

277
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:04,108
There's something terribly wrong with their child?

278
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:05,512
It's impossible.

279
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,154
Dania must have noticed, but for some reason,

280
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,097
She's afraid to tell her husband.

281
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,407
He could just be severely ADHD.

282
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:14,911
Good point.

283
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,986
Please prepare a paper on the current
thinking

284
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:18,256
Of bipolar disorder presenting in children

285
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:19,560
Under the age of 10.

286
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:21,299
I-I believe that we need to start him

287
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,206
On 5 milligrams of Risperdal

288
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:26,552
Combined with another 5 milligrams of
depakote.

289
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:28,224
We may have a legal problem with that.

290
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,063
They're about to file a writ of habeas corpus.

291
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:32,137
that leaves us with psychotherapy.

292
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,509
All things considered, Carl,

293
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:34,913
Maybe I should take the lead on this.

294
00:14:34,981 --> 00:14:37,222
Hey, there's no ego here. You go ahead.

295
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,768
I think I'll get to know Conor a little better.

296
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:42,640
I suggest not doing it in your office.

297
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,289
Why did you bring me here?

298
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:48,794
I like it here.

299
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:51,236
How come?

300
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:56,789
The kids - They're all happy. They're all
having fun.

301
00:14:56,857 --> 00:14:58,929
Are you happy?

302
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:03,881
I'm mostly happy.

303
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:09,600
Everybody has some things that, uh - That
they don't like.

304
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,510
Jump up.

305
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,650
What are your things?

306
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:16,257
Well...

307
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:23,113
my sister's sick. And that's not so good.

308
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,755
And I'm not climbing in the mountains

309
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,562
'Cause I'm here in the city,

310
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:29,870
And, uh, that doesn't make me too happy.

311
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:31,308
What makes you happy?

312
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,749
I used to play video games...

313
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,422
a lot.

314
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:41,510
Then my dad said I was addicted, and he took
them all away.

315
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:44,320
That make you upset?

316
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,667
<i>I guess. I was happy.</i>

317
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:53,919
When I was younger, my dad - He'd take me to his factory.

318
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,863
It was kind of like our place.

319
00:15:56,964 --> 00:16:00,574
It's really cool.

320
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:03,954
Then...

321
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,228
he stopped taking me to work.

322
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:08,302
I hear them talking sometimes.

323
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,945
He says I'm not normal.

324
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:17,869
What's wrong with me?

325
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:21,681
You're just... you're just sort of wired

326
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,124
A little bit differently than most of us.

327
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:26,464
There's a lot of really, really smart people

328
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,003
That are wired a little bit differently.

329
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,913
Like who? Well, like, uh...

330
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,723
Beethoven, Isaac Newton...

331
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,529
Vincent van Gogh...

332
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:40,379
...Robert Downey Jr.

333
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:42,287
Iron man.

334
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:44,494
Really? Yeah.

335
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:46,936
Cool.

336
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:49,276
Do you remember what you were thinking

337
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:51,282
When you picked up the knife in the kitchen?

338
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,274
Yeah.

339
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:01,151
I was thinking that I was broken,

340
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:03,859
Like some of my old video games.

341
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:07,106
I was thinking that I needed to be thrown
out.

342
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,480
Is that what you're doing with your fingers -

343
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,519
You're playing your old video games?

344
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:16,001
I play a new one now... one I made up.

345
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,310
I started playing it in my head.

346
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:20,685
I have to get away from the demons.

347
00:17:20,753 --> 00:17:23,060
I'm trying to run away but...

348
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:28,278
...they keep coming after me.

349
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:38,280
So, what's the object of the game?

350
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:39,416
Where are you running to?

351
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,962
A safe place.

352
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,381
I haven't made it there yet.

353
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:51,390
Conor's not bipolar. He can't be.

354
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,561
That's inherited, isn't it?

355
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:54,167
Bipolar is highly genetic.

356
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,140
80% of kids diagnosed with bipolar

357
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,550
Have parents with a history of mood
disorders.

358
00:17:58,618 --> 00:17:59,920
Well, there you have it.

359
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,827
There is no history of mental illness

360
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:02,997
In either of our families.

361
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,138
He's perfectly normal.

362
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,479
Dania, why are you home-schooling him?

363
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,591
Look, I'm not saying that Conor’s not a special kid.

364
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:13,501
He is, but in a good way.

365
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:16,778
Maybe he can't handle the pressures of a large classroom.

366
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,751
But at home, with me and his tutors,

367
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:20,558
He's testing way above grade average.

368
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,030
Stop.

369
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,672
We don't have to explain ourselves to you.

370
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,813
No, but you can't ignore the symptoms -

371
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,124
Distractibility, hyperactivity, explosive
rages,

372
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:33,771
Separation anxiety, mood swings, depression,
low self-Esteem.

373
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:35,175
Did it ever occur to you people

374
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,517
That this might just be a phase he's going through?

375
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,790
Show me a kid who doesn't throw a tantrum.

376
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:43,002
And everyone gets depressed now and then.

377
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,407
Yeah.

378
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:47,251
And how many 8-Year-Old kids consider
suicide?

379
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:50,594
He was just...

380
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,100
playing.

381
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:54,575
Are you willing to bet his life on that?

382
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:56,347
If you're refusing

383
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,489
To let us start him on a course of
medication,

384
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:00,027
Please let us do a brain scan.

385
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,168
Actually, they've just done

386
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:03,473
Some extraordinary research pointing out -

387
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,212
Conor doesn't need a brain scan.

388
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,091
He needs to come home.

389
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,434
Mr. Stephens, how much time

390
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,808
Have you spent with your son lately?

391
00:19:13,877 --> 00:19:15,413
What?

392
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,722
It's understandable, what, with your schedule.

393
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,330
Have you been around long enough to even
notice that he's -

394
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:21,835
How dare you.

395
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:24,646
You've been treating my son for, what, a couple of hours?

396
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:27,422
This is my son!

397
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:28,927
I was there when he was born.

398
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:31,536
I rocked him to sleep every night, read him
stories...

399
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,342
Ian, please... took him to the ball game,

400
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:35,217
Taught him how to tie his shoes!

401
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:37,089
I did everything -

402
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,966
Everything that a father is supposed to do
with his son!

403
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:43,176
"Did" - In the past. What about now?

404
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:47,826
Let's go.

405
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,411
Ainsley.

406
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:25,757
Mom, can you please knock before you come in?

407
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,328
W- Why? What are you - What are you doing

408
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:28,633
That I'm not supposed to see?

409
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:29,803
I need privacy.

410
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:31,810
Look, I know I don't live here anymore.

411
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:33,616
But it's still my room, isn't it?

412
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,456
Yeah, I-I just wanted to tell you

413
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:37,396
That dinner will be ready in an hour.

414
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:40,039
Okay. I'm gonna go for a jog.

415
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:41,578
I'll be back. Bye.

416
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:58,041
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

417
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,614
Calm down.

418
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:08,277
Okay, I'm gonna let you go, all right?

419
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,984
What happened?

420
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:22,225
we were just shooting hoops.

421
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,462
He started getting angry

422
00:22:23,563 --> 00:22:25,636
Because he wasn't making any baskets.

423
00:22:25,704 --> 00:22:27,041
I told him it was okay,

424
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:28,412
But he just kept saying over and over

425
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,986
That he was stupid.

426
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:31,691
He started hitting, and I just...

427
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:35,771
okay. Give us a minute.

428
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:41,760
Hey, Conor.

429
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:51,158
What's going on?

430
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,135
I'm so dumb.

431
00:22:54,236 --> 00:22:56,477
I can't do anything right.

432
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:59,754
Hey, everybody's got a temper.

433
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:01,727
You, too?

434
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:05,038
Oh, yeah. Big time.

435
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:11,160
We just need to find a way for you to
control it.

436
00:23:11,228 --> 00:23:13,134
I can't.

437
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:16,712
Once it starts...

438
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:19,221
I can't stop.

439
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:21,830
Okay. Come here.

440
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:25,409
Then we need to find something for you to
concentrate on

441
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,620
Whenever you start to feel that anger take
over.

442
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:30,426
Here's what we're gonna do -

443
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:33,204
How about you play your video game?

444
00:23:33,271 --> 00:23:36,949
Only this time, we're gonna give you some upgrades, okay?

445
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:40,360
What are you wearing in the game?

446
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,732
T - Shirt and jeans.

447
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,074
Kind of like this?

448
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:45,345
Yeah.

449
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,188
And are you carrying anything?

450
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:50,227
Like, maybe a backpack?

451
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,168
No.

452
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:53,740
Well, let's say you are.

453
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,947
Why?

454
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,022
'Cause then we can put some stuff in it.

455
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,978
Cool.

456
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,056
What's up?

457
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:10,297
The attorney for the Stephenses called.

458
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,271
Maria, the nanny, recanted.

459
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:13,441
Oh, what a shocker.

460
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:14,679
They probably threatened her

461
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:16,050
With deportation.

462
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:18,459
Anyway, they got a judge to sign the writ.

463
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:21,703
And after the 72-Hour hold, we have to set
Conor free.

464
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:25,048
Damn it, Nora. I'm making progress.

465
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:29,363
If I even had two weeks with this kid,

466
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:30,567
I could sort him out.

467
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,640
W - We have no legal standing.

468
00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:34,113
So what?

469
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:36,354
We just wait around until he hurts someone
or himself?

470
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:39,163
Convince his parents.

471
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:45,551
You okay?

472
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,024
I'm fine.

473
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:50,970
Actually, I'm not fine.

474
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:53,379
I - I need some advice.

475
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:56,555
What am I - Chopped liver?

476
00:24:56,658 --> 00:24:57,761
She didn't try to hide it?

477
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:58,865
She didn't think I'd snoop.

478
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:00,638
I've never done that before.

479
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:03,012
You hear all this stuff

480
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:05,957
About kids and predators on the internet.

481
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:08,163
I think she wanted you to find it.

482
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,936
It's like the rich kid

483
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:12,077
Who steals a pair of sunglasses and gets
caught.

484
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,482
How did she handle the divorce?

485
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,020
She says she understood.

486
00:25:15,088 --> 00:25:17,628
In fact, she was the only girl in her clique

487
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:19,635
Whose parents were still married.

488
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:25,255
But... I was sick.

489
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,861
Sick?

490
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:29,804
What do you mean "sick"?

491
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:31,410
Uh, well, I had cancer.

492
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,126
Myeloma.

493
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:38,601
I'm in complete remission now.

494
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,539
Nora, why didn't you tell me?

495
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,842
Before I hired you,

496
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:43,452
The subject just... didn't come up.

497
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:47,566
Fine.

498
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,877
So you got sick, you got treatment,

499
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:52,852
And you filed for divorce.

500
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,727
I was in the hospital, being treated with
chemo,

501
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:57,198
And I thought,

502
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,673
While they're zapping all those cancer cells,

503
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:02,217
I would get rid of everything else in my life

504
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:06,665
That was unhealthy, including my marriage.

505
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,705
And Ainsley was there through it all.

506
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:11,113
I tried to shelter her from it.

507
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:16,365
She's such a beautiful girl

508
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:19,375
And she's very good in school and...

509
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,717
and she's very popular.

510
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:26,233
That's how you see her. How does she see herself?

511
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:39,646
Ian, hey, how are you?

512
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:41,385
Hope you don't mind. No.

513
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:44,429
You gave me your card. No, no, no, no. Of
course not.

514
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,034
Glad you came. Please, have a seat.

515
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:47,706
Uh, have you seen Conor today?

516
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,914
I'm waiting for Dania.

517
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:53,125
Speaking of which, my wife and I...

518
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:55,701
would love to have the two of you over for
dinner.

519
00:26:55,802 --> 00:26:57,138
I have this beautiful Lafitte.

520
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:59,547
This is after Conor’s been released

521
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:00,919
And back home, of course.

522
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:04,130
Actually, this whole thing's

523
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,137
Been pretty tough on Dania and me.

524
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:10,953
I don't think we're gonna be socializing
anytime soon.

525
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:12,592
Oh, no.

526
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,662
Of course. Of course not.

527
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:20,520
You know... in my business,

528
00:27:20,587 --> 00:27:23,663
If there's a problem, I fix it.

529
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:27,410
But this...

530
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:30,955
Conor will improve.

531
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:34,301
I wish I could say the same thing for me and
Dania.

532
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:40,154
How does this happen?

533
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:41,926
You're going along, day after day,

534
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,903
Thinking everything's fine, then out of nowhere -

535
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:48,315
Ian, I don't think that this is out of nowhere.

536
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,488
Listen, I-I'm just gonna be honest with you.

537
00:27:50,591 --> 00:27:52,329
I - I think that you need to sit down

538
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:55,038
And have a very straightforward conversation
with Dania.

539
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,577
This condition -

540
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:59,788
This manic depression, this bipolarism...

541
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:01,995
doesn't just come on overnight.

542
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:08,719
You're absolutely right, doctor.

543
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,297
remember, doc, we got to make this quick.

544
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,338
Thanks, Jesus.

545
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,379
You're welcome. You got my tickets?

546
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,219
Ah, come on, man - Floor seats.

547
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:19,457
My man.

548
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:22,199
Hey.

549
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,440
Thanks, Malc.

550
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:25,845
Ah, no problem, doc.

551
00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:27,317
I owe you one.

552
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:29,190
How you doing, little bro?

553
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,631
I'm scared.

554
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:34,173
Y don't you close your eyes and play the game?

555
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:35,745
It'll take your mind off it.

556
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,983
Okay.

557
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,889
I'll be waiting right over here.

558
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:39,693
Good boy.

559
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,625
<i>You're doing great, Conor.</i>

560
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:00,397
<i>Just relax.</i>

561
00:29:09,128 --> 00:29:11,201
<i>Conor, are you okay?</i>

562
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:12,740
Are you playing the game?

563
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,088
Do you remember the backpack we talked about?

564
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,995
<i>Look for it. It'll be there.</i>

565
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:27,089
Put it on. I know it's a little bit scary.

566
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,916
I can't.

567
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:35,954
I can't!

568
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:49,333
How long for the readout?

569
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:52,945
Um... I don't know, about a day or so.

570
00:29:53,013 --> 00:29:54,516
Any chance we can rush it?

571
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:58,130
You like the clippers?

572
00:30:02,646 --> 00:30:06,257
Any other presentations, theses, papers you
want written?

573
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:07,562
Not at the moment.

574
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:10,037
Hold on a second.

575
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:12,279
Conor, Malcolm will take you back up.

576
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:15,422
I'll come up and play the game later, okay?

577
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,032
Okay. Jack?

578
00:30:18,133 --> 00:30:19,738
Mm-Hmm.

579
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:22,213
If that machine I was in finds something
wrong with my brain,

580
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:23,852
Can I get a new one?

581
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:28,066
We can't give you a new one, Conor.

582
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:29,504
But you know what?

583
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:32,012
We can make the one you've got work a lot better.

584
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:34,723
But I don't want to be like this anymore.

585
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,365
Trust me. We're gonna make it right.

586
00:30:37,466 --> 00:30:40,141
Thanks, Malcolm.

587
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:42,449
At ease, soldier.

588
00:30:42,517 --> 00:30:43,987
Feel free to speak your mind.

589
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:46,865
Fine. Get off my ass.

590
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:50,410
You take every opportunity to test me, to
pile work on me.

591
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:51,782
Why?

592
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,457
Because I don't know why you're here.

593
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,132
Most of the time I just feel like you're phoning it in.

594
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:59,575
What, were all the dermatology residencies
filled?

595
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:02,084
Are you just biding your time until one
opens up?

596
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,091
Is it because I don't always agree with you?

597
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:06,399
It's because when you disagree, you don't
fight for it.

598
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:09,007
If we're not gonna fight for these patients, who is?

599
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:10,512
I'm a good doctor.

600
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,553
I do everything that's asked of me here.

601
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:13,891
It's not enough.

602
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:16,332
Look, I get it. Psychiatry's different.

603
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,871
It's not like we get the immediate gratification

604
00:31:17,972 --> 00:31:19,443
Of mending a broken bone or...

605
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,450
or performing a successful lung transplant

606
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:23,926
Or even cutting away 20 years' worth of wrinkles.

607
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:26,936
Hell, it's rare that we actually ever cure anyone.

608
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:28,374
But even so,

609
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:30,046
You have to find the enthusiasm to stay in
the game.

610
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:33,994
I'll get my pom-poms out of storage.

611
00:31:34,095 --> 00:31:37,372
Psychiatry's a calling. I'm not convinced
you've got it.

612
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,857
Tell me about those pom-pom things.

613
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:45,633
Hey.

614
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:46,905
What are you doing home so early?

615
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:52,391
That's my computer. You have no right -

616
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:53,929
Is this the way you see yourself?

617
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,635
This is lame. I'm - I'm out of here.

618
00:31:55,736 --> 00:31:57,774
I'm - I'd rather be at dad's.

619
00:31:57,877 --> 00:32:01,622
Than what - Have an honest conversation with
me?

620
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,535
You're gonna talk to me about being honest?

621
00:32:05,603 --> 00:32:09,215
You had cancer, and you almost died,

622
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:12,191
But you wouldn't even let me in the hospital.

623
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,467
I didn't want you to have to see me that way.

624
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,040
You're my mother.

625
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:28,482
You should have known that I could handle it

626
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,191
And not shut me out and shuttle me off to
dad's.

627
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:35,003
I'm like...

628
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:37,377
totally alone.

629
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:39,017
I have no family right now.

630
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:42,396
I - I come here, and you want to hang out
like my b. F.F.

631
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:44,503
And I go to dad's, and all he cares about

632
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,714
Is his hottie and her two psycho kids.

633
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:50,323
I made a mistake.

634
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,073
I should have talked to you about my illness,

635
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,448
And I should have included you in my
recovery.

636
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:05,209
I never meant to hurt you.

637
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:08,888
I love you more than anything.

638
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,584
<i>Attention, security. We have a missing child.</i>

639
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:19,792
<i>Answers to the name of Conor.</i>

640
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,765
<i>Security, a missing child.</i>

641
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,538
What the hell's going on?

642
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,942
Conor's gone. What?

643
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,214
I was taking him back to the ward,

644
00:33:26,315 --> 00:33:27,552
But he said he had to pee really bad.

645
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:29,894
So I took him to the men's room in the lobby.

646
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:31,900
I was waiting outside. He must have snuck
out.

647
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,506
They searched the whole hospital.

648
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:34,910
Now they're combing the streets.

649
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:41,533
Ian, uh... I'm so sorry.

650
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:46,148
There's something I need to tell you...

651
00:33:46,216 --> 00:33:48,490
something even Dania doesn't know.

652
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:52,773
Who was it?

653
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:56,250
My mother.

654
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:59,529
She was committed to a mental institution

655
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,999
When I was 16.

656
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:05,918
I remember my sister and I would come home
from school,

657
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:10,399
And sometimes my dad wouldn't let us into the house for hours

658
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:14,480
Because my mom was having one of her... fits.

659
00:34:14,548 --> 00:34:17,591
Ian, I know what it's like

660
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,531
To have mental illness in your family.

661
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,072
Conor's a great kid.

662
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:24,515
He's got a chance to have a really happy life.

663
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:28,595
What did he say to me? He said...

664
00:34:28,663 --> 00:34:30,703
he said the happiest time in his life

665
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:32,543
Was with you at one of your, uh...

666
00:34:32,644 --> 00:34:34,717
one of your factories.

667
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:36,992
Is there one nearby?

668
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:38,362
Yes.

669
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,800
You go that way?

670
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,877
Conor!

671
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:04,753
Conor!

672
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:09,370
Conor, please answer me!

673
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,259
Conor, are you here?!

674
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:21,479
Conor, it's daddy!

675
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:22,950
Please tell me if you're in here!

676
00:35:27,131 --> 00:35:29,203
Conor!

677
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,011
Conor!

678
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:04,057
Conor, look in your backpack!

679
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:08,841
It's got everything you need to win!

680
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,140
Conor, wait!

681
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:41,193
Finish it, Conor!

682
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:18,723
Ooh! Ugh!

683
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,208
I did it, jack! I won the game!

684
00:38:24,276 --> 00:38:28,589
That's great, Conor. That's just great.

685
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:35,546
I'm here, son.

686
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:53,977
this is a normal brain, and this is Conor’s
brain.

687
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:55,248
My god.

688
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,125
Now, these scans aren't 100% accurate,

689
00:38:58,192 --> 00:38:59,629
But these results

690
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,737
In combination with the symptoms he's presenting...

691
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,316
listen, if Conor was diabetic, wouldn't you give him insulin?

692
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,792
He needs medication.

693
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:09,597
It might take us a little time

694
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:12,006
To find out the right mix, but...

695
00:39:12,107 --> 00:39:14,849
okay. We'll start right away.

696
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:18,663
Is there anything else I can do?

697
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,569
Actually, you might try tickling him.

698
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:21,941
Scientists have been testing rats

699
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,913
And recording the high-Pitch sounds they make

700
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:24,851
When they're being tickled.

701
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,723
They're actually laughing.

702
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,209
It's gonna be okay, Dania.

703
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:37,025
Is this, uh, a I - A lifelong thing?

704
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,635
I mean, will he get better?

705
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:43,816
Ere is no cure... as such.

706
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,154
But medication can and will help.

707
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:49,903
I - I need some time.

708
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:54,084
Dania. Dania, where are you going?

709
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:59,236
I'll call you.

710
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:07,464
It's a lot for her to take in.

711
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:12,815
Hey, hey.

712
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:15,692
Hi.

713
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:19,941
Guess what. It's time to go home.

714
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,084
You mean we can't play the game anymore?

715
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:24,756
You know what?

716
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:27,700
Maybe someday a lot of people will play your
game,

717
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:30,008
Maybe millions of people.

718
00:40:30,076 --> 00:40:32,116
If you can create it in your head,

719
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:33,319
You can create it on paper.

720
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:37,099
Cool.

721
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,437
I think you can do anything you set your
mind to.

722
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:41,213
Where's mom?

723
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,000
We'll see her later.

724
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:50,378
Okay.

725
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,455
Thanks for the cards.

726
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:55,731
You're welcome.

727
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:57,002
Thank you.

728
00:40:57,103 --> 00:40:58,841
I'll see you soon.

729
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,287
Hey, hey.

730
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:15,064
You, uh... so, are you sticking around for a
while?

731
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:16,502
Maybe.

732
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:19,680
Well, I hope so. And where are you ladies
off to?

733
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:20,984
Dinner.

734
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:22,288
You want to come?

735
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,630
Um...

736
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:27,339
I'd love to, but, uh, maybe another time.

737
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:29,512
Have fun, though.

738
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,595
He is so hot.

739
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:36,504
I know. I know.

740
00:41:36,605 --> 00:41:37,441
Mom!

741
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:38,478
No, I know!

742
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,283
Mom!
