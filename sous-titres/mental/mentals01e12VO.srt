RIGHT?

341
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:04,431
THAT'S MY, UH, SUIT.

342
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:05,564
ALL RIGHT.

343
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,398
JACK, I, UH --
I CONTACTED A-A PSYCHIATRIST

344
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,398
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF PENNSYLVANIA

345
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,431
REGARDING THIS NEW
IMPLANT DEVICE.

346
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,731
ZYPREXA.
YEAH.

347
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:17,231
THE IMPLANT CAN LAST
FOR UP TO ONE YEAR,

348
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:19,664
WHICH MAKES IT VERY
DIFFICULT FOR BECKY TO
CHOOSE TO GO OFF HER MEDS.

349
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:21,731
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM --
I THINK IT'S HEALTHY

350
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:23,531
FOR BECKY TO BE IN CHARGE
OF HER TREATMENT.

351
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,098
RIGHT.

352
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,998
BUT SHE HAS GOT A HISTORY
OF GOING OFF HER MEDS,

353
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:28,398
AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SHE DOES.

354
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:30,464
THIS WAY,
ALL SHE NEEDS TO DO

355
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,598
IS TURN UP ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR,
GET THE INJECTION.

356
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,564
I'LL CONSIDER IT.
HOW'S IT GOING?

357
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:38,064
GOOD.

358
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:40,331
I THINK WE HAD A-A GOOD AMOUNT
OF SELF-DISCLOSURE

359
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:41,431
IN THE FIRST MEETING.

360
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:43,298
SHE DEFINITELY ALLIED
WITH ME.

361
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:45,431
SHE SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT
THE AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS?

362
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:47,631
UH, NO, BUT I THINK
I'M GETTING CLOSE.

363
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:51,098
THOUGHT I MIGHT TAKE HER
FOR A WALK AROUND THE GROUNDS.

364
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:52,498
SHE'S YOUR PATIENT.

365
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:58,131
Veronica: HE'S NOT --
HE'S NOT LETTING GO.

366
00:15:58,131 --> 00:15:59,364
HE'S NOT!

367
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:01,231
HE'S TRYING TO SAVE

368
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:03,698
THE ONE PERSON IN THE WORLD
HE REALLY LOVES.

369
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,564
OKAY, THE BOTTOM LINE
IS THIS --

370
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:11,164
I THINK SHE'S MORE STRESSED
WHEN HE'S AROUND.

371
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:13,698
SHE NEEDS SOMEONE TO TREAT HER
WITHOUT HISTORY, PITY,

372
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:15,298
JUDGMENT,
OR ANY OF THAT --

373
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,664
THAT SIBLING CRAP
THAT WE ALL KNOW IS THERE.

374
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:21,298
OKAY.
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

375
00:16:21,298 --> 00:16:22,531
Arturo:
SOMETHING'S JUST WEIRD.

376
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:24,431
WE -- WE PUSHED BRIAN
THROUGH HERE TOO FAST.

377
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:26,198
I AGREE.

378
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,998
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

379
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,598
ACTUALLY, NO, I DON'T.
CAN I CALL YOU LATER?

380
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:32,431
NO, ACTUALLY,
YOU'VE GOT A MINUTE.

381
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,331
GO HOME.

382
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,398
LET ME GUESS --
VERONICA SAID SOMETHING.

383
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,631
JACK, YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE
OF BECKY AND YOUR PARENTS

384
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:44,564
AND THE PATIENTS
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

385
00:16:44,564 --> 00:16:47,098
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF DOING MY JOB.

386
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:48,764
<i>NO, YOU THINK YOU'RE FINE.
YOU'RE NOT FINE.</i>

387
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:50,631
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR BECKY
FOR FOUR YEARS.

388
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:54,031
YOU CAN'T ACT LIKE THIS IS
SUDDENLY BUSINESS AS USUAL.

389
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:56,131
Malcolm: APPARENTLY,
THIS WASN'T HIS FIRST TIME.

390
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,398
WHERE IS HE?

391
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:02,131
BRIAN? HE'S BEEN DISCHARGED.
YOU SIGNED OFF.

392
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:04,664
WHAT IS IT?

393
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:07,998
FIND HIM.
FIND HIM NOW.

394
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:15,364
[ DING! ]

395
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,264
WHAT DO THE PARENTS SAY?

396
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:24,198
CLUELESS, DON'T KNOW,
AND DON'T CARE.

397
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:26,598
NOT TRUE, AT LEAST NOT THE MOM.
SHE WAS WORRIED.

398
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:28,731
THEY LOST TOUCH WITH HIM
OVER A YEAR AGO.

399
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,331
SAID BRIAN
JUST KEPT MOVING.

400
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:32,031
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE LIVES?

401
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,998
THEY DON'T HAVE A NUMBER
FOR HIM?

402
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:34,998
WHAT DO THE POLICE SAY?

403
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:36,764
AFTER I TOLD THEM
WE WERE WORRIED BRIAN

404
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,531
WAS GONNA CHOP OFF
ANOTHER BODY PART

405
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:40,564
AND THEY HAD TO FIND HIM
BEFORE HE DID, NOT MUCH.

406
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:42,098
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR HIM.

407
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,064
THEY SAID HE HAS A DEBIT CARD
AND BANK ACCOUNT.

408
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,064
THEY'RE LOOKING.

409
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:49,198
WEYBURN CLINIC --
JUST NORTH OF SAN DIEGO.

410
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,264
IT'S, UH -- IT'S GOT 30 ACRES,
SWIMMING POOL.

411
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:52,598
IT'S REALLY NICE.

412
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:53,698
IS IT NEAR THE WATER?

413
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,498
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
RIGHT BESIDE IT.

414
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:58,064
I THOUGHT I COULD MAYBE
RENT A PLACE DOWN THERE.

415
00:17:58,064 --> 00:18:00,064
SPEND WEEKENDS TOGETHER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

416
00:18:00,064 --> 00:18:01,231
I THINK IT SOUNDS GREAT.

417
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:03,531
UM, BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE MY WATCH IS.

418
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,764
I HAD IT WHEN I CAME HERE.
DID YOU SEE IT?

419
00:18:05,764 --> 00:18:08,664
NO.

420
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:11,398
I'VE HAD IT FOREVER.
MUM AND JAMES GAVE IT TO ME.

421
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:12,731
DID THEY?

422
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:14,398
YOU, UH --
YOU WEREN'T WEARING IT

423
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:15,764
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP
AT MY PLACE.

424
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:18,231
YES, I WAS.
I'M POSITIVE I WAS.

425
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,764
MAYBE ONE OF THE STAFF
PUT IT IN THE PATIENT
BAG WHEN YOU CAME IN.

426
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:23,131
I HAD IT HERE!

427
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:25,298
OKAY.

428
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:28,698
BECKY, THINK ABOUT
SAN DIEGO FOR ME.

429
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:30,364
SOMEBODY
MUST HAVE STOLEN IT.

430
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:32,298
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND IT.

WHAT JUST HAPPENED
IN THERE?

432
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:38,564
SHE WAS TRYING
TO FIND A WATCH,

WHICH, OF COURSE,
SHE NEVER HAD.

434

SO, THAT WAS YOU
JUST TAKING YOUR STEP BACK.

435
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,031
THAT WASN'T
A THERAPY SESSION.

436

ABOUT THE FACILITY THAT
I'M GONNA TRANSFER HER TO.

438
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:53,464

ABOUT RAISING CHILDREN?

THROW HER INTO AN INSTITUTION.
