<i>Previously on </i>Heroes...

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:05,380
- What happened to your parents?
- I touched them, they died.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:06,882
I know about your power,

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,676
and I know you're not a killer,
you're a healer.

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,761
You're staying here?
How long?

6
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,430
Until I know you're all right.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,140
I'm Becky Taylor.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,810
Open rush starts today at the house.
What don't you come by?

9
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,106
I'm missing bid night, uncle Samuel.

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,400
Checking on your work
with Claire Bennet.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,485
You're doing everything
to isolate her,

12
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,904
push other people away,
push her in our direction?

13
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,119
I remember flying.
I flew jets in the military, maybe.

14
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,664
- What name pops into your head?
- Call me Nathan.

15
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,421
I have a crush.

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,634
Please accept this bid
to join the Psi Alpha Chi sisterhood.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,803
You need to undo what you did.

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,514
Give me back my body
and I will be happy...

19
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,892
You're a killer, I'm a cop.

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,103
If I have to keep you trapped inside
for the rest of my life,

21
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,813
so be it.

22
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,278
That was amazing.

23
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,322
You are amazing.

24
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,288
Forbidden fruit.

25
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,378
My favorite kind.

27
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,956
Sheriff?

28
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,418
- You can't do this.
- Is that right?

29
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,129
You say you're a family friend.

30
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,214
Now, you're a lawyer?

31
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,342
- Jeremy lost his parents.
- My point, exactly.

32
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,179
You saw the broken heater.
You can't lock him up like a killer.

33
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,807
- You know this was and accident.
- What I know...

34
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,059
is that two people are dead.

35
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,686
And that boy...

36
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,147
Let's just say...

37
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,816
it's not the first time
he's made some trouble in my town.

38
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,361
- He's building up quite the rap sheet.
- Are you pressing charges?

39
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,698
That kid ain't going anywhere
until I finish my investigation.

40
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,658
And if and when that happens,

41
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,455
I'm not releasing him
to anyone who's not the next of kin.

42
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,916
And that is not you,

43
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,542
friend.

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,378
You have yourself
a nice evening now.

45
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,264
It's me.

46
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,600
I need your help.

47
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,507
I can get a latte here
no problem, right?

48
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,344
I saw a cow about a mile back.
Get some espresso, we're in business.

49
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,763
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know if you'd show.

50
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,516
- Who is your fallback?
- Don't have one.

51
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,101
Then I'm honored.

52
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,437
So, you found a kid with abilities?

53
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,982
I thought you were done
with the bag-and-tag business.

54
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,277
This is more of a rescue mission.

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,780
His name's Jeremy, 17 years old.
He has...

56
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,907
a dual ability.

57
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,701
Life and death.

58
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,245
He got into an argument
with his parents, and...

59
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,914
- He killed them?
- An accident.

60
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,917
His emotions got the better of him.
We all know that can happen.

61
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,878
Is that why you called me?

62
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,214
Not entirely.

63
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,884
They won't release him,
I'm not family, but it turns out...

64
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,095
that the kid is very fond...

65
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,139
of his ant Tracy.

66
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,811
Just go in,
talk to him, sign him out.

67
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,523
- I don't know.
- He's got nobody.

68
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,277
You've been there.

69
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,567
You awake?

70
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,363
- You?
- Yep.

71
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,868
You're afraid I'm gonna kiss-attack you
in your sleep?

72
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,081
Maybe.

73
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,172
We should talk about this.

74
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,594
Yeah, I guess we should.

75
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,773
It was stupid and impulsive and bad.

76
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,441
It wasn't bad.

77
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,317
I mean,

78
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,196
you're a good kisser.
I just...

79
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,033
I don't want to mess this up.

80
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,576
Mess what up?

81
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,704
My new totally ordinary life.

82
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,374
You know, the one I'm still chasing?

83
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,754
You're the first real friend
I've had since I left Texas, and...

84
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,257
that's a big deal for me.

85
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,011
And I really like you a lot.

86
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,265
Just... not in that way?

87
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,737
Jeez, Claire.

88
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,699
You don't have to go all Buffy on us.
We're just kidnapping you.

89
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,993
I am so sorry.

90
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,537
Do you want to be
an Alpha Chi or not?

91
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,248
Is that a trick question?

92
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,835
- Where are you taking us?
- Well, if I told you,

93
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,337
that wouldn't be a very good
kidnapping, would it?

94
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,100
Cannot believe that they shoved
us in the trunk.

95
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,602
So lame.

96
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,902
Look at us.

97
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,696
All tied up in the dark.

98
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,825
You know, they have entire
websites devoted to this.

99
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,538
Sorry.

100
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,046
So, you were saying

101
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,257
how you didn't really
like me that way?

102
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,302
You were saying that.

103
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,139
I was saying that you've been
a great friend.

104
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,728
So, which way is it?

105
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,650
I don't know.

106
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,278
What does that mean?

107
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,118
It means I don't know.

108
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:00,665
Awesome.

109
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,043
Good morning.

110
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,836
Welcome to hell week.

111
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,922
All right, ladies, listen up.

112
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,842
This is what we call
a screaming scavenger hunt.

113
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,637
There's a big Alpha Chi treasure
close by.

114
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,849
Whichever team finds it first
gets to sit out hell week.

115
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,434
Trust me, you want to sit out.

116
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,144
We've got goldfish.

117
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,479
Good luck!

118
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,107
But remember, ladies,
someone's got to win

119
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,776
and someone's got to lose.

120
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,659
Oh, my God!

121
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,285
Oh, my God!
Where are we?

122
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,720
Thank you.

123
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,356
My name's Tracy.
I'm a friend of Mr. Bennet's.

124
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,316
How'd you get in here?

125
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,736
We told them that I was your aunt.

126
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,237
My aunt?

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,614
I don't have an aunt.

128
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,742
You do now.

129
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,537
Mr. Bennet fixed some paperwork
and here I am.

130
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:26,292
Mr. Bennet said that
everything would go away...

131
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,420
That the cops would buy the story.

132
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,715
Mr. Bennet...

133
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,510
said they'd let me go.

134
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,226
All I have to do is sign you out.

135
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,604
That might not be such a good idea.

136
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,147
Why not?

137
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,446
I killed my parents.

138
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,156
I'm a murderer.

139
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,620
You can't control me.
You've never been able to do that.

140
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,122
I had a compelling reason.
Let's face it.

141
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,333
- Your wife is kind of hot.
- Enough!

142
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,295
That is the second Parkman
I made scream today.

143
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,092
If you want, I can give you
some pointers later.

144
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,261
Crazy psycho!

145
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,264
What are you gonna do?

146
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,809
Hit me?
Defend your lady's honor?

147
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,353
We both know it's not about that.

148
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,732
It's about all those other
things I can do to her...

149
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,112
And Matty, next time
I take over your body.

150
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,824
That's when the real fun begins.

151
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,132
Cozy.

152
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,470
Oh, my God.

153
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,432
Do you smell that?
It smells like something died in here.

154
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:08,185
- What is this place?
- Oh, my God.

155
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,271
Slaughterhouse.

156
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,107
Oh, my...

157
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,484
Please, don't say that again.

158
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,654
Hey, guys?

159
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,616
Super-cute puzzle over here.

160
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,749
"What you find
will help you survive."

161
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,543
"When we were found
will keep you alive."

162
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,211
"When we were found"?

163
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,964
Okay, let's just open one,
so we can get out of here.

164
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,007
Wait!

165
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,349
Oh, my God.

166
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,102
Relax. It's not real.
They're just trying to scare us.

167
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,068
Open 24.

168
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,279
How do you know?

169
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,158
"When we were found," 1924.
That's when the sorority was founded.

170
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,326
You know that?

171
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,912
My mom's a former sister.
Remember?

172
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,469
Thank God.
I am so thirsty.

173
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,304
One bottle per team.

174
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,681
No problem.

175
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,226
Come on, Ash.
They won the first round.

176
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,561
Now we are going to bring it.

177
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,897
Can I just stay here?

178
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,071
What happened with your parents...

179
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,990
I understand.

180
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,452
All you did was touch them.

181
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,207
The day that I discovered
my ability,

182
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,792
I killed a man.

183
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,544
He was threatening me.

184
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,296
I grabbed him and...

185
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,258
something took over.

186
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,468
Something inside of me.

187
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,016
And no matter how hard I tried...

188
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,436
You couldn't let go.

189
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,441
Your emotions took over.

190
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,360
You got mad.

191
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,571
For most people,
that's not a bad thing.

192
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,825
We're not most people.

193
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,580
I'm gonna get you out of here.

194
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,006
His next of kin is here.
What reason do you still have?

195
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,758
Well, we got plenty.

196
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,260
Is this Jeremy's?

197
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,347
Gil, show him what we found.

198
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,561
"I feel the darkness surrounding me.

199
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,271
"I am the bringer of death."

200
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,566
He's 17 years old.
The songs in his iPod sound like that.

201
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,943
I should read you the part
about killing animals.

202
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,487
Any kid at school will tell you
he does it, for fun.

203
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,199
So now we're taking gossip
as evidence, is that it?

204
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,409
There's something wrong
with that boy.

205
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,078
Far as I'm concerned,
this proves it.

206
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,789
He ain't getting away
with killing his family.

207
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,333
He's staying right here.

208
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,464
No, they still haven't charged him.

209
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,091
Their evidence
is circumstantial at best.

210
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,761
Yes, right now.

211
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,056
I'm calling in a favor, Denis.

212
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,310
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you then.

213
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,398
Sounds like you're shaking
things up in there.

214
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,027
From the looks of the place,
they could use it.

215
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,946
- Is that right?
- Tell me something.

216
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,325
How's a girl like you end up
in a place like this?

217
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,370
- You have to do better than that.
- The name is Samuel.

218
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,330
I'm here to ask you one question.

219
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,707
If you're here to save young
Jeremy's life,

220
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,210
then what's next?

221
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,671
You gonna take him
to a place just to live?

222
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,356
Or where he belongs?

223
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,694
- What did you do?
- It's all right.

224
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,489
- Stay back.
- I'm a friend, Tracy.

225
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,785
- How do you know my name?
- It's all right. You're safe here.

226
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,955
I'm like you.
We're all like you.

227
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,375
Where is this?

228
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,169
Home.

229
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,474
Slaughter floor or operation center?

230
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,144
Should I even ask?

231
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,688
Have a nice hell week.

232
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,030
After you.

233
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,924
- So, how long have you known?
- Known what?

234
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,801
That I really don't want
to be in this sorority?

235
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,304
That you like girls.

236
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,516
You make it sound
like I have to declare,

237
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,560
like, it's my major or something.

238
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,563
I'm actually jealous.

239
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,941
First year of college
and you've already figured yourself out.

240
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,069
I don't know about that.

241
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,989
Truth is I've had
more boyfriends than girlfriends.

242
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,157
Really?

243
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,451
How many more?

244
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,746
Six or seven.

245
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,831
That's not a lot, right?

246
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,334
Sounds about right.

247
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,878
You're not...

248
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,006
No, you couldn't be.
You were a cheerleader.

249
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,716
Not what?

250
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:14,593
A virgin?

251
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,183
We could not be more different.

252
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,352
Maybe we're strange attractors.

253
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,898
- Strange attractors?
- It's a physics thing.

254
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,192
Everything in the universe
has a magnetic charge.

255
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,362
So strange attractors are particles
that end up together

256
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,657
that don't belong together,
but together, they're super-powerful.

257
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,825
Sort of like we could be?

258
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,662
Or not.

259
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,330
What?

260
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,082
Hold on.

261
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:51,338
Come on.
Don't tell me you're freaked out now.

262
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,132
I mean, look.
See?

263
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,009
Nothing.

264
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,887
Just more lameness.

265
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,688
What the hell was that?

266
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:13,568
I'm starting to think
this isn't a game.

267
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,404
This is the life Jeremy could have.

268
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,699
What?
Working at a carnival?

269
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,492
Surrounded by family.

270
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,661
His true family.

271
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:29,751
Do you remember the first time
you experienced your gift?

272
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,212
"Gift" might be a little generous.

273
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:36,633
Like the entire universe
coursing through you all at once.

274
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,678
That wasn't just your ability,
Tracy.

275
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,348
You were tapping into something
greater than yourself.

276
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,821
We're all connected.

277
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,782
- I'd like to believe that.
- Believe it.

278
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,868
Every time someone
joins this family,

279
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,745
I get a feeling in here.

280
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,207
It's an energy, I guess.
It gets stronger every day.

281
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,083
This is where Jeremy should be.

282
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,211
What, living in trailers,
drifting from town to town?

283
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,423
What would you do?
Give him a false name? A false life?

284
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,260
This is a boy who can work miracles.
Why should he be invisible?

285
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,140
Bring him home!
You could join him.

286
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,436
I know you've been lost too.
It's your nature.

287
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,104
That's enough.

288
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,498
Just take me back now.

289
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,526
Fair enough.

290
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,116
Look, I'm never out the hard sell,
but please take this

291
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,243
to find your way back here.

292
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,540
This is Lydia.

293
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,668
She'll take you from here.

294
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,888
I know her. I helped her.
She came to me when she was sad.

295
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,516
I held her in my arms.
We were flying.

296
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,813
We've talked about this.
Those memories are not yours.

297
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,190
Then whose are they?

298
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,277
And if the real me isn't in here...

299
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,281
Where am I?

300
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,079
Matt, what are you doing?

301
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,168
I have to leave.
It's not safe for you and Matty.

302
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,752
Why?

303
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,754
Because...

304
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,135
Someone else can control me.

305
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,470
- My body.
- Someone else?

306
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,933
Why do you always do this?

307
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,102
Come on.
We're getting close.

308
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,606
We're going on 15 years
and you blow everything up again?

309
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,484
Look, I did a terrible thing.

310
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,362
- This should be good.
- I used my ability

311
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,031
to push one man's memories
into another man's head.

312
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,741
Yeah, my head.

313
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,161
There is somebody
using my body without my permission.

314
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:13,290
- I didn't know you could do that.
- It was wrong. I know that.

315
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,251
But I had to do it to get rid
of this really bad criminal.

316
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,713
- That's not very nice...
- Or at least just his mind.

317
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:23,884
And now his consciousness
is rattling around up in here.

318
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,969
- There's so much space.
- Shut up!

319
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:31,099
Look.
I can get rid of him.

320
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,686
- The answer's out there. I'll find it.
- Good luck.

321
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,773
- I need you to trust me, okay?
- I'm gonna give you guys a moment.

322
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,942
- You trust me, right?
- Do your thing.

323
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,987
You said it yourself.
Fifteen years are worth something.

324
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,489
I can fix this.

325
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,080
You need a place to work things out.
You should stay here.

326
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,166
I insist.
It's safer for you here.

327
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,835
I'll take Matty
and we'll go and stay with...

328
00:22:59,002 --> 00:22:59,920
Don't!

329
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,297
Don't tell me.
I don't want him to hear.

330
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,178
All right.

331
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,307
- I love you.
- That's good.

332
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,193
That was pretty smart even for you,

333
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,654
not letting her tell me
where she's gonna be.

334
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:30,200
But you still haven't figured out
how to get rid of me, genius.

335
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,752
Mohinder.
I have no idea where you are.

336
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,463
Will you do me a favor?
Call me back, okay?

337
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,299
When you get this, just call me.

338
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,096
Mohinder?

339
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,099
How's he gonna help?
He's probably working

340
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,934
on his father's research.

341
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,357
Why don't you try your old lady?
See if she picks up.

342
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:08,071
Forget it.
It is time to give me back my body

343
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,322
and just...

344
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,909
Accept it.

345
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,372
I'm... gaining ground and I...

346
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,377
I can...

347
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,213
make you do whatever...

348
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,799
- I want.
- Yeah?

349
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,844
This is hurting you a little bit?

350
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,306
You wish.

351
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,349
You know, you're right.

352
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,935
I mean, you slept with my wife.

353
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,896
You can control me
at any time, right?

354
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,523
All right.

355
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,610
Control me.
Stop me from drinking this beer.

356
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,320
Come on.

357
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,197
Come on!
Stop me!

358
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:02,709
Why don't we see...

359
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,170
how you do...

360
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:09,799
Against the heavy artillery.

361
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,472
Wait.

362
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,603
I think I've finally
found a leash for this dog.

363
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,778
There you are.
Your guy came through.

364
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:33,114
- He made all the arrangements.
- That's great.

365
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,908
- You all right?
- Yeah.

366
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,327
Let's just get him out of here.

367
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,081
Thanks.

368
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,584
Jeremy, they're letting you go.

369
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,711
But who am I gonna live with?

370
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,426
You'll be a few doors down from me
in my apartment building in D.C.

371
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,552
I've set up a new identity for you.

372
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,596
Your name is Jarod Mitchell

373
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,723
and you attend
Georgetown high school.

374
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,810
So nobody will know what I can do?

375
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,521
You'll learn to control
your ability with Tracy's help.

376
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:08,316
But you're gonna keep it to yourself.
It's the only way.

377
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,861
What if something happens?

378
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,490
Nothing's going to happen.

379
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,200
You'll be safe.

380
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,663
You'll be invisible.

381
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,257
What, you think a sorority
brought us out here to kill us?

382
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,926
That's ridiculous.
It's just a game.

383
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,928
It didn't just move itself.

384
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,807
There was no one else there.
How else would you explain it?

385
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:44,978
- In my world, there's a million ways.
- Name one.

386
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,563
Telekinesis.

387
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,275
I've seen it.
Heck, I know someone who has it.

388
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,112
So wait, you're saying
there's another one of you here?

389
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,573
It's very possible.

390
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,452
And what?
They're playing a college prank on you?

391
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,871
Not a prank.

392
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,249
You think that they're
trying to kill you?

393
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,585
Not me.

394
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,961
Then who?

395
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,927
Me?
Come on.

396
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,386
Think about it.

397
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,597
My first roommate committed suicide

398
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,017
with a mysterious note that
wasn't there, but then it was.

399
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,104
Maybe you almost
getting gutted wasn't a coincidence.

400
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:32,233
Claire, that is a little out there.

401
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,070
Sounds like some crazy-ass
conspiracy theory.

402
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,783
Which pretty much describes
your entire life.

403
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,120
What was that?

404
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,999
I don't know.

405
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:53,880
Ash, cut it out.
Come on.

406
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,257
You guys all right?

407
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,636
- You find another clue?
- Like I'm gonna tell you.

408
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,598
Look, your roommate's freaked out
and we don't care about the treasure.

409
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,975
Let's stick together,
get the hell out of here,

410
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,020
and once we find it,
you can have it. Deal?

411
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,315
- Okay, can we just go?
- Deal.

412
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,692
Lead the way.

413
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,940
Take my car.
Straight ahead.

414
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,860
We know what happened
to your parents!

415
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,529
We know what you did!

416
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,906
We know what you did.

417
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,952
You're getting away
with murder, you...

418
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,329
Don't hurt him!

419
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,333
Jeremy, stop.
Let him go.

420
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,508
Get the hell away from him!

421
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,428
<i>Jeremy, you can save him!</i>

422
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,097
- <i>Everyone back! Back!</i>
- <i>Listen to me</i>.

423
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,142
- <i>You can help him. You can save him.</i>
- <i>Everybody stand back!</i>

424
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,602
<i>Now listen, son.</i>

425
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,396
<i>You're going back in there.</i>

426
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,816
<i>You know what you did
to your mama and your daddy.</i>

427
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,237
<i>Save him.
You can do it.</i>

428
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:08,362
You have no idea
what's happening here.

429
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:09,682
Three people are dead.

430
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:11,342
I understand that.

431
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,039
And that boy, whatever he is,
is responsible!

432
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:15,647
Do you want it to happen again?

433
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:17,732
Let me talk to him.

434
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:20,164
Talk to him?

435
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:23,143
You're through talking to him.

436
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,190
Both of you.

437
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,660
You think killers go free?

438
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,584
Not in this town.

439
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:44,292
Gil, where's the boy?

440
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:48,847
Gil, do you read?

441
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:50,657
<i>The boy is gone.</i>

442
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,184
<i>Gil, do you read me?</i>

443
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,641
<i>Are you there?</i>

444
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,352
Not so tough now, are you?

445
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:05,405
Go ahead.

446
00:31:06,336 --> 00:31:07,740
Take your best shot.

447
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:09,918
Give me a reason.

448
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,121
You're not normal.

449
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,557
You don't belong here.

450
00:31:37,804 --> 00:31:38,804
Go.

451
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:46,404
You like that?

452
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:48,990
You know what this is?

453
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,373
I bought this...
with Janice,

454
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:55,413
on our anniversary trip to Ensenada.

455
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:59,130
And it is so poetic
that I am using it to bury you.

456
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:01,419
Bury me or drown the truth?

457
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,064
The truth, what?
That you...

458
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:07,595
you're nothing?
You're just a figment of my imagination.

459
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,302
Let's quiet those voices, shall we?

460
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,624
Your wife walked out on you.

461
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:21,087
You think she wanted
to give you your space.

462
00:32:21,254 --> 00:32:23,165
She can't stand the sight of you.

463
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,150
Pathetic.

464
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,133
You know what she said to me,

465
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:29,155
in front of the fire last night?

466
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,742
"Why can't you be more
like this all the time?"

467
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,733
When you're gone...

468
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:44,077
Janice and I are gonna have
a beautiful life together.

469
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:49,467
You're so desperate

470
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:51,088
to fit in.

471
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,056
Why can't you accept your power?

472
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,500
Why do you insist
on being... so forgettable?

473
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:05,388
Man.
You're afraid.

474
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,862
You're afraid of dying.

475
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:15,021
And you just passed out.

476
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,476
You just passed out.

477
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,381
Yes!

478
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:41,171
Honey, I did it.

479
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:42,520
I really did it.

480
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,189
"Kill house."

481
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,161
"Prep room."

482
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:04,918
"Kill house" sounds more dangerous.
We're taking that one.

483
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,791
I thought we were gonna
stick together.

484
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:09,208
No way.

485
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:18,473
Let's just check this real quick.
We'll catch up to them.

486
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,515
Well, we won.

487
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:39,494
Kind of.

488
00:34:40,857 --> 00:34:42,789
I'm gonna go get Paris and Nicole.

489
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:50,588
- I get it, by the way.
- You get what?

490
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,841
You wanting to run
from your freaky world

491
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,658
and live a normal life.

492
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:59,632
I shouldn't have put you on the spot
and gotten all relationship-y on you.

493
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:02,399
- The last thing you need right now...
- I need you.

494
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:04,982
Trust me.

495
00:35:07,781 --> 00:35:08,781
What?

496
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:30,542
What's going on?

497
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:40,334
Oh, my God!
Claire!

498
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:53,605
Oh...

499
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:54,817
My...

500
00:35:54,984 --> 00:35:55,984
God!

501
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:58,947
Becky?

502
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:00,997
Grab her!

503
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,193
A little help, please?

504
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,174
Oh, my God.

505
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:18,448
Don't do it!
Stop!

506
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,691
No, stop!

507
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,222
- What the...
- What?

508
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:25,002
How did you...

509
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,159
What's happening?

510
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:31,853
What are we gonna do?

511
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:21,072
We could have saved him.

512
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:23,228
He needed a home.

513
00:37:28,294 --> 00:37:29,401
A real home.

514
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:50,405
Tracy, I'm sorry.

515
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:54,914
You know,
this was supposed to be simple.

516
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,566
Just go in and sign him out.

517
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,235
I thought I could manage.

518
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,487
By hiding him away
for the rest of his life?

519
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:05,700
I stood on his porch and I told him
that I wouldn't let him down.

520
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,050
But you did.

521
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:10,121
We did.

522
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,406
I did what I thought was right.

523
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:15,805
And I was wrong.

524
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:20,278
I've been wrong all these years.

525
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:22,473
Do we have to be invisible?

526
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:25,595
You ever think we could just live,
Noah?

527
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:27,519
Out in the open?

528
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,292
Not after today, no.

529
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:36,978
Don't ever call me again.

530
00:39:24,201 --> 00:39:26,639
You gave us quite
a scare there, brother.

531
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:30,841
I know.
I'm sorry. I just...

532
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:34,297
I had to see if...

533
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:37,294
If I could...

534
00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:42,075
I'm much better now.

535
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,173
Not quite.

536
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:46,673
We start over...

537
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,751
from the beginning.

538
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:50,251
You hear me?

539
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:58,001
Thanks.

540
00:39:58,444 --> 00:39:59,544
Both of you.

541
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:04,198
I love you.

542
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,080
You'll love me a lot more
after I take a shower.

543
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,330
Let me guess.

544
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,065
You want your body back?

545
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:45,526
Did you think
you were actually winning?

546
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:49,766
The second you blacked out,
I slipped right in.

547
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:52,074
Now I'm in the driver's seat.

548
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:54,577
You'll never get away with this.

549
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:57,456
I already have.
