1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:01,923
Previously on heroes...

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,547
You had to go and be the detective,

3
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:05,615
Didn't you, matt?

4
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:10,353
Now that you know, you can't be here.

5
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:13,322
No!

6
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:14,790
This girl found me,

7
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,392
Said I should go to this company, pinehearst.

8
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:17,727
There's a chance

9
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:19,629
That these people at pinehearst can help us.

10
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,567
You don't have your powers anymore, peter.

11
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:26,135
Because I have them now.

12
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:27,803
I'm sorry, peter. this is something I have to do.

13
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,372
You help him, you're proving

14
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:30,640
All the worst things I've ever said about you.

15
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:32,174
Just kick his ass, and let's get out of here.

16
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:33,576
I'm not going anywhere, peter.

17
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:34,977
You are.

18
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:38,447
You can't heal.

19
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:39,715
How did you fall that far and not die?

20
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:41,250
Now that they think we're dead,

21
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:43,119
We have time to get away.

22
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,654
No. I told you. I'm not running.

23
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:46,155
There's a company, primatech--

24
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,057
They know how to deal with situations like this.

25
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,091
If anybody can help, they can.

26
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:50,092
It worked.

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,327
He thinks I'm on his side.

28
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:53,429
Hello, angela.

29
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,131
You can see the future.

30
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:56,766
I can't have that.

31
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:58,868
That's too dangerous.

32
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:00,236
Dad's dead.

33
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:01,637
He's not. he's alive.

34
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:02,972
I need to know where he is.

35
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,307
Pinehearst.

36
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:05,575
Pinehearst, the biotech firm?

37
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:07,510
How do you know about pinehearst?

38
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:09,011
I've been taking a consultant fee from them

39
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,079
For over a year.

40
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,314
I can open doors.

41
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:12,415
I don't need any doors opened.

42
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:14,083
I plan on kicking 'em down.

43
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:16,152
I'm ready to begin my spirit walk.

44
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:21,157
I understand you've been dreaming about me.

45
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:25,895
When the moon passes

46
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,697
Between the sun and the earth,

47
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:29,398
A strange fascination

48
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,967
Takes root in the heart.

49
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:33,936
And suddenly, anything is possible.

50
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:41,477
Its power is undeniable.

51
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:43,980
Its beauty mesmerizing.

52
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:45,848
Its lure biblical.

53
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:50,486
Its meaning unknowable.

54
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:54,090
And as quickly as it comes,It disappears,

55
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:57,159
Leaving us to dwell on our own insignificance

56
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:58,594
In the face of god.

57
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,634
I understand you've been dreaming about me.

58
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:06,936
I can't have that.

59
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:08,170
That's too dangerous.

60
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,872
I will completely wipe out your memory.

61
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,574
Hiro!

62
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:13,676
Leave my friend alone!

63
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:24,086
You had one job to do,

64
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:26,556
And now I have to come clean up your mess.

65
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:30,526
That's what I get for sending a boy to do a man's job.

66
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,160


67
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,730


68
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,420


69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,560


70
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,010


71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,110


72
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,220


73
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,480


74
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,420


75
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,650


76
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,470


77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,650


78
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,440


79
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,240


80
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,880


81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,470


82
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,740


83
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,950


84
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,110


85
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:17,366
Still hard to believe peter survived that fall

86
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:19,268
Without his powers.

87
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:24,073
Yeah, I was just thinking that myself.

88
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:27,109
Come. I have something to show you.

89
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:29,178
Where are you taking me?

90
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,116
It's time I started acting like your father, gabriel.

91
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:36,252
That hunger you've got, it's not about killing,

92
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:37,820
It's about power.

93
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,023
You can take all the abilities you want

94
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,592
Without killing.

95
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,492
I can teach you.

96
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,461
How?

97
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:47,697
By accessing your empathy,

98
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:51,000
That part of your heart I know is there.

99
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,469
You've had this power all along.

100
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,006
Empathy.

101
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:59,342
What makes you think I'm capable of that?

102
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,644
Because I know you're the one

103
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:06,315
That saved peter from that fall.

104
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:48,791
You.

105
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,214
-We have to get out of here. -I know.

106
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,682
But you're not coming with me.

107
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:16,050
What?

108
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:17,318
I'm gonna go someplace where they can't find me.

109
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:18,787
And you're gonna go home.

110
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:19,780
Peter, I have to protect you.

111
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,668
I can protect myself, claire.

112
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:22,735
How? you don't have your powers.

113
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:23,770
Your father's trying to kill you.

114
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,705
Look, this isn't your fight.

115
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:27,874
I need you to stay...

116
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,835
Stay what?

117
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:33,870
Innocent.

118
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:38,376
Fire escape. run!

119
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,825
-I'll hold 'em off. -claire.

120
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:41,226
I have a plan. go.

121
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:53,606
You're never gonna find him.

122
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:55,507
Aw, that's cute. she's protecting him.

123
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:03,682
Don't you know?

124
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:10,182
I'm the defensive player of the year.

125
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,514
Come on!

126
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,876
Told you I had a plan.

127
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:34,511
Yeah.

128
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,150
What's wrong?

129
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:42,518
They're coming. come on.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,134
We should keep moving.

131
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:04,240
Any luck yet?

132
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,008
If you call this luck?

133
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:11,514
What went wrong?

134
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:12,949
I don't know.

135
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,517
I'm beginning to think it's impossible

136
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:16,953
To give people abilities without an adverse reaction.

137
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,256
He's a human being for god's sakes.

138
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:29,031
I see we share a fascination.

139
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:33,369
It seems most of the powers I've documented

140
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:35,805
Took place during the last total-annular eclipse.

141
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,876
It's probably just a coincidence.

142
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:41,494
I thought I had successfully combined my findings

143
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:43,045
With yours.

144
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:44,814
I mean, theoretically, this formula is sound,

145
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:47,550
But the serum is triggering a mutation

146
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,518
Because something is missing.

147
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:50,953
Something?

148
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:53,656
Some kind of catalyst that allows the proteins

149
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:55,658
From the serum to bond with the enzymes

150
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,493
Produced by each individual's adrenals.

151
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,595
Then you'll just have to keep looking.

152
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:01,063
It's not that simple.

153
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:03,366
The key component of this catalyst would be something

154
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:05,134
That couldn't be stored or created synthetically.

155
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:06,302
Meaning what?

156
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,703
Meaning it would live in a human host.

157
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:11,707
You're saying this catalyst isn't something.

158
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,843
It's someone.

159
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:17,680
Kaito.

160
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:19,782
I'm sorry?

161
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,351
My former colleague, kaito nakamura.

162
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,720
He hid it.

163
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:26,389
Just not well enough.

164
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,917
I will kill you, you son of a bitch.

165
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:56,819
You murdered my father!

166
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,521
Yes, I did.

167
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:01,157
How could you do that to me?

168
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:09,565
I'm not gonna insult you by saying I'm sorry.

169
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,435
You deserve so much more than that, elle.

170
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:15,438
You deserve vengeance.

171
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:17,240
I'll take whatever you've got.

172
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:25,455
I thought you said

173
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:26,399
there were people who could help us here.

174
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,316
There were.

175
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:28,951
Where'd they all go?

176
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,320
It's like a ghost town.

177
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:53,976
Who is that?

178
00:10:54,077 --> 00:10:56,345
Her name is, uh, angela petrelli.

179
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:59,148
Petrelli.

180
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:03,186
-What's wrong with her? -I don't know.

181
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:04,754
Mrs. petrelli.

182
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:16,532
What is it? what did you see?

183
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,668
I gotta help her.

184
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:20,102
I better get a nurse.

185
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:41,791
Didn't expect you so soon.

186
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:43,426
Matt parkman's at primatech.

187
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:46,429
He's trying to help your wife.

188
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:50,433
Did you do that to her?

189
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,370
Mrs. petrelli will be fine.

190
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,506
Can we leave matt out of this?

191
00:11:56,607 --> 00:12:00,776
You know, if you're unhappy,

192
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,078
I can always arrange for you

193
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:05,481
To go back to your previous life.

194
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:09,051
Just tell me what I'm supposed to do.

195
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:10,953
Stay with parkman.

196
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,523
And if he tries to help your wife?

197
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,559
Then I'll be waiting.

198
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,728
Okay, we'll go and then we'll separate.

199
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:19,795
Separate?

200
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,297
I told you. you have to go home.

201
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,865
I'm not going home, peter.

202
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:25,501
You still have a chance, claire.

203
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:28,304
I left home so I could fight these people,

204
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:29,372
And I have.

205
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:31,174
I can protect myself now.

206
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,575
I can protect you.

207
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:34,844
That's the problem.

208
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:37,213
What's this all about?

209
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,282
Look, that alley back there,

210
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:40,483
That's where you kill me.

211
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,751
What?

212
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:43,119
In the future, you find me,

213
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:44,854
And you shoot me.

214
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:47,089
Twice. right in the chest.

215
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:49,258
What are you talking about? why would I do that?

216
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:52,261
Because what you're becoming is a killer.

217
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,065
And I'm trying really hard to make sure

218
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,202
That future that I saw does not come true.

219
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:00,636
And I don't know if I can do it.

220
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:03,306
Because everything that happens,

221
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,677
Everything, you're still becoming this woman who--

222
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,645
Who what?

223
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:10,646
Who kills you?

224
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:12,515
Stop saying that.

225
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,750
Claire, just go home.

226
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:18,955
Please.

227
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:22,792
No.

228
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,594
It's not gonna happen.

229
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,562
And it's all your fault.

230
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,397
You should have never come to odessa to save me.

231
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:31,200
You should have never become my friend or my hero.

232
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,271
And now I can't leave you

233
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:38,508
Because I have a favor to return.

234
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:45,281
Run.

235
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,085
Go.

236
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:02,098
You want him, you're gonna have to go through me.

237
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,766
You can't fight it, claire.

238
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:07,370
How do you know my name?

239
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,607
Oh, 'cause we didn't come for peter.

240
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,242
We came for you.

241
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:19,515
No!

242
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,218
Get off of me!

243
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,953
No!

244
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,926
No! let me go!

245
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,630


246
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,890


247
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,760


248
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,620


249
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,570


250
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,730


251
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,520


252
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,190


253
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
superhero?

254
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,860


255
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,880


256
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,780


257
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,660


258
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,940


259
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,620


260
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,370


261
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,830


262
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,980


263
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,510


264
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,220


265
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,940


266
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,060


267
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,590


268
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,270


269
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,530


270
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,920


271
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,640


272
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,400


273
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000


274
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000


275
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,071
I couldn't find anyone.
There's no one here.

276
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,573
I gotta try and get inside her head.

277
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:10,409
See if I can unlock what's holding her.

278
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,477
Is that safe?

279
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:12,544
Can you get hurt?

280
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:20,953
I've only done it one other time.

281
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,988
With my dad.

282
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:25,791
How'd that work out?

283
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:29,929
What do you need me to do?

284
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,599
Just stay here and keep an eye on me, okay?

285
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,834
I might disappear for a while.

286
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:36,835
In there.

287
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:41,040
But I'll be back. I'll be okay.

288
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:44,443
Just knowing that you're here's gonna help.

289
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:53,519
Matt?

290
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:55,688
Can you hear me?

291
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:56,989
Murderer!

292
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,995
Murderer!

293
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,734
I didn't want to kill him.

294
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,541
I didn't want to kill any of them.

295
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:16,842
You know that.

296
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:19,345
You saved my life. remember, elle?

297
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:22,481
You know the pain I feel over this.

298
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:29,288
The urge. but I'm not gonna let it control me.

299
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:31,323
Not anymore.

300
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:39,298
I'll kill you, I swear to god!

301
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:43,435
I'll kill you, I swear to god! I will kill you!

302
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:51,076
I understand.

303
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:52,211
You need to let it out.

304
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:06,258
The anger.

305
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,259
The betrayal.

306
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:11,263
You can take it out on me.

307
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:12,431
I can take it all.

308
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,027
Go ahead.

309
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:43,395
Kill me.

310
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:50,736
Please.

311
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,768
There was a wide spot up in the road.

312
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,136
In the berkshires.

313
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,738
My father used to take my brother and me fishing there

314
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,608
When we were kids.

315
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,776
It was called pinehearst.

316
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,743
Nathan, are you sure

317
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,712
You want to do this?

318
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,382
If he's alive,

319
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,117
Maybe there's a reason he hasn't contacted you.

320
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:25,056
I need to know the truth.

321
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,524
Everything I've ever done in my life

322
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,893
Has been because of my father.

323
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,428
I went to law school to be like him.

324
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,096
I married the girl he wanted me to.

325
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,031
I ran for office

326
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,367
Because he couldn't.

327
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,338
If he's alive, I've gotta see him.

328
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,380
My god.

329
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,688
Good to see you too,

330
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,590
Nathan.

331
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,791
Come give your dad a hug.

332
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,341
You must be miss strauss.

333
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,077
I must be.

334
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,153
You have any idea

335
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,389
What you've done to this family?

336
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,791
What you've done to me?

337
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,961
Hindsight being 20/20, I should have told you sooner

338
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,630
What your role was in all of this.

339
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,436
My role?

340
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,572
Would you excuse us, please?

341
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,607
My son and I need to talk alone.

342
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,610
Absolutely.

343
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,282
Take a hard look at the last couple of weeks

344
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,751
Of your life, and you will see that role

345
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,153
Coming into focus.

346
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:06,257
The assassination, linderman,

347
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,658
The senate seat.

348
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,561
All part of your destiny.

349
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,964
That was all you.

350
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,466
You were born with a talent, nathan.

351
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,969
A talent to lead a nation.

352
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,305
This is the same crap linderman spouted.

353
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,874
I'm not falling for it again.

354
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,545
Because...last time, it was new york

355
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,713
That was destroyed, and this time,

356
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,114
It would be the world, right?

357
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,016
Look around you.

358
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,284
It's already happening.

359
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,521
And I've got the formula that will stop it.

360
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,756
You're insane.

361
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:48,099
I am not afraid to admit

362
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,669
That you have always been my favorite son,

363
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,404
The one most like me.

364
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,239
The strong one.

365
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,744
We can save the world together.

366
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,847
This can be our legacy, nathan,

367
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,882
For the petrelli name.

368
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:08,686
I am offering you this chance.

369
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,988
As your father.

370
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,345
Kill me.

371
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,683
Take my power. that's what you want.

372
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,385
Kill me, and make the pain stop.

373
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,889
I wanna make it stop, elle.

374
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,193
But I'm not gonna kill you.

375
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,296
Please just do it.

376
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,631
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:57,535
I wanna be a good person.

378
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,371
You're a monster.

379
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,140
Like me.

380
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,142
No, your father made you this way,

381
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,378
Just like my mother made me.

382
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,447
We we never good enough for them, elle.

383
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,283
You never meant to be this way.

384
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,651
You wanted to be normal.

385
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,054
You just didn't know how.

386
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,290
You saved my life once, elle.

387
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,859
You gave me the will to live.

388
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,362
Don't you see I owe you?

389
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,868
I only saved you so we could use you.

390
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,105
Like a lab rat.

391
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,409
You were just following orders.

392
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,650
But I forgive you.

393
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,656
Now you need to forgive yourself.

394
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,709
The pain.

395
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,010
It's gone.

396
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,624
Oh, my god.

397
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:41,005
Let me go! no!

398
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,081
You've got two choices.

399
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,048
Let her go, or you die.

400
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,650
You and what army?

401
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,418
Peter, what are you doing?

402
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,559
I don't need an army to kick your ass, flint.

403
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,094
I can do that all by myself.

404
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,795
Don't even need my powers.

405
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Stop!

406
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,135
Gas.

407
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,137
Claire, run!

408
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,262
No one's ever done anything like that for me before.

409
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,068
You forgave yourself, elle.

410
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,436
We're all at war with ourselves.

411
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:49,006
That's what it means to be human.

412
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,442
The trick is figuring out how to be on the winning side.

413
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,220
You wanna try?

414
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,002
Clearly, I don't have it figured out yet.

415
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,105
Let me show you a few tricks.

416
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,979
You aim.

417
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,247
Then go like this.

418
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,192
That's good.

419
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,861
This time, loosen up.

420
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:45,863
You know? give it some attitude.

421
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,232
Some english.

422
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,942
That's really good.

423
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,211
Keep it up, you'll be a gunslinger in no time.

424
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,414
Thank you.

425
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,584
It's amazing.

426
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,455
Thank you.

427
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,686
Hiro!

428
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000


429
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000


430
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000


431
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000


432
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000


433
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000


434
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000


435
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000


436
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000


437
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000


438
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000


439
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000


440
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000


441
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,691
He wants to give half the planet superpowers,

442
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,060
So that we can save the world together with me as president.

443
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,094
And you believed him?

444
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,096
I don't know what to believe.

445
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,698
Nothing makes any sense.

446
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,166
I thought the man was dead.

447
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,401
I don't even know what to do with my life

448
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,435
Now that he's alive.

449
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,270
Hold on a minute.

450
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,073
You are a u.s. senator.

451
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,709
You've got an entire constituency riding on you

452
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,577
Having a clear vision of what you believe in.

453
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:44,581
Good luck with that.

454
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,250
No, you need to listen to me.

455
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,485
You gotta snap the hell out of this.

456
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,424
You have to get yourself together.

457
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,558
Do you understand?

458
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,664
We should go back to washington.

459
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,434
We'll get the justice department involved-- no.

460
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,602
Let's keep the lid on it.

461
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:05,669
But people have to know.

462
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,971
No.

463
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,406
Last time I tried to tell anybody anything like this,

464
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,643
My brother came back from the future and shot me.

465
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,980
Twice.

466
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,715
I'm gonna go to primatech,

467
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,117
See what else my mother knows.

468
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,251
You go to washington.

469
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,288
Cover for me.

470
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,525
I'll be back in touch when I know

471
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:29,994
What our next move is, okay?

472
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,646
Let me guess.

473
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:52,182
You want me to take away your power.

474
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,584
No.

475
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,586
I'm actually getting used to it.

476
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,488
I'm here because I think

477
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,457
That you and I can help each other.

478
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,192
Can we now?

479
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,560
And all I ask on my end

480
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,729
Is that you look out for me once the dust settles.

481
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,501
See...

482
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,636
I believe that you have a p.r. problem.

483
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,541
I pride myself on knowing how the tides turn.

484
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,976
I know how the world works,

485
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,546
And for your plan to succeed,

486
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,714
You need a public face.

487
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:27,151
Now, normally, that would be you.

488
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,220
Problem is, the world thinks you're dead.

489
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,024
A thorny issue,

490
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,826
I admit.

491
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,062
But I think nathan can be that face.

492
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:43,934
The bad news, he's on the fence.

493
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,269
The good news...

494
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,706
I can push him over.

495
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,574
You scratch my back,

496
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,377
And I will make sure he lands on the right side.

497
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:06,657
Matt?

498
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,025
Can you hear me?

499
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,718
Angela!

500
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,120
You okay?

501
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,890
I'm here to help you. I'm gonna get you out of here.

502
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,492
You shouldn't have come.

503
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,161
He's too dangerous.

504
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,897
Don't you understand?

505
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,599
There's no escape.

506
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,401
Even if you get them off,

507
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:53,704
Arthur's locked all of the doors.

508
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,812
These doors are open. I can get us out of here.

509
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,018
Daphne.

510
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,287
What are you doing here?

511
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,123
I'm here to help you, matt.

512
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,636
Aah! daphne, don't!

513
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,141
No.

514
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,309
Matt.

515
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,578
No. no.

516
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,613
You gotta come back.

517
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,483
Daphne, don't.

518
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,952
Matt.

519
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,687
Matt, wake up!

520
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,888
Matt, wake up!

521
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:51,962
Matt, you've got to wake up! wake up, matt!

522
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,471
Matt, matt, wake up. bring me in there.

523
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,308
Matt, you have to take me in there.

524
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:12,085
Matt, we gotta go. matt.

525
00:34:12,186 --> 00:34:13,353
Get away from me.

526
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,388
I came to help you.

527
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,123
Ugh, you stabbed me.

528
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:18,725
That wasn't me. don't believe her, matt.

529
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:21,661
Take it from me.

530
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:24,964
A woman will betray you at every turn.

531
00:34:27,368 --> 00:34:28,968
You're lying.

532
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:32,638
Really? how do you think I knew where you were?

533
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:33,940
She told me.

534
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:38,111
She betrayed you, matt.

535
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:42,081
Like angela betrayed me.

536
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:43,249
You told him?

537
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,184
I was afraid.

538
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,020
I thought I had to. he said he'd take it all away from me.

539
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:48,421
What are you talking about?

540
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:50,256
I can't go back to being the way that I was, matt,

541
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:51,958
But I couldn't let you die either.

542
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:53,493
I'm sorry. I just--i didn't know.

543
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:55,628
Didn't know what?

544
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:59,198
How much I cared about you.

545
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,034
Matt, you're bleeding.

546
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,869
I don't know how arthur's doing it,

547
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,270
But you've got to wake up, or you're going to die.

548
00:35:04,338 --> 00:35:06,706
You can't trust her, matt. she lies.

549
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:07,740
They all lie.

550
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:08,908
Send her away.

551
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:11,778
No. no, don't. matt, please.

552
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:14,280
I made a mistake.

553
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,916
I trusted the wrong people, but I can't lose you.

554
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,289
I love you.

555
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:32,065
We were once like that, arthur.

556
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,367
Remember?

557
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:39,672
You loved me.

558
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,008
And there's a part of you that still does.

559
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:44,911
So now you're going

560
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,879
To let me go.

561
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:48,314
You understand?

562
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:56,756
I said, let me go, arthur.

563
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:13,406
We gotta go, fast.

564
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,351
We did it.

565
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:27,286
You were there.

566
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,688
Was that really you?

567
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:31,290
Yeah, you brought me in.

568
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,926
And those things that you said--

569
00:36:33,994 --> 00:36:36,529
Yeah, that was me too, and I meant every word of it.

570
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,570
Detective parkman.

571
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:48,675
Are you okay?

572
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:51,110
I'm gonna get a doctor.

573
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:57,250
Parkman?

574
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:58,851
Peter.

575
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:01,054
She can't be trusted.

576
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:03,222
You're the one who can't be trusted.

577
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:05,258
You shot your own brother,

578
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,659
And then you sent me out in the middle of nowhere!

579
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,227
It wasn't me. it wasn't me.

580
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:12,799
Matt, you gotta believe me. I'm telling the truth.

581
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:17,970
Where's angela?

582
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:20,873
She's awake.

583
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,778
Test subject was injected with batch 38

584
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:29,349
At 0634 hours.

585
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:32,785
Heart rate rose to 164 beats per minute.

586
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:35,421
Sustained at that level for two hours.

587
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,398
I am so sorry.

588
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:50,103
Please kill me. please.

589
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,210


590
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,050


591
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,860


592
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,550


593
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,900


594
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,330


595
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,340


596
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,170


597
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,220


598
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,930


599
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,270


600
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,800


601
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,720


602
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,870


603
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,630


604
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,200


605
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,190


606
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,910


607
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,530


608
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,770


609
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,770


610
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,280


611
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,880


612
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,860


613
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,402
Mom. thank god you're okay.

614
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:31,471
Your father. he's alive.

615
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:32,739
I know.

616
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:35,008
I talked to him today.

617
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:40,413
He's got the formula.

618
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:42,148
Both halves.

619
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:44,217
They were supposed to be hidden away forever,

620
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:46,686
But someone's stolen them

621
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:48,287
Right out from underneath us.

622
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:50,490
Now peter and I have both seen the future,

623
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:53,259
And trust me, it's not one that any of you want to face.

624
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:55,395
Make that three of us.

625
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:57,030
And she's right.

626
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,132
Arthur's probably figured out by now

627
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,134
That there's a third piece of the formula.

628
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:01,968
It won't work without it.

629
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:03,836
What kind of piece?

630
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:05,872
It's a catalyst.

631
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:08,975
Hidden away in the blood of a human host.

632
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:12,478
Kaito nakamura was the only one who knew the identity

633
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:16,182
Of the host, and kaito, as we know, is dead.

634
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,818
So how do we find the host?

635
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:20,219
We don't have to.

636
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,155
We just have to make sure that he doesn't.

637
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:34,334
When sylar attacked me, he saw something.

638
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,302
He took off the top of my head.

639
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:43,176
He said I was different from everyone else.

640
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:44,410
Special.

641
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:50,717
I didn't understand what that meant until today.

642
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:58,024
I think I'm the catalyst.

643
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:12,705
It starts with light

644
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:14,073
And ends with light.

645
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,376
And in between, there is darkness.

646
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,881
Nothing there is beyond hope.

647
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:25,351
Nothing that can be sworn impossible.

648
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:27,487
Nothing left unimagined...

649
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:30,223
Since zeus, father of the olympians,

650
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:37,230
Made night from midday...

651
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:42,394
Hiding the light of the shining sun

652
00:41:42,462 --> 00:41:45,231
And raining dark fear down upon men.

653
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:49,401
It's coming.
