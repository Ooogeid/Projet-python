00:00:00,378 --> 00:00:04,356
<i>Now, the next chapter of Heroes begins.</i>

2
00:00:07,327 --> 00:00:10,750
<i>Last December, Heroes give us a look</i>

3
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:12,232
<i>into the future.</i>

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,380
<i>But that, was just the beginning.</i>

5
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,944
<i>There were strangers who discovered
extraordinary abilities...</i>

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,629
I think I can fly.

7
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:27,032
<i>... until they realize
they were not alone...</i>

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,488
We are all connected.

9
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,667
<i>... with the discovery of one thing.</i>

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,112
The List.

11
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,326
<i>The invincible cheerleader</i>

12
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,410
<i>on a mission to find her birth parents.</i>

13
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:40,852
I think I'm old enough for you
to tell me who my real parents are.

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,013
<i>The mother with an alter ego</i>

15
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,883
<i>makes a sacrifice to protect her child.</i>

16
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,947
- Can I help you, m'am?
- Yeah, you can arrest me.

17
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,259
Your mom's not coming home.

18
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:53,604
<i>And tonight,
the search for new heroes begins.</i>

19
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:54,784
How can you see me?

20
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,884
The entire city is in danger.

21
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:00,970
It's me.

22
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:05,159
Heroes, the next chapter begins...now.

23
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:43,376
1x12 God Send

24
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:45,341
You get your mind ready yet, Niki?

25
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:54,248
Up to me, I'd leave you in the box here
a few more weeks.

26
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,128
Even animals like you
get a lawyer visit.

27
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:00,658
You just move real slow-like,
you hear me?

28
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,414
Nice and easy.

29
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:04,655
Show me your hands!

30
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:08,721
Come on, get 'em up!

31
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:11,057
Go on.

32
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:14,409
Let's go.

33
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,262
<i>Union Wells High School opens its doors
today</i>

34
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,204
<i>for the first time
since 16-year-old Jackie Wilcox</i>

35
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:24,906
<i>was brutally murdered
during a homecoming game two weeks ago.</i>

36
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,674
<i>Teachers and students wrestle with
how to remember the slain cheerleader,</i>

37
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:30,439
<i>while still trying to move on.</i>

38
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,449
<i>This is Angela Braumstead,
Channel 5 News.</i>

39
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:36,550
Look at all those reporters.

40
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,095
Don't worry about the press.

41
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:39,740
They're not allowed on school grounds.

42
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:41,241
I'm more worried about the other kids.

43
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:43,745
They're gonna want to ask me questions
about it.

44
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,806
Well...

45
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,626
You don't have to tell them anything.

46
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,666
Well, good,
'cause I don't really remember much.

47
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:55,693
I mean, I know that's supposed to be
post-traumatic stress

48
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:57,701
or whatever, but nothing?

49
00:02:58,874 --> 00:02:59,874
Nothing at all?

50
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:01,776
Memory's a funny thing.

51
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:04,600
I think it's a blessing
that you don't remember.

52
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:05,918
Where'd you find me?

53
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,654
What do you mean?

54
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:10,350
The night Jackie got killed.

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,779
You said you found me by the stadium?

56
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,907
You were scared to death.

57
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:17,846
You were traumatized,
you just wanted to go home.

58
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,416
I don't remember.

59
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,375
Thanks.

60
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,247
I guess I better go.

61
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:48,424
Not so dangerous anymore, are we,
Mr. Sylar?

62
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,996
We've gone over every strand of code,

63
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,761
trying to find the code on switches
that identify his aptitudes.

64
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,202
Other than telekinesis,
we're drawing a blank.

65
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:59,320
Has he responded to the glycimerine?

66
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,986
Given him enough to kill an elephant.

67
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,009
Nothing. We're no closer.

68
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:08,433
If we keep up at this rate,
he'll be dead by tomorrow.

69
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,963
After what he did to Eden,
he'd deserve it.

70
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:14,340
Unfortunately,
they haven't authorized that.

71
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:15,496
He stays alive.

72
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,425
You're just gonna have to dig deeper.

73
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:34,820
You better be right about this, Parkman.

74
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:39,986
Let's go, come on!

75
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:42,015
Come on, let's go.

76
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,475
We swept this entire place.
There's nothing here but paper.

77
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,028
- Did you check the basement?
- Yeah !

78
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,097
Stairwells?

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,656
More paper.

80
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:54,971
Where is he?

81
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,358
Where is he? Where's Sylar?

82
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,391
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

83
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,992
He's not here, Parkman.

84
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:13,557
Nice going.

85
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:32,669
<i>The Tyrannosaurus Rex was a huge,
meat-eating dinosaur</i>

86
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:34,971
<i>that lived
during the late Cretaceous Period</i>

87
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:37,580
<i>about 65 to 85 million years ago.</i>

88
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,327
<i>If we could go back in time,</i>

89
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,968
<i>there's no telling
what wonders we'd find...</i>

90
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:33,950
www.sub-way.fr

91
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:03,351
He's burning up.

92
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,617
Persistent idiopathic fever.

93
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,178
Means they have no idea what's wrong.

94
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:11,212
Find the best doctors in the world,
just to have them tell me

95
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,667
they don't know what they're doing
in 4 different languages.

96
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:16,172
His heart-- they don't know
how much more he can take.

97
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:18,122
26 years old,
he's gonna die of a heart attack?

98
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:19,475
He's not gonna die, Ma.

99
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,660
Well, he will unless I do something.

100
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,736
Why don't you just let the doctors do
what they do?

101
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:30,151
I wish I knew what was going on
in there.

102
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,827
Just before he passed out,
he said he, uh...

103
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:35,418
He felt he was absorbing
too many powers.

104
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,077
Peter wanted to see that painting.

105
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:40,411
After I told you not to let him,

106
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:44,451
you knew he was gonna follow that thing
headfirst all the way to Texas.

107
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:45,880
He's my brother and I love him,

108
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,384
but we both know
he shouldn't have even been there.

109
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,796
It was important to him.

110
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:52,196
You really believe all this crap?

111
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,190
Future paintings?

112
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:58,348
- The end of the world?
- I know he believes it.

113
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:00,407
And I believe in him.

114
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:01,780
Fine.

115
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:02,935
Then show me.

116
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:07,209
I've been here for two weeks,
waiting for something to happen.

117
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,962
I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around
and watch my brother die.

118
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:12,257
Take me to the artist.

119
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:14,530
I want to see what's worth all this.

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,583
I love you, man.

121
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,535
There.

122
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,213
Okay, your first mistake?

123
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,320
Never put the peanut butter
in the refrigerator.

124
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,225
Mom always keeps it at room temperature.

125
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:36,284
Well, your dad's got his own style.

126
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:37,838
I see that.

127
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:39,567
It still tastes good.

128
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,315
What happened to you?

129
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:47,295
Did you get in a fight at school today?

130
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:48,452
It's nothing.

131
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:50,927
- Just some jerks.
- Well, what happened?

132
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:53,198
Dad, they called Mom a psycho killer.

133
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:57,725
I know, you can lecture me
about not fighting.

134
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,251
No, I...

135
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,990
I know how hard it is without her.

136
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,658
And I wish it could be easier.

137
00:09:09,724 --> 00:09:10,989
But we gonna make it.

138
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,710
You enjoy that.

139
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,359
I'll be back.

140
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,061
I believe you were expecting me?

141
00:09:30,478 --> 00:09:31,595
The name is Malski.

142
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:32,976
Aaron Malski.

143
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:35,470
I take it you have it here?

144
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,808
Have the charges against me
been dropped?

145
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,367
Your wife's confession
took care of most of that.

146
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:57,356
Her pointing out
where to find the bodies helped too.

147
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:58,878
As for the other charges,

148
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:01,751
consider yourself a free man,
Mr. Hawkins.

149
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,560
So no more looking over my shoulder?

150
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,031
Only if you wish
to see where you've been.

151
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,467
So that's it.

152
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:14,433
Linderman leaves me
and my family alone?

153
00:10:14,568 --> 00:10:16,465
Oh, I wouldn't bank on that, no.

154
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:17,781
That was the deal.

155
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,685
You got back your $2 million.

156
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,450
There is no deal, Mr. Hawkins,

157
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:23,889
unless Mr. Linderman says
there's a deal.

158
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,119
You took something of his.

159
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:29,595
And he reserves the right
to let you make that up to him.

160
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:30,892
Believe me.

161
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,846
You'll be the first to find out

162
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,023
when he chooses to call in that debt.

163
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:36,916
You have a nice day now.

164
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,530
I'm glad the Bureau
finally decided to take the list

165
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:10,681
I offered seriously.

166
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:13,211
Too many people
showing up dead or missing.

167
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:15,457
If you didn't have a record
showing you were in India

168
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:17,039
when some of these people were killed,

169
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,443
you and I would be having
a very different conversation.

170
00:12:19,444 --> 00:12:21,032
How fortunate for me, then.

171
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:23,606
You say, uh...

172
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,653
your father compiled this list?

173
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:27,124
Yes, he was a geneticist.

174
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:29,762
All the people on the list
share a unique genetic marker

175
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:33,102
that he was able to map and track
using the Human Genome Project.

176
00:12:34,406 --> 00:12:36,161
I've been trying to locate them.

177
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:37,377
To warn them.

178
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:39,438
About this man Sylar?

179
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,872
Yes, the man who killed my father.

180
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
I see.

181
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:47,555
Well, we ran the name.

182
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,135
Nothing.

183
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:51,913
Clearly an alias.

184
00:12:53,191 --> 00:12:57,073
But we did follow up on a--
another name you said was on the list.

185
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,653
Sarah Ellis?

186
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,053
Yes,
I tried to locate her in Los Angeles,

187
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,007
but she wasn't at any
of her known addresses,

188
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:05,008
and no, I've never met her before.

189
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,519
Are you sure?

190
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:13,991
That's Sarah Ellis?

191
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,304
I know her by a different name.

192
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:20,337
Eden McCain. She, uh--

193
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,859
Lives across the hall right there.

194
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:25,374
She's been gone for a few weeks.
Is there a problem?

195
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:27,149
She turned up three days ago.

196
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:30,612
Well...
what was left of her, anyway.

197
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:32,397
What?

198
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:35,456
Yeah, they pulled her out
of Lake Ramsey in Sudbury.

199
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:37,367
Hundred miles out of Ontario.

200
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:39,937
Gunshot wound to the head.

201
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:43,598
Local law wrote it up as a suicide.

202
00:13:50,185 --> 00:13:51,185
The, uh...

203
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:53,389
last I heard from her,

204
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,978
she said she had something
to confess to me.

205
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,646
You say she was your friend?

206
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,050
She--

207
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,589
I don't know what she was.

208
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:16,404
The guy who you were just talking to
has Sylar in this building.

209
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:17,512
- No, Parkman.
- Yes, he--

210
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,960
He doesn't.
There's nothing in here but paper.

211
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,211
But we didn't look everywhere.

212
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:22,754
Maybe-- maybe--

213
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,847
there's a secret room. Somewhere.

214
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:25,891
Okay? Maybe--

215
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,197
And maybe I can whistle
The Star-Spangled Banner out of my ass.

216
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:32,279
We are lucky he hasn't threatened
to sue us for this stunt.

217
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,515
You want to know
what's on this tape he just handed me?

218
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:36,732
You.

219
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:39,193
Caught on the parking lot
surveillance camera.

220
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,352
What, you didn't think
anyone would notice a guy

221
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,764
sitting in the same car
every day for two weeks?

222
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:48,499
Do you have any idea the position
you have put this Bureau in?

223
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,758
I was following a hunch.

224
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,799
Whose hunch?

225
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:52,061
My hunch?

226
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:53,430
The Bureau's hunch?

227
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,660
- Matt's hunch.
- He abducted people.

228
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,720
He abducted me!

229
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,322
He abducted Ted Sprague!

230
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:00,317
Sure, the guy
with the radioactive hands?

231
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:02,259
Well, it all makes perfect sense.

232
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:05,953
I am going to make sure
you are benched for this.

233
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
What, that's it?

234
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,211
Obviously.

235
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:16,768
We both know he's in here.

236
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:17,897
- I know--
- Do we?

237
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:20,869
Because all I know is that I have wasted
the last three weeks of my life

238
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,722
on the crazy idea
that you can hear people's thoughts.

239
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,781
I liked you, Matt.

240
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,286
I felt sorry for you.

241
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,735
And maybe that clouded my judgment.

242
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:30,590
But now I need to get back to reality.

243
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,179
And you should do the same.

244
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:34,837
Go home, Matt.

245
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:36,293
We're done.

246
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:46,108
Listen to me.

247
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:49,297
I have no idea
how you're pulling this off,

248
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,893
but I swear to God
I'm not gonna stop

249
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,093
until I figure it out,
you understand me?

250
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,530
Good luck with that.

251
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,129
Zach.

252
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:10,720
Hey, this is a public place.

253
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,437
Are you sure
you can be seen here with me?

254
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:13,534
Why not?

255
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:16,882
Right, I forgot.
You've been body-snatched.

256
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:18,780
Look, I just want to talk.

257
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:21,788
Hey, I'm sorry about Jackie.

258
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:23,909
I know she was your best friend and all.

259
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:29,471
No, I actually discovered
that someone else was my best friend.

260
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:30,961
But I lost him too.

261
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,278
What happened to you at Homecoming?

262
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:39,508
I can't remember.

263
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,067
Can't remember a lot of things lately.

264
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:43,991
Yeah, it's, uh...

265
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:48,765
That's funny, 'cause lately,
I can't remember...

266
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,884
- Must be something in the water, right?
- Zach, look at me.

267
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,239
Do you feel like we could be friends?

268
00:16:58,373 --> 00:16:59,396
Us?

269
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:04,586
We wouldn't play well together.

270
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,519
I gotta to tell you, Ms. Sanders,

271
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:13,317
the outbursts are not helping.

272
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:17,148
Kind of getting tired of them myself.

273
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:20,069
Look, I just want to do my time
in peace.

274
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:21,912
Yeah, about that...

275
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,569
it seems the D. A. is going to file

276
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,107
for special circumstances
in the homicides.

277
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,759
They're gonna seek the death penalty.

278
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:35,091
Death penalty?

279
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:37,084
Look, I know it's a long shot.

280
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:39,845
But it might help
if you cooperated a little.

281
00:17:40,201 --> 00:17:42,142
And how am I supposed to do that?

282
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:45,061
The $2 million,
things might go a little smoother

283
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:46,854
if you tell the police where it is.

284
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:48,085
I've told you.

285
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:51,875
I don't know anything about that.

286
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:57,875
Who are you trying to fool?

287
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,224
You know exactly where it is.

288
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,625
I'm sorry?

289
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:05,274
He's right, Niki.

290
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,210
We should tell them.

291
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,583
Stop it!

292
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:14,370
Don't pay any attention to her.

293
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:16,792
Pay attention to who?

294
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:19,335
God, who am I gonna have to screw
to get out of this place?

295
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:20,408
I said stop it!

296
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:24,265
What is this?

297
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,535
What's it look like, dipstick?

298
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,343
Wait, you're going psych on me?

299
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:30,975
If that's what it takes.

300
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:34,866
Multiple personality disorders
are a real hard sell.

301
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,682
When I want your opinion,
I will ask for it.

302
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,913
Just get us a damn shrink.

303
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,253
I'm not crazy. No, I'm not crazy.

304
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:51,835
Don't listen to her.

305
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:54,515
Please, I'm telling you the truth.

306
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,126
- Of course.
- Don't listen to her.

307
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,182
Listen to me, please.
-I'm not lying to you.

308
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:00,379
- Of course you're not.
- I'm telling you the truth!

309
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,025
Which way to

310
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:18,779
gift store?

311
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,317
Thank you.

312
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:08,790
Isaac was obsessed,

313
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,015
ranting about a bomb
coming to explode New York.

314
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,840
- The painting on the floor.
- Yeah, and he just left.

315
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:16,260
Someone came and took his paintings.

316
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:18,174
And I don't understand.

317
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,935
He's been gone a few weeks.

318
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:21,192
Then I came back.

319
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,207
I'm waiting for the shock to clear
so I can tell if you're glad to see me.

320
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,680
Well... I'm just going to, uh...

321
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,631
You look...

322
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,640
you look healthy.

323
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:51,062
I got back a few days ago.

324
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:53,065
I wasn't sure when to call you.

325
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,668
I was in a clinic.

326
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,333
I barely rember any of it,
but when I woke up,

327
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:05,644
I was in Texas.

328
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:07,215
And I was clean.

329
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:09,769
that's great.

330
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:11,878
I mean it.

331
00:23:13,886 --> 00:23:17,121
I don't need the drugs anymore,
I can paint without it.

332
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,485
Well, I'm glad for you.

333
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:22,271
I'm only alive because of you, Simone.

334
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:26,495
I still love you.

335
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,125
All right, uh, this painting...

336
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:35,567
that's-- it's like he's exploding.
Like he's-- like he's a bomb.

337
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,707
How did you know about this?

338
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:40,449
Did you talk to my brother Peter?

339
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:41,799
I painted what I saw.

340
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:47,082
The last thing Peter said
before he collapsed was that he...

341
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,369
was the cause of the explosion.

342
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,987
Look, I may not get everything.
That's fine, but this...

343
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,691
This-- these things can't be connected.

344
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,839
And the world doesn't work like this.

345
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:03,752
Bad news, sword not there.

346
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:04,851
It was replica.

347
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:07,553
Original owned by man named Linderman.

348
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:09,088
Did he say Linderman?

349
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:12,866
Flying Man!

350
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:24,440
Save the cheerleader, save the world.

351
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:28,103
What does that even mean?

352
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:32,265
Have I been saved,
or do I still need saving?

353
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:35,376
You're saved for the time being.

354
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,824
I wanna talk to Peter Petrelli.

355
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:43,352
You're not supposed to remember
Peter Petrelli.

356
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:44,474
He's being watched.

357
00:24:44,577 --> 00:24:47,389
If you try to contact him,
your father will know.

358
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,595
You have to give me something.

359
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:55,620
Nothing in my life has been real.

360
00:24:58,027 --> 00:25:00,909
My dad obviously doesn't work
in a paper factory.

361
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,184
I don't know what he does.

362
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,211
And what about my biological parents?

363
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,482
He didn't find them through
the adoption agency, did he?

364
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,339
They work for your father.
Like I do.

365
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:14,882
Everything has been a lie.

366
00:25:17,214 --> 00:25:19,120
The only person I could trust was Zach,

367
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:20,591
and you took him from me.

368
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:22,323
That was your father's doing.

369
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,631
- Not mine.
- Then give him back his memories.

370
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:28,940
I don't wanna be alone.

371
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:33,714
You are not alone, Claire.

372
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:38,265
And I cannot give your friend back
his memories.

373
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:40,094
It's not how my gift works.

374
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,795
Your gift?

375
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,434
That what you call it?

376
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:45,795
What do you call it?

377
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,869
My own private freak show.

378
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:54,775
What you can do,

379
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,507
what I can do,

380
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,742
that is God.

381
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:02,469
Respect it accordingly.

382
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:19,239
The bomb, it comes from the street.

383
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,945
Destroy everything,
everything turn into dust.

384
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,827
Your English is a lot better.

385
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:26,588
- I met a waitress in Texas.
- Oh, yeah?

386
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:28,902
She teach me many things.

387
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:30,888
Good for you.

388
00:26:32,554 --> 00:26:34,770
So, look, I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

389
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:38,169
You teleported here...

390
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:40,850
back from the future.

391
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:44,796
Yes, my power let me
come back here so I can stop it.

392
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:46,026
Right.

393
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,608
Because "you hero."

394
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:49,134
You will help too.

395
00:26:51,082 --> 00:26:52,082
Me?

396
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,196
- What makes you so sure?
- You're flying man.

397
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,327
Would you keep it down?

398
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:04,834
What do you think
it is that makes this bomb thing go off?

399
00:27:05,945 --> 00:27:08,145
Don't know... probably bad guy?

400
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:09,882
- Bad guy?
- Yes. Like villain.

401
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:11,348
- What's that?
- Villain.

402
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,115
- Villain?
- Villain.

403
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:14,702
- Villain.
- Vee.

404
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:16,312
- V.
- Vee-yun.

405
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,285
Like the guy in the painting?

406
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:26,427
You think a human being
can actually cause an explosion?

407
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,692
I have power, you have power.

408
00:27:31,513 --> 00:27:32,790
Maybe he has power too.

409
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,439
Bad guy.

410
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:35,498
We must stop him.

411
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:37,914
I think I can help.

412
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:23,459
We've been here before.

413
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,160
You, me, the video camera.

414
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,119
Is it at all familiar?

415
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:32,950
What are you doing, auditioning
for America's Next Top Model?

416
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:34,757
You made that joke the first time.

417
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:36,834
Look,

418
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:38,550
just keep the camera on me, okay?

419
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:40,319
Why don't you just use a tripod?

420
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,849
I can't do this by myself.

421
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:45,710
And I know you can keep a secret,
you did.

422
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:48,727
You did, until you forgot what it was.

423
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:52,104
When we were best friends.

424
00:28:53,237 --> 00:28:54,284
You ready?

425
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:55,917
Claire, hold on a second.

426
00:28:56,288 --> 00:28:58,648
I'm sure you told me this... before,

427
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:00,274
but, umh,

428
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:02,662
why are we videotaping this?

429
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:03,847
Whatever this is.

430
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:06,120
Actually, I didn't tell you that before.

431
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,816
The first time I did this
I did it to show my parents.

432
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:11,731
My real parents.

433
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:14,038
I wanted them to see what I was.

434
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,603
I thought
they could help me understand.

435
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,051
But I don't think
I'm ever gonna meet them.

436
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,626
They may not even be alive anymore.

437
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:25,569
So why do you wanna tape it now?

438
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
For me.

439
00:29:29,322 --> 00:29:30,857
So I never forget what I am.

440
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:32,964
No matter what happens to me.

441
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:38,615
Look, just don't freak out, okay?

442
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:41,074
I won't.

443
00:29:41,401 --> 00:29:42,845
You said that last time.

444
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,335
Camera's ready for whatever.

445
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,844
Okay, I'm ready.

446
00:29:54,998 --> 00:29:56,178
Keep the camera on me.

447
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:57,719
What are you doing?

448
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,261
Oh, my God.

449
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:03,234
Oh, my God-- Claire!

450
00:30:23,451 --> 00:30:24,892
This is Claire Bennett.

451
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:28,560
And as far as you know,
that was attempt number one.

452
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,996
I don't know
how much longer I'm gonna be here.

453
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:44,699
And what's that supposed to mean?

454
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:47,483
They're sending me to the psych ward,

455
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:50,624
for an evaluation with a shrink.

456
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:53,492
She's here.

457
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,451
She came out, she tried to escape,

458
00:30:58,452 --> 00:31:00,040
she hurt one of the guards.

459
00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:02,006
Maybe a shrink
can help you deal with her.

460
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,155
Get rid of her.

461
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:04,855
This isn't in my head, D. L.

462
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:06,526
She is real.

463
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,682
I should've never let you do this, Nik,

464
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,313
get yourself thrown in here.

465
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:20,319
I shoulda kept that money
to help you out.

466
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:25,677
You had to give it back,
or else this would never be over.

467
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,571
Let me talk to Micah.

468
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,048
I want you to come home.

469
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,204
I know, sweetie.

470
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,905
But I can't.

471
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,155
It's hard to understand right now.

472
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,960
But I hope that one day you will.

473
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:03,063
Y- your daddy, he's gonna take
real good care of you while I'm gone.

474
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:15,951
I need you to be the strong one
because I'm not strong right now, okay?

475
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,088
Mom, that's not fair.

476
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,158
That's my son.

477
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:25,542
Can I just give him a hug?

478
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:29,994
- Just for a second, I promise.
- Baby, it's okay.

479
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:31,261
It's all right.

480
00:32:32,457 --> 00:32:33,613
No, he needs me.

481
00:32:35,198 --> 00:32:36,209
He needs me.

482
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:38,780
Just let me hold him.

483
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:40,246
- Stay right there
- He needs me.

484
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:42,373
- I said stay there!
- Please.

485
00:32:42,624 --> 00:32:43,671
I'm warning you.

486
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:46,210
Please. Just for a moment.

487
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,614
I just wanted to see my son.

488
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:15,976
I don't even know what she fed you.

489
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:19,693
They eat crickets.

490
00:33:20,586 --> 00:33:21,592
Lots of crickets.

491
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:24,830
You.

492
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:26,696
Hope you don't mind, I let myself in.

493
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,421
Have you come to kill me now?

494
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:31,726
That depends.

495
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:35,823
I'd like to talk to you about Eden.

496
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:38,200
She worked for me.

497
00:33:38,412 --> 00:33:39,540
Don't you mean Sarah Ellis?

498
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:41,919
She gave up that name
and that life a long time ago.

499
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:43,184
And she was a good person.

500
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,282
Yes, of course,
all spies are very good people.

501
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:46,444
Just misunderstood.

502
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:48,876
She cared about you
more than she should've.

503
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:50,569
She was..

504
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:53,610
- ... special.
- She had an ability?

505
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:54,906
What was it?

506
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,751
Suffice it to say,
she learned how to use it wisely.

507
00:33:57,752 --> 00:34:00,624
Not everyone who has these abilities
deserves them.

508
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:03,174
And who are you to judge?
In fact, who are you, period?

509
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,178
I made a mistake.

510
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:09,379
- I should've come to you before.
- You've been spying on me for weeks.

511
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,482
In India, my cab, bugging my phone.

512
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,834
We need to help each other, Dr. Suresh.

513
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:15,581
And why would I help you?

514
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:22,639
You need me, don't you?

515
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,706
My father, he knew more than you do.

516
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:26,415
From what we could observe, yes.

517
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:29,158
If you've been watching, you know
my father's formula doesn't work.

518
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,394
We both know that he generated a list.

519
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:33,964
Who's on that list
is a matter of grave importance.

520
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:36,161
You've come for it?
You want to find them?

521
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,961
Why do you seem so worried?

522
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,196
Are you on the list?

523
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:44,680
You've no doubt realized things can go
terribly wrong with these abilities.

524
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:47,304
If you work with me,
we can control that.

525
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,869
If and when I do figure out this list,

526
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:52,994
the first thing I'm going to do
is warn these people.

527
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:53,995
About you.

528
00:34:55,246 --> 00:34:57,951
Together, we could actually
make a difference.

529
00:34:57,952 --> 00:34:59,524
Sorry, not interested.

530
00:35:12,864 --> 00:35:14,980
Contact me when you change your mind.

531
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:20,817
The access number's on the back.

532
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:46,090
Are you back?

533
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:48,753
Yeah.

534
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,942
I took out that suitcase this morning.

535
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:55,816
But I haven't packed it yet.

536
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:12,229
I know that we're in trouble.

537
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:15,385
And I know that a lot of it is my--

538
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,182
most of it is my fault

539
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:21,087
Janice, we-- we need to start
being completely honest with each other,

540
00:36:21,088 --> 00:36:22,690
come clean about everything.

541
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:23,691
Okay.

542
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,076
'Cause there's something I gotta
tell you, something has happened to me.

543
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:31,397
... really hard to explain.

544
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:32,444
Just say it.

545
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,663
I can hear people's thoughts.

546
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:37,759
Meaning what?

547
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,259
I hear their thoughts.

548
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,661
What they're thinking.

549
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:45,546
It started a few weeks ago.

550
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,648
That's why I've been with the FBI
all this time.

551
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:48,776
What do you mean?

552
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:51,084
Like, a psychic or something?

553
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:52,085
I don't know.

554
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
I guess.

555
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:57,474
You can't be serious.

556
00:36:57,475 --> 00:36:58,477
Yeah.

557
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:03,392
You don't believe me.
Okay, that's all right.

558
00:37:03,393 --> 00:37:05,156
Here, come here.

559
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:09,595
All right.

560
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:14,804
Pick a number between one...
and a million.

561
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,039
Come on, bring it on.

562
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:27,193
I took his power, Nathan.

563
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,589
I can't control it!

564
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:30,923
Let me help you, Peter.

565
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:33,323
You can't!

566
00:38:34,023 --> 00:38:35,199
I'm not leaving you.

567
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:06,275
Ma?

568
00:39:07,223 --> 00:39:08,822
- Where is he?
- I have no idea.

569
00:39:08,823 --> 00:39:10,459
- He woke up.
- He woke up?

570
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:12,026
Yes. He was raving.

571
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:15,446
After two weeks spent
sitting at his bedside,

572
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,829
thinking he could die,
he says he's gotta get away.

573
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:19,906
You just let him leave?

574
00:39:19,907 --> 00:39:23,878
No, I just did not let him leave
and when I see him, I will kill him.

575
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,020
Mom...all right, look.
Just go home, okay?

576
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,650
Get some rest.

577
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:30,836
I'll take care of it.

578
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:35,613
You're really Hiro Nakamura
from Isaac's comic book?

579
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:39,170
I worked there, at Yamagato,

580
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:44,518
We fly here,
and we drive that car everywhere.

581
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:45,939
Blue Nissan Versa.

582
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:48,016
It's parked outside right now.

583
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:52,070
I'm just like Mr. Isaac draw me,
except my face not so round.

584
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:56,852
Okay, yeah. I give up.

585
00:39:57,026 --> 00:39:59,995
The world is insane,
I'm not gonna keep fighting it.

586
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:01,608
You can paint the future!

587
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:04,006
And he needs a sword.

588
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:05,878
This guy Linderman?
He's a client of mine.

589
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:09,283
Huge collector. He buys
every painting of Isaac's he can.

590
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:10,815
I can get you in there.

591
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:13,886
Get your car,
you're going back to Vegas.

592
00:40:15,769 --> 00:40:19,463
I need the, uh, first flight
out of New York into the desert.

593
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:23,132
I don't know. Nevada, maybe?

594
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:28,753
That's where they did
all those nuclear bomb tests, right?

595
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:29,801
Okay.

596
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:32,387
Yeah, Las Vegas. Las Vegas is good.

597
00:40:32,654 --> 00:40:33,697
Yeah, whatever.

598
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:39,261
Yeah, I'll hold.

599
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:05,057
What are you do-- hey!

600
00:41:08,063 --> 00:41:09,063
You can see me!

601
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:10,317
You--

602
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,108
Nobody sees me!

603
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:14,691
Do ya hear me?

604
00:41:16,846 --> 00:41:18,657
Nobody sees me! I'm invisible!

605
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:28,629
<i>In the beginning, there was discovery.</i>

606
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:30,914
<i>A confusion of elements,</i>

607
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,553
<i>the first snowfall of impossible change.</i>

608
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:39,658
<i>Old lives undone, left behind.</i>

609
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:46,627
<i>Strange faces made familiar...</i>

610
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,200
<i>new nightmares to challenge sleep.</i>

611
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,115
<i>New friends to feel safe with.</i>

612
00:41:58,137 --> 00:42:00,064
<i>Only then comes control.</i>

613
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,625
<i>The need to impose order onto chaos,</i>

614
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,601
<i>through determination,</i>

615
00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:06,602
<i>through study,</i>

616
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:07,851
<i>through struggle...</i>

617
00:42:07,852 --> 00:42:09,028
She's gonna be okay.

618
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:11,400
You know that, right?

619
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,500
You'd tell me the truth, right?

620
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,525
<i>... all in defiance
of a thundering truth.</i>

621
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:21,781
<i>They're here.</i>

622
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,800
<i>And the earth shudders underfoot.</i>

623
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,243
Oh, God...

624
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,039
Lights out.

625
00:42:29,143 --> 00:42:30,298
Please help me.

626
00:42:36,245 --> 00:42:38,245
Who needs God when you've got me?
