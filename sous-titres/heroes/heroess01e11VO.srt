00:00:00,423 --> 00:00:02,172
<i>Previously on Heroes...</i>

2
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:04,321
<i>Ordinary people across the globe,</i>

3
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:07,104
<i>discovered extraordinary abilities.</i>

4
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:10,145
<i>Niki's alter ego, sought revenge...</i>

5
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:11,594
Must really hate the guy.

6
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:12,792
He took my son.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,228
<i>... until the ultimate retribution.</i>

8
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:18,381
<i>Peter set out on his mission...</i>

9
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:20,993
I know when, and I know
where the cheerleader gets attacked.

10
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:22,296
I have to stop him.

11
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:23,910
<i>... to save the cheerleader.</i>

12
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:32,044
By saving you, did I save the world?

13
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:33,413
I don't know.

14
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:35,115
I'm just a cheerleader.

15
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,146
<i>But he was taken by the police...</i>

16
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,555
Put your hands on your head!

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,058
It's not what you think, guys!

18
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:41,397
What are you doing?

19
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,886
<i>... and Sylar was finally captured.</i>

20
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:45,330
You don't want to hurt me.

21
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:46,574
Go to sleep.

22
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,971
<i>And Claire revealed a secret
that will change her life.</i>

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,461
You're lucky to be alive.

24
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,983
It's not luck, Dad.

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,437
I have something I have to tell you.

26
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:59,290
<i>And now, Heroes continues...</i>

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,935
Are you mad at me?

28
00:01:16,313 --> 00:01:18,990
You haven't said anything
since we got in the car.

29
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:20,292
Since I told you.

30
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,582
No, no, no, I just...

31
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,215
I've just been thinking.

32
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,979
I have something I need to tell you.

33
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,419
It's not fair
to keep it from you any longer.

34
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:38,893
What you can do...

35
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,652
I've known about you, Claire.

36
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:48,864
I knew before you knew.
Before you made those tapes with Zach.

37
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:50,509
You saw the tape?

38
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:53,998
Why didn't you say anything?

39
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:55,324
There are a lot of reasons,

40
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,113
but mostly,
I just wanted to protect you.

41
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,297
Protect me? All this time, I've...

42
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:03,936
felt so alone, and like
some sort of freak. And you knew?

43
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:06,132
I've worked very hard
I've done some things

44
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,549
that I am not proud of to keep you safe.

45
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,618
What kinds of things?

46
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:17,175
I just wanted you to have a normal life.

47
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,756
Jackie died because of me.

48
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:24,598
He thought she was me, didn't he?

49
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,508
That man is taken care of.

50
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,154
I promise you.

51
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:32,543
You and mom knew all this time?

52
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:34,746
Your mother doesn't know.

53
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:36,989
Neither does your brother.

54
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,191
Actually, Lyle kind of found out.

55
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:41,671
Really?

56
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:43,128
Did anybody else?

57
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:45,109
Just Zach.

58
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:47,602
Nobody else can know.

59
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:49,547
It's the only way to keep you safe.

60
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,390
That man who tried to kill you,

61
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,479
there are others out there like him.

62
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:56,401
Who want what you have
and will hurt you to get it.

63
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,590
That's why we can't tell your mother.
We can't tell anybody.

64
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:01,322
Do you understand?

65
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:07,730
I'm gonna pick Lyle up from practice,
and I'll talk to him.

66
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:08,799
You talk to Zach.

67
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,419
Any other tapes you've made...

68
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:12,607
I need you to destroy them.

69
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:20,349
The victim was a student:
Jacqueline Wilcox.

70
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:23,397
And the crime scene fits Sylar's M.O.

71
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,887
He took her brain?

72
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,715
No, the incision in her skull
said he wanted to,

73
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:28,883
but somebody got in his way.

74
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:32,321
They have a suspect in custody,
a hospice nurse from New York.

75
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,057
And you think he might be Sylar?

76
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:36,087
I think this is.

77
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:39,146
Judging by the blood patterns,

78
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:42,021
I'd say he stopped here
to catch his breath, and then just...

79
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,148
- disappeared. - You know what?

80
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,359
Maybe he didn't.

81
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,209
Look at this.

82
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:51,993
The tread pattern's totally different.
These are two new sets of footprints.

83
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,958
That's the fourth handful
of those you knocked down since...

84
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,959
I have headaches!

85
00:03:58,898 --> 00:04:00,521
It's the whole Janice thing, it's...

86
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:01,770
She slipped out, Parkman.

87
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:03,382
And it sucks, but it happens.

88
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,522
- You've never cheated on her? - No.

89
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:08,770
You don't believe me.

90
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,208
Well, statistically speaking,

91
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,897
law enforcement attracts
a certain kind of male personality.

92
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:14,710
Oh, what personality would that be?

93
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:15,711
Dogs.

94
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,400
And the female personality?

95
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:18,836
Bitches.

96
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:20,799
We keep it in the canine family.

97
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,394
Okay, so two new sets of footprints.

98
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:26,328
- You think Sylar had accomplices?
- With the amount of blood he lost,

99
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,525
there's no way he got out of here
by himself.

100
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:30,139
So I guess we'll ask this...

101
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,419
Peter Petrelli.

102
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:46,397
Nathan.

103
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,686
What are you... What are you doing here?

104
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,555
You get in trouble,
I drop everything and fix it.

105
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,334
Isn't that how things work?

106
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,457
- Get you out of here soon.
- What, no lecture?

107
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,422
I'm just glad you're alive, man.

108
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,455
Why did you destroy that painting?

109
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:04,286
Why did you try to keep me
from coming here?

110
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:06,143
The painting showed you dead, Peter.

111
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:09,163
When I got the phone call,
I nearly believed it for a minute.

112
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:10,750
Yeah, I thought I'd be a hero.

113
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,176
How'd that work out for you?

114
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,312
Save the cheerleader, save the world.

115
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,169
You're meant to do a lot of things,
Peter.

116
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,511
Saving the world isn't one of them.

117
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:26,067
You gotta learn to recognize
when life is bigger than you are.

118
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:29,389
You're not a fighter. But that's okay,
the world needs nurses too.

119
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,791
When I'm around you,
I can do what you can do.

120
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:37,497
Isaac, Hiro Nakamura, this girl Claire.

121
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:40,781
See, I think
that we're all the same somehow.

122
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:42,904
And this bomb that Isaac painted,

123
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,594
I think we're supposed to stop it.

124
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,812
But I just...

125
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,435
I don't think I can do it.

126
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:54,900
That's because you can't.

127
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:58,586
How can you stop what's coming?

128
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,541
When you don't know
anything about power?

130
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,480
- Micah! - Dad!

131
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:33,737
Stay down!

132
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,165
What are you looking at?

133
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:16,673
Anything?

134
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:17,951
He slept through the night.

135
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:27,988
I got this.

136
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,194
You lost a lot of blood.

137
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,437
We sewed you up the best we could.

138
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,732
Turns out
you're not so untouchable after all.

139
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:56,951
No,
you'll find your abilities won't work.

140
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,184
Not here.

141
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:01,515
You're not going anywhere, Gabriel.

142
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,945
My name is Sylar.

143
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,110
Now it is.

144
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:06,811
Wasn't so long ago
that you were Gabriel Gray.

145
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:09,833
An insignificant watchmaker.

146
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,528
I restored timepieces.

147
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,700
Do you know why I was so good at it?

148
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:19,430
No, why don't you tell me?

149
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,686
Because I can see how things work.

150
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:26,014
What makes things... tick.

151
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,049
Like you.

152
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,673
We're interested
in how things work as well.

153
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:35,199
Everyone else we've...
met has had only one ability.

154
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:37,200
You've taken on several.

155
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,298
I guess that's what makes me special.

156
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:40,922
That's important to you, isn't it?

157
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:41,923
Being special.

158
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,738
It's important to everyone.

159
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,022
I think you're insane.

160
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,339
I think the infusion
of so many alterations to your DNA

161
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:49,610
has corrupted your mind.

162
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,587
All this power is degrading you.

163
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,049
And yet here I am, alive and well,

164
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,110
and as soon as I get out,

165
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:58,111
I'm gonna collect one more ability
from your daughter.

166
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,119
Sweet, innocent.

167
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,469
- That's enough. - Ripe, indestructible.

168
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:05,734
I said that's enough, Gabriel.

169
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,543
My name is Sylar!

170
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:19,923
Options?

171
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,924
There are no options
with someone like this.

172
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:23,925
Maybe I didn't make the risk clear...

173
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,109
Understood.

174
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,110
Of course.

175
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,235
Is it true?

176
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,174
You have to be more specific.

177
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:33,236
I've got more
than one house on fire at the moment.

178
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,664
We're keeping him alive.

179
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:36,652
Those are our marching orders.

180
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:39,391
Think about
what he almost did to Claire.

181
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,882
I could tell him to kill himself.

182
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,495
No one would have to know.

183
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:59,738
I don't have time for this. Not today.

184
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:01,418
You know I'm right!

185
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,612
I know I'm right, and if that...

186
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:06,390
that Haitian could speak,
he'd tell you I'm right!

187
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,925
Micah, take that.

188
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,293
Walk back the way you came.

189
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:32,481
In the footsteps.

190
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,301
Oh, like the Indians.

191
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,856
Just like the Indians, son.

192
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:40,886
That wasn't the police.

193
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:42,467
You don't know that.

194
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:45,213
Dad, they've gotta warn you
before they shoot.

195
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:46,357
It's a rule.

196
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,607
The police don't always
follow the rules, son. Trust me.

197
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,552
Give me a hand.

198
00:10:57,706 --> 00:10:58,928
Right here.

199
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:41,185
Dad, are you gonna be okay?

200
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,361
I'm gonna be as good as new.

201
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,509
I just need you to help me
with these bandages.

202
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:48,807
You can do that, right?

203
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,403
It was her, wasn't it?

204
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:56,995
It was Jessica.

205
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:01,105
It sure looked like your mom.

206
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Mom would never hurt you on purpose.

207
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:08,030
She just did, Micah.

208
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,149
A couple inches to the left...

209
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,193
and...

210
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:17,618
Dad?

211
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:18,743
Dad, wake up!

212
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:20,880
Dad, you need to wake up!

213
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,923
Your brother's pretty well connected.

214
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,369
Even down here.

215
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,868
We had to climb over six lawyers
to get to you, Mr. Petrelli.

216
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:32,743
Are you okay?

217
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:35,144
My head feels like
it's gonna split open.

218
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:37,056
Help yourself.

219
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:41,590
- I didn't kill that girl.
- We know.

220
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,554
The blood we found on you was your own.

221
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,185
We checked you out,
and you don't seem to have any injuries.

222
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:47,536
Care to explain that?

223
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:52,243
If I'm not being charged, can I go?

224
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:53,800
What's a hospice nurse from Manhattan

225
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,943
doing at a high school homecoming
in Texas?

226
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,446
You some kind of pervert?

227
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,235
My brother said not to talk.

228
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,186
We don't need you to talk.

229
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,383
What are you doing to me?

230
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:30,399
"Save the cheerleader"?

231
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
<i>Too late for that.</i>

232
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:32,929
<i>The cheerleader's dead.</i>

233
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:34,901
Claire's dead?

234
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:36,859
No, that's not possible.

235
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,517
<i>Did he just read her mind?</i>

236
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:39,922
<i>Is he one of them?</i>

237
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:42,698
The cheerleader's name
was Jackie Wilcox.

238
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:45,353
- What the hell is going on?
- Claire is the one that he wanted.

239
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:46,461
You're not protecting her?

240
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:47,880
Why would you know who he wanted?

241
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,247
You wanna catch this guy?

242
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,278
You need to find her.
You need to protect her!

243
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,161
He's telling the truth.

244
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,755
Then we better find this cheerleader.

245
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,572
You're not gonna let me out of here?

246
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,295
You get out when I get answers.

247
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:26,786
I faxed the list to your Quantico office
yesterday.

248
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:29,113
Names, addresses.
Why didn't you warn them?

249
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:33,000
Looking into it? At least six
of the people on this list are dead,

250
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,801
all of them from the same killer.

251
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:38,472
James Walker in Los Angeles
was killed nine days ago.

252
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:40,725
Charlene Andrews two days ago,
Midland, Texas.

253
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,003
Doesn't this mean anything
to you people?

254
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:46,101
Well, do you really want
to take that chance?

255
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:49,454
Fine, I won't. Never mind.

256
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:06,632
You're sketching.

257
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:09,321
I am.

258
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:11,569
And you're sober.

259
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:13,693
The locks on the door help.

260
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:16,317
Anything interesting?

261
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,040
Nothing predictive,
if that's what you're asking.

262
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:21,658
I don't think I can do it clean.

263
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:23,754
You'll get there.

264
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:26,921
To be honest, it's nice to be drawing
just to draw again.

265
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,505
That's what I liked about comics.

266
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,443
You don't have to take them
too seriously.

267
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:31,999
Good guys catching bad guys?

268
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:34,936
Which reminds me...

269
00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:36,696
Claire.

270
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:38,198
The cheerleader...

271
00:15:38,882 --> 00:15:39,882
She's alive.

272
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,432
Peter? He saved her?

273
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:46,416
No, you did. With your gift.
I mean, thanks to you.

274
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,590
Sylar won't be able
to hurt anybody anymore.

275
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:51,819
This means we can change the future.

276
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:53,607
Maybe stop that bomb.

277
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:56,145
Well, I wish you the best of luck.

278
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,879
What?

279
00:15:58,317 --> 00:15:59,317
Where you going?

280
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:00,742
Off the reservation.

281
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,005
You're leaving?

282
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,630
Well, what good is painting the future

283
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,853
if no one will do anything to change it?

284
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:15,256
So change it.

285
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,035
<i>- Yes?</i>
- This is Isaac Mendez.

286
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:30,200
Mr. Isaac?

287
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,695
Hiro... we need to meet.

288
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,731
And then he grabbed her and...

289
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,304
I tried to save her, but...

290
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:45,749
he was killing her, and...

291
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:51,107
she told me to run, so I ran.

292
00:17:53,744 --> 00:17:54,910
I left her and I ran.

293
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:58,409
I'm sorry, Claire.
I know you've been through a lot.

294
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,263
I just have a few more questions.

295
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:05,206
This man... did he exhibit anything
out of the ordinary?

296
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:13,062
You mean besides killing my friend?

297
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,697
No, like being able to fall five stories
and walk away without a scratch.

298
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,807
What?

299
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,805
Well, you said Peter Petrelli tackled
the man who killed Jackie,

300
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,495
and they both fell over the ledge.

301
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:25,940
That's a pretty long fall.

302
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:32,732
Is Peter okay?

303
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:34,877
He survived... without a scratch.

304
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,936
- How do you think he did that?
- All I know is he saved my life.

305
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:42,468
He's a very lucky guy.

306
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:45,632
You didn't seem
to get hurt at all, either.

307
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:48,943
Guess I'm lucky too.

308
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,680
We found some of your blood
at the crime scene.

309
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:53,968
Look, I've told you
everything I know, okay?

310
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:56,340
Do you have what you need, Agent Hanson?

311
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:01,118
Yes... of course.

312
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:03,729
Thank you both very much for your time.

313
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:05,940
Wait, can I talk to Peter?

314
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:11,228
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

315
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:14,598
I just want you to know that we're doing
everything in our power to

316
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:15,985
to get this guy.

317
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:18,440
Well, I appreciate that, Mr...

318
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:20,055
Parkman.

319
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,318
Officer Matt Parkman.

320
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,118
I really appreciate that,
Officer Parkman. Thank you.

321
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,804
You don't have to be a mind reader
to know she's hiding something.

322
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:35,805
What is it?

323
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,029
I didn't get anything.

324
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:41,855
I mean, I... there was this distinct...
absence of sound.

325
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,030
You mean silence?

326
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:46,133
No, it was more like
a static interfering with my...

327
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,126
- Whatever the hell this thing is.
- That's a new one.

328
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,926
It's not, actually.
I've heard this before.

329
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:52,367
Once, when I went to that bar.

330
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,381
It's the last thing that I heard,

331
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:56,384
or didn't hear, before I lost a day.

332
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:33,931
D.L.

333
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,143
Did she...

334
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:41,368
Did I...

335
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,555
Get up!

336
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:52,180
What did you do?

337
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:54,564
What I had to do to get Micah back.

338
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:58,718
If you cared about Micah,
you wouldn't have taken those shots.

339
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:00,028
You could have missed.

340
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:01,245
I don't miss.

341
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,110
You saw D.L.'s jacket.

342
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,843
D.L.'s Micah's father.

343
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,675
D.L. is a criminal.

344
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,703
He brought danger into our home.

345
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:10,993
You want Micah to end up like that?

346
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:12,271
You're wrong about him.

347
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,216
You're out of control.

348
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:17,417
What do you know about control, Niki?

349
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,744
You're part of me.

350
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,451
You do what I say.

351
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,439
It doesn't work like that.

352
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:25,804
Not anymore.

353
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:27,082
Why are you doing this?

354
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,203
Because you're not strong enough.

355
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:30,302
Mom!

356
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:32,178
Micah!

357
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:33,564
Mom, is that you?

358
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:35,616
Coming!

359
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:46,116
You're okay.

360
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:47,763
Thanks to you.

361
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:50,441
Mr. Petrelli, I'm Claire's father.

362
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,550
Hi.

363
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:53,191
You saved my little girl.

364
00:21:53,804 --> 00:21:54,804
I owe you my life.

365
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,281
I was just in the right place.

366
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:02,394
Maybe one day I'll be in the right place
and can return the favor.

367
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:06,426
Are you feeling all right?

368
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:07,427
Yeah.

369
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:08,615
Fine.

370
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:11,480
Hey, Dad can you wait outside?

371
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:15,928
Of course.

372
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,259
How long have you known?

373
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:29,865
Known what?

374
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:32,475
That you're like me.

375
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:37,014
- You would have died if you couldn't...
- Wait, do you...

376
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:42,241
Do you heal?

377
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:43,994
Is that it?

378
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:48,630
All this time, I thought it was just me.

379
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:50,867
Now there's you.

380
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:54,570
Is that why you came for me?
Is that why you...

381
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,074
asked me if I was the one?

382
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,212
No, I just... I knew I had to save you.

383
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:01,452
Why?

384
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:03,575
To save the world.

385
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:07,325
What do I have to do with the world?

386
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:08,577
I don't know.

387
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:10,324
Yet.

388
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,602
I do know that I don't think
I would be here if it wasn't for you.

389
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,762
I think I died.

390
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:21,764
I've died before.

391
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:23,823
It's no big deal.

392
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:29,024
I'm not like you, Claire.

393
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:33,625
This, uh...

394
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:37,292
This healing thing
is kind of new for me.

395
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:39,387
Wait... you didn't know
you were gonna heal

396
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:40,967
when you jumped off the building?

397
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,218
That's kinda stupid, huh?

398
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:49,518
No, it's not.

399
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:00,253
You're totally my hero.

400
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:13,552
Mom? Mom, is that you?

401
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:18,832
Dad's hurt.

402
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,372
Where is he?

403
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:22,895
In there. He's bleeding... bad.

404
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,206
Stop fighting!

405
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,740
- Stop fighting!
- It's for your own good!

406
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,391
Are you okay, son?

407
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:55,570
Stay away from him!

408
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,497
It's me, baby.

409
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:06,547
Mom, is that you?

410
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
It's me.

411
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,576
I am so sorry.

412
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:32,826
I'm so sorry.

413
00:25:44,773 --> 00:25:46,139
So what have people been saying?

414
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,265
Well, the official word is that somebody
got killed in the high school.

415
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:51,226
But everybody knows it's Jackie.

416
00:25:51,264 --> 00:25:53,641
I got, like,
four text messages this morning.

417
00:25:53,827 --> 00:25:55,160
Did you bring the tapes?

418
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:56,265
Oh, yeah

419
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:59,535
There wasn't that much to bring--

420
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:05,075
That's pretty destroyed, right?

421
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:07,892
Yeah,
I don't think they're gonna play again.

422
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:10,614
Look...I feel really bad.

423
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,291
About pushing you to go
to homecoming last night. I'm sorry.

424
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:15,792
You shouldn't feel bad.

425
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,826
You did it because you're my friend.

426
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:21,617
Probably the best friend I've ever had.

427
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:23,486
I've only been your friend
for two weeks.

428
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:25,632
Hey, I didn't say it wasn't pathetic.

429
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:30,016
- You know, you could have been killed.
- I know.

430
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:33,396
Look, I gotta go.

431
00:26:33,546 --> 00:26:34,914
My dad just wanted to...

432
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:37,924
make sure that you weren't gonna say
anything to anyone.

433
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:39,032
Of course.

434
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:40,554
Cross my heart.

435
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:41,865
Thanks, Zach.

436
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,093
Hiro Nakamura, I presume.

437
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Mr. Isaac?

438
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,907
This hasn't even gone
to the printer yet.

439
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,327
It's--it's incredible.

440
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:15,677
You really went to the future.

441
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:19,761
Jumping through time, I mean--

442
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:20,849
and space.

443
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:23,134
Your power very strong too.

444
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,125
I'm not so sure about that.

445
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:28,891
I can only do it when I'm chasing.

446
00:27:30,637 --> 00:27:31,637
Stoned.

447
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:33,073
On drugs.

448
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,571
What else did you see there... then?

449
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:39,947
I saw the bomb.

450
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:43,577
It exploded the city
and destroyed many things.

451
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,522
And I saw you.

452
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,130
What about me?

453
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,034
I saw you on the floor.

454
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:54,567
You were dead.

455
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:57,456
With your head...cut...off.

456
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:05,653
The man who cuts off heads...

457
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:07,237
he's taken care of.

458
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:14,590
- He's caught?- That is very good news.

459
00:28:14,748 --> 00:28:15,998
Hiro lost a friend.

460
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:17,830
The brain man killed her.

461
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,193
Wait a minute.

462
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:28,885
I painted this two days ago...sober.

463
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:30,557
Is this your friend?

464
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:31,694
Yes.

465
00:28:32,882 --> 00:28:33,882
I did it.

466
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:36,971
You say your mission
is to stop the bomb.

467
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:37,944
In New York.

468
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:40,107
Yes, uh...our destiny.

469
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:41,744
I think it may be mine too.

470
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,714
I painted that mural on my floor.

471
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:49,325
And very recently,
I painted a picture of...

472
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:54,041
a man exploding.

473
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,027
How do you stop an exploding man?

474
00:28:58,892 --> 00:28:59,007
Mom!

475
00:28:59,065 --> 00:28:59,200
Dad!

476
00:28:59,229 --> 00:28:59,421
Mom's at the store.

477
00:28:59,479 --> 00:28:59,672
I don't know where Dad is.

478
00:28:59,710 --> 00:28:59,941
Did Dad talk to you?

479
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,192
About what?

480
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:00,423
About me.

481
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:00,673
He knows.

482
00:29:00,712 --> 00:29:00,847
And he knows that you know.

483
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:01,078
My thing.

484
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:01,251
That I can't get hurt.

485
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,310
That didn't hurt?

486
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:04,972
Lyle, I'm serious.

487
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,600
Now tell me what Dad said to you.

488
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:10,142
I haven't seen Dad all day.

489
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:12,202
He was supposed
to pick you up from practice.

490
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:13,329
Well, he didn't.

491
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,215
Well, how'd you get home?

492
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,890
Lyle.

493
00:29:20,141 --> 00:29:21,307
How did you get home?

494
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:27,571
I don't remember.

495
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:33,442
I can get you some help, Nik.

496
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:34,880
You don't understand.

497
00:29:34,894 --> 00:29:37,858
There are doctors
that can help with situations like this.

498
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:40,150
D, she's stronger than me.

499
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:42,013
I don't believe that for a second.

500
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:43,725
You've seen what she can do!

501
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:46,408
How do you explain that?

502
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:49,393
There are a lot of things
that I can't explain.

503
00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:51,851
Like why you shot me.

504
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,444
Jessica shot you.

505
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:57,167
And she's gonna come back
and take Micah.

506
00:29:58,077 --> 00:29:59,305
She's out of control.

507
00:29:59,371 --> 00:30:01,403
She could really hurt him, even...

508
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,434
I can't be trusted.

509
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:08,953
Nik...

510
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:16,789
You all right?

511
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:18,366
Yeah, I'm okay.

512
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:19,564
Come on.

513
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,368
Gonna get you to a hotel.

514
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:23,489
We gonna get you cleaned up, all right?

515
00:30:23,602 --> 00:30:26,137
Niki, we're gonna go to a hotel...

516
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:36,949
Can I help you, ma'am?

517
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,312
Yeah, you can arrest me.

518
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:41,249
Arrest you? For what?

519
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:43,481
Murder.

520
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:52,648
Really, Parkman.

521
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:55,617
Since when does absence of noise
warrant a stakeout?

522
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:58,380
You always say
I don't take you anywhere.

523
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:00,543
Well,
you sure know how to spoil a girl.

524
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:01,729
Eat your tex-mex.

525
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,484
<i>Gotta say, he can be cute.</i>

526
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:07,762
<i>Oh, God, did he just hear that?</i>

527
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,577
Did you just read my mind?

528
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,523
You can't do that.

529
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,228
It was a stray thought, I--

530
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:16,248
You can't do that.

531
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,405
You really think I'm cute?

532
00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:21,395
I really think you're married.

533
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:23,865
And I really think you love your wife.

534
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:24,964
I do.

535
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:26,983
Then why haven't you called
to yell at her,

536
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:28,180
so you can go home already?

537
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:30,027
That's what you want, isn't it?

538
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,322
I don't wanna be a chump.

539
00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:35,166
So still loving your wife
after she has sex with someone else

540
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,088
- makes you a chump? - Doesn't it?

541
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:38,289
Grow up, Parkman.

542
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,365
If you want your marriage to work,
you have to find a way to make it work.

543
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:43,233
Otherwise, you are kind of a chump.

544
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:46,560
Cheerleader's dad, 9:00.

545
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:52,045
That guy that's with him.
I know that guy.

546
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:53,165
From where?

547
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:54,340
He was at the bar...

548
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,665
the night I first heard that static.

549
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:00,950
But how do you know?
I thought you lost that whole day.

550
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,025
Matt, maybe we should get out of here.

551
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,692
Hold it,
I'm just trying to get... something.

552
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,401
I was only able to get one word.

553
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:29,402
What?

554
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:30,779
Sylar.

555
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:40,545
All right, Claire, I'm here.
What's the emergency?

556
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:42,601
Something's going on.

557
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:46,633
It's like The Stepford Body Snatchers
or something.

558
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:49,330
My brother doesn't remember anything.

559
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:50,946
What I can do, nothing.

560
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:53,083
It's like they made him forget.

561
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:58,045
So this is another one of your little
cheerleader initiation pranks.

562
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,653
Is that it? Is it?

563
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,339
Zach, are you listening to me?

564
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,789
Something is going on!

565
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,342
What is your damage?

566
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:06,523
Look, you haven't talked to me
since sixth grade,

567
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,295
and now you call me out of the blue?

568
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,547
What is this about?

569
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:14,977
They got to you too.

570
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:16,898
Are you on crystal meth or something?

571
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:19,010
'Cause this is really cracky behavior.

572
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:49,961
You see yourself as some sort
of humanitarian, don't you?

573
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:52,828
A do-gooder, a hero.

574
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:55,168
Kidnapping men and women
who are different.

575
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:57,106
Does that make you feel powerful?

576
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:00,703
We're quite alike, you know.

577
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,916
You collect special people.

578
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:06,418
So do I.

579
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:10,836
We're gonna take you apart, Gabriel.

580
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,985
Like one of your little watches.

581
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:15,352
Sorry...timepieces.

582
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:19,363
And we're gonna find out exactly
what makes you...

583
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:21,023
tick.

584
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:39,080
I don't think I can do this.

585
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,879
Yes, you can.

586
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:44,169
Concentrate.

587
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:16,939
Tell me you remember.

588
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:20,589
Y-you remember what I told you?

589
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:22,398
<i>Last night. Don't you?</i>

590
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,895
You remember what we talked about?

591
00:35:23,932 --> 00:35:25,708
Of course I do. What's going on?

592
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:29,637
<i>You said that there were people
who wanted to hurt me.</i>

593
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,824
I think they got to Zach and Lyle.

594
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:33,957
<i>They don't remember anything.</i>

595
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:36,121
It's like it never happened.

596
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,793
I don't know what to do.

597
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:39,208
Where are you?

598
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:40,692
I'm at home.

599
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:42,503
Where's Mom?

600
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:46,167
Where's--where's Lyle?

601
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,611
Just stay where you are.

602
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:49,010
I'll be right there.

603
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:50,390
<i>I love you, Claire.</i>

604
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:52,186
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

605
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,084
Okay.

606
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:09,530
I work for your father.

607
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,778
He sent me here to make you forget.

608
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,555
Like he sent me to your friend.

609
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:16,709
And your brother.

610
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:19,780
And to your mother so many times.

611
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:22,726
He'll be here soon, expecting that...

612
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:24,577
you won't remember anything.

613
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:28,578
But it is very important that you do.

614
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,503
Tell me, Claire.

615
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,554
Can you keep... a secret?

616
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:19,016
<i>Mohinder?</i>

617
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:20,980
<i>- It's me. - Eden.</i>

618
00:37:21,192 --> 00:37:23,388
<i>Look, I'm not who you think I am.</i>

619
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:26,138
<i>I lied to you, and I'm really sorry.</i>

620
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:28,344
<i>And I'm gonna explain it
all to you soon.</i>

621
00:37:28,943 --> 00:37:30,467
Where are you? What's going on?

622
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:32,172
<i>First, I need to make things right.</i>

623
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:37,656
<i>Starting with killing the man
who murdered your father.</i>

624
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,637
Eden, wait, I--

625
00:37:47,924 --> 00:37:49,257
I do know you, don't I?

626
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,171
I live next door to Chandra Suresh.

627
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,024
That wonderful ability.

628
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,735
The power of persuasion,

629
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,262
and this whole time,
you were the girl next door.

630
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:07,384
I'm gonna take this gun,
and I'm gonna put it in that slot.

631
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:10,546
You're gonna take it,
and you're gonna blow your brains out.

632
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:12,087
You knew, didn't you?

633
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,313
You knew what I was,
and you let it continue.

634
00:38:17,984 --> 00:38:19,411
In a way, you helped me.

635
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:23,997
And after I've consumed your power,
you'll help me even more.

636
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:27,593
Oh, Eden, you know that won't hurt me.

637
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,619
What are you doing here, Nathan?

638
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:42,140
Let's go.

639
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:43,478
Don't you ask what happened?

640
00:38:43,517 --> 00:38:45,562
I know what happened.
You got yourself in trouble.

641
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,873
- You nearly got yourself killed.
- No, I saved a girl.

642
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:49,492
Had to be a hero, didn't you?

643
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,046
- Got it out of your system now?
- I finally get it now.

644
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:54,723
I have these dreams, and when I'm around
someone with an ability,

645
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,983
- I can do what they can do.
- You look like hell.

646
00:38:57,582 --> 00:39:00,722
And I was with that girl and that guy
that was trying to kill that girl.

647
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:03,457
And this cop,
I think he was reading my mind.

648
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:05,678
- They were all like us.
- Dysfunctional?

649
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:06,859
No, they...

650
00:39:07,526 --> 00:39:09,992
Nathan, I have to stop that bomb.
I have to save everybody.

651
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,544
Right now,
I'd settle for you walking straight.

652
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:13,007
Easy, it's all right, it's all right.

653
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,501
- It's all right.
- It's all-- my fault.

654
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:18,246
The explosion...

655
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:20,567
What are you talking about?

656
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:23,013
It's me.

657
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:26,606
Breathe.

658
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,611
Breathe. Peter!
