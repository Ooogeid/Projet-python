1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,330
Previously on Heroes:

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,050
You have to tell me where Mr. Canfield went.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,220
He's not a killer.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,610
I wouldn't send anybody to level five that doesn't belong there.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,640
You want me to kill your partner?

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,430
Do it,and I'll let you go.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,670
I won't be a monster.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,560
- What's going on?  - Claire lied.

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,870
There was no cheerleading retreat.

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,510
She's obviously going after one of them.

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,410
Who is he?

12
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,430
His name's Eric Doyle.

13
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,890
It's ok. I know I'm in.

14
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,600
I'll go and get Claire.

15
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,050
This must be my future picture.

16
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,980
The future has changed.

17
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,390
Her name is Daphne.

18
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,390
You have to find her.

19
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,660
Are you okay?

20
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,990
Your brother tried to kill me.

21
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,300
He took Sylar's ability,

22
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,130
And now he's suffering the consequences.

23
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,780
We're in a lot of trouble,Nathan.

24
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,590
How do you feel about recruiting?

25
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,710
Recruiting for what?

26
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,650
An organization for a new world order.

27
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,360
Your father was disappointed that you weren't born with the genetic code.

28
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,460
You did experiments on me.

29
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,780
And God knows who else.

30
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,760
I know a scientist.

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,010
If anybody can help you,he can.

32
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,550
- Can he be trusted?  - Suresh?

33
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,950
Yeah,he's harmless.

34
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,740
You actually inject yourself with that?

35
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,630
You are a monster...

36
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,670
I wish you hadn't said that.

37
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,670
Hello,Angela.

38
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,530
You can see the future.

39
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,590
I can't have that.

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,650
The team is coming together nicely.

41
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,170
We're building an army,just like you...

42
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,140
Whatever you say goes,Mr. Petrelli.

43
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,300
In every journey,

44
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,200
the traveler must ask

45
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,580
"was the right path taken?"

46
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,190
Many roads are long and winding,

47
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,000
filled with those who have lost their way.

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,630
Some forge their own course,

49
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,960
Guided by faith,

50
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,460
Seeking not a location,

51
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,700
but a kindred soul.

52
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,300
Others step together,

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,530
Finding safety in the arms of another.

54
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,460
A few remove themselves from the trail

55
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,530
to avoid the path of temptation.

56
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,000
But those who watch the track too closely

57
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,730
fail to see where it led them.

58
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,830
And they're often all too surprised

59
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,730
By their destination.

60
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,930
Kill the other one.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,230
Kill Ando?!

62
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,130
Yeah,he has no powers.

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,530
What good is he to us?

64
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,160
You kill him,You are badass.

65
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,160
That's good.

66
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,530
He'll never do it.

67
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,830
Hiro?

68
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,700
Hello,Milos.

69
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,130
Aah!

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,060
Hiro?

71
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,730
I'm sorry,my friend.

72
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,030
I must make sacrifices to save the world.

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,100
Ugh!

74
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,400
Hiro.

75
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,830
Okay.

76
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,460
You're in.

77
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,400
You handle the rest.

78
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm taking Adam Monroe to see the boss.

79
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,860
Oh,my god!

80
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,430
You actually Killed him.

81
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,930
That guy told me to.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Badass!

83
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,960
That was to prove you wouldn't.

84
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,730
You're supposed to be a good guy.

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Now I'm a villain like you.

86
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,130
Me?

87
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,660
I'm not a killer.

88
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,560
No,but you are a thief.

89
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,960
But I just do it for money.

90
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,830
It's not like anybody gets hurt.

91
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,130
Well,I want my payday,too.

92
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,300
Ando was useless to me. He had no powers.

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,500
Now take me to your boss.

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm not taking you anywhere.

95
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,100
You get an assignment like everyone else.

96
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,130
Here,

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,300
you're going to africa.

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,330
He's a precog.

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,330
A what?

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,500
He can see the future.

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,830
Whatever he paints comes true.

102
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,560
Like Mr. Isaac.

103
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,230
Whatever.

104
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,260
My boss can't have someone like that out there.

105
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,030
Bring him to this address,

106
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,060
Alive.

107
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,160
Just so you know,

108
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,960
It's not easy catching a precog.

109
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,400
Why's that?

110
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,000
They see you coming.

111
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,860
Hi. Where are you going?

112
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,230
Meredith went after this creep,and it's my fault.

113
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,460
Mom,have you looked at his file?

114
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,560
He's psycho. She's in danger.

115
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay. I get it.

116
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,000
You want to fight bad guys,save the world,

117
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,400
Be a hero.

118
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,560
I don't need special abilities like your mother...

119
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,200
Your other mother... to understand that.

120
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,560
Thank you.

121
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,130
I really have to go.

122
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,130
I'm ready.

123
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,230
Your father always said,"one of us,one of them."

124
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,460
I'm the one of us.

125
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
Meredith Gordon...

126
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,760
As god as my witness,

127
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm going to make you love me again.

128
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,800
It's like I told you all night long,Eric,

129
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,130
I never loved you.

130
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,060
You disgust me.

131
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,830
You know,

132
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,100
Even when they stuck me on level five,

133
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,200
I knew someday

134
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,860
We'd be together again.

135
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,630
I'd like a destination wedding...

136
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,330
Like Fiji?

137
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,300
Let me go,

138
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,630
Or I'll kill you.

139
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,130
You know how this works,Meredith.

140
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,000
You can't make a move

141
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,760
unless I make you move.

142
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,030
So I don't take orders from you.

143
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,960
Stop it,Eric.

144
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,860
Eric,please.

145
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,360
Please.

146
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,460
You will love me,Meredith.

147
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,400
I promise you that.

148
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh.

149
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,030
You've heard of me,right? Adam Monroe?

150
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,530
I'm guessing you have some sort of special ability.

151
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,200
What is it?

152
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,030
I get strong off other people's fear.

153
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,530
Ah. I'm not afraid.

154
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,800
Seriously,you're wasting your time.

155
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,460
Arthur?

156
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,060
I heard you were dead.

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
Wait.

158
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,830
No!

159
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,100
No!

160
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,600
Please let me go.

161
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,100
You scared now?

162
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,230
Arthur,

163
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,260
No,please!

164
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,800
I can be of use to you!

165
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,000
No!

166
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,700
No!

167
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,360
Feels good to breathe again.

168
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,700
That would be a mistake,my dear.

169
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,330
Are we not paying you enough money?

170
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,130
No,it's not that.

171
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
Hiro Nakamura was a good guy,but...

172
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,830
We've turned him into a murderer.

173
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,000
I mean,I'm in way over my head here.

174
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,330
Daphne,you and I Have discussed this before.

175
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I can't do this anymore.

176
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh,dear.

177
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,160
Well,that's a shame.

178
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,730
You've done so much for us.

179
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,730
we've done so much for you...

180
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,000
So much that we couldn't do for you anymore

181
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,060
If you were to leave.

182
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,460
Let's keep this little lapse of judgment

183
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,500
to ourselves,shall we?

184
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,000
Mm-hmm.

185
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,160
Look,there's Your next assignment.

186
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,360
Okay,turtle,You got me home.

187
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,760
So now we just need to find Daphne,

188
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,700
save her life,get her to fall in love with me.

189
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
So you just give me a sign.

190
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,530
I can't believe I'm talking to a turtle.

191
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,760
High five,turtle.

192
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,360
Daphne?

193
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,400
How do you know who I am?

194
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,160
Um,it's actually kind of complicated.

195
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,460
Um...

196
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,400
Lucky guess.

197
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,860
Can we go somewhere and talk?

198
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,730
Yeah.

199
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,230
Uh,yeah.

200
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,430
Mohinder.

201
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,100
Can we come in?

202
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,860
I'm relieved to see you're okay,Niki,

203
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,200
But,really,you should have called.

204
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm in the middle

205
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,100
of some sensitive trials here.

206
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,360
She's not Niki.

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,100
We're sorry to interrupt you,Dr. Suresh,

208
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,460
But we need your help.

209
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,300
I'm Tracy. Niki was my sister.

210
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,330
You're telling me you're not Niki?

211
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,900
No.

212
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,260
Tracy has an ability,too.

213
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,300
That's why we're here.

214
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,960
A doctor did it.. Zimmerman.

215
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,930
He altered our genes somehow.

216
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,460
A doctor did this to you?

217
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,800
How?

218
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,230
I don't know. I was just a baby.

219
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,800
This is exactly what I've been researching...

220
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,230
How to give people abilities.

221
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,030
I was told the same thing was done to me,

222
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,130
and you're saying that it is possible.

223
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,300
I know it is.

224
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,430
Tell me,have you had any side effects?

225
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,000
She didn't even know about it until four days ago.

226
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,330
Let me guess.

227
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,160
It first happened when you were in a state

228
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,430
of heightened agitation.

229
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,730
you were frightened,angry.

230
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,100
It came over you like a wave you couldn't control.

231
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,300
Yes.

232
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,060
Can you remove it?

233
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,830
Oh,I have a feeling

234
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,060
We can be of great assistance to each other.

235
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,260
These people know things.

236
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,830
Pinehearst? Yeah.

237
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,500
They know how you struggled as a cop in L.A.

238
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,830
to protect and serve,

239
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
but that wasn't enough for you,was it?

240
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,730
No.

241
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,930
No,it wasn't.

242
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,030
They know how you've been waiting your whole life

243
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,800
just to be somebody.

244
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,530
It's sounds to me like you're...

245
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,530
Not buying your own pitch.

246
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,100
No,I am.

247
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,700
I just got a lot of appointments today.

248
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,460
So are you in or out?

249
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,200
Uh...

250
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,530
S... um...

251
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,900
So this... this isn't about us?

252
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,900
Us?

253
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,900
Yeah.

254
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,700
No. Sorry.

255
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,260
Who told you my name?

256
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,560
No one.

257
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,860
I had this dream

258
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,200
about the future.

259
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,400
But it wasn't a dream,it was real.

260
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,630
And you and I were...

261
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,730
We were married.

262
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,230
And I know about your speed ability.

263
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,560
And we have this beautiful baby girl

264
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,130
and this pet turtle.

265
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,730
And we were so... so happy.

266
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,730
We're soul mates.

267
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,730
I came here looking for you,and what did I find?

268
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,030
You're waiting for me.

269
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,200
I mean,that's got to mean something,right?

270
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,430
Um...

271
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,100
This is getting kind of stalky,

272
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,630
So,um,I got to go.

273
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,230
No,no,no,wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second.

274
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,100
Uh,look,the address is on the card if you're interested.

275
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,630
We named our baby Daniella...

276
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,300
After your grandmother.

277
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,130
How did... How did you know...

278
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,860
Because I'm telling you the truth.

279
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,930
Look,I have a bunch of stuff to do today,but...

280
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,260
Can you wait here?

281
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,730
Here?

282
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,730
Yeah.

283
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,760
- Yeah.  - I'll be back.

284
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,760
Don't go anywhere.

285
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,860
Okay.

286
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,830
Huh?

287
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,630
Is this going to work?

288
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,630
And you're sure there's no side effects?

289
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,960
Oh. It's just a marker.

290
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,460
It tags any unusual DNA.

291
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,960
You won't feel a thing,

292
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,400
But it'll make my job much easier.

293
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,400
You know,I always thought my ability was a gift from god.

294
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,660
But after what my mother told me,I just...

295
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,930
I need to know the truth.

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,130
I understand.

297
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,500
I once put all my faith

298
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,060
In my father's research,followed it blindly.

299
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,060
I never got anywhere until I thought for myself.

300
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,630
Let's do it.

301
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,230
Inside you both is the solution to many problems.

302
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,430
With it,

303
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,300
I can help everyone.

304
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,000
Something's wrong.

305
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,960
Wha...

306
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,960
What's happening to her?

307
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,030
She'll be all right.

308
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,900
The roo...

309
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,360
What have you done to us?

310
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,730
Who are you? What are you doing?

311
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,500
My job... Springing you out.

312
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,160
You're Sylar,right?

313
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,100
You have places to be.

314
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,500
The guards are here in a few seconds.

315
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,500
Let's get going.

316
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
No.

317
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,400
No?

318
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
Who do you work for?

319
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,630
Someone who wants to work with you.

320
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,630
Why?

321
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,800
Because you're a killer.

322
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,200
for some reason,you're important to him.

323
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,530
I don't ask questions like that.

324
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,530
Now come on.

325
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,260
I'm not a killer anymore.

326
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,860
And you're not going Anywhere.

327
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,030
Look,I'm on your side!

328
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,200
Can't you see?

329
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,760
They're trying to change you in here,

330
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,330
make you into something that you're not?

331
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,530
You don't know anything about me!

332
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
But the man I work for does.

333
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,730
He likes you the way you are.

334
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
So you know where to find us.

335
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,130
We're going.

336
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,500
It's about time.

337
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,860
Peter...

338
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,660
Peter,you need to come with me.

339
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,100
Peter.

340
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,830
Where am I? What are you doing?

341
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,200
I need your help.

342
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,200
Get away from me!

343
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,560
No,no,no,no,no!

344
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm not gonna hurt you.

345
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,900
You already did.

346
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,300
You gave me this hunger. You made me a monster.

347
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,400
Now I can't control it. I'm just like you.

348
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,830
I don't want to be that anymore. I'm trying to be different.

349
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,900
I think I can control it,And if I can,then so can you.

350
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,060
When I saw you in the future,you...

351
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:02,500
You changed.

352
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,960
- You found a way to suppress it.  - How?

353
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,200
I don't know.

354
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,360
But just knowing that I figure it out,

355
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,460
Just believing it's a possibility,gives me hope.

356
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,200
I don't want hope. I want it gone.

357
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,860
This is not about you and me.

358
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,260
I woke you because your mother's in trouble...

359
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,500
Our mother.

360
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,100
Hello?

361
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,500
Mr. African Isaac?

362
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,960
She said she knew him.

363
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,360
Maybe we just ought to give her a little more time.

364
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,460
She's still not answering her phone.

365
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,300
She's in trouble.

366
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,530
Oh,my god,Claire.

367
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,330
Where'd you get that thing?

368
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,330
Dad's closet.

369
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,460
Stay here. I'm going in.

370
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,860
Claire,we should call your father.

371
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,030
No,I don't want him here.

372
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,930
Claire,wait.

373
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,830
Claire,if we're gonna go in there,

374
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,300
We need a plan.

375
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,000
I've always had two left feet.

376
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,500
I...

377
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,500
But you...

378
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,330
You were always graceful

379
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,500
and light...

380
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,630
as a feather.

381
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,960
Did you tell anyone you were here?

382
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,900
No.

383
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,430
I swear.

384
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,230
Good.

385
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,200
Welcome. Nice to see you.

386
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,900
What do you want?

387
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,700
Hi.

388
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,360
Hi,I was,um,wondering

389
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,700
if I could book a birthday party for my son,Lyle.

390
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,060
He's six,

391
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,530
and he just loves puppets.

392
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
Yeah,I don't do parties anymore.

393
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,060
Well,I would be willing to pay cash...

394
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,630
up front.

395
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,960
Okay.

396
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,830
Fill this out.

397
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,560
Bring it back.

398
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,230
Well,I'll just fill it out Here,if you don't mind.

399
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
I think I have a pen.

400
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,330
Fine.

401
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,800
On second thought,

402
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,430
I will just take this little form

403
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,560
and fill it out At home.

404
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,860
Who are you?

405
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,560
Meredith.

406
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,900
Come on.

407
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,260
Come on.

408
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,660
We got to get out of here.

409
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,400
Let them go.

410
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,800
I said,"let them go"!

411
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,530
No.

412
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,830
Those things have just one shot,right?

413
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,500
Ahh.

414
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
That's much better.

415
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,330
Hiro?!

416
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,730
Aah!

417
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,230
Dr. Suresh?

418
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,030
Maybe. Who are you?

419
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,630
How did you just...

420
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,560
You know exactly how I just did that.

421
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,160
You know a lot about people like me.

422
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,560
That's why they sent me to you.

423
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,400
And what do they want with me?

424
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,500
Access to your research,

425
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,630
your database,contacts.

426
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,400
Why on earth would I give them that?

427
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,600
That's not part of my job description.

428
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,930
All I know is that they've already figured out

429
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,530
How to do the thing that you're trying to do...

430
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,560
To give people abilities.

431
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,760
They need your help. You need theirs.

432
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,630
Help to do what?

433
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,760
Save the world.

434
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,560
Look...

435
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,000
If you have questions,

436
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,430
You can ask them.

437
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,600
I'm just the messeng...

438
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,530
What was that?

439
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,400
Help us.

440
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,160
Great.

441
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,860
You're just as bad as the rest of them.

442
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,560
Ahh!

443
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,200
It's showtime,ladies.

444
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,730
The gun

445
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,760
has just one bullet.

446
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,400
What is it you want,you sick...

447
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,300
What I want,Barbie,is not to be interrupted,

448
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,560
but since you're so eager,

449
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,030
Why don't you spin The gun?

450
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,130
All right.

451
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,930
Time to choose.

452
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,400
Who you gonna shoot?

453
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,860
No,no,I can't.

454
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,430
You're not scared,are you?

455
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,600
I mean,because you're the hero

456
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
with the big old gun.

457
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,830
Stop it.

458
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,230
Leave her alone.

459
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,330
What are you,her mother?

460
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,060
Oh.

461
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,900
Oh,this is too good.

462
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,460
You are her mother.

463
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,830
oh.

464
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,730
So what does that make you,Meredith?

465
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,160
I mean,because,you know,You're too old

466
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,060
to be Her daughter too.

467
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,630
So let's see.

468
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,900
Sexy,free spirit...

469
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,900
Oh,you're the fun aunt,right?

470
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,560
The one that barbie

471
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,000
really looks up to.

472
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,930
Go to hell!

473
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,800
So...

474
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,360
What's it gonna be,huh?

475
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,400
P.T.A Mom who tucks you in

476
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,200
every night?

477
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,830
or cool aunt

478
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,860
with flame-throwing action?

479
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,260
I mean,come on,

480
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,500
There's only a one-in-six chance it'll even go off.

481
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,600
Please,don't make me do this.

482
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,430
Fine.

483
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,760
I'll choose for you.

484
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,460
Aah.

485
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,330
Stop it! Stop!

486
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,530
I promise you,

487
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,030
I will love you

488
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,030
forever and ever.

489
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,700
I don't believe you.

490
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,900
Pull the trigger.

491
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,300
- No!  - If you don't do it,I will.

492
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,300
Aah!

493
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,630
Hmm.

494
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,430
Okay,mom,

495
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,330
your turn to spin.

496
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,730
Listen to me. Leave them alone!

497
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,730
I...

498
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Oh,you got to love the irony.

499
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,860
I mean,it's like a greek tragedy or something,right?

500
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,700
Okay,mom,

501
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,730
Do it.

502
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,760
I won't.

503
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,830
Yes,you will.

504
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,360
Okay,look,these could be your final words,barbie,

505
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,800
So make them count.

506
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,260
Mom...

507
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,530
Mom,it's okay.

508
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,730
It's me.

509
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,600
you can't fight him.

510
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,530
Do what you have to do.

511
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,160
Pull the trigger.

512
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,660
Okay.

513
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,230
Aah!

514
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,730
Ooh.

515
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,300
That was fun,huh?

516
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,930
Show's over.

517
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,730
I found her like this. She's in some kind of a coma.

518
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,760
You're worried.

519
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,460
You actually care about her.

520
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,460
She's my mother,too,Peter.

521
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,800
She's the only person who ever accepted me

522
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,960
For what I am.

523
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,730
I should've protected her.

524
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,930
You've got to look inside of her head.

525
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,030
We've got to find out what's wrong.

526
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,400
What was it? What did you see?

527
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,630
Just this.

528
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,900
I've seen this before.

529
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,230
So have I.

530
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,030
That ought to keep him down for a little while.

531
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,200
It's a good thing you called me.

532
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,200
Claire,you were amazing.

533
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,200
No,i wasn't. I got us caught.

534
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,430
No,You saved us.

535
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,300
you may have got your genes from me,

536
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,200
But...

537
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,100
You got your heart from your mom.

538
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,860
You did this,Claire?

539
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,760
That's very impressive,sweetheart.

540
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,900
Claire!

541
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
I'll talk to her.

542
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,230
She...

543
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,060
Just has a wrong idea about me in her head.

544
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,230
She's a young woman now,Noah.

545
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,730
She just wants to be on her own.

546
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,560
She doesn't need you or me to protect her.

547
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,560
Well,maybe not,but there are a lot more people

548
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,560
Like Eric Doyle out there.

549
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,060
I could use some help.

550
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,330
What,from Claire?

551
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,930
No...

552
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,730
From you.

553
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,300
Peter,don't.

554
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,900
You're in no condition to go to Pinehearst.

555
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,600
They spread abilities,cause the end of the world.

556
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,760
- They did this to her.  - Well,I want revenge for what they did to mom,too...

557
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,600
Stop calling her that!

558
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,200
- You are not my family.  - What you took from me...

559
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,430
My ability... I've lived with it.

560
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,960
The need for power will consume you.

561
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,300
It will control you.

562
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,800
- Get out of my way.  - No. I'm your brother.

563
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,430
You got to listen to me,Peter. You need help.

564
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,930
I don't need anything from you!

565
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,830
I'm not gonna let you leave,Peter.

566
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,030
i've been down that path.

567
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,260
It's too dangerous!

568
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,630
You're too weak to stop me.

569
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,300
I know what it feels like now...

570
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,260
All this power.

571
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,030
I'm the most special.

572
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,660
I know what you're thinking.

573
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,400
You didn't mean

574
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,330
for any of this to happen.

575
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,500
You try to fix it,

576
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,900
but everything you do just makes it worse.

577
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,160
It all got out of control.

578
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,530
but that girl that was here

579
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,160
gave you a way out,

580
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,060
some answers.

581
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,030
This was all so unnecessary.

582
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,160
Maya was right.

583
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,700
I am a monster.

584
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,030
maybe we all are.

585
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,000
I understand.

586
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,360
Aah!

587
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,760
Nathan,are you okay?

588
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,930
Uh-huh.

589
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,460
Come here.

590
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Okay.

591
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,760
We're not finished here.

592
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,800
What,You're not hungry?

593
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,060
Yeah,me neither.

594
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,000
You came back.

595
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,500
Yeah.

596
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,830
I'm supposed to recruit you to Pinehearst,

597
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,160
But you wouldn't fit in.

598
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh.

599
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,660
I... it's not you. It's...

600
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,000
I mean,it is you,

601
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,230
But it's these people and the things that they do.

602
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,430
They're not good people.

603
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,830
And you seem like a really sweet guy,so...

604
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,000
Great.

605
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,330
Oka... Well,that's...

606
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,830
That's great.

607
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,060
I mean,that means that,uh,You know,you and I should def...

608
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,530
That means that you need to stay away from them.

609
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,700
Actually,uh...

610
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,600
You have to stay away from them too.

611
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,530
In the future,Pinehearst is gonna...

612
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,960
Get you killed.

613
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,530
That's why I wanted to find you,to save you...

614
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,300
To keep that from happening.

615
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,700
You read minds,

616
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,400
Not the future.

617
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,800
I know,I know,but I met a guy in Africa,

618
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,200
And everything thing that he paints...

619
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,360
Comes true.

620
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,730
Yes! So you've got to stay with me.

621
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,560
No,you don't get it.

622
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,230
I have to go back. I don't have a choice.

623
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,400
But you don't trust these people.

624
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,560
If you can read my thoughts,then you know

625
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,400
That I don't know If I can trust you either.

626
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,760
Forget your thoughts.

627
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,230
What is your heart telling you to do?

628
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,230
The same as it always does.

629
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,430
Keep moving too fast to get caught.

630
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,100
What do they have over you?

631
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,730
I can protect you.

632
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,930
No...

633
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,330
You can't.

634
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,000
Bye,Parkman.

635
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:29,000
Hiro.

636
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,160
Congratulations.

637
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,230
You were relying too much on your powers.

638
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,700
You forgot how to use your head.

639
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,300
But when you started to think,that's when you found me.

640
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,230
This was a test?

641
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,060
Yes.

642
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,700
And now you are ready.

643
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,560
These are The villains

644
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,300
You seek.

645
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,730
You can take me to them,

646
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,960
Or you can follow your own path.

647
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,660
- Mr. Petrelli?  - I know.

648
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:15,030
The bad guys are here.

649
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,700
That's what they call you,Isn't it?

650
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,100
Criminals,villains.

651
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,360
It's okay!

652
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,330
He's my son.

653
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,660
Dad?

654
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,560
Peter.

655
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,200
How is this possible? You're...

656
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,430
You're dead.

657
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,300
It's a long story.

658
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,730
So you're behind all this? You...

659
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,230
You hurt mom?

660
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,400
Like I say,We need to talk.

661
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,430
Come give your father a hug.

662
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,800
It's all right,Peter.

663
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,430
It's all right.

664
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,600
I'm sorry It had to come to this.

665
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,430
Aah!

666
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,660
Aah!

667
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,360
Aah!

668
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,230
You don't have your powers anymore,Peter...

669
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Because I have them now.
