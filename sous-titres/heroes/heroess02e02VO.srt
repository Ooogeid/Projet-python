1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,360
Previously on Heroes...

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,850
Takezo Kensei?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,620
You're supposed to be a hero!

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,990
I don't think she wants
to be my princess.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,710
Dr. Suresh...
can we count you in?

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,030
finally took the bait.

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,520
They caught up
with me in cairo.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,320
I'm in.

9
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,640
And you and I will bring
this whole company down.

10
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,480
We are all in grave danger.

11
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:23,234
Our past has caught up with us.

12
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,814
No!

13
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,006
- I'm west.
- Claire.

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,601
Are you one of them?

15
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:30,141
Or one of the others?

16
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:33,401
I figured that you'd
rather have a real one.

17
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:35,893
We need to talk
about the nightmares.

18
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:36,870
There's nothing you can do.

19
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:38,871
Molly! I wanna help you.

20
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:45,940
If we get caught,
people could die.

21
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:48,223
They'll die if we don't run.

22
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,120
What the hell are
you doing here?

23
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:50,782
Who are you?

24
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:51,810
What's your name?

25
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:52,843
I don't know.

26
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:09,361
He's awake.

27
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:11,982
Where am I?

28
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:16,900
Home.

29
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:21,641
{\a6}WANDERING ROCKS
PUB CORK, IRELAND

30
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:23,343
Just tell us where
you stashed the ipods.

31
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:25,631
We'll cut your binds.

32
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:27,442
You'll be on your way.

33
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,152
As square a deal as
you're likely to find.

34
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:34,310
I didn't take anything.

35
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,800
Right.

36
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:40,350
With the thousands of shippinaicontners
coming through cork harbor every day,

37
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:46,502
you just happen to be having tea
in the onewe were sent to rob.

38
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,851
I don't know how
I got in there.

39
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:52,172
You might wanna consider
remembering, boyle.

40
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,241
You're in a bad spot.

41
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:06,161
CHAPTER TWO "LIZARDS"

42
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:13,341
{\a6}BENNET HOUSE
COSTAVERDE, CALIFORNIA

43
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,271
My wedding ring fell
in with the eggs.

44
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:29,242
We do have a colander, dear.

45
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,370
No need to be flashy.

46
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,563
It's no big deal.

47
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,593
It isn't until it
gets you noticed.

48
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:37,973
I can't even be myself at home?

49
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:40,851
It's bad enough that I have
to be all fake at school.

50
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,203
We simply asked you to lay low.

51
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,951
High school doesn't
work like that, dad.

52
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:49,112
You lay low,
and you get noticed more tn anyone.

53
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,072
They have metal detectors
for people who lay too low.

54
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,411
I have to be someone.

55
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:56,183
You know I trust you, claire.

56
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,523
I mean,
we got you your own car.

57
00:02:57,548 --> 00:03:02,193
You know, it may be easy for you to
pretend that you're the most boring
photocopier in the world.

58
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:04,870
But I can't not be what I am.

59
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:05,683
Whatever that is.

60
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:07,833
Making copies is not my job.

61
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,822
Keeping this family
safe is my job.

62
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:11,912
And if that means that I don't have time
to make you breakfast in the morning

63
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:13,930
or I have to dress up
in this stupid shirt

64
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:16,903
so that we stay invisible
and nobody finds us...

65
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,741
then that's what I'll do.

66
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:23,182
And I need you to do the same.

67
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:33,313
I forgot how weird it must be for you to
play normal after being... whatever
that was.

68
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:35,492
Don't you feel
sorry for your dad.

69
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:41,650
Compared to the life I had...
normal's a pretty nice vacation.

70
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:44,260
Thanks.

71
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,873
You're welcome.

72
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:48,301
Have a good day.

73
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:03,462
Did you see this?

74
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:10,171
{\a6}Yamagato C. E.
O. Dead At Age 70

75
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,512
I knew this would
happen. Kaito.

76
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,372
How'd you know this
was gonna happen?

77
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:15,863
Hey.

78
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:19,340
That's not the way we
do things anymore.

79
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:21,801
No more secrets.

80
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:23,770
That was the deal.

81
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:29,531
This was done by a very
gifted artist in new york.

82
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:30,771
Isaac mendez.

83
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:33,662
Everything he's ever
painted has come true.

84
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:37,300
Except for a series of eight.

85
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,122
I was only given the first.

86
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:39,953
There's seven more.

87
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:41,311
What's in the other paintings?

88
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,870
I don't know.

89
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:50,083
But I'm gonna find them.

90
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:57,292
DEVEAUX ROOFTOP NEW YORK, NY

91
00:04:58,027 --> 00:04:59,410
What, are you waiting
on an invitation?

92
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,910
Oh, no.

93
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:02,431
I've just spent so much time
on that side of the tape,

94
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,911
I was just savoring the moment.

95
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:06,202
Yeah, well,
welcome to the big leagues, detective.

96
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:07,752
Let's hope you survive.

97
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:09,751
All right, got kaito nakamura.

98
00:05:09,796 --> 00:05:11,490
70, a japanese national.

99
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,943
Ceo of yamagato industries.

100
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:18,811
Now, he fell out of the sky onto central
park west with this in his pocket.

101
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:20,612
That look familiar?

102
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,261
Uh, no.

103
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:24,740
No, I've never
seen this before.

104
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:27,031
Well, Mr.
Masahashi here is a witness.

105
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:31,063
He says that he saw Mr. Nakamura being
pushed by someone who went over
with him.

106
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:32,561
But we've only got one body.

107
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:37,380
Well, either the killer fell 20 stories,
got up and walked away, or flew away.

108
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,502
You know somebody
that can do that?

109
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:47,342
Ah. We, uh,
found a fingerprint on the photo.

110
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:50,163
Got a match.

111
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:51,911
Angela petrelli.

112
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:53,850
We need to bring her right in.

113
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:01,640
Mr. Masahashi.

114
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,412
You ever seen this
symbol before?

115
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,181
Yes.

116
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,070
It is a kanji.

117
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:12,412
It means, "great ability,
godsend. "

118
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,730
Ability?

119
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:17,711
It is the crest of takezo kensei,
a famous hero in japan.

120
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:22,481
Mr. Nakamura used to read the
kensei stories to his son hiro.

121
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:24,440
I need to talk to him.

122
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,121
So do I.

123
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,070
OTSU, JAPAN 1671

124
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:47,703
HAVE YOU SEEN A
SCARY WHITE MAN?

125
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,341
You must be sober!

126
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:06,610
If we don't go after yaeko right now,
she'll be killed!

127
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:07,633
Who's yaeko?

128
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,180
The girl you're supposed
to fall in love with!

129
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,382
The one who hates me?

130
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:14,160
Yes, before I came back in
time and ruined everything,

131
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:17,790
she was supposed to be your princess,
and you, a hero.

132
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:20,061
You look like a
fish when you talk.

133
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:24,812
No, I promise, if you do this, they will
tell the story for 400
years... minimum!

134
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:27,211
Like a giant carp.

135
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,453
I already made a
mess of the past.

136
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,050
The space/time continuum
can't take any more.

137
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:42,533
History needs Takezo Kensei
to be a hero today...

138
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,932
Ando's never going
to believe this one!

Season 02 Episode 02</font>

142
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:15,682
This video demonstrates the newt's
amazing ability to regrow a completely
working limb.

143
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,360
But newts are not the only
creatures with this talent.

144
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:21,994
Thanks to millions of
years of combined mutation,

145
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,894
lizards are capable of
cellular regeneration.

146
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:28,286
You mean like people
who can heal themselves?

147
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:29,320
No, not people, claire.

148
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,163
Lizards.

149
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:32,310
And raise your hand, please.

150
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:36,192
But it's possible, right?

151
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:37,103
For people to be
able to do that too?

152
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:39,141
I mean, theoretically.

153
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,200
Well, there's a lot of controversial,
though promising, work with stem cells.

154
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:46,693
So we might be able to culture whole
organs and limbs for people who
need them?

155
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:51,772
I guess the next step for us is
phasing out the extra parts.

156
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:55,990
We're not using the appendix anymore,
or grinding bone with our wisdom teeth.

157
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,983
We don't even really need
a pinky toe for balance.

158
00:08:58,018 --> 00:09:00,783
It's all just...
junk in our dna.

159
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:03,331
I've read that some people might have
evolved a different code already.

160
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,761
Is that possible?

161
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:09,633
I'm afraid you are gonna need an
advanced degree in genetics to get at
those answers.

162
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:12,982
And I hope you thank me
in your dissertation.

163
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:20,742
What?

164
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:27,240
{\a6}HARTSDALE, NEW YORK

165
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,190
Oh, so how'd you like the jet?

166
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:30,272
A lot better than
flying coach, huh?

167
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:32,131
I didn't agree to work
with you for the comforts.

168
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,472
Still, it doesn't hurt.

169
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:38,571
I can't help people with abilities
unless I have access to all your records
and your labs.

170
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:39,281
Of course, of course.

171
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:43,130
And right now, I need to get
you back on that plane because

172
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:46,353
- I have your first assignment here somewhere.
- Assignment?

173
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,821
I thought you said your company
kept its medical samples here.

174
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:50,072
Not samples.

175
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:51,141
A man.

176
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:51,983
In port-au-prince.

177
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,330
He turned up sick.

178
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:57,071
Weakness, tremors,
loss of abilities.

179
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,132
He's dying.

180
00:09:58,155 --> 00:09:59,373
The virus.

181
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:01,763
If there's another case, there could
be some reservoir of infection.

182
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,510
That's what I need
you to find out.

183
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:06,182
To date, there have only been
two presentations of the disease.

184
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:09,710
Your sister in 1974,
and molly walker four months ago.

185
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,641
If there is actually
a third case--

186
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:13,110
then it is spreading.

187
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:14,022
I'll test him.

188
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:16,620
If it's true,
I'll bring him back as soon as possible.

189
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:23,101
Oh, and, doctor... as of now, your
blood is the only cure for that virus.

190
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,143
Try not to get yourself killed.

191
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,771
COATEPEQUE, GUATEMALA
30KM FROM MEXICO

192
00:10:31,478 --> 00:10:32,792
Nidia

193
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:34,841
You remember us?

194
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:44,131
You are all grown up but I
still see you as children.

195
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:45,722
I still remember the
day you were born.

196
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:50,551
Fist Maya,
the Alejandro right behind.

197
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:53,023
I see it is still the same way.

198
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:54,150
Maya...

199
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:56,982
Go ahead and rest.

200
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:00,800
You will help take us across
the river into Mexico?

201
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:02,400
We have no money.

202
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,862
I can't take money.

203
00:11:04,888 --> 00:11:09,532
This is no place for the
young to make their lives.

204
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,092
It's been so long since anyone
has been so kind to us, Nidia.

205
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:15,940
I've forgotten what it
means to trust someone.

206
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:19,382
Others will be coming soon.
we have a long night ahead.

207
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:21,341
Come, you must be tired.

208
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:26,951
You see? we're almost there.

209
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:29,880
it's not right to risk her.

210
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:33,402
we shoule find a
way to cross alone

211
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,713
the police know our faces

212
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:38,952
we have to keep going

213
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,191
but what if it happens again.

214
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:44,950
i won't let that happen

215
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:01,513
Bet you were
prettier yesterday.

216
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:04,132
I like your necklace.

217
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:05,873
What does it mean?

218
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,152
I wish I knew.

219
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:10,471
Let's try an easier one.

220
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:11,783
What's your name?

221
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,311
I don't know.

222
00:12:13,385 --> 00:12:15,320
It's not your day, is it?

223
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm caitlin.

224
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,560
You know that much now.

225
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,502
Caitlin.

226
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:26,381
What are they gonna do to me?

227
00:12:26,418 --> 00:12:27,551
I don't know.

228
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:28,993
Whatever my brother
thinks is best.

229
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:30,431
Your brother?

230
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:33,230
Did he send you in here?

231
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,140
He'd pitch an epic fit.

232
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,923
Thought I'd try a kinder tack.

233
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:42,962
Thing is, this job, it's bigger
than you and a couple of quid.

234
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:45,153
They pulled it for this
man named mcsorely.

235
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,552
Promised delivery today.

236
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:51,961
So what happens if the guy
doesn't get what he wants?

237
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:53,280
You have to remember something.

238
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,902
Anything--a name, a face.

239
00:12:57,856 --> 00:13:01,292
First thing I remember is your
brother and his crew finding me.

240
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:03,740
Then the big guy
came at me and--

241
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:05,970
and an electrical short
blew tuko on his arse--

242
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,711
I heard the story.

243
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:09,252
The spark.

244
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,611
I think it came from me.

245
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,300
My hand.

246
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,371
- I--I know that it seems-
- is it possible?

247
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:28,130
I've just rung out...
a lot of your blood.

248
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:32,930
You don't have a mark on you.

249
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:01,062
PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI

250
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:10,851
Is anyone here?

251
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:15,080
My name is Monhinder Suresh.

252
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,292
I'm a doctor.

253
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:35,811
There's a possibility you
have a very rare virus.

254
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,143
That's why I've come.

255
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,783
I may be able to help.

256
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,420
Give you a cure.

257
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:44,513
I do not want your cure.

258
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:48,281
Without it, you could die.

259
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:49,913
God gave me power.

260
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,790
I abused his gift,
so he took it away.

261
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,951
Now I suffer his judgment.

262
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:57,120
Then perhaps we should
leave it to god to decide.

263
00:14:57,138 --> 00:15:00,510
The chances are you carry one of
100 viruses I can do nothing about.

264
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,190
If you somehow carry this one virus,
there is only one cure.

265
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,010
The distillation of my own blood,
and I was guided to you.

266
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:09,881
Surely that's a sign.

267
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,192
Just the same as
your suffering.

268
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:12,790
A sign of what?

269
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:15,881
That god isn't quite
done with you yet.

270
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:21,223
So, my friend, shall we see if
he still offers redemption?

271
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,502
Keep an eye on him.

272
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:55,442
If he so much as lays an
inconsiderate fart, you grab the gun.

273
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,310
What am I, 12?

274
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:01,100
Always.

275
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:15,981
Come on. Come on.

276
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:48,211
Sorry, fellas.

277
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:50,280
Ricky and the boys just left.

278
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,551
Aye, I saw.

279
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:59,553
We're not here for ricky.

280
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,063
Lucky then.
I've just tapped a barrel.

281
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,232
Two pints?

282
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,330
No, thanks, love.
We came for you.

283
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,851
So... lizards, huh?

284
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:45,763
Tell me you didn't just time
that so I'd walk right past you.

285
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:48,560
I figured you'd be more
into whales or something.

286
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,333
Unicorns.

287
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:53,063
You know,
you make a lot of assumptions.

288
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:55,082
Is my hair really that blonde?

289
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,952
I think it's cool, actually.

290
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,762
I'm sort of into genetics too.

291
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,992
I didn't say I
was into genetics.

292
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,280
You don't have to hide everything
interesting about you.

293
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:08,923
Biology is supposed
to be our destiny.

294
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:12,602
But people forget...
genes can change.

295
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,590
I thought guys like you were supposed to
sit at the back of the classroom and
hate everything.

296
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:19,132
I just found this book.

297
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:20,052
It's by some indian guy.

298
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:21,190
I can barely even
pronounce his name.

299
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:24,531
It's about everything
you're talking about.

300
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:27,121
People who've evolved.

301
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,161
There's a whole chapter
on regeneration.

302
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:34,113
Sorry, I, uh, left all my awesome
genetic textbook reading for the
summer vacation.

303
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:36,190
You should see it.

304
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:37,921
I-I could bring it over.

305
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,663
Get you on your
way to your phd.

306
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,301
You know,
I don't really care that much.

307
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:44,681
I was just kind of
bored in class.

308
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:45,660
Really?

309
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:48,300
Yes, but if you like lizards,
that's awesome-- have fun.

310
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,861
And I gotta go home.

311
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:55,182
Where's my car?

312
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,391
Your blood is clearing
the viral load.

313
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:40,571
Seems you have this
disease after all.

314
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,482
How are your hands?

315
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,953
Steady as faith.

316
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,773
I prayed your cure
would not work.

317
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,650
If I prayed,
I would have asked the same.

318
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:54,512
The thought of this virus finding you,
out here.

319
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,782
If it spreads...

320
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:58,032
so you did not
believe what you said.

321
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:00,432
About god sending
you to cure me.

322
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:03,991
I have trouble believing in any god that
would allow a pathogenlike this
to exist.

323
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:05,961
It killed my sister.

324
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:11,240
Seems like it's becoming
even more virulent.

325
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:15,111
With a replication rate this aggressive,
you would have been dead by morning.

326
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:17,990
The people I work with will want
me to bring you infor observation.

327
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:19,461
I have a plane.

328
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,573
You work for people?

329
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:24,920
A company.

330
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:27,673
Of course.

331
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:29,920
There's always a company.

332
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:38,090
Where is he?

333
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:40,303
Where is the haitian?

334
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:41,892
The haitian?

335
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:43,120
Isn't he in haiti?

336
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:45,250
We're in haiti.

337
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:48,203
You've been out of
contact for hours.

338
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,403
I was in your office.

339
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,390
You gave me an envelope, said...
a man may have the virus.

340
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,580
That I was to cure him.

341
00:25:56,237 --> 00:26:00,381
He wouldn't have been able to take
your memory unless the vaccine worked.

342
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:03,122
So... apparently it did.

343
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,922
Full recovery.
Thank you, dr. Suresh.

344
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:08,590
My memory?

345
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:11,731
I'm sorry.

346
00:26:12,646 --> 00:26:14,790
Well, at least we've
contained the virus.

347
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:18,622
We'll just chalk this
up to a rookie mistake.

348
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:23,691
BORDER GUATEMALA AND MEXICO

349
00:30:19,106 --> 00:30:20,983
Hey.

350
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:23,873
Five-pound bag of gummi bears.

351
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:25,963
Receptionists love them.

352
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:29,890
A well-stocked candy dish
makes them feel popular.

353
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:37,521
Dad, if I told you something,
will you promise not to freak out?

354
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:43,400
My car kinda got stolen.

355
00:30:45,087 --> 00:30:47,063
My god, claire.

356
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:49,952
My heart just about stopped.

357
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:55,293
I know. What's a stolen car when
you're running for your life?

358
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:59,981
Not that... look, I loved the car,
and if you ever got me another one,

359
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:03,792
I promise I will never leave
it unlocked, ever again.

360
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:07,261
You left it... unlocked?

361
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:11,310
Claire... I have to
be able to trust you.

362
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:13,082
And not just with the car,
with everything.

363
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:14,411
I know. I made a mistake.

364
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:15,760
We can't afford mistakes.

365
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:17,231
'Cause we're in hiding,
and it's dangerous.

366
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:19,271
- That's right.
- Oh, great.

367
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:22,461
I'm in hiding because of something I can
do, and I don't even know what that is.

368
00:31:22,495 --> 00:31:25,343
You know enough.

369
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:27,840
But I don't even
know how it works.

370
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:28,920
Or what my limits are.

371
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:32,242
I mean, if I cut off my arm, would it
reattach itself or would I grow a
new one?

372
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,832
We shouldn't be
discussing this.

373
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,963
You're the only one I
can talk to about this.

374
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:39,523
I mean, I could be missing my
opportunity to help people.

375
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:42,532
If my skin can grow back after
I boil it in with the eggs,

376
00:31:42,587 --> 00:31:46,050
then maybe my blood can helpsomeone who
got burned, or--or someone who's sick.

377
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:47,271
I don't even know
if I can get sick.

378
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,212
That's enough, claire!

379
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:51,221
Look, you can yell at me all you want
about the car, but this is what I am!

380
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:54,640
I have kept you out of danger your whole
life so you wouldn't have to find
your limits.

381
00:31:54,676 --> 00:31:56,100
Because if they find you,
that's what they'll do.

382
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:58,063
They'll cut you,
they'll test you.

383
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:03,223
And they will push you so far past your
capacity for pain that you'll wish you
could die.

384
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:05,821
Believe me.

385
00:32:05,877 --> 00:32:11,202
You may feel confined here, but this is
far freer a cage than the one they'd put
you in.

386
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:16,451
I've gotta get back to work.

387
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:20,222
You and nakamura.

388
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:22,000
Witness said you had
a fight yesterday.

389
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:23,221
We were old friends.

390
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:26,453
Sometimes simple conversations
can be misconstrued.

391
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:28,280
Hmm. He said you slapped him.

392
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:30,992
He made an offhand comment
about my son's death.

393
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:32,631
I found it distasteful.

394
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:35,280
You're a major shareholder
in yamagato industries.

395
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:37,550
That stock's been in the
toilet for months now.

396
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:39,623
You think I killed
kaito over money?

397
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:41,753
Most common motives
are money and sex.

398
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:45,420
Well, I don't need the money,
and I wasn't sleeping with him.

399
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:48,170
Not for a long time.

400
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:53,040
You recognize that symbol?

401
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,590
Yes, it's the logo of
my husband's law firm.

402
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:58,582
Why draw it across
nakamura's face?

403
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,882
I don't know.

404
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:05,471
E Because we did something terrible,
and now someone wants revenge.

405
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:12,111
Would anyone want revenge on him,
maybe... on you?

406
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,471
Who said anything
about revenge?

407
00:33:13,566 --> 00:33:14,822
I want my lawyer now.

408
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:16,740
Who wants revenge,
mrs. Petrelli?

409
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:19,983
Stand down, parkman.
She cried uncle.

410
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:24,841
Get out of my head!

411
00:33:29,518 --> 00:33:32,310
Mr. Petrelli.

412
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:34,511
I know you.

413
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:35,533
Detective matt parkman.

414
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:39,043
We met in texas when you came in to
lawyer your brother out of jail.

415
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:42,530
Look, I'm sorry about peter.

416
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:43,980
Follow me.
I'll show you to your mother.

417
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:46,571
She's not gonna want to see me.

418
00:33:47,635 --> 00:33:49,753
Look, I just came
to get her out.

419
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:52,640
Then why'd she ask
us to call you?

420
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:55,443
She doesn't haveanyone else.

421
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:07,091
That's not possible!

422
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:12,221
Stand back.

423
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:25,012
It's gonna be all right, mom.

424
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:27,330
It's gonna be okay.

425
00:34:28,336 --> 00:34:31,360
Who did this to you,
mrs. Petrelli?

426
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,680
Aren't you gonna say anything?

427
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:44,982
About what?

428
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,541
About those things you did.

429
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,190
I didn't do anything.

430
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:50,352
Make up a story.

431
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:54,440
Tell me you lost your memory of tonight
too, but don't pretend I'm stupid.

432
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:58,831
You had to knock the piss out of him,
didn't you?

433
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:02,781
The fella you put through
a wall was mcsorely's son.

434
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:05,872
A sadistic bastard,
but his old man loves him.

435
00:35:05,925 --> 00:35:07,591
And you just made
him even uglier.

436
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:09,551
Fine, next time,
I'll leave him alone with your sister.

437
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:11,650
Don't you mouth off to me.

438
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:15,310
You turned a fixable monetary
problem into a blood feud.

439
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:18,010
Ricky!

440
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:22,302
You're gonna make this right.

441
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:23,941
We'll do another job.

442
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,763
Something big enough we candrop a fat
stack on his desk and get him off
our backs.

443
00:35:29,346 --> 00:35:31,311
I'm not a thief.

444
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:33,001
Maybe not.

445
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:35,750
But you certainly handled
those two like a pro.

446
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:37,253
And that makes you something.

447
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:38,512
Now, doesn't it?

448
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,703
What's to say I don't do the same
thing to you and walk out of here?

449
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:43,140
I thought common
courtesy would do it.

450
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:45,182
No?

451
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:47,831
Then maybe this.

452
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:53,292
You might want this... peter.

453
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:58,630
My name is peter?

454
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,143
Sounds about right, doesn't it?

455
00:36:00,248 --> 00:36:02,270
Just something I read.

456
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:04,923
This here is everything you
had on you when we found you.

457
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:07,721
Credit cards,
maybe a train ticket.

458
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:10,273
Could even be a love letter.

459
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:17,270
It's all yours... you just have
to help us with one little job.

460
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:21,510
What do you say... peter?

461
00:36:23,825 --> 00:36:25,081
Hello?

462
00:36:25,178 --> 00:36:26,292
Mr. Kensei?

463
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:27,163
Mr. Kensei?

464
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:29,190
You stole my armor
and left me withal.

465
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:30,290
Who do you think you are?

466
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,520
I only did it to save yaeko.

467
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:36,432
And to show that takezo kensei
is not a drunk, but a hero.

468
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,340
- And I did.
- You did?

469
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:42,222
Yes. They're already
telling of your bravery.

470
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:45,500
And what exactly did
I do on this day?

471
00:36:45,558 --> 00:36:49,360
You disarmed 11 men and
rescued a beautiful girl.

472
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,581
I'm to believe you did all
that and took no credit?

473
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:26,852
All right, carp, I'm in.

474
00:37:26,908 --> 00:37:27,920
Really?

475
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:29,422
I don't know what brand
of fool you truly are,

476
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,962
but it appears listening to
you will grant me more reward.

477
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:34,113
- And more of her.
- It will!

478
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,011
Mm-hmm, then you can make
me the hero she sees in me.

479
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,310
As long as you stop drinking.

480
00:37:38,365 --> 00:37:40,340
No promises.

481
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,030
I'm sorry, carp.

482
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:16,112
Maybe I'll be a hero
next time around.

483
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:17,661
No!

484
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:20,700
You cannot die!

485
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:30,913
You're working late.

486
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,283
Night shift. Don't ask.

487
00:39:33,386 --> 00:39:35,023
Was it a productive trip?

488
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:37,431
You should have the answer to
that yourself very shortly.

489
00:39:37,487 --> 00:39:40,183
And you didn't arouse
any suspicions?

490
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:41,452
I don't think so.

491
00:39:41,558 --> 00:39:45,642
Bob seemed more angry at himself
for trusting the bungling professor.

492
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:48,532
They'll be watching
me more closely now.

493
00:39:48,588 --> 00:39:50,133
That's to be expected.

494
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:51,343
Don't worry.

495
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:53,183
I'll find the other
paintings myself.

496
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,782
Are you sure?

497
00:39:57,417 --> 00:40:00,552
You've given me
everything I need.

498
00:40:08,017 --> 00:40:10,201
Welcome to copy kingdom.

499
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:13,081
How can I help you?

500
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:26,133
Turn that off.

501
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:30,082
That is salt in the wound
for poor Mr. Muggles.

502
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,251
I'm sorry.

503
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:35,531
That was very
inconsiderate of me.

504
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:39,810
You're right.

505
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:41,861
It doesn't help to avoid it.

506
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:57,220
Well... guess it's
just you and me.

507
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:35,033
Come on, barow ck.

508
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:49,713
No way.
