1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,610
You're special and I couldn't kill you

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,880
Even if I wanted to.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,910
At formula could destroy the whole world.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,410
I was just heading out to get the other half of this.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,630
It's not right that you're here.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,820
Tells me the future is not as I have painted it.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,870
You must spirit walk many miles.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,710
I was the one who shot you.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,800
What do I do next?

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,050
You gotta make the right choices.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,770
I'd be honored to serve as junior senator from new york.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,770
That's not me.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,970
You can't run this story.

14
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,140
No!

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,370
I've called someone to help out and I want them gone.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,630
Mom?

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,200
They're villains, Claire.

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,500
I'm one of the only people on the planet that knows enough

19
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,800
To stop them.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,430
Hurry, hurry.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,570
Jesse!

22
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,400
Where is he? Where'd they go?

23
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,400
Escaped.

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,830
I put him in the body of that guy in that cell right there!

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,590
I need you to look out for someone who looks just like me.

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,550
My sons have been such a disappointment.

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,100
But you--I can give you

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,400
What all boys crave from their mothers.

29
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,320
Inspiration.

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,380
Kindness, comfort.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,400
You are not my mother.

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,970
But I am, dear.

33
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,880
I should never have given you up for adoption.

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,260
But now I'm going to take good care of you...

35
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,460
Just like a good mother.

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,820
My mother?

37
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,070
Yes.

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,610
Because you're right.

39
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,010
You are very special.

40
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,180
And you need to betrong for what's to come.

41
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,620
Bridgett, would you join us, please?

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,660
You want to see me?

43
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,720
This is Bridgett.

44
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,730
And she has a very special ability.

45
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,660
Any object she touches

46
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,170
She can see its history.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,870
Everywhere its been.

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,010
Everyone who's ever touched it.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,240
What's she gonna do to me?

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,030
Feed you.

51
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,820
In the ongoing search for self

52
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,770
There are days when we learn sothing genuinely new.

53
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,300
Something uncovered.

54
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,450
Hidden.

55
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,120
That we never knew was there.

56
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,740
Something that surprises us.

57
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,690
And on that day of self discovery

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,870
Remains.

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,910
What kind of person are we?

60
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,970
Does the hero or the villain inside us

61
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,410
Win the day?

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,270
Is Tracy here yet?

63
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,770
No, sir, still no answer.

64
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,010
Where's my brother?

65
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know.

66
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,470
I'm looking for him too.

67
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,870
And you called me?

68
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,900
Peter left me a message last night.

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,930
But it wasn't his voice.

70
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,810
Nathan, it's Peter.

71
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,550
I'm trapped in the body of this guy.

72
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,310
I just broke out of level five with these...Criminals.

73
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,570
I'm trying to get back.

74
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,900
But I'm really fraid they're gonna hurt somebody.

75
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,210
Maybe we should come back at night.

76
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,370
It'll be empty.

77
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,500
That's not exactly the plan now, is it?

78
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,440
You're terrified, Jesse. I can feel it.

79
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,520
What's up? Nothing.

80
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,290
Nothing, I'm good.

81
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,610
Light it up.

82
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,400
Evyone on the ground now!

83
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,520
I expected you back earlier, Noah.

84
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,370
All of these prisoners escaped.

85
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,860
Most of whom you put away.

86
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,660
You can take the man out of the company--

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,700
Let me be clear.

88
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,130
I'm not here to reenlist.

89
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm here to make sure these psychopaths

90
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,730
Get put back in their cages where they belong.

91
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,090
And then I return to my family.

92
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,840
And our Claire.

93
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,780
I'm gonna need my old partner.

94
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,740
Well, unfortunately the Haitian is unavailable.

95
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,240
He's on a pickup assignment for me.

96
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,300
I can't do this alone.

97
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,690
You know how it works.

98
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,030
One of us, one of them.

99
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,880
Don't worry.

100
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,810
I have the perfect one of them in mind.

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,320
Meet your new partner.

102
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,850
Just keep your heads down.

103
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,210
All of you.

104
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,810
Ah-ah-ah. No alarms.

105
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,780
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,150
Yeah, you are.

107
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,960
But maybe you can work it off.

108
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,300
I hear that Stockholm Syndrome is like Spanish Fly.

109
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,880
Leave her alone.

110
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,010
What are you gonna do, Jesse?

111
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,540
Are you gonna stop me?

112
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,070
Yeah, I am.

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,530
It's open!

114
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,090
Let's go collect our winnings.

115
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,610
Oh, thank you.

116
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,420
Mom?

117
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,660
Oh, we don't smoke in the house.

118
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,430
Oh, sorry.

119
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,600
Uh, so, you're Claire's real mom?

120
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,110
Biological mom.

121
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,150
Your dad asked me to stick around.

122
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,720
Help protect you guys while he's way.

123
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,630
With fire?

124
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,250
Yeah.

125
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,440
Claire.

126
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,210
You got everything ready to get back

127
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,510
To school today?

128
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,410
I'm not going.

129
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,870
Excu me?

130
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,520
Well, it is very clear that my life will never be normal

131
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,360
So I've decided to stop trying.

132
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,560
You decided?

133
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,620
Your father and I-- dad's not here.

134
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,440
He doesn't get a vote.

135
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
He's out there protecting all of us.

136
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,050
Yeah, he's out there stopping villains.

137
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,120
Helping people.

138
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,570
Doing the same thing that I

139
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,240
Should be doing with my life

140
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,650
You're a 17-year old girl.

141
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,210
Who can't get hurt.

142
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,880
Can't die.

143
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,550
Can't even feel pain.

144
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,680
You just don't understand.

145
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,540
I think that what Claire is trying to say here

146
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,610
Is that when you're like us--

147
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,600
Meredith, I'm thrilled that you're here to protect us

148
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,630
But I know how to talk to my daughter, thank you.

149
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,520
Claire...

150
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,250
Get ready for school...Now.

151
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,600
You expect me to work with this animal

152
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,980
After what he did to my daughter?

153
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,340
Your granddaughter?

154
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,730
He nearly killed her.

155
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,140
She can't die.

156
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,120
You really don't understand her, do you?

157
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,910
Noah.

158
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,350
We just let a dozen criminals

159
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,270
Out into a world

160
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,040
That is grossly unprepared to deal with them.

161
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,340
So your solution is to send

162
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,930
A psychopath after the psychopaths?

163
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,720
He is the perfect partner.

164
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,700
And he can't be killed anyway. You know that.

165
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,870
He's a murderer.

166
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,120
Then you and Gabriel have more in common

167
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,480
Than you care to admit.

168
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,670
He's been misunderstood.

169
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,000
He just needs structure.

170
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,280
And you're the perfect person to give it to him.

171
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,260
And if I refuse?

172
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,430
I can't make you do anything

173
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,390
You don't want to, but I am gng to put

174
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,150
Gabriel in play.

175
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,670
It's your call whether or not it's under your supervision.

176
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,590
Nemesis.

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,100
Stop calling me that.

178
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,230
My name is Daphne.

179
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,170
And why are you two following me?

180
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,050
You know why. I want my father's formula back.

181
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,380
That?

182
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,330
Too late.

183
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,190
It's been delivered and paid for.

184
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm on to the next half.

185
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,430
There is another half?

186
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,120
There's supposed to be some sort of exchange

187
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,540
Going down at this theater and I'm waiting to intercept.

188
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,300
You're telling us your plan?

189
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,740
What kind of overconfident nemesis are you?

190
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,230
You're 0 for 2 against me, Pikachu.

191
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,870
That's just regular confidence.

192
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,110
Pikachu?

193
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,170
We will find the other half of the formula before you

194
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,030
And we will sa the world.

195
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,810
Yeah. Good luck with that.

196
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,630
I'm slow.

197
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,320
What did you do?

198
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,910
Whatever.

199
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,680
I don't need powers to beat you two losers.

200
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,290
Well, that went well, don't you think?

201
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,000
Welcome to the Bennet household.

202
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,200
Well, what is with this new superhero kick anyway?

203
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,930
There are bad people out there.

204
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,300
I just feel like I should help.

205
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,950
Sure you wanna help people, huh?

206
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,790
I keep trying to be normal...Fit in.

207
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,420
But I just end up the victim.

208
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,870
Your mom told about your attack.

209
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,820
You feel like talking about it?

210
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,600
I just wanna move past it and I wanna do something.

211
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,800
Fight them.

212
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,260
How you gonna do that, huh?

213
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
How you gonna learn how to fight?

214
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,850
Well, I was hoping you could teach me.

215
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,190
Hop in.

216
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,640
We're gonna play hooky today.

217
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,650
It's open.

218
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,560
Had my swearing in this morning.

219
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,310
You kinda missed it.

220
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,480
Everything okay?

221
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,390
You called me Niki Sanders yesterday.

222
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,830
Then...

223
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,900
A reporter shows me this.

224
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,050
Last year at the Corinthian Hotel in Las Vegas.

225
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,130
Just tell me who the hell she is.

226
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,490
I still kinda think that's you.

227
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,530
I'm just waiting for this all to make sense.

228
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,870
It's not me.

229
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,620
Look, I'm trying to find her.

230
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,860
Talk to her.

231
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,310
All I can get is an address in New Orleans.

232
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,780
Tell me what you know about her.

233
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,550
You're really not Niki Sanders?

234
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,700
I need to go to New Orleans

235
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,750
This is all of it.

236
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,080
Let's move.

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,970
How in t hell did they know we were here?

238
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
Probably because I called them.

239
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,390
You what?

240
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,480
It wasn't just about the money.

241
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,370
In fact, it was mostly about revenge.

242
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,090
It was only about the money for me.

243
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,490
That's why I'm going to take mine and leave

244
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,980
Before the company shows up.

245
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,610
The company is supposed to show up...

246
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,060
While I got all these scared people powering me up.

247
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,060
Hey, we got what we need, let's just get outta here.

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
You're scared too, aren't you?

249
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,890
What the hell are you doing?

250
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,370
He was gonna ruin your plan.

251
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,180
Yeah, what is the plan exactly?

252
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,680
Stay put, raise hell.

253
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,710
And wait for the man the company sends

254
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,360
When super people do bad things.

255
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,480
And after he gets here,

256
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,430
Then I'll beat his horn-rimmed glasses right into this skull.

257
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,230
Right, Jesse?

258
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,070
Hey, man.

259
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,060
This spirit walk...

260
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,690
How long's it last?

261
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,110
It's your spirit walk, Parkman.

262
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,260
Not mine.

263
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,770
Why the hell was I teleported to Africa?

264
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,520
For that Matter, how do you know my name?

265
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,050
From your badge.

266
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,130
From my ba--

267
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,730
You mean my policeadge?

268
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,020
When I was a boy I went on the spirit walk...

269
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,060
To find truth.

270
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,150
To hunt.

271
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,950
But my spirit animal tell me to gather...

272
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,200
Berrie

273
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,840
Many colors.

274
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,880
They were my paint.

275
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,490
And you were my subject, Parkman.

276
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,150
So you learned everything about me

277
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,930
From this painting?

278
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,060
This I paint when I was a boy.

279
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,530
I'm not a boy anymore.

280
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,010
It fits.

281
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,270
Good.

282
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,000
Are you really my mother?

283
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,900
You've always understood on some level

284
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,080
That you weren't the son of a watch repairman

285
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,860
And a woman who collects hummel figurines.

286
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,950
He's right, I'm--

287
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,230
A killer, that's all I am.

288
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,430
No, it's not your fault.

289
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,580
It's your ability.

290
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,580
There's a hunger that you cannot control.

291
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,530
It's made you that way.

292
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,830
But we're gonna fix that.

293
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,380
I think I've just found a few of them.

294
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,420
They made the news.

295
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,120
Police were called in what was described as

296
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,020
An incredible scene when four gentlemen

297
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,850
Came in to rob the fit federal bank

298
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,620
In Poughkeepsie, New York, this morning.

299
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,170
One of the robbers was equipped--

300
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,190
With what appeared to be a flame thrower. Peter.

301
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,100
He's in the body of one of those escapees.

302
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,020
Which one?

303
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,990
Jesse.

304
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,860
Does he have Jesse's ability?

305
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,140
If he does, he doesn't know what it is.

306
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,760
Police have called in s.W.A.T. Teams and hostage--

307
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,170
Is he ready?

308
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,970
Police have made several attempts to make contact...

309
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,840
Domo arigato.

310
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,020
That's all the Japanese I know.

311
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,180
What are you guys looking at anyway?

312
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,030
Go away. We were here first.

313
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,450
You can't call dibs.

314
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,210
Can too. Dibs.

315
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,810
Why are you doing this?

316
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,810
Do you want the world to end?

317
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,870
I don't know what you're talking about.

318
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,990
I work for a guy, I find stuff, he pays me.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,850
Simple as that.

320
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,160
You're doing this for money?

321
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,320
Is your friend always so self-righteous?

322
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,280
Hiro takes his job very seriously.

323
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,720
And what are you, like,his sidekick?

324
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,110
Partner.

325
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,440
Like Robin to his batman.

326
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,900
I understand what you're doing.

327
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,360
Hiro's my best friend

328
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,080
We will never leave each other's side.

329
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,130
Hiro?

330
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,310
This is my life.

331
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,720
I mean, it happened exactly like this.

332
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,070
Future can only be the future for so long.

333
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,520
Then it becomes the present.

334
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,500
Except for this one.

335
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,050
I-I don't remember this.

336
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,200
This must be my future future.

337
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,450
It was.

338
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,790
But not anymore.

339
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,480
The future has...

340
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,890
Changed.

341
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,750
Yeah, changed to what?

342
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,970
Come on.

343
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,890
You can't just tell a guy that his future

344
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,350
Is changed and not--

345
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,660
Hey, man, come on.

346
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,050
Are you even listening to me?

347
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,360
So what if he doesn't show?

348
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,120
He always does.

349
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,960
He's like Santa Claus.

350
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,600
And then we're gonna get our payback.

351
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,930
I don't think I want it anymore.

352
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,350
I sat in a cell next to you month after month.

353
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,810
This is all you talked about.

354
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,820
One-stop shopping, revenge, and retirement.

355
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,780
T about being free.

356
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,800
I never told you but you gave me hope.

357
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,340
Probly saved my life.

358
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,750
Yeah, but we're free now.

359
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,240
Why do you wanna tempt fate?

360
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,780
What are you so afraid of?

361
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,570
I just don't wanna go back.

362
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,500
Don't like feeling trapped, powerless.

363
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,380
I just wanna get back to my own life.

364
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,300
Yeah, I bet you can't wait to get

365
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,070
To your family and friends in Detroit.

366
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,230
Yeah, exactly.

367
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,910
Except Jesse's family's from Vegas.

368
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,510
And he ain't got no friends.

369
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,860
So who the hell are you?

370
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,020
You do realize she's playing us, don't you?

371
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,270
This is all one big game to her.

372
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,420
Maybe.

373
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,300
But aren't you curious to see how it all plays out?

374
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,990
So how do we do this?

375
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,020
"We" do nothing.

376
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,330
I take care of the escapees and Petrelli.

377
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,820
That sounds like a one-sided partnership.

378
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,050
We're not partners.

379
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,510
You just stay close and keep your mouth shut.

380
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,360
Who the hell's in charge around here?

381
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,380
What are you doing?

382
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm Lieutenant Chory.

383
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,620
Who are you?

384
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,710
Special Agent Andrew Hanson, FBI.

385
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,180
Lieutenant, you mind telling me why these barricades

386
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,420
Aren't 30 feet further back?

387
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,690
You want the media up our ass?

388
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,270
Sir, I'm in the middle-- are you just trying to get

389
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,070
One of these lookie-loo civilians killed?

390
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,720
You heard the man!

391
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,160
Back the horses up!

392
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,460
All hands!

393
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,300
We'rgonna need some coffee.

394
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,680
Decaf.

395
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,500
Let's go!

396
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,570
Three feet on the other side.

397
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,300
You drink decaf, right, Noah?

398
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,510
Told you.

399
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,320
Somebody put me in his body against my will.

400
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,740
I swear.

401
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,980
Then why'd you come along with us?

402
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,880
You had plenty of chances to bail.

403
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,940
You said you were gonna hurt people.

404
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,240
I couldn't let that happen.

405
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,670
Now I know you're full of it.

406
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,040
Nobody's that heroic.

407
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,960
The formula hasn't been moved in years.

408
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,570
Why now?

409
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,210
Given recent events, Mrs. Petrelli deemed it wise

410
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,440
To keep her half closer to home.

411
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,760
Are we going in

412
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,680
I am.

413
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,070
You're waiting out here.

414
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,820
Well, what's that gonna protect you from?

415
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,960
Nothing.

416
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,530
It's for show.

417
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,340
And you're going in without your gun too?

418
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,600
Knox wants me unarmed.

419
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,800
He says he'll release the hostages.

420
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,810
You do realize they're not gonna let you out alive?

421
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,330
Well, that's very touching.

422
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,200
A monster cares about my well being.

423
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,470
Well, you're so concerned

424
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,960
With proving that you're better than me

425
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,190
That you're willing to get yourself killed.

426
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,600
I am better than you.

427
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,910
I can help. Let me do something.

428
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,590
All right, debrief the hostages.

429
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,160
Use that silver tongue of yours diffuse their stories

430
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,350
But under no circumstances

431
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,850
Are you to go anywhere near that buffet in there.

432
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,970
Got me?

433
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,270
Yeah.

434
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,360
Hello?

435
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,070
Mom?

436
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,550
You're not my motherI.

437
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,350
No, I'm not.

438
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,510
Your mom and I look so much alike.

439
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,160
But I don't know anything about her.

440
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,300
God, I imagine this is so strange for you.

441
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,480
Yeah, kind of.

442
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,810
I should go.

443
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,150
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,310
You look just like her.

445
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,020
Are you special too, like my mom?

446
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,890
I'm not sure what you mean.

447
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,070
She had a power.

448
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,350
She was super strong like The Hulk.

449
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,690
It's okay if you don't wanna talk about it.

450
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,150
It was hard for my mom to handle at first too.

451
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,920
Gets easier though.

452
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,010
Are you special too, Micah?

453
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,250
I can talk to machines.

454
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,120
You can talk to machines?

455
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,470
Yeah.

456
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,940
Maybe I can help you get some of your answers.

457
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,500
What's your last name?

458
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,230
Uh, Strauss--two ss.

459
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,740
I can cross-reference every bit

460
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,020
Of information on both you and my mom.

461
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,950
Just one match.

462
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,440
You were both born in the same hospital in California.

463
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,190
Same day.

464
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,540
Same doctor too.

465
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,980
Dr. Zimmerman.

466
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,400
Now you know one thing about her.

467
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,870
Goodbye.

468
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,860
I've got it.

469
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,990
I've been looking everywhere.

470
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,870
I believe this is my briefcase.

471
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,870
No, you are mistaken.

472
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,890
This is mine. Wait.

473
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,290
We call someone.

474
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,240
Usher!

475
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,850
Movie usher!

476
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,010
No, hold on.

477
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,580
Please! Ah!

478
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,480
Popcorn?

479
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,420
You took away my life.

480
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,490
You're a criminal, Knox.

481
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,680
Criminals get trials and lawyers.

482
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,700
Me, I got stuck in Super-Guantanamo.

483
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,900
You got a bum rap, is that it?

484
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,640
I think you get off being judge, jury, and executioner.

485
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,150
Now it's my turn.

486
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,000
Knox.

487
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,200
You don't have to do this.

488
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,820
You can walk away. You're free now.

489
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,010
Shut up!

490
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,310
I'm done listening to you!

491
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,270
No!

492
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,840
No one dies today!

493
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,410
Listen to me!

494
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,090
You.

495
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,510
What the hell did you do?

496
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:08,890
I came to find you.

497
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,300
Get you outta here.

498
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,680
Outta here?

499
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,610
Then we need to stop this.

500
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,330
He's in trouble.

501
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,430
The world is in trouble.

502
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,560
Don't you get it?

503
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,800
You need to listen to me.

504
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,180
You shot my brother.

505
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,130
Trapped me.

506
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,900
Why should I believe a thing you say?

507
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,140
You're right.

508
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,030
I need to show you.

509
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,940
Thanks, Peter.

510
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,170
You okay?

511
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,800
Peter's not here anymore.

512
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,300
Where are we going?

513
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,740
You wanna learn how to fight?

514
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,830
Lock the door.

515
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,810
Are you sure you wanna do this

516
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,230
All right, we'll start at the beginning.

517
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,060
Survival.

518
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,770
I've already mastered survival.

519
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,110
I need to learn how to fight.

520
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,070
There are some things you can't fight, Claire.

521
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,100
Looks like the man with the plan just ran out of options.

522
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,930
Turn yourself in.

523
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,960
Nobody has to get hurt.

524
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,250
Who the hell do you think you are?

525
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,390
Just a guy with a partner

526
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,790
Standing right behind you.

527
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,550
I told you to stay put!

528
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,800
You told me that to make sure I wouldn't, didn't you?

529
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,330
What's this supposed to prove?

530
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,240
I've walked through fire before and I haven't gotten burned.

531
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,620
You've never been burned?

532
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,520
I'm indestructible.

533
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,650
I can't feel pain.

534
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,120
You ever suffocate?

535
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,780
'cause I would imagine the air is getting pretty thin in here.

536
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,820
Why are you doing this?

537
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,670
Why do you wanna stop bad guys?

538
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,130
I told you.

539
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,620
To help people.

540
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,810
That's what you keep saying.

541
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,460
But I don't believe you.

542
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,000
Do you know what waterboarding is, Claire?

543
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,010
No!

544
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,320
It's a method of torture.

545
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,680
You're not drowning but your body

546
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,070
Tells your mind that you are.

547
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,730
You think yore gonna die.

548
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,220
Trapped, you panic.

549
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,220
Trapped.

550
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,950
Does that remind you of anything?

551
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,350
Stop it!

552
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,550
Turn it off!

553
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,500
Is this how it was with Sylar, huh?

554
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,710
You're indestructible but you couldn't get away, right?

555
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,350
Well, that must have made you feel trapped.

556
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,780
Helpless.

557
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,690
Please stop!

558
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,860
I can't--

559
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,300
Why do you wanna stop bad guys?

560
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,460
To help people!

561
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,770
I don't believe you.

562
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,200
You tell me why.

563
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,740
To hurt him, okay!

564
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,490
To hurt him for what he did!

565
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,640
Like he hurt me.

566
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,480
What do we do now?

567
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,870
Now I get him patched up and tell the locals

568
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,980
That these are federal prisoners

569
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,380
And we get them back to level 5.

570
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,730
Yeah, okay.

571
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,720
What are you doing?

572
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,170
He's getting away!

573
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,930
You were right. I am just a killer.

574
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,300
No.

575
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,700
No, you don't have to do this.

576
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,860
She's right.

577
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,770
You don't have to do this.

578
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,730
You can fight it.

579
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,070
No.

580
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,690
I don't think I can.

581
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,400
It's the hunger.

582
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,760
I'm sorry I tricked you like that.

583
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,140
I just did it for your own good.

584
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,770
Right.

585
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,560
It's only been a couple days since you went through all that.

586
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,860
You got a really good family.

587
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,010
You got a nice home.

588
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,050
I know.

589
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,770
You're right.

590
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,200
You don't just wake up one day

591
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,610
And ow what life's all about.

592
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,770
You know, you gotta build it brick by brick.

593
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,750
And you gotta learn to save yourself

594
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,380
Before you can save the world.

595
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,360
The ain't nothing wrong with just being

596
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,660
A 17-year old girl for a while.

597
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,480
You got that?

598
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,420
Yeah.

599
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,540
I got that.

600
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,330
Come here.

601
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,790
Who is she?

602
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,000
What happened to her?

603
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,670
It's your future, Parkman.

604
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,320
Not mine.

605
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,370
Yeah.

606
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,990
We cannot understand these things.

607
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,370
This is it. This is it.

608
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,250
I can feel it.

609
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,530
This is the reason I'm here.

610
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,130
My spirit walk.

611
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,180
So that means

612
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,780
I can stop that from happening, right?

613
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,990
You really want to know?

614
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,550
School just called.

615
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,950
Claire didn't show up today

616
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,900
You know anything about that?

617
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

618
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,200
You know, I just thought that since--

619
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,610
You don't get to do that.

620
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,500
Think about Claire.

621
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,200
That's me. Not you.

622
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,200
I'm the one who's been here.

623
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,370
Changed her diapers, checked her spelling.

624
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,930
Me, not you.

625
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,960
Sandra, I'm not trying to--

626
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,480
Do you think this is a game?

627
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,040
She just got attacked.

628
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,820
Hurt. Yeah, that's right.

629
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,900
And she's looking to push back.

630
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,470
And there's nothing you can do stop that.

631
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,740
In fact, smothering her,

632
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,680
That's the best way to drive her away real quick.

633
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,010
Don't you ever assume to know anything

634
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,310
About me and my daughter.

635
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,760
I just did that I thought was best to keep her here.

636
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,270
Safe.

637
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,100
I got it.

638
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,720
You ready?

639
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,800
One second.

640
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,010
I totally forgot about the cheerleader sleepover retreat.

641
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,500
I'm sorry.

642
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,400
Is it...Cool?

643
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,000
Sure.

644
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,920
Barbara?

645
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,440
No, my name is Tracy Strauss.

646
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,340
Are you Dr. Zimmerman?

647
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,080
The one from Beverly Hills, huh?

648
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,640
Come in.

649
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,520
How do you know I'm from Beverly Hills?

650
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,430
Do you know me?

651
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,580
Know you?

652
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,200
I created you.

653
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,400
No, don't think it's working.

654
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,490
Here.

655
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,230
Try this.

656
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,350
And as the search for self continues

657
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,550
We look for answers everywhere.

658
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,430
In nature.

659
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,310
In god.

660
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,820
In tiny tragedies th may never be understood.

661
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,940
But still, we are driven to it.

662
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,640
Single-minded on one goal.

663
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,130
To find our purpose on this earth.

664
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,020
No Matter what the ramification...

665
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,090
The friendships that may be hurt...

666
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,680
Or the deals with the devil we need to make.

667
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,110
I guess you were wrong about me.

668
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,110
We'll see.

669
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,260
Am I being replaced?

670
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,900
Only for a while.

671
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,700
Just until I find his weakness.

672
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,070
And then I'm gonna kill him.
