<i>Previously on </i>Heroes...

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,129
Lauren, it's great to see you.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,548
- Dinner's ready.
- You brought a date?

4
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:10,594
- How did the two of you meet?
- We used to work at Primatech.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,679
She is so a date.

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,516
I'm dead. He knows it. You know it.
Why don't you tell us why?

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,811
As far as the world is concerned,
Nathan is still alive.

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,772
- Yeah, but I'm not me.
- They are your memories.

9
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,484
His spirit and his mind
are fighting for his family.

10
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:29,446
I'm gonna find him,
and I'm gonna bring him back.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,697
It's over.

12
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,950
- It isn't possible anymore.
- I'll find a way.

13
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,412
Maybe I'm just not supposed
to have a normal life.

14
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,665
- Sounds like you're giving up.
- I want to find out where this leads.

15
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,126
- Where did you get that?
- I stole it from my dad.

16
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,129
You need to take me back.
I need to know the truth.

17
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,632
Your brother's powers
could increase a thousandfold.

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,050
It's been my life's work
to keep him in the dark.

19
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,262
- How long have you been lying to me?
- You had to be controlled.

20
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,515
- You have the power to kill millions.
- You have betrayed me.

21
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,287
I know the truth, Samuel.

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,793
But I have a daughter to look after,

23
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,128
so your secret is safe with me.

24
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,262
You wanted to see me, Samuel?

25
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,849
I don't know why I read these,
nothing but God-awful news.

26
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,684
Everywhere.

27
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,313
Makes one wonder, doesn't it?

28
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,067
- About what?
- The nature of our lowly existence.

29
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,778
People want to believe
there's hope everywhere,

30
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,530
but, then you read this.

31
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,367
It makes you wonder if we'll be
the last generation of our species.

32
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,453
And if that's so, how can
we stop that from happening?

33
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,789
I don't really give it much thought.

34
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,458
Well, you really should.

35
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,502
You grew up in this family.

36
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,423
You've been a loyal member.
That's why I want to ask a favor.

37
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,715
With Edgar gone,

38
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,176
will you do me the honor
of being my right-hand man?

39
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,015
Or should I say men?

40
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,267
- The honor would be all mine.
- Good, 'cause I need you to start

41
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,938
by retrieving some files
from a Mr. Noah Bennet.

42
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,315
They'll be in a box
marked "Primatech."

43
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,153
Who should I give this to?

44
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,203
Do I get to use my friends?

45
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,628
I think they will lend themselves
very nicely to the job.

00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:24,120


48
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,352
Evening, Mr. Bennet.

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,187
Hello, Ms. Gilmore.

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,065
Come on in.

51
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,277
You know...

52
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,238
I easily could have picked you up.

53
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,115
You do live closer to the theater.

54
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,743
I asked you out.
Seems only fair I pick you up.

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,706
- Are you uncomfortable with that?
- No, not at all.

56
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:09,874
It's just...

57
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,877
It's been a long time
since I've dated.

58
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,297
I kind of skipped right over
the sexual revolution.

59
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,300
Who said anything about sex?

60
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,555
What's all that?

61
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,186
That's the bad guys.
I think. I don't know.

62
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,273
It's been hard to wrangle resources
since Primatech folded.

63
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,317
- "Compass"?
- The key component in the mystery,

64
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,027
enough for them to kill for.

65
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,989
I've come across two of them.
Here, have a look.

66
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,036
- It was right here.
- Maybe you put it someplace else.

67
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,252
- She took it?
- When she was here last night.

68
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,712
Damn it.

69
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,090
Voice mail.

70
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,343
Claire, it's me.
I know you took the compass.

71
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,930
Whatever you're doing
right now, please just stop.

72
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,766
This is much more dangerous
than you know.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,852
Call me right away.

74
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,481
Let me guess.
We're not gonna go to the movies.

75
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,443
Give me her number.

76
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,570
Working for the CIA
has a few benefits,

77
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,156
like waterboarding terrorists,
some pretty decent bagels

78
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,157
and triangulating cell-phone calls.

79
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:28,619
- What is it?
- 703-555-0187.

80
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,749
When we get the cell-tower locations,
we can hop on Google Maps

81
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,502
and get a general sense
of where she's headed.

82
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,423
Thank you.

83
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,717
I owe you.

84
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,598
It'll be okay, we'll find her.
We will.

85
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,737
Dude, wait up!

86
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,035
We came all this way
to go to a carnival?

87
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,829
I guess so.

88
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,751
The compass is locked right onto it.

89
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,004
I always said I belonged
in a freak show.

90
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,465
I just never took it so literally.

91
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,436
- I know why you're here.
- Good.

92
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,690
Then you'll save me
from the long-winded windup.

93
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,736
Peter, there are five stages
of grief.

94
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,571
You need to leap over denial phase

95
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,865
and get right
into the acceptance of this whole thing.

96
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,784
- He's not dead, Mom.
- Sweetheart,

97
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,577
Nathan died months ago,

98
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,247
despite my own grand gestures
of denial.

99
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,250
No, he's in there, in Sylar.

100
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,878
Why do you think we're still standing?
Nathan kept us alive. So,

101
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,505
I'm gonna find him,

102
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,382
and I'm gonna take Sylar down.

103
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,093
How do you intend to fight him
with all the powers he has?

104
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,762
It won't be too hard
once I take them away.

105
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,597
Thanks for coming.

106
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,266
The least I can do.

107
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,354
Please, think about
what you're doing.

108
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,525
I have. I'm gonna go
get Nathan back.

109
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,155
What happens when you find out
there's not a Nathan to get back?

110
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,657
I guess I'll just settle
for revenge.

111
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,542
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- What?

112
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,294
We've been driving for 21 hours.

113
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,379
I know.
It was a stupid idea.

114
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,798
What if we run
into Psycho Becky in there?

115
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,633
She already tried to kill you once.

116
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:50,845
Twice, actually.
But you'll protect me, won't you?

117
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,222
Look, I'm serious, okay?

118
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,183
You don't have to do this.

119
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,560
And now that I think about it,
neither do I.

120
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,604
Claire, wait.

121
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,856
I'm here because of you,

122
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,358
to support you no matter what.
So you have to do this.

123
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,069
- Do I?
- We've been on the road for a day.

124
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,114
But you've been on this road
your whole life, and it's led you here.

125
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,866
You have to at least check it out.

126
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,248
So glad you could make it.

127
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,424
I know it can look a little
scary from the outside,

128
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,051
but you'll get used to it.

129
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,762
Here, free passes.

130
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,473
The whole night's on me...
everything.

131
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,808
You like carnivals, right?

132
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,019
- I guess.
- Thank you.

133
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,395
But...

134
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,689
we are just looking.

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,650
Of course you are.

136
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,235
Although I'm not quite sure
what I'm supposed to be seeing.

137
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,530
It's actually more normal
than it appears.

138
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,532
This is just the show part
of the business.

139
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,786
We need to make money
the most honest way we can.

140
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,915
Going town to town,
always on the move,

141
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,167
at least for now...

142
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,545
Till we find a better,
more permanent way to live.

143
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,756
Hey, you two like popcorn?

144
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,216
Who doesn't?

145
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,511
Well, this is the best popcorn
in the world,

146
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,138
and I'm not just saying that.

147
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,770
- That is good.
- Tell you what, stay...

148
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,772
until you finish the box.

149
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:27,608
Walk around on your own.
Meet my family.

150
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,985
When you're done, I'll walk you
back to your car.

151
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,071
You girls can go back to school.
Fair enough?

152
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,785
Just until you finish the box.

153
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,251
<i>Every tattoo,
a harbinger of things to come.</i>

154
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,295
What is it we're suppose
to be looking at here?

155
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,089
I don't know,

156
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,133
but I've got plenty left.

157
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,970
<i>You never know what future will appear
before your very eyes.</i>

158
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,807
<i>Every tattoo,
a harbinger of things to come.</i>

159
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,602
<i>Her naked skin a canvas
to rival Van Gogh's.</i>

160
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,439
<i>Step right up.
Pay your money.</i>

161
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,234
<i>You never know what future will appear
before your very eyes.</i>

162
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,738
<i>Every tattoo,
a harbinger of things to come.</i>

163
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,658
<i>Her naked skin a canvas
to rival Van Gogh's.</i>

164
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,286
<i>Step right up.
Pay your money.</i>

165
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,596
Well, this looks promising.

166
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,683
What are we supposed to do?

167
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,393
You ask a question, and...

168
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,228
then you take my hand.

169
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,525
And then what?
You're like a fortune teller?

170
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,863
I show you what you need to see.

171
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,741
Like a crystal ball?

172
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,910
Something like that.

173
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,913
Go ahead.

174
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,008
Am I supposed to be here?

175
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,019
Must be some kind of
projector or something, right?

176
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,196
What, am I...

177
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,532
am I gonna have a circus act?

178
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,952
This isn't the future, Claire.

179
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,870
This is your desire.

180
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,255
Come on, let's get out of here.

181
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,410
- Hi.
- Hello.

182
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,523
Is this all for me?

183
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,445
You shouldn't have.

184
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,825
No, seriously,

185
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,245
you really, really shouldn't have.

186
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,067
Listen, Peter.

187
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,527
I'm pretty disappointed in you.

188
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,657
Your plan was to syringe me
in the neck with drugs.

189
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,912
Wasn't that the old plan?

190
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,958
I mean, don't get me wrong.
Congrats for...

191
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,877
pulling it off in the first place.

192
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,006
But fool me twice, you know?

193
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,133
I know.

194
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,360
- What the hell did you do?
- Our Haitian friend...

195
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,322
I took his ability...

196
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,036
Mind-erasing and power-blocking.

197
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,668
Now give me my brother back!

198
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,347
Nathan's pretty dead.
I should know.

199
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,856
He's still in you,

200
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,941
and I'm gonna get him back.

201
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,193
What are you gonna do...

202
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,029
beat him out of me?

203
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,954
Something like that.

204
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,720
That hurts, doesn't it?

205
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,518
No healing power.

206
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,817
God!

207
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,112
Oh, God!
What do you want?

208
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,031
I want to make a deal.

209
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,783
I'll let up.

210
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,786
I'll let you heal,
but you give me Nathan.

211
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,038
You give him back to me,
body and soul.

212
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,293
Sounds like a pretty
one-sided deal to me.

213
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,544
It is.

214
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,214
So what's it gonna be?

215
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,938
You're gonna need
a lot more nails in that thing.

216
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,906
That's fine.

217
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,826
I'll just take away
everything that's you

218
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,620
until Nathan is the only one left.

219
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,372
I would love...

220
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,999
to see you try.

221
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,462
Come on, Nathan,
I know you're in there.

222
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:46,713
Go ahead.

223
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,259
- Kill me.
- Come on, I can't do this alone.

224
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,220
Please.

225
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,991
Is it really you?

226
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,498
What did she mean
about seeing your desires?

227
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,666
No idea.

228
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,044
Do you have some secret desire
to be a circus performer?

229
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,629
Not that I know of.

230
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,674
This place is starting to give me
the willies, so maybe we should just...

231
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,551
It's kind of amazing, though.

232
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,512
I mean, these people
have all figured out a way

233
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,097
to use their abilities.

234
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,933
They're conning people.

235
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,853
At least they're living
out in the open.

236
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,938
In a freak show.

237
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,441
Look, I can think of worse things.

238
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,902
Try having the government
hunt you down.

239
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,156
Maybe I can be the girl
who gets sawed in half every night.

240
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,033
Now, that's something to aspire to.

241
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,998
Give me three more balls.
I'm going for that big stuffed tiger.

242
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,335
That's not fair.
You've had your turn.

243
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,545
Watch and learn, missy.

244
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,797
Three years pitching
in the minors, dude.

245
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,466
I'm gonna clean you out.

246
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,730
That ball was headed right down
the middle. What did you do?

247
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,399
I'm not the one that pitched
in the minors for three years.

248
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,986
- Double or nothing.
- It's your money, man.

249
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,114
How's he doing it?

250
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,199
Watch his right hand.

251
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,500
Sorry.

252
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,129
All right, little lady, your turn.

253
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,092
So that guy was a jerk, but it doesn't
give him the right to rip him off.

254
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,726
All right!
Congratulations.

255
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,811
Thank you so much.

256
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,896
All right, who's next?
Let's go.

257
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,524
- Come on, 3 balls for a dollar.
- Looks like our time is up.

258
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,025
Be our next big winner.


259
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,820
Come on, the little girl
just won the grand prize.

260
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,030
Evening, ladies.

261
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,115
Hope you liked what you saw.

262
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,324
Not really.

263
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,079
If you're interested... I can show you
backstage, where we all live.

264
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,872
- We'd love to.
- No, thanks.

265
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,708
You're more than welcome to join us.

266
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,460
We don't exclude anyone here.

267
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,423
Come on, step right up!
Here we go.

268
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,179
All of Southern Ohio.
That's great.

269
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,140
Needle in a haystack.

270
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:46,518
Hard to believe we bagged and tagged
every one of these people.

271
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,687
You're not gonna find
any leads in there.

272
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,856
Carnival's a nest
we never came across.

273
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,691
I'm gonna try
cross-referencing these

274
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,485
with the CIA database,
see what I can find there.

275
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,826
Let it go. Girls lie to their fathers.
You're not the only one.

276
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,995
I deserve it.

277
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,456
- Like father, like daughter.
- Lying

278
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,792
is a stock in trade
in our line of work.

279
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,462
And you reap what you sow.

280
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,672
All right, fine.

281
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,509
If you want to wallow, have at it.

282
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,512
Unload.

283
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,892
I've driven everyone away
with my suffocating need for control.

284
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,561
- Come on. Everyone?
- Sandra,

285
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,812
Claire...

286
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,941
- You.
- Me?

287
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,904
- You.
- This ought to be good.

288
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,864
Lauren, we...

289
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,452
had... something together.

290
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,372
What, at Primatech?

291
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,583
I definitely thought you were cute,

292
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,710
but we never had feelings
for each other.

293
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,587
We did, actually.

294
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,341
No, we didn't.

295
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,967
We had breakfast twice a week

296
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,262
for almost six months,

297
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,222
and...

298
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,432
we talked about everything.

299
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,227
Well, I think I would remember that.

300
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,647
Not if you had your memory erased.

301
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,233
- You had my memory erased?
- No.

302
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,360
You did it yourself.

303
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,863
It was over before it began.

304
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,741
We both knew it was gonna end badly,
and you chose the high road.

305
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,203
I haitian'd myself.

306
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,456
This isn't the way
I wanted to tell you...

307
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,168
but you deserve to know the truth.

308
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,796
And what, this...
Now you're...

309
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,131
single, playing the field,

310
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:43,177
and you thought what,
you could reignite the flame?

311
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,198
Who wants to know?

312
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,951
Name's Eli.
I'm an emissary.

313
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,828
An emissary from where?

314
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,163
Sullivan Brothers Carnival.
You...

315
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,874
mind if I... come in?

316
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,126
I'd rather you stay where you are.

317
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,211
Now, now...

318
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,297
Where are your manners?

319
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,717
- What do you want?
- Something you have,

320
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,219
and we want.

321
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:28,263
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

322
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,515
So we'll just take what we came for,

323
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,934
and we will be on our way.

324
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,234
Bathroom!

325
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,870
- He's a multiplier.
- I know.

326
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,164
That's what I call being prepared.

327
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,793
One of them is a prime.
We shoot him, we get rid of the rest.

328
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,670
It took us two weeks
to find the one in Tulsa.

329
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,422
What's the plan here?

330
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,300
Shoot them all
and hope for the best.

331
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:22,817
Gone.

332
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,611
So are your files.

333
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,629
From time to time, the ogre...

334
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,130
would return,

335
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,759
always bringing presents to the boys
and girls of the village.

336
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,719
Even though...

337
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,638
the grown-ups feared him, hated him,

338
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,350
the children knew...

339
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,603
he was harmless, because...

340
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,648
children... always know.

341
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,483
Right?

342
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:07,320
You got to admit, it's nowhere near
as creepy behind the scenes.

343
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,240
That's because it's dark out.

344
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:12,867
It's just like any other carnival.

345
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,204
Except for the part about
the superpowered con artists.

346
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,834
Everybody knows that the games
at carnivals are rigged. And...

347
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,713
I don't see the problem
with doling out a little karma.

348
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,383
I mean, they let the little girl
win a prize, right?

349
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,052
They're exploiting their abilities.

350
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,596
I don't see you running around
conning people with yours.

351
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,973
Hey, Barbie...

352
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:37,934
Doyle?

353
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,354
What are you doing here?

354
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,816
We were just in the neighborhood.
How long have you been here?

355
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,194
Since you helped me leave Costa Verde.
I kind of kicked around for a while,

356
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,655
tried to stay under the radar.
It didn't work out so good.

357
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,450
And then Samuel found me,

358
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,535
and everything changed.

359
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,204
It is amazing living here.

360
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,832
I finally belong someplace.

361
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,127
I can be completely myself.

362
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,464
You have no idea what that's like.

363
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,385
I need to talk to you about this.
Are you gonna be here

364
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,719
for a while?

365
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,182
- Yeah, a little bit.
- I have to go strike my set,

366
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,434
and I'll talk to you in a bit.

367
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,817
Explain to me
how you're BFFs with a carny?

368
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,612
He kidnapped me once,

369
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,491
tried to get my mom to shoot me,
but... I got over it.

370
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,826
Excuse me?

371
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,872
The children want to hear
one more story before they go to bed.

372
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,791
Why don't you tell us one?

373
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,879
- I don't think I know any stories.
- Of course you do.

374
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,547
We all have stories.

375
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,689
Once upon a time...

376
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,526
there was...

377
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,152
a frog.

378
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,655
And...

379
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,324
the frog lived in a far-away land

380
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,120
with mom, dad, brother,

381
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:22,914
and a tadpole named Mr. Muggles.

382
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,295
And the frog always wanted
to be special.

383
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,797
What is it you people want from her?

384
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,759
It's not fair to toy with her emotions.
She's vulnerable, you know?

385
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,639
We live in troubling times,
do we not?

386
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:41,891
That doesn't answer the question.

387
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,602
Families encompass...

388
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,771
all manner and shape.

389
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,941
But the defining ingredient is love.

390
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:54,321
Now, we don't profess to offer much,
but love, we have...

391
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,907
in ample supply.

392
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,619
Something that changed everything.

393
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,715
I'm tired, Pete.

394
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,383
Yeah, I know.

395
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:19,679
No, I mean I'm tired.

396
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,350
I've been trying to get out,

397
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,561
fight my way,

398
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,355
and I don't think
I can do it anymore.

399
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,443
- I don't think I can hang on.
- Sure you can.

400
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,121
You know what?
Let's go get some air.

401
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,332
I know just the place.

402
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:03,515
And after they saved the world
from total destruction,

403
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,142
the frog went back to its family

404
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,228
with all that it had learned,

405
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,314
and they all lived
happily ever after.

406
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,319
All right, children, time for bed.

407
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,532
No more stories.
Come on, lets go.

408
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,707
They love you.

409
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,712
Who's in charge here?

410
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,885
- Sorry, sir. This is a restricted area.
- Where's the man in charge?

411
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,181
- You're looking at him, friend.
- You're not my friend. You stole me.

412
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,309
Well, I'm sure
there must be some mistake.

413
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,645
We don't steal money
from our customers.

414
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,440
The hell you don't.
Now give me my damn money back.

415
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,942
We offer our customers
games of chance.

416
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,279
And, you obviously took a chance,
and you lost.

417
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,614
- The game was rigged.
- Or...

418
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:04,283
you don't possess
the proper skill level to win.

419
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,911
We all have talents,
certain talents, friend.

420
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,164
God-given gifts,
but perhaps the good Lord

421
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,751
forgot to hand
a sufficient one out to you?

422
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,004
- How's this for a gift.
- My God!

423
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,354
- Why isn't he fighting back?
- Our friend has a point to make.

424
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,731
Let him speak his piece.

425
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,325
- That's enough!
- Really? I'll take you on.

426
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,368
I'll take on any of you freaks.

427
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,635
You can't hurt us.

428
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,496
Remember the last time
we were up here?

429
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,125
I do.

430
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,420
You were standing
on that edge right there...

431
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,256
like an idiot...

432
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,594
asking me about Dad's depression...

433
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,723
asking me if I could fly.

434
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,018
Remember what you said?

435
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,814
I said we could both fly.

436
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:00,567
Before that.

437
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,362
You denied it.

438
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,574
An election year.

439
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,454
Denial was the go-to.

440
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,340
It seems like a million years ago.

441
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,719
A lifetime.

442
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,762
And we made it through it...

443
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:32,306
together.

444
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,642
We made it
through all the craziness.

445
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,437
We can make it
through anything, Nathan.

446
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,523
Even death?

447
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,234
Why not?

448
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,281
Because this isn't me.

449
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,159
It's not my body.
Because it's Sylar's.

450
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,829
It is you.
Nathan, I'm looking at you.

451
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,499
- You're looking at an illusion.
- No, it's you.

452
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:01,127
I need you to keep
fighting in there, okay?

453
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,341
I can't.

454
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:11,888
He's killing me.

455
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,102
- And I can't hold on anymore.
- Yes, you can.

456
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,524
That's why you found me.
That's why you came and found me.

457
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,529
I found you

458
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,824
because I wanted to crucify you
in Times Square.

459
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,497
That is not you.

460
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,459
That's what I'm trying to say.

461
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,087
Stay with me.

462
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:48,382
Fight it.
Come on, I need you to fight it.

463
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,884
Fight it.

464
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,346
Come on, stay with me, bud.

465
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,015
Please.

466
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,102
Come on.

467
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:10,405
Sorry.

468
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,383
Pull yourself up, Nathan.

469
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,552
- Let me go, Pete.
- I can't do that.

470
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,595
You need to accept that I'm gone.

471
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,182
I need you to help me.
Now, pull yourself up, please.

472
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,895
You're gonna have to carry on
for the both of us, Pete.

473
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,693
You tell Mom I love her.

474
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,903
You take care of Claire.

475
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,656
Fight the good fight.

476
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:56,784
You've always been everything
that's good in the world.

477
00:33:57,743 --> 00:34:00,454
And I got a feeling the world
ain't seen nothing yet.

478
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:04,250
- I can't do this without you.
- You can do anything, Pete...

479
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,502
Anything.

480
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,338
Remember that.

481
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,595
I love you.

482
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,606
I love you, Nathan.

483
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,176
Why did you let him do that to you?

484
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,429
Life is a series of choices...

485
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,183
One of the many I'm forced to make

486
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,602
to preserve the well-being
of this family.

487
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,648
You could've defended yourself.

488
00:35:51,857 --> 00:35:52,858
Easily.

489
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,320
But we're gypsies, Claire.

490
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,826
We weigh our decisions very carefully
when dealing with the outside world.

491
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,497
The path of least resistance
is sometimes the wisest.

492
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,251
- It's not right.
- No, it isn't.

493
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,381
We're not that different, are we?

494
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,013
We're both learning new things
about ourselves,

495
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,099
both searching for new ways

496
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,768
to live our lives on our own terms.

497
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,187
But you found that out here.

498
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:34,942
Have we?

499
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,862
You all get to be
what you want to be,

500
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,032
out in the open,
right in front of people.

501
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,951
If we lie, bow our heads,
keep our mouths shut...

502
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,038
let some creep...

503
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,373
punch our face and not hit him back,

504
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,920
I've been sold a bill of goods
my whole life...

505
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:58,758
taught how to be comfortable

506
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,051
being a second-class citizen.

507
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,013
Now I'm questioning that,
and so are you.

508
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,307
I know what you were thinking,

509
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,225
walking around tonight,

510
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,394
that this place is...

511
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,313
awfully strange,

512
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,356
yet strangely familiar.

513
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,566
Am I right?

514
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,155
I don't know
what I've been thinking.

515
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,199
Yes, you do, and you were right.

516
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,826
We all think it's a little strange.

517
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,204
A carnival?

518
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:33,209
It's the only life
most of us have ever known.

519
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,796
But we can be more.

520
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,006
We can be bigger...

521
00:37:40,382 --> 00:37:41,843
if we can just figure out how.

522
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,971
And I have a strong feeling,
Claire Bennet,

523
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,431
that you can help us do just that.

524
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,227
I think it's time...

525
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,562
for some soul searching.

526
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:59,068
And you're welcome to stay
a few days and do just that...

527
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,654
before you go back to school.

528
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:06,700
God, this whole night

529
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:10,120
just felt like a bad Fellini film.

530
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,998
Twenty-one-hour drive.

531
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:14,875
Want to take the first shift?

532
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,379
What now?

533
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,048
- I'll see you Monday.
- What?

534
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,009
I'm gonna stay,

535
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,220
just for a couple days.

536
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,848
We got two more days
before break ends, and...

537
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,060
I know that it's hard to explain.

538
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,187
I just...

539
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,647
You need to see for yourself.

540
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,067
I get it.

541
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,031
I saw your face, Claire...

542
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,576
The way you looked at them...

543
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,245
Like you belonged...

544
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,831
Like you knew them.

545
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:57,293
I've never had that feeling
anywhere in my whole life.

546
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,381
I'm happy for you.

547
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,151
I'll see you Monday.

548
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,612
I hope so.

549
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,379
I'll make this right, Lydia.

550
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,714
It'll all make sense soon,

551
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,842
Joseph, the gathering
of the others...

552
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,218
All of it.

553
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,971
You've gone to great lengths
to bring her here.

554
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,182
She is awfully innocent.

555
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,895
I'm not sure she's going
to serve a purpose for you.

556
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,481
It's not her I'm after.

557
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:31,887
My brother Joseph

558
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,639
had the right idea.

559
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:38,018
He believed that alone,
this family would be safe.

560
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,814
And that idea has worked
for us for years.

561
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:45,067
But how long can we live like this,

562
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:47,945
wandering in the desert
without a home?

563
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,324
Times change,
and we need to change with them.

564
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,076
We need to stop running,

565
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,036
stop living in the shadows.

566
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,205
We should be stronger.
The problem is,

567
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,417
there's simply too few of us
to make a stand.

568
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,921
If we are truly to be great,
we need to grow our ranks,

569
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,715
bring in new members.

570
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:10,426
And the newest among us

571
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,178
cannot be shackled
with the same burden we've borne...

572
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,847
wandering like Nomads.

573
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:17,224
They deserve a home...

574
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,144
A promised land.

575
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,188
Now, I've thought a lot about...

576
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,816
exactly where
this homeland should be.

577
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,111
And I keep coming back
to this very spot.

578
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,115
Here we will plant roots

579
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,451
and build a life,

580
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,994
a community.

581
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,749
Here we will be oppressed no longer.

582
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,877
Here we will live our lives
on our own terms.

583
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,547
But none of that can happen
until we have gathered the rest.

584
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,011
And when we have done that,
we will return to this place.

585
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,056
We will wander no longer.

586
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,475
We will finally...

587
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,853
be home.

588
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:22,498
