1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:04,546
<i>There are many ways
to define our fragile existence.</i>

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>Many ways to give it meaning.</i>

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,216
I love you.

4
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,009
I love you, Nathan.

5
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>But it is our memories
that shape its purpose</i>

6
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,478
<i>and give it context.</i>

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,317
- You're very sick.
- Brain tumor. I'm dying.

8
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>A private assortment
of images, fears,</i>

9
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,822
<i>loves, regrets.</i>

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>We alone choose
the importance of each.</i>

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,952
How do you feel, Hiro?

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,454


13
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,998


14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:44,502
<i>Building our own unique histories
one memory at a time.</i>

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,671
What have you done?

16
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,215
Did you send a cello
to my apartment?

17
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,633
Cello, no.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,012
<i>Hoping that ones we remember
don't betray or trap us.</i>

19
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,889
They are no bad powers.
You will learn to use your powers

20
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,142
to do good things in the world.

21
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,812
- Where'd you learn how to do that?
- Medical school. I dropped out.

22
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,024
Are you gonna go back to school?
Go be a doctor?

23
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,192
<i>For it is the cruel irony of life</i>

24
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,903
<i>that we are destined to hold
the dark with the light.</i>

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,447
<i>The good with the evil.</i>

26
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,284
- You betrayed me.
- I'm still your brother.

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,163
I need you to start
by retrieving some files

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,248
from the apartment
of a Mr. Noah Bennet.

29
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,792
- What do you want?
- We don't want anyone to get hurt.

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,380
So we'll just take what we came for,
and we will be on our way.

31
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,466
<i>This is what separates us,
makes us human.</i>

32
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,343
- Gone.
- So are your files.

33
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,346
<i>And in the end,
what we must fight to hold on to.</i>

34
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,223
- Where'd you get that?
- I stole it from my dad.

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,476
We came all this way
to go to a carnival?

36
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,312
Glad you could make it.

37
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,730
I think it's time...

38
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,358
for some soul-searching.

39
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,486
You're welcome to stay a few days
and do just that.

40
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,864
I'm gonna stay.
Just for a couple days.

41
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:57,784
I'm not sure she's gonna serve
a purpose for you.

42
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,828
It's not her I'm after.

43
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:38,324
Don't worry about Eli,
he's harmless.

44
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,454
I've caught him staring at me,
like, three times.

45
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,416
It's that you're new.
Everybody's talking.

46
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,000
Talking's okay with me.

47
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,628
Staring?
Not so much.

48
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,380
You have breakfast yet?

49
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,468
Yes, I had the blueberry pancakes,
and they were amazing.

50
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,847
I'm taking some to Samuel now.
He is in his trailer.

51
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,892
You know...
How about you take them to him?

52
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,145
Score some points.
Not that you need to,

53
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,065
but he does love
Mrs. Comey's pancakes.

54
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,609
Okay, sure.

55
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,236
- Thank you.
- No problem.

56
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,254
Hope you brought extra syrup.

57
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,381
How'd you know I had pancakes?

58
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,515
I thought you were Lydia.

59
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,270
That's so very nice of you.

60
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,402
That box in there
looks a lot like the one

61
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,905
from the paper company
my dad used to work for.

62
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,200
As you may have guessed,

63
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,744
your father and I have shared
more history than you know.

64
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,165
- You can always fill me in.
- I'm not interested in the past.

65
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,377
Not when the future holds
such infinite possibilities.

66
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,672
- The homeland you talked about?
- We're almost there.

67
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,176
And I'd love nothing more
than for you to stay

68
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,011
and watch that come to fruition.

69
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,849
Like I said, I do have
to get back to class on Monday.

70
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,645
Your loss.

71
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,355
How do I look?

72
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,524
I'm going to the city.

73
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,902
Then you look very...

74
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,904
- urban.
- Good.

75
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,282
I need to make a positive impression.
I'm going to get someone...

76
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,953
Someone essential
for the plan coming together.

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,330
To help us build a place
where we can be free.

78
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,334
"Freedom is what you do
with what's been done to you."

79
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,422
- Sounds deep.
- Sartre. College.

80
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,384
I always thought freedom
was just another word

81
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,010
for nothing left to lose.

82
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,597
- That too.
- You'll see.

83
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,224
We'll stop running and find
a permanent place to live,

84
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,268
an ordinary place.

85
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,354
Then, you might even want to stay.

86
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,106
Or go.

87
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,358
It's your choice.

88
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,668
- So she's free to go?
- Not in my lifetime.

89
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,129
You make sure of that.

What are you doing?

118
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,271
- Give it up, little brother.
- It almost moved this time.

119
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,231
Let's see.

120
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,657
Far out.

121
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,702
Now come on.
I've got a show to do.

122
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,995
Just you wait.

123
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,456
I'm gonna move
bigger rocks than that.

124
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,292
People are gonna come
from all over the world to see me.

125
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,669
You mean
Vanessa's gonna come see you.

126
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,381
Vanessa girl.

127
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,719
- Come and see my dirt-moving show.
- Shut up.

128
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,347
I can't believe you're still carrying
a torch for that girl.

129
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,475
Don't you know
we're never going back there?

130
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,518
Tell you what...

131
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,689
If you can get people to buy a ticket
to see a kid not move a rock,

132
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,691
I'll invite her myself.

133
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,819
You're a jerk.
Just you wait.

134
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,872
Just you wait, brother.

135
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,334
Just you wait.

136
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,190
Are you serious, Mom?
Come on!

137
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,192
- He's nice.
- He just got here.

138
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,070
I don't even know him from Adam.
I don't know his family.

139
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,948
- Since when do you care?
- The answer is no.

140
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,164
- Something funny?
- Sorry, no.

141
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:42,999
I just...

142
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,210
I've been looking for something
normal in this place

143
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,504
since this morning,
and I finally found it

144
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,881
when I was listening to you
and your daughter argue.

145
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,843
You sound like my mom and me.

146
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,388
We had some serious knock-down,
drag-outs, but...

147
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,141
I wonder if we had a place like this

148
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:04,145
if things would've been easier.

149
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,438
How so?

150
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,318
Lose a finger, it grows back.
Nobody looks twice.

151
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,695
Yeah, it's paradise here.

152
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,283
- You don't sound convinced.
- I didn't mean anything by it.

153
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,368
You know things, right?

154
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,829
I mean, you can see things.
Your tattoos.

155
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,914
Sometimes.

156
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,419
- Why?
- I was just wondering if you...

157
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,922
knew why Samuel wanted me here.

158
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,633
Lately he's wanted
a lot of people here.

159
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:37,386
Half of them
want to date my daughter.

160
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,932
Why's he bringing so many people in?

161
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,642
It's become an obsession of his.

162
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,730
He spent all morning in his trailer.

163
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,816
Yeah, with my dad's files.

164
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,215
If it isn't Nancy Drew.

165
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,760
- Can I help you, Nance?
- I was just looking for Samuel.

166
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,721
He's not around.

167
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,060
- Nice trick.
- I like to think so.

168
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,358
Aren't you on beautification duty?

169
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,529
Why don't you run along
and beautify?

170
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,287


171
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,498


172
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,417


173
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,337


174
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,048


175
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,884


176
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,803


177
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,055


178
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,432


179
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,352


180
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,479


181
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,815


182
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,443


183
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,447


184

Miss Coolidge?

199
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,158
My name is Samuel.

200
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,454
I've come a long way to see you.

201
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,539


202
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,166
I'm like you.

203
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,377


204
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,006
But I have a gift like you.

205
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,093
Emma, please let me explain.

206
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,721
You can read lips?

207
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,432


208
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,684
Emma, wait.

209
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,603
I'm the one who sent you the cello.

210
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,335


211
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,421


212
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,132


213
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,885


214
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,310


215
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,062


216
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,983


217
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,279


218
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,697

221
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,500


222
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,085


223
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,129


224
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,799


225
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,259


226
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,303


227
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,013


228
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,807


229
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,976


230
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,855


231
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,690


232
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,777


233
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,737


234
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,658


235
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,160


236
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,000


237
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,962


238
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,713


239
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,550


240
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,556


241
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,184


242
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,156


243
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,367
I'm interested in people like us.

244
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,663
I know that you can see
things that other people hear.

245
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,542
And that you feel them,
oh, so much more.

246
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,337


247
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,505


248
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,257
I know many people with gifts.

249
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:33,635
And one of them
can see from far away,

250
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,179
and she helped me find you.

251
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,932
We're all connected, Emma.

252
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,105
Thanks.

253
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:50,027
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
that was from me.

254
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,865
- Giving it away was not that easy.
- Why?

255
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,742
It was meant for someone else.

256
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:58,911
Someone special in my life.

257
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,498
She and I... were close.

258
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,375
And then one day I lost her.

259
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,711
May I?

260
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,562
It's found its proper home.
I can see that now.

261
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,399


262
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,444


263
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,113
No, it didn't do that.
You did.

264
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,241
It was your own fear.

265
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,495
That's why I'm here.
You have to let go of that fear

266
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,539
and release your true ability.

267
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,291


268
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,794
I need your help.

269
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,341
I've tried in my usual way
to find this man.

270
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,593
But I've been unsuccessful.

271
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:01,306
He's overwhelmed by his gift,
like you've been.

272
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,475
But so much more lost.

273
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,353
He thought he was losing his mind

274
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,024
when the moss and the flowers
started growing in his footsteps.

275
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,988
He lost touch with this world
and fell into the cracks.

276
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,657
I'm told he lives in Central Park.

277
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,034


278
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,078


279
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,514
Cover the exits.

280
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,409
- Now you know what it feels like.
- Nice trick.

281
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,643
What do you think you're doing,
Barbie?

282
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,150
Let me go.

283
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,361
Tell me why you were
in Samuel's trailer.

284
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,072
- Listen to me, okay?
- You're a spy, aren't you?

285
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,243
- Working for your father?
- No. I came here on my own.

286
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,704
I believed
what Samuel was saying was real,

287
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,063
but he's collecting
people with abilities.

288
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,542
Yeah, why shouldn't he?
We're a family.

289
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:18,897
You wouldn't understand that,
would you, Barbie?

290
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,484
You only see the worst in people.

291
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,263
Makes me want
to pin you to that trailer

292
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,183
so Samuel can find you
when he gets back.

293
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,228
Samuel is using my dad's old files
to track people down and bring them in.

294
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:39,321
He's got a map of that valley out there,
and he is planning something.

295
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:41,610
And whatever it is...

296
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:44,315
You're gonna ruin it for everyone.

297
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:46,521
I'm not gonna let you.

298
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:50,744
I'm not gonna let you
ruin it for me.

299
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:56,249


300
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:59,169


301
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,087


302
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,798


303
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,803


304
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:09,763


305
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,139


306
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,433


307
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,601


308
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,853


309
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,481


310
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,190


311
00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:24,486


312
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:34,863


313
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:36,173


314
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,359


315
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,915


316
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,632


317
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,758


318
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:51,179


319
00:23:51,756 --> 00:23:55,559


320
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,304


321
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,068


322
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,736


323
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,904


324
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:10,233


325
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,201


326
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,655


327
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:18,164


328
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,351


329
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,665


330
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:29,573


331
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,012


332
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:40,520
Your gift is more
than seeing sound as color.

333
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,110
- And putting cracks in the wall.
- My true ability, what is it?

334
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:48,207
Your emotions can become one

335
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:50,211
with the music.

336
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:53,669
You can bring people to you.

337
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,534
Like a siren's song.

338
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,350
Siren?

339
00:24:57,714 --> 00:24:59,764
Yeah, just play and you'll see.

340
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,419
Concentrate on him.

341
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,797
Draw him to you.

342
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,447
Now's your chance.

343
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:12,207
Make your prayers into song.

344
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:17,868
It's all right.
Let the music fill you up.

345
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,140
Is he all right?

346
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:06,124


347
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,376
I cannot thank you enough
for getting him in.

348
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:12,339


349
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:16,607
If you ever wanna help more of us,
there's a place I'd like you to visit.

350
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,340
We could use a doctor...

351
00:27:18,664 --> 00:27:19,764
And a siren.

352
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,029
This'll help get you there.

353
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:42,743
- I will. Thank you.
- Thank you.

354
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:50,015
She's different, like me.

355
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:52,747
Not different.

356
00:27:53,075 --> 00:27:54,075
Special.

357
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,926
I always thought
I was alone in the world.

358
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,430
I guess I'm...
Just a little scared.

359
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,110
So many of us are, friend.
So many.

360
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:09,337
But not for long.

361
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,076
Let's go home.

362
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:19,972
<i>Sources confirm the remains found
in the the small plane crash</i>

363
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:22,867
<i>are that of New York
senator Nathan Petrelli.</i>

364
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,120
<i>The NTSB is promising a complete
and thorough investigation</i>

365
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,455
<i>into the crash.</i>

366
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,499
<i>At this time,
investigators are reporting</i>

367
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,366
<i>that the senator was the pilot
and sole passenger of the plane.</i>

368
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,334
You're getting weak.

369
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:39,592
Otherwise
you would've forced my mouth shut.

370
00:28:39,824 --> 00:28:42,262
Don't tempt me, Barbie.

371
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,529
I'm telling you.
Samuel's up to something.

372
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:48,034
And he's lying to all of you.

373
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,315
- He's a good man.
- Why are you so sure?

374
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:55,396
Because I'm good now.

375
00:28:56,827 --> 00:28:58,627
This place is good for me.

376
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:01,031
I haven't done anything
wrong since I got here.

377
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:03,445
Joseph set me straight.

378
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:07,579
He showed me what was good
and true about my ability.

379
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,001
Is that who's in that picture
there next to Samuel?

380
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,257
- Samuel's brother.
- He didn't want to let me in at first.

381
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,593
Samuel convinced him.

382
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,039
Lydia said that Samuel was obsessed
with making the family bigger.

383
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:28,756
Why do you think that Samuel's
bringing in all these people?

384
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:30,703
Shut up!

385
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:33,605
- This is my home now, Barbie.
- Listen to me.

386
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,738
I don't want to destroy this place.

387
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,276
But if Samuel's bringing
people in for a reason,

388
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,195
won't it put everyone in danger?

389
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:41,863
You know me.

390
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:44,491
Do you seriously think
I want to destroy your home?

391
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:50,141
Talk to Lydia.

392
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:54,835
She knows.

393
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,225
Thank you.

394
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:12,051
- What are you doing here?
- I just went into Samuel's trailer.

395
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:15,126
He has a map of the valley.
What is he planning?

396
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,110
You wanted me to go in there
for a reason, why?

397
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:23,863
You know something
and you're not telling me what it is.

398
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:27,200
Samuel wasn't...
He wasn't always in charge.

399
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:28,701
Joseph...

400
00:30:29,572 --> 00:30:30,829
He was our real father.

401
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:34,147
He made this...
place a home.

402
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:37,962
I miss him.

403
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,923
- We all miss him.
- What happened to him?

404
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:52,376
He killed him, didn't he?

405
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:55,964
He's lost his way, Claire.

406
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:58,502
I am scared for all of us.

407
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:01,796
I woke up this morning

408
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:03,762
and I wasn't sure about this place.

409
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,927
But this place is special.

410
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:09,737
For you, and for your daughter.

411
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,044
Even Doyle.

412
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:15,707
The only thing wrong with it
is Samuel.

413
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:17,658
You have to help us.

414
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:19,354
Please.

415
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:21,677
You have to find someone...

416
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:23,578
that can stop him.

417
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:26,043
I will.

418
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:35,977
No buried treasure for you,
Nancy Drew.

419
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,112
- What were you thinking?
- You told me to watch her.

420
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,531
She's not a prisoner.
If she wants to go, she can go.

421
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:52,869
Not a prisoner? Sure feels that way
with copy boy over here.

422
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:55,038
Don't you ever get sick of him?

423
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:58,291
Stay or go, Claire.
It's still your choice.

424
00:31:58,657 --> 00:31:59,625
I'll go.

425
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,753
After you tell me
what happened to Joseph.

426
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:05,263
Eli, give us a minute.

427
00:32:11,345 --> 00:32:12,722
Did Lydia tell you?

428
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,608
No, I asked her, she wouldn't.

429
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:18,866
It's true, isn't it?

430
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,564
- You killed him.
- I lost control.

431
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,775
Like that is an excuse?

432
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,277
He told the government about us.

433
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,989
You remember them, don't you?
They lured him in.

434
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:33,826
Very same people
that have been chasing us for years.

435
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:37,455
Emile Danko. Same one
who worked alongside your father.

436
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:39,415
The man who imprisoned you.

437
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:41,876
How do you think
your father got the compass?

438
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:44,476
This is not about my father.

439
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,548
Okay? This is about what you did.

440
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:57,642
What I did was awful.

441
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:01,184
Joseph put us all in danger.

442
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,200
After years of running free,

443
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,819
I wasn't about to let him get away
with that and take that away from us.

444
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,696
So murder was the answer?

445
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,490
You, of all people,
should understand

446
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,281
how far a father
will go to protect his family.

447
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,529
Hasn't your father lied, cheated,

448
00:33:20,286 --> 00:33:21,428
even killed...

449
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:23,126
To protect you?

450
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,547
What's going on out in that valley?

451
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:45,899
Every artist needs his canvas,
Claire.

452
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:47,662
And Ian...

453
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,840
Well, Ian is Picasso.

454
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:55,073
I need water.

455
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:56,618
That can be arranged.

456
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,690
It's beautiful.

457
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:11,651
It's you.

458
00:35:13,908 --> 00:35:15,258
It's who you are.

459
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:20,722
It is beautiful.

460
00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:29,416
What is this place?

461
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:31,936
Our new home.

462
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:35,326
My brother would've loved it.

463
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,492
He never believed it was possible.

464
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,140
He certainly never believed
I could make it real.

465
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,869
This is why I need a bigger family,

466
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,536
to build the future.

467
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,324
This could be your home too, Claire.

468
00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:58,882
I have a home.

469
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:02,707
And I'd like to go back to it.

470
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,370
Of course.

471
00:36:07,654 --> 00:36:09,154
But just remember...

472
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:12,045
You're free, Claire.

473
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,478
Whatever happens
in your world back home,

474
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,457
you can always come back
to this one.

475
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:20,678
Whenever you want.

476
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:23,097
I know.

477
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,034
<i>Claire, we need to talk.</i>

478
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:47,994
<i>Claire bear, call me.</i>

479
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,152
<i>Claire, hey, it's peter.</i>

480
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:55,004
<i>You need to call me.
Something happened.</i>

481
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,489
<i>We have a lot to talk about.</i>

482
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,312
I'm glad you're safe.

483
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,270
From what?

484
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,940
Where I came from or this lie?

485
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:28,306
I know you took the compass.

486
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,657
And I'm not giving it back.

487
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:48,318
My brother Nathan taught me a lot.

488
00:38:50,149 --> 00:38:51,399
He taught me...

489
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:54,634
How to ride a skateboard
when I was a kid,

490
00:38:55,981 --> 00:38:57,550
how to hook a marlin,

491
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,709
he taught me how...

492
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:02,757
to catch a baseball.

493
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,010
Those are all things...

494
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,846
usually a father'll teach his son.

495
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,182
But dad wasn't around.

496
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:13,508
So it was Nathan.

497
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:17,611
And I wish to hell it
would've been my father,

498
00:39:18,178 --> 00:39:19,857
because Nathan didn't make it easy.

499
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:24,236
He would throw it high,
or he'd throw it wide.

500
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:26,467
And I would yell at him.

501
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:29,377
I would tell him to throw it
right at me. But he'd say to me,

502
00:39:29,544 --> 00:39:31,911
"that's not how it's gonna come
at you in a game, Pete."

503
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:35,497
I used to think he was just being
a big brother and he was picking on me.

504
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:38,954
But now I understand.

505
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:43,339
He just wanted me to be ready...

506
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:47,009
For anything.

507
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:57,403
I'm ready, brother.

508
00:40:00,032 --> 00:40:01,482
For whatever comes.

509
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,490
Detail, atten-hut!

510
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:20,334
Detail, halt!

511
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,666
Flag.

512
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,231
Ma'am, this flag is presented
on behalf of a grateful nation

513
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,442
for the honorable and faithful service
rendered by your loved one.

514
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:48,446
Thank you.

515
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,410
Ready.

516
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:04,248
Aim.

517
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:05,715
Fire!

518
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,348
Honor, hut!
