1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,750
Previously on heroes

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,410
I must wipe your memory

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,030
Hiro...How old do you think you are?

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,140
I'm 10

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,840
This is going to tell us what was supposed to do

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,680
Can we leave Matt out of this?

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,650
If you are unhappy, we can always arrange you to return you to your formal life

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,150
Just tell me how am I supposed to do

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,460
Stay with parkman

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,020
I came here looking for you and what I find,you are waiting for me

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,030
That's kidda mean something,right

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,070
You saved my life once，elle.

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,470
Don't you see I owe you

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,780
I forgive you

15
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,530
Now you need to forgive yourself

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,670
Auther has probably figured out by now

17
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,930
There's a third piece of the formula

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,110
The catalyst,

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,310
Hidden away in the blood of a human host

20
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,930
I think I'm the catalyst

21
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,370
I see we share a facination

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,060
It seems most of the powers I've documented

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,050
Took place during the last total-annular eclipse.

24
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,940
There's a moment in every war

25
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,260
When everything chages

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,400
The moment when the road bents

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,700
Alliances and battle line shift

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,520
And the rules of engagement rewritten

29
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,500
Moments like these can change the nature of battle

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,330
And turn the time

31
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,050
Bright the sight

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,260
So we do what we can

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,120
To understand them

34
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,380
To be ready for change

35
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,060
We study our hearts,

36
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,990
Curb our fears,master our forces and look for signs

37
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,850
And the starts

38
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,040
But these moments

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,070
These game changes

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,800
Remain a mystery.

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Destiny's invisible hand

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,800
Moving pieces on a chessboard.

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,400
No matter how much we prepare for them,

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
How much we resist the change, anticipate the moment,

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,800
Fight the inevitable outcome.

46
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,800
In the end, we're never truly ready,

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,400
When it strikes.

48
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,300
You're getting pretty good at that.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,700
Well, it's not as easy as you make it look.

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,200
You'll get there. Don't sweat it.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,100
Yeah, well, I need to get there now.

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,500
I have to prove myself.

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,000
To who?

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,900
Nobody. I'm not sure that you'd understand.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,900
Okay.

56
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,700
Then let's go again.

57
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,000
Gabriel.

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,400
I need you to do something.

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,900
Find claire bennet,

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
Bring her back to me.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,100
You think you can do that?

62
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,800
Yes, sir. Of course I can.

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm going too.

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
What?

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
Well, they're not gonna make it easy for you,

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,100
Getting claire.

67
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
You need help.

68
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,900
And I was raised to be a company girl.

69
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,100
But I thought you'd left all that behind you.

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Well, it's all I know.

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,000
You need help.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,300
Let me help you.

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
You okay with this, dad?

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I think the two of you together,

75
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,300
It's a good pairing.

76
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,500
Let's go get the cheerleader.

77
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,900
Why is it always me?

78
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,100
You're the catalyst.

79
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,200
Arthur's formula doesn't work without you.

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,600
I have a plan, but we all have

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,500
To work together to stop him.

82
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,100
Okay, so where's everyone else?

83
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,700
Nathan's going to find the haitian.

84
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,300
Matt parkman will get hiro nakamura.

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,700
And you, claire, have the most important part to play.

86
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,300
Great. What's my assignment?

87
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,400
Your assignment is to keep from getting caught.

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Just stay out of harm's way.

89
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,900
But I can fight.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
I can do more. I can be more.

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
The only place you're going to be

92
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,300
Is underground, off the grid.

93
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,100
No! No way!

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,200
I am done hiding.

95
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,500
We all have to make sacrifices.

96
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,900
What are you gonna do? Lock me up?

97
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Don't think it hasn't crossed my mind.

98
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,500
But, no,

99
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,600
I have another plan.

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Hi, claire-bear.

101
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,200
It's too dangerous for you to go there alone.

102
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
I'm just going down there to get the haitian,

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Then I'm coming right back.

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,300
The haitian's there to hunt down

105
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,500
Level five escapees.

106
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
This guy, baron samedi, look.

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,300
Baron?

108
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,800
No, it's a alias. Voodoo god of death.

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,100
This guy's into some bad stuff.

110
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,200
Drug trafficking, kidnapping, slavery.

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
I'm telling you, nathan, you're gonna need some help.

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,000
Hey, I'm not going down there to save the country.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
Look, hey, just--

114
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,900
You don't understand.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,200
Then help me out.

116
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,300
When I found my abilities,

117
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
I knew who I was supposed to be.

118
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,400
Okay? But now--

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,000
Pete, just because you don't have your abilities--

120
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,600
It doesn't mean you don't have a purpose.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,800
It will if you don't take me with you.

122
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Nathan.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
All right.

124
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,700
Come on.

125
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I need the catalyst.

126
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,300
You said you would have it by now.

127
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,900
You said you were going to cure me!

128
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,700
I've got people on it,

129
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,300
But all our plans might be for nothing.

130
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,700
What are you talking about?

131
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,500
I drew that.

132
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
It's going to happen today.

133
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,800
This is claire bennet.

134
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
She can't die. It's impossible.

135
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,700
That's my point.

136
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,200
It can't happen, but it's going to.

137
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,200
You're the scientist.

138
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,700
You tell me how.

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
There's an eclipse today.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,900
Yes.

141
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,800
When I first noticed abilities manifesting,

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
There was an eclipse.

143
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,600
A global event.

144
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
You said it was a coincidence.

145
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, I thought it was, but--

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,700
But what? What does it mean?

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
Look, I don't know!

148
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,800
But I do know if claire bennet dies,

149
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,100
Then the catalyst dies with her

150
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,900
And there's no hope for me being cured.

151
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
That explains this.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm going to die.

153
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Everything's going to change today.

154
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
I don't understand what hiro nakamura

155
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,500
Has to do with any of this.

156
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,900
Angela made our orders very clear.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah, the guy's a spaz.

158
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,600
No, he's a time traveler.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,500
If arthur petrelli has us on the ropes,

160
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,000
The man is a walking do-over.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I know I had hiro's number in his dad's homicide file.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Are you nervous about something?

163
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
Arthur petrelli scares me.

164
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
Oh, you don't have to be scared about him.

165
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Of course I do!

166
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,800
He can take away abilities, and I betrayed him!

167
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
I betrayed you.

168
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,900
No. No, you didn't.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,100
I'm a betrayer.

170
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,900
What?

171
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,600
And a liar and a thief and--

172
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,100
I am selfish. You know, honestly,

173
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,100
I don't understand why you keep me around!

174
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
Because you're one of the good guys now.

175
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,800
So, you trust me? Yes!

176
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,100
Completely?

177
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,400
Yes, I trust you completely.

178
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,800
I know you, daphne.

179
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
No, you say that,

180
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
But you don't know me, not really.

181
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,600
We had a life together.

182
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,800
In a dream.

183
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,300
It was a spirit walk.

184
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,200
It wasn't real!

185
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,900
Arthur killed your father.

186
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,500
He could kill us all or worse!

187
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

188
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,700
I promise.

189
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,800
Please, just help me find hiro.

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Come on.

191
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
How are you gonna do that exactly?

192
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,600
That guy's a freakin' teleporter.

193
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,100
Hey, I need your help. You have to fix hiro.

194
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,300
Look.

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,300
What does it say?

196
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,000
It says, "you have to fix hiro."

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Arthur petrelli erased his memory.

198
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,700
He now thinks he's 10 years old.

199
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh, it's back there.

200
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,300
We're all gonna die.

201
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,500
This is stephen canfield's house.

202
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,300
You'll be safe here. Out of harm's way.

203
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,000
The last time we were here,

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We almost got sucked into a black hole.

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,700
What makes it so safe now?

206
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Simple set-up. Controllable.

207
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Yeah, I know how you like to control things.

208
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,500
Okay, I'll bite. What does that mean?

209
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,400
It means you'll do whatever it takes

210
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
To keep the catalyst safe, right?

211
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,200
I want to keep you safe, claire.

212
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,500
You.

213
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,400
Not some catalyst.

214
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,700
Do you understand?

215
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,370
I understand

216
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,900
Aren't you dead?

217
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,800
Yeah, you would like that.

218
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,600
What's your game, nemesis?

219
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
I'm not a nemesis anymore.

220
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm a good guy now.

221
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,400
I can't help him.

222
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,900
I can't understand him.

223
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,400
Well, arthur really did a number on hiro.

224
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,900
He really thinks he's 10.

225
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,500
So get inside his head and fix him.

226
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,400
I don't think I can.

227
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
He's thinking in japanese.

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,500
But the comic book says that you--

229
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,300
I don't know what to tell you.

230
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,500
This is way beyond me.

231
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,900
Hiro is our reset button.

232
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,400
Our walking do-over, remember?

233
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I know, but he still can time-travel,

234
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
He can teleport,

235
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
And he's still very powerful.

236
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,400
I can't-- I can't do this.

237
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm sorry. I got to get out of here.

238
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,400
What? What are you talking about?

239
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Daphne!

240
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
You paused. What?

241
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,900
When I asked you if you trust me,

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
You paused.

243
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,600
No. No, I didn't.

244
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,100
I'm a speedster.

245
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,400
Fractions of seconds feel like hours to me

246
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,800
And you paused.

247
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,700
You don't know me

248
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,300
And you don't know what I've been through!

249
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
What is that supposed to mean?

250
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,500
Daphne, come on

251
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,700
Matt--

252
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,800
Lawrence, kansas.

253
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,900
Stop reading my mind! What's in kansas? Come on.

254
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Just back off! Your home.

255
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,700
Leave me alone!

256
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,220
Cool! Do it again,do it again

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,900
Yes, sir. It'll all be taken care of.

258
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,500
Who was on the phone?

259
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Arthur.

260
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,000
Just updating him on our status.

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
He thinks claire's with her father.

262
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Ugh. Glasses himself.

263
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,800
Scary. He's not gonna make this any easier.

264
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
Actually, he is.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
I didn't want him to get inside my head

266
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,900
So he could kill me, but it worked both ways.

267
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,700
I know how he thinks.

268
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,200
I know where he'll hide her.

269
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,900
I'm worried about you.

270
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,600
All these "yes, sirs"

271
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,000
And checking in like a good little boy.

272
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm just tryingg to be responsible.

273
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,700
Oh, sure.

274
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,200
Responsible.

275
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,600
Where is this damn rental car guy?

276
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,500
Probably calling the police

277
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Because I told him you were a serial killer

278
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,100
And that you kidnapped me.

279
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,400
You must be joking. Why the hell would you do that?

280
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,500
Because I'm trying to help you.

281
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Because it was wrong of the company

282
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,900
To hide our abilities.

283
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,500
Because we can do whatever we want.

284
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,100
We can take whatever we want.

285
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,200
Trust me.

286
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Come on, we're going.

287
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,800
You're not going anywhere!

288
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,300
Oh, god! Oh, help!

289
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,600
Please, help. Please.

290
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,300
Let go of the girl.

291
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,900
Thank you. Oh, god, thank you.

292
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,400
Oh, my god. Thank you.

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,300
Sir, please, put down the gun.

294
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,100
You really don't understand what's happening here.

295
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,600
She filled me in pretty good,

296
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
You serially-killing

297
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Scum of the earth.

298
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
They're all trying to make you into something.

299
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
A boy scout.

300
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,200
A monster.

301
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,600
Who's it gonna be, huh? Who are you really?

302
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,500
Shut up.

303
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,900
I should kill you right now.

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,700
Say it was self-defense.

305
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,900
I'll be famous.

306
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,500
A bona fide hero.

307
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,540
I hate heroes

308
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,500
What does this eclipse mean?

309
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,700
And how could it possibly affect us?

310
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,100
The moon controls the ocean's waves,

311
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,600
The sun our internal timing,

312
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,200
But something is happening to me.

313
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm changing.

314
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,000
I can feel it.

315
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,200
And I can't control it.

316
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,900
What's this for?

317
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,100
Hit me with it.

318
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,300
You wanted me to train you, let's do it.

319
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,600
Right here, right now.

320
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,600
Is this how you get over your guilt?

321
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,100
Because I've been just fine without you.

322
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,300
Have you?

323
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,700
I caught the puppet guy.

324
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,300
Yeah, you got lucky,

325
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,700
And you almost got your mother killed.

326
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
These are serious, dangerous criminals.

327
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,300
I know! You're not acting like it.

328
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,200
What am I acting like?

329
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,500
Like a girl who can't get hurt! Stupid and careless!

330
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,700
What do you know?

331
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,400
You're the one who left, remember?

332
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,300
My absence does not give you license to act like a brat.

333
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,700
I have been trying to do something good

334
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,600
With my abilities.

335
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,200
And I'm trying to keep you safe.

336
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,500
I don't need your help!

337
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,700
Then hit me!

338
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,100
I said hit me!

339
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
The good news is

340
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,100
You've certainly got the strength.

341
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,800
The bad news is

342
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,700
You're clumsy, slow, and obvious.

343
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,400
Thanks.

344
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,600
This time,

345
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,500
Get your body weight into it.

346
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
That way all the power will be on the other end of the board.

347
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,900
Okay, let's go again.

348
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,600
What is this, tae-kwon-do?

349
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,300
No, it's baseball.

350
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,500
Let's go again.

351
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,300
It's tracy.

352
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Nathan's veering off plan.

353
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,900
He's gone to find this haitian guy.

354
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
That's smart, using the haitian against me.

355
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,500
We can't have that.

356
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,300
You're not gonna hurt him?

357
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,200
I'm learning today

358
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,900
There are some things out of my control.

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,900
What is that supposed to mean?

360
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,500
It's time for nathan to see the world

361
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,100
For what it really is.

362
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,400
Look, I agreed to help you because you said

363
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
That we could get nathan into the white house.

364
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,900
You need him, arthur.

365
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,200
So do you.

366
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,100
I need you to go to parris island.

367
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,900
Use those connections you've got.

368
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,300
I don't take orders from you.

369
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,200
If you watch your way into the oval office,

370
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,600
You'll do exactly as I say.

371
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,400
Parris island?

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,900
The marine training facility?

373
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,000
Every war needs an army.

374
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
Washington.

375
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,700
I guess there's no rest for the wicked.

376
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,700
Obviously not.

377
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,400
I need hiro to help me find daphne.

378
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,400
But she stole the formula. She's a villain.

379
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,800
No, she's not. She's just scared.

380
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,400
Of what?

381
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,300
I don't know, I don't know. But I've got to find out.

382
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,400
I told her that I doubted her.

383
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,200
I practically packed her bags for her.

384
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,500
Look, we need to help hiro,

385
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,400
Get him back to normal, stop arthur petrelli--

386
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
But it'll only take a minute.

387
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,600
All he has to do is teleport me

388
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,400
To lawrence, kansas, I grab daphne--

389
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,940
Lawrence, kansas.

390
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,910
Lawrence, kansas.

391
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,500
Yes, that's us. We're in a corn field.

392
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,100
She told me that she grew up on a corn farm.

393
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,600
Corn farm? Yeah.

394
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,930
Let's go to the corn farm

395
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,800
Lawrence, kansas.Let's go

396
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,900
Holy crap, it worked.

397
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,600
This is it. This is daphne's house.

398
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,300
I can hear her thoughts. She's in there.

399
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,600
Holy crap!

400
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,910
Hey,guys

401
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,750
It's starting

402
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,000
Pete!

403
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,900
Pete, you all right?

404
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,400
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

405
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,500
Are you?

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm good.

407
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,300
What happened?

408
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,100
I don't know.

409
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,500
I was flying and then I wasn't.

410
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,300
I was falling really fast.

411
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,500
And now?

412
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,900
Nothing. I can't fly.

413
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,400
Hey, wasn't there an eclipse that first day you flew?

414
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,600
Yeah. So?

415
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
So, you don't find that significant?

416
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
The guy we're looking for, the haitian,

417
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,900
He takes powers away.

418
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
Maybe he saw us coming. I don't know.

419
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,500
Maybe it's this whole damn country.

420
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,900
We got to find him.

421
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,000
Come on, let's make tracks.

422
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

423
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,200
What the hell are these? Voodoo dolls?

424
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,600
Huh? No, they're called pwen.

425
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,500
They're messengers.

426
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,500
Prayers for salvation. Redemption.

427
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,800
Let's go.

428
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,700
Looking at the map,

429
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,300
Haitian's village is this way.

430
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
I saw it from two clicks up.

431
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,500
We were falling.

432
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,300
Yeah. It's still this way.

433
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,200
Hey, are you gonna--

434
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,400
Don't you want--

435
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,000
Something I can do for you?

436
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
Hi. Yeah, um--

437
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm a friend of daphne's.

438
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,900
Can I talk to her for a second?

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,300
Daphne's not here.

440
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
Daphne, I know you're inside!

441
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Come on, I just need a minute.

442
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,900
Go away, matt.

443
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,300
Like I said, she's not home.

444
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,400
Why don't you just let me inside?

445
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
Are you threatening me?

446
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Uh, I said...

447
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,700
Let me in.

448
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,200
Why are you turning your head sideways?

449
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,100
What's your problem, son?

450
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,700
Psst! What happened?

451
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,000
My-- my powers are gone.

452
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,230
His powers are gone

453
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,050
Nothing.No powers!

454
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,400
His also.

455
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,600
What's going on?

456
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,100
Are you gonna tell me who that was?

457
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Nope.

458
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
I'm not asking a lot of questions here.

459
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,900
And I appreciate that.

460
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,000
But you've been gone a long time.

461
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,200
It's my home. Can't I just come home?

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,700
Are you feeling okay?

463
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,600
No.

464
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,300
It's happening again.

465
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Ah, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

466
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,500
Do you still have them?

467
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,400
Yeah, I'll go get 'em.

468
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,600
All right, all right. If we double back,

469
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
We should be able to make it to the village in an hour.

470
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,200
You're not even gonna admit you were wrong.

471
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,200
You really want to get into this now?

472
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,400
Come on.

473
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,800
You've got to stop treating me

474
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,100
Like your idiot kid brother.

475
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,300
You read the map right. Congratulations.

476
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,200
I wish I could fly.

477
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,300
But you can't.

478
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,200
That's right, I'm powerless just like you.

479
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,300
Hey, if it wasn't for me, you'd be lost and alone!

480
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,800
If it wasn't for you, I'd be home by now.

481
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,600
I only brought you down here to protect your fragile ego.

482
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,300
You know what? I don't need your pity.

483
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,700
No, but you know what you do need?

484
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,800
My help.

485
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,000
I've been saving your ass my entire life.

486
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,900
Is that so? That's right.

487
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
When you jumped off that roof like a moron,

488
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
Who caught you?

489
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,200
Who pulled you out of kirby plaza

490
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,800
When you were about to blow up?

491
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
You want my respect? You want my approval?

492
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,700
Earn it!

493
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,800
Why would I want your respect?

494
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,100
You're a puppet!

495
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Excuse me?

496
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,800
You have no spine.

497
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,100
I'm a u.S. Senator. You're a nurse.

498
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,900
You're everything that dad ever wanted you to be.

499
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,300
His dreams, huh? His goals.

500
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,100
He could always find a way to get under your skin

501
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,600
And manipulate you and use you.

502
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,500
Where's this coming from?

503
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,300
In the future, you choose him.

504
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,500
You choose dad, nathan.

505
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,200
Well, I'm down here right now, pete.

506
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
I'm trying to stop him.

507
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,600
Now help me.

508
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,100
Good! Control first, follow through second.

509
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,600
You feel that power?

510
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,900
Again.

511
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,400
Tell me what you're thinking.

512
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
No.

513
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,800
All right, tap into that anger.

514
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
It'll give you strength.

515
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,000
Here, take a swing at me now.

516
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,700
I don't want to swing at you.

517
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,800
Come on. Swing at me!

518
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,500
See if you can hit me.

519
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,100
Let's go.

520
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,500
Come on.

521
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,100
You're not even trying, claire.

522
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,600
Tell me what you're thinking.

523
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,100
Every time you would come home from a trip,

524
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,700
I'd always hug you as hard as I could.

525
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,000
Because I thought if I held you tight enough,

526
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,800
You wouldn't leave me again.

527
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Why did you always leave?!

528
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,100
I need to get some air.

529
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,200
Claire, wait a minute. Let's talk about this.

530
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,600
No, I didn't mean to bring it up.

531
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,800
Just forget it.

532
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,800
Hey, girls.

533
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,200
You have the haitian in here?

534
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,100
No, just me.

535
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,300
Back out of the house, now.

536
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,900
You're not getting claire.

537
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Funny story.

538
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,300
We are.

539
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,100
Claire, stay back!

540
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,200
Claire!

541
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,500
Sandra!

542
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,800
Oh, my god. What happened?

543
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,700
She got shot.

544
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,600
Why isn't she healing? I don't know.

545
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,800
Something's wrong. Her abilities aren't working.

546
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,200
We have to get her to a hospital.

547
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,900
No!

548
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,100
They report gunshot wounds to the police.

549
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,300
They'll ask questions.

550
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,100
She is bleeding! She is hurt!

551
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm calling 911.

552
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,700
And what happens when her healing comes back?

553
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,300
Noah--

554
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,200
This is a surface wound.

555
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,200
We can deal with it. Hang up the phone, please!

556
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,500
I'll get the first aid kit.

557
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,700
Thank you.

558
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,800
What happened?

559
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,200
I don't know. I wish I did.

560
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,500
Maybe you were right.

561
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
I've been stupid, careless.

562
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
I thought I was invulnerable.

563
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,400
Claire, you shouldn't have--

564
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,600
It hurts.

565
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
I never thought I'd be able to hurt again.

566
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,800
Uhh, it sucks,

567
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
But it's wonderful.

568
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Thank you for saving my life.

569
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,300
Anytime.

570
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,160
Nothing, No powers.

571
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,300
Still no powers.

572
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,200
Yeah, that much I get.

573
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,000
Why is this happening? How do we get it back?

574
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,600
Maybe daphne was right. Maybe arthur took them away.

575
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,800
You know, I never, ever thought

576
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,100
That I would miss my--

577
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,600
Right now, all I want to do

578
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,100
Is just know what's going on inside her head.

579
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,000
What are we supposed to do?

580
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,070
Do? You must do what you came here to do!

581
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,900
He says you must save daphne.

582
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,700
I can't!

583
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,000
I...Can't!

584
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,300
Not without my brain thingy.

585
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,780
He says he can't.

586
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,220
He can't?

587
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,800
What?

588
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,710
This is a part of the Hero's Quest.

589
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,400
Can you triumph without powers?

590
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,300
Can you triumph without powers?

591
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,800
Hey, seriously, dude, stop it.

592
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,320
He's going to hurt you.

593
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,900
How do you say "stop it"?

594
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,430
You must not doubt your mission.

595
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,100
The corn will keep on coming.

596
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,930
Only you have the power to stop it.

597
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,300
You must not doubt!

598
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,530
See! You did it!

599
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,250
Please don't hurt me.

600
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm not gonna hurt you.

601
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,400
I'm gonna save daphne.

602
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,220
He's going to save her.

603
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,390
Holy crap

604
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
While he's doing that...

605
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,520
We will get our abilities back.

606
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,010
You can do that?

607
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,130
I have a plan.

608
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,810
Where did you learn all that stuff about the corn and the Hero's Quest?

609
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,310
Saturday Samurai Matinee Showdown.

610
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,330
We've reached the end of the comic book.

611
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,440
We must find the next issue.

612
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,650
How?

613
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,270
Every town and city around the world...

614
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,980
Has a place where the wise men gather.

615
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,860
The Greek oracle at Delphi. The Library at Alexandria.

616
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,920
The hall of Justice.

617
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,870
How do we know where to find them?

618
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,280
Just trust me...

619
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,900
It's a miracle.

620
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,700
Complete remission.

621
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,900
All effects of the formula have disappeared.

622
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,500
Scales, abilities,

623
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,200
I have no idea how or why.

624
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,600
Some correlation to the eclipse?

625
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,600
Further study is warranted.

626
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,900
But not yet.

627
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,600
You're not going anywhere.

628
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Now we know the meaning of the eclipse.

629
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,700
Everyone's abilities have gone away.

630
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,200
You have to get them back.

631
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
I'm not sure that's entirely possible.

632
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,000
I mean, who knows what the implications

633
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,800
Of this event are?

634
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,200
They could be irreversible.

635
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
That's unacceptable.

636
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,100
What are you doing?!

637
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,600
Without abilities, I'm nobody.

638
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,300
I already been nobody.

639
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,600
You understand?

640
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,600
So, we gonna stay right here

641
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,800
Until you get it all back for us.

642
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,730
This is your plan?

643
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,510
She was right.

644
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,920
We'er all going to die.

645
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,830
No, we're not. It's Wednesday.

646
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,960
So?

647
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,760
New comic book day!

648
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,790
This comic got us this far...

649
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,110
The new one will tell us what's next.

650
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,800
Ask if they have the latest issue.

651
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Excuse me?

652
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,100
Be with you in a second. Don't worry.

653
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,900
We got plenty of red hulks for everybody.

654
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,700
Sam? Yeah?

655
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,300
Dude, this is so awesome.

656
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,410
All of our questions will be answered.

657
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,100
Is he always this quiet?

658
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,200
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

659
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,000
I really appreciate your help,

660
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,400
But we need to get you back home.

661
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,200
My father's alive.

662
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,600
Arthur's alive?

663
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,700
You're one of the only people who can stop him.

664
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,800
Now the sooner you take this juju off of me,

665
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,100
The sooner I can fly us home

666
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,200
And deal with him.

667
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,200
I'm not responsible for your condition.

668
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,300
My ability is gone as well.

669
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,100
The universe has decided our fate.

670
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,500
Can the universe get me a phone?

671
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,100
I can call the military, get us on a c-130,

672
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,000
Get this sorted.

673
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm not going anywhere until I stop samedi.

674
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,700
The guy from level five.

675
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,000
I am responsible for his evil.

676
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,400
He is my brother.

677
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,500
Like us, special.

678
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,500
His skin is impenetrable.

679
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
By knife, and by fire,

680
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,200
And by bullet.

681
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,000
Many people here believe him to be a god.

682
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,100
He uses fear to form an army.

683
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,900
They murdered, stole, kidnapped.

684
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I stopped him once, put him away, but now...

685
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,900
Hey, you can't do this on your own.

686
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Peter, this is not your fight.

687
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,200
You helped our family out once.

688
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,700
At least let us repay that favor.

689
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,100
Hey, look, all right, you proved

690
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,600
You can be brave, okay.

691
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,600
Don't be stupid. Think about it, nathan.

692
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,200
The only way to get this guy to come back home with us

693
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,400
Is if we help him stop his brother.

694
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,600
Look, if you're not gonna do this for the right reasons,

695
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,500
At least do it for the selfish ones.

696
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,500
Go! Go! Run!

697
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,000
Je m'appelle, nathan petrelli.

698
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,700
Je suis american.

699
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,500
We know all about you, senator nathan petrelli.

700
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,600
Your father warned us you'd come.

701
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
My father?

702
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,700
Yes.

703
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,100
What did he tell you?

704
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,500
He told me to be myself.

705
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,800
Hey, no fever.

706
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,400
You feeling okay?

707
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,700
Pretty good, all things considered.

708
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,800
We're gonna figure out what's happening to you.

709
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,800
But for now, you just rest.

710
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,500
I'll be right downstairs.

711
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,100
I love you, dad.

712
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,600
I love u, clair bear

713
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,500
No.

714
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,700
No what?

715
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,300
You're leaving, aren't you?

716
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,500
Do not leave your daughter. Not now.

717
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,800
She's fine.

718
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,700
She's scared.

719
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
She doesn't know what's happening.

720
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,500
She needs you.

721
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,200
Oh God, Claire

722
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000
Daphne?

723
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,600
Daphne, I'm not leaving until I talk to you.

724
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,100
Go away, matt.

725
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,100
No.

726
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,000
No, I came here because I know exactly who you are.

727
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,000
You are smart and beautiful

728
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,700
And funny.

729
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,500
I don't even care if the-- the spirit walk is all a bunk.

730
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,800
I'm not gonna--

731
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,700
I'm never gonna give up because--

732
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
Because I'm in love with you.

733
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,500
Daphne!

734
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,800
The door's open.

735
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,000
Daph?

736
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm in here.

737
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,900
I just didn't want you to see me like this.

738
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,900
Like what?

739
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,900
Like this.

740
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,300
Hi, sweetie.

741
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,700
Claire.

742
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Aah! Oh, god!

743
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,500
Oh, it hurts!

744
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,100
Well, it's gonna hurt forever

745
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,200
If I can't set it.

746
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,000
Stop being such a baby!

747
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,700
Oh, thanks.

748
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,500
What's happening to us?

749
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,700
I have no idea.

750
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,100
I used to understand everything, but...

751
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,500
Nothing makes sense.

752
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,100
We're just human.

753
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,700
You okay with that?

754
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,100
It's actually a relief.

755
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,800
I felt the hunger,

756
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,800
The need to have powers, so numbing.

757
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,900
My mind felt like it was full of cotton and ice.

758
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,800
I haven't felt like this since--

759
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,200
Since I first met you.

760
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,600
I pushed you to become that monster.

761
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,300
It's my fault. No.

762
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,500
You were just following orders,

763
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,300
A company girl.

764
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,800
Exactly! We're both so--

765
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,100
Powerless?

766
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,200
We can't take what we want anymore.

767
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,800
Says who?
