<i>Previously on </i>Heroes...

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:05,922
- Get out of my head.
- This is a dream.

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,883
- It's not a dream!
- I came to take you out of here.

4
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,969
In the dream, Emma, my friend...

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,179
You save her
before she kills thousands.

6
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,015
You really think you can get us out?

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,391
Let me see you try.

8
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:20,687
Charlie was my heart, my world,
my happily ever after.

9
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,481
I did everything I could
to try and save her life.

10
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,191
Where is Charlie?

11
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:28,319
I'm the only one who knows exactly
where your sweet Charlie is.

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,530
- Help him.
- It's our intent to prove

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,031
that he abused his power

14
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,452
to bend space and time
selfishly and repeatedly.

15
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,538


16
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,916


17
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,171
Showing my dad's memories
is gonna enlighten me?

18
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,382
- Don't do this.
- You're afraid she'll see the real you?

19
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,801
- You brought a gun.
- I was scared.

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,303
First time you ever killed.

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,805
You actually thought
that I would turn on him?

22
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,725
Claire Bennet needs some time
to think about my offer.

23
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,608
It's time to gather the family.
We're moving on to bigger things.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,485
The greatest show we've ever done.

25
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,238
Dad?

26
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,492
I'm here.

27
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,285
No signal.

28
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,997
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

29
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,374
Yeah, help me get these ropes off.

30
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,503
A lantern over there?

31
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,012
We're buried.

32
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,808
- How far down we are?
- It felt like we dropped 40 or 50 feet.

33
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,102
Can anyone hear us?

34
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,813
Anybody hear us?

35
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,199
Help!

36
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,992
Can anybody hear us?

37
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,330
- Anybody up there?
- Somebody help us!

38
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,084
Help!
Can anybody hear us?

39
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,919
Can you hear us out there?

41
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,744
How long has it been?

42
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,456
Half a day, maybe.

43
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,459
Feels like we were in there
for years.

44
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,507
- Is your buddy Samuel here with you?
- Came alone this time...

45
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,508
so to speak.

46
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,762
- What do you want?
- Samuel asked me to make sure

47
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,264
your friends downstairs
aren't a problem for us.

48
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,308
I guess that means you too.

49
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:52,732
Sorry to break up the lovefest.

50
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,111
Come on.

51
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,740
You're having doubts.

52
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,952
Look at you.
Come on, I can tell.

53
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,537
You don't want to do this.

54
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,456
What I want doesn't matter.

55
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,084
I have no choice.

56
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,212
Don't bother.
We got you outnumbered.

57
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,133
<i>You want to leave, right now.</i>

58
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,596
Are you trying to push a thought?

59
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,183
All but one of us are pretty...
thoughtless.

60
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,613
Tonight will be a night
unlike any other.

61
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,657
Tonight...

62
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,661
we change everything.

63
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,000
We've been shamed into believing
we're second-class citizens.

64
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,753
When the truth is,
we're king of the hill!

65
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,758
They should aspire to be like us,
not the other way around.

66
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,343
That's right.

67
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,388
And so I make this pledge to you.

68
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,224
Tonight...

69
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,310
once and for all...

70
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:16,149
we pull back the curtain
and reveal ourselves for who we are.

71
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,112
After tonight, we will be...

72
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,448
respected.

73
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,653
Come on!

74
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,698
Don't.
Think about what you're doing.

75
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,618
Don't do this!

76
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,582
Don't!

77
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,631
You okay?

78
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,718
Sit.

79
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,723
Just dislocated.

80
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,183
Awesome.

81
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,981
What the hell is he doing here?

82
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,122


83
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,207
There you are.

84
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,792
Time for your solo.

85
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,795


86
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,506
How do you think
all the people are gonna find us?

87
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,550
You're gonna bring them here.

88
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,221
I told you you had a unique gift.
It's time to put it to use.

89
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,891


90
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,184
What dream?

91
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,895


92
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,564


93
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,234
Thousands of people will die.

94
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,240
He was right about you.

95
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,579
You disappoint me, Emma.

96
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,749
You can't force me to do anything.

97
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,424
I would have preferred
you were a willing participant,

98
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,801
but these things happen.

99
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,388
She's all yours, Mr. Doyle.

100
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,390
I've always had a thing...

101
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,184
for blondes.

102
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,529


103
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,365


104
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,493


105
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,163


106
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,415


107
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,292


108
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,003


109
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,339


110
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,673


111
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,342


112
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,553


113
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,472


114
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,558


115
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,770


116
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,688


117
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,817


118
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,444


119
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,403


120
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,238


121
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,952
Excuse me.
Hiro Nakamura?

122
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,497
The woman in room 1106
asked me to give this to you.

123
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,961
<i></i>

124
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,798


125
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,176
I trapped him in a nightmare.

126
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,011
What's he doing out?
You did this.

127
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,805
It's a long story.

128
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,350
We need to know what Samuel
is planning, when and where.

129
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,227
Thousands of people are in danger.

130
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,187
Get in his head.
Tell us what you see.

131
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,398
So you run off
and be superheroes together?

132
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,818
This is ridiculous.
Come on, he's a monster.

133
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,445
- You actually trust him?
- You want something done?

134
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,288
Samuel's gonna show the world
his powers...

135
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,207
New York City...

136
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,335
Central Park, tonight.

137
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:47,920
"Show his power?"

138
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,965
Samuel's gonna open up the ground,
kill them all, bury them.

139
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,050
Sounds like a plan
I used to come up with.

140
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,011
You say that
like it wasn't yesterday.

141
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,390
I'm not that person anymore.
I know it's hard to understand.

142
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,686
- We got what we needed. Let's go.
- You won't go anywhere.

143
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,063
You leave with Sylar,
people are gonna end up dead.

144
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,107
That'll be on you.
I can't let that happen.

145
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,525
Let's go.

146
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,403
I won't anywhere.

147
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,072
- What are you talking about?
- That would be me.

148
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,116
I can still push a thought.

149
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,827
I told you,
I'm not letting him out of here.

150
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,004
We're too deep.

151
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,383
We're not.

152
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,137
We can dig our way out.
It might take a while, but...

153
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,729
We'll run out of oxygen.

154
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,982
The more we dig,
the faster we'll run out of air.

155
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,984
Or more precisely,

156
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,863
the faster I'll run out of air.
Your lungs will keep regenerating.

157
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,658
What are you saying?

158
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:00,701
It's futile.

159
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,288
What do you mean "futile?"
We have to find some way out of here.

160
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,627
I think I know why Samuel
put you down here with me.

161
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,963
So you could watch me die.

162
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,081
Lure them in.

163
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,095


164
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,638


165
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,015


166
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,769
Excuse me.

167
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,312
My God.

168
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,316
When I saw the nurse's chart
said "Hiro Nakamura,"

169
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,693
I couldn't believe it.

170
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,279
It's been an awful long time, Hiro,

171
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,656
ever since the <i>Burnt Toast Diner</i>,

172
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,950
65 years ago.

173
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,711
We have to focus.
We have to think of something.

174
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,422
You have a plan.
I know you have a plan.

175
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,424
- What is it?
- There is no plan.

176
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,885
I need to talk about what you saw
in the house of mirrors.

177
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,096
- Why?
- Because you're gonna survive this.

178
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,640
If it takes a month,

179
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,017
you will get out of here.

180
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,269
I'm not going to.

181
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,187
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

182
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,190
And there are things
that I need to say.

183
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,692
What you saw up there, all of it,

184
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,528
it's all true,
but it's not the whole truth.

185
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,863
Don't do this.

186
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,657
We're all products
of our own experiences, good and bad.

187
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,035
Everything that's happened to me
has made me who I am,

188
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,955
- but it can't explain what I've become.
- You're my dad for better or for worse!

189
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:12,499
Don't protect me, Claire!
That's my job.

190
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,669
To protect me?
From the rest of the world?

191
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,961
Yes, exactly.

192
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,090
That's why you believe
people like me

193
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,634
can't live out in the open.

194
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,678
It doesn't matter
what I believe anymore,

195
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,098
because the whole world...

196
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,392
is about to find out about you.

197
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,562
We can thank Samuel for that.

198
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,233
Maybe it won't be so bad.

199
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,237
Maybe the world is more ready
than you think it is.

200
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,280
Things change.

201
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,324
Sure.

202
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,953
There might be curiosity for a while,
but all it takes is one Sylar,

203
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,040
and then the pitchforks come out,
and all hell breaks loose.

204
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,208
I've seen it.

205
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,795
They will turn on you.
It's human nature.

206
00:13:58,545 --> 00:13:59,630
You're right.

207
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,548
Things change...

208
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,677
but people don't.

209
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,311
Sylar killed your brother.
He killed Nathan.

210
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:17,481
- I've repented.
- Yeah, during the nightmare.

211
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,399
That lasted a couple hours?

212
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,777
Not to us.
That was five years.

213
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,196
You heard what Samuel's planning.
We can stop him.

214
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,032
I don't expect you to understand
what happened in that nightmare.

215
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,160
- I don't expect you to forgive me.
- Good, that'll never happen.

216
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,162
I've done so much wrong
to many people.

217
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,915
Just give me a chance
to redeem myself.

218
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,256
I was inside your head,
I know what it takes to be good.

219
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,133
Go inside mine.

220
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,635
And you make the call.

221
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,246
You see it.

222
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,292
Right here.

223
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:21,670
What I saw was inside
your twisted mind.

224
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,548
That wasn't your heart.

225
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,218
I can prove it.

226
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,722
Just give me a chance.

227
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,809
You need to trust us.

228
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,817
Fine.
Just get the hell out of my home.

229
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,403
Let's go.

230
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,494
<i>Now you are going to do exactly
what I tell you to do.</i>

231
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,111
Emma's doing an incredible job.
It's quite a crowd.

232
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,197
They've all come out to see us.

233
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,992
See us do what?
Our acts?

234
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,245
What else would I be referring to?

235
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,460
Those news cameras...

236
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,048
- you invite them too?
- The world needs to meet us.

237
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:52,010
It's the biggest show
we've ever done.

238
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,347
You seem nervous.

239
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,224
Are you?

240
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,309
Excited.

241
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,772
Tonight changes everything...

242
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,525
for all of us.

243
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,617
He was there waiting
as I left the <i>Burnt Toast</i> that day.

244
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,662
Some old man said
he was a friend of Samuel Sullivan,

245
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,581
put his hand on my shoulder.

246
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,751
Next thing I knew,
I was on a street corner in Milwaukee.

247
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,422
It was January 26, 1944.

248
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,549
It was cold.

249
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,135
I was scared.

250
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,096
I didn't know a soul,
and I missed you.

251
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:41,393
- And you lived all this time.
- I got a job in a munitions factory.

252
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,145
All the girls did back then.

253
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,981
Did you realize it takes
108 pounds of rivets

254
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,525
to hold the wing
of a P-51 Mustang in place?

255
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,778
Unless, of course,
you use the 14-gauge

256
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,613
instead of the 16-gauge...

257
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,365
I'm so sorry.

258
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,410
This was all my fault.
I led the Evil Butterfly Man to you.

259
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,206
It is because I loved you
that he sent you away.

260
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,807
When I said
I was the product of my experiences,

261
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,435
I left out the most important part.

262
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,312
You.

263
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,941
You came into my life,

264
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,610
and you changed everything.

265
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:37,407
The man you saw in those memories
could never have died a happy man.

266
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,160
But I can, because of you.

267
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,704
Don't say that.

268
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,918
Try to find a way to forgive me.

269
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,882
I don't need to forgive you.

270
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,802
I need to thank you.

271
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,431
I am who I am because of you.

272
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,809
I love you.

273
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,064
I love you too, Claire bear.

274
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,444
So I want you
to promise me something...

275
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,031
that you'll hide.

276
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,782
What?

277
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,160
The world doesn't have
to know about you.

278
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,578
You can stay in.

279
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,205
You can blend in.

280
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,749
You can pass.
You know how to do it.

281
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,169
We don't have to do this.
We can find a way out.

282
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,173
I want you to promise me
you'll stay hidden.

283
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,092
Claire, please.

284
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,428
It's my dying wish.

285
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,223
Please, promise me.

286
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:44,975
Dad?

287
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,395
Dad!

288
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,098
- I don't know what to do. He's dying.
- Not if I can help it.

289
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:26,224
Dad.

290
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,060
Dad.

291
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,855
We have to get you
through 30 feet of dirt.

292
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,608
Ready?

293
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,901
Come on.

294
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,617
- You're gonna owe me one.
- He will as soon as we get out of here.

295
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,705
I hope you can swim.

296
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,778
Dad. You okay?

297
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:23,073
- Tracy saved us.
- I know. I called her.

298
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,077
- Carnival's gone?
- They're in New York, Central Park.

299
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,287
I lined up a chopper
to take us into Manhattan.

300
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,622
It'll be here any...

301
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:33,125
second.

302
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,255
- Where is she?
- She said you owe her one.

303
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,675
We've got to go.

304
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,764
Don't beat yourself up.

305
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:50,892
I would have waited for you,
but by the time you were born,

306
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,269
I was middle-aged.

307
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,106
I'm just so happy
I got to see you before...

308
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,651
You're not well.

309
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,111
The good news is...

310
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,822
that brain aneurysm
never bothered me again

311
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,032
after your weird doctor friend
cured me.

312
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,410
Unfortunately,

313
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,122
pretty much everything
else is about to give out.

314
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,254
I can fix this.

315
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,339
Fix this?

316
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,717
How do you mean?

317
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:26,261
I can fix everything.

318
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,434
I'm sorry.
Will you excuse us for one minute?

319
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,192


320
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,027


321
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,572


322
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,868


323
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,621


324
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,165


325
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,166


326
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,212


327
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,264


328
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,287
He's done it.
He's brought in thousands of people.

329
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,873
This is gonna be a massacre.

330
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,336
We got to find the backstage area.
You know where it is?

331
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,089
- It's back that way.
- All right, let's split up.

332
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,216
You go that way,
and I'll head off this way.

333
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,927
Be careful.

334
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,680
You too.

335
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,813
This way.

336
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,819
Wait...

337
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,406
- The dream.
- What?

338
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,367
All these people, they're all here,
like lambs to the slaughter.

339
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,119
It's not gonna happen.

340
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,539
Go find Samuel.
I'll save them.

341
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,461
Your dream said I save her.

342
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:27,007
Trust me.

343
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,682
It's an emergency.

344
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,727
Tell Hiro he needs to get here
as fast as he can.

345
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,606
Where do you think you're going?

346
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,584
Don't worry.
I've come to save you.

347
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,099
What brings you to the Big Apple?

348
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,659
Everybody.

349
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,203
Everybody listen to me, please.

350
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,623
We need to get you
far away from Samuel.

351
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,999
You don't belong here.

352
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,335
I know what he told you
about tonight,

353
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,046
that you're coming out
and that you'll live out in the open.

354
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,090
And trust me, there is nobody
who wants that more than me.

355
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:54,219
But this is not your coming-out party.
This is his.

356
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:58,056
Look who finally came up for air.
What are you doing here?

357
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,352
- You're not part of this family.
- You're right. I'm not.

358
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,770
But let me ask.

359
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,314
Does your family know
what you're planning to do?

360
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,446
Why don't you tell them?

361
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,531
He's gonna kill
all of those people out there.

362
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:18,243
That's how he's gonna
introduce you to the world.

363
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,744
Why would he do that?

364
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,205
He's given us all new life.

365
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,833
If he hadn't found me,
I'd still be living out in that park.

366
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,835
Homeless.

367
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,589
They know the truth.

368
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:35,427
Tonight is our night.

369
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,392
I never wanted to hurt your family.

370
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,896
Ask yourself if that's true of Samuel.
He killed his own brother.

371
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,317
I'm only here to stop him
from murdering a lot of other people.

372
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,029
Then you and I have the same goal.

373
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,951
I can't kill him
in front of the others.

374
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,163
And you strike me
as the kind of man with a plan.

375
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,790
So what do we do?

376
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,048
It's simple.

377
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,467
I'll be waiting for you in 1944.

378
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,553
When you pop in
on that snowy street corner,

379
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,514
I'll take you back to <i>Burnt Toast Diner</i>,
right where I left you.

380
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,433
And I'd be young again.

381
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,102
And we can finally
build a life together.

382
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,272
That sounds nice.

383
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,275
But, Hiro, I already had a life.

384
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,277
I had a wonderful life.

385
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,821
65 years is a long time.

386
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,824
Grandma!

387
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,910
Hey, there, honeysuckle.

388
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,330
- Where's Mommy and Daddy?
- They're talking to the nurse.

389
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,542
Sally.
This is an old friend of mine.

390
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:51,336
- His name is Hiro.
- That's a funny name.

391
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:54,047
Hello, Sally.

392
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,053
Go find Mommy and Daddy
so they can meet Hiro, okay?

393
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,689
After the war,
I married a wonderful man.

394
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,232
We had four children.

395
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:15,985
I now have
seven beautiful grandchildren.

396
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,946
We had a home, friends,

397
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:20,865
cherished memories...

398
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,409
A life.

399
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,538
If I were to go back now
and lead a different life,

400
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,415
what would happen with all that?

401
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,793
What would happen to Sally?

402
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,061


403
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,064


404
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,363


405
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,783


406
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:08,204


407
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,333


408
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:13,710


409
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:16,838


410
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,841


411
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,593


412
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,442


413
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:48,828
I don't want to hurt you.

414
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,873
Just let her go, please.

415
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,751
Since when do you ask politely?

416
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,753
A lot of people are gonna die.

417
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,672
Are you a shape-shifter?
Is that Dudley Do-Right in there?

418
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,799
You can't hold us here forever.

419
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:03,718
I don't plan on it...

420
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,723
Just long enough for
Samuel to finish the show.

421
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,809
Isn't that right, Em?

422
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,771
I don't think she heard me.

423
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,613
Are you okay?

424
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,827
Please.
Listen to me.

425
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,956
- Please, Samuel made me do it.
- Really?

426
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,001
I thought
you were the puppet master.

427
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:38,252
Come on.

428
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,714
What do you care about this girl,
anyway?

429
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:43,508
I am here to save her.

430
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,510
That's not you.

431
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,054
You're like me.

432
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,142
I'm a hero.

433
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,276
You think you're here to save them,
but they don't need saving.

434
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,070
They know what I've done for them.

435
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,781
Do they know that you gain
your strength from them?

436
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,827
You are the source of his power.
Without you, he is nothing.

437
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,496
That's why Joseph
was keeping this family small

438
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,373
for all those years,
because he knew.

439
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,708
He knew how powerful
Samuel could be,

440
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,170
that he would lose control,
just like when he buried that town.

441
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:25,424
But you all walk away now,
and he will be weak.

442
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:28,011
He will be ordinary.
He will be nothing.

443
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,263
I think we've all heard enough,
am I right?

444
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:34,142
He's using you, and that's what Joseph
was trying to keep from happening.

445
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,978
But why don't you tell them
what you did to stop him?

446
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,981
- That's enough!
- He killed his own brother!

447
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,035
You think they're gonna
believe you over me?

448
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,664
They'd be lost without me.

449
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,546
There's not one person here
who thinks I'm capable

450
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,131
of murdering my own brother.

451
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,800
There's one, actually.

452
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,220
Make that two.

453
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,849
Lydia told me everything.

454
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,061
She's not here
to confirm that now, is she?

455
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,606
- Because he killed her.
- That's a lie.

456
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:24,650
Isn't it?

457
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,613
Tell the truth.

458
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,202
You had me kill Lydia.

459
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:38,623
I did no such thing.

460
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,250
You blamed it on me to justify
what you're going to do.

461
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,670
What, you're gonna believe him,
after all I've done for you?

462
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,465
I know I can't stay in this family

463
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,050
after killing one of our own.

464
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,677
But he has to be stopped.

465
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,555
It's up to all of you.

466
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,184
Claire's right.
You walk away, and he's powerless.

467
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,354
It's over.

468
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,897
Come on.

469
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,108
Let's get out of here.

470
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,861
Wait...
Where are you going?

471
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,823
Don't you see?

472
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,741
You're victims.

473
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:17,412
All of you, like Joseph.

474
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,166
Run as fast as you can.

475
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,169
You'll never get far enough!

476
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,132
Ladies and gentlemen,
do you want a show?

477
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,900
This is the greatest show on earth!

478
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,718
We're too close.

479
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,887
We need to get
as far away as possible!

480
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,222
Go.

481
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,588
You seem to have found my power.

482
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:52,590
It's funny how that works.

483
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,512
I'm not gonna let you
hurt anyone now.

484
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,518
You of all people should know
they have to fear us!

485
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:09,148
That's the only way
they'll respect us.

486
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,484
All you've ever wanted is respect.

487
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,362
We know what it's like
to live in the shadow of a brother.

488
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,282
Joseph destroyed my potential,
kept me down,

489
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,826
Just like your brother.

490
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,831
My brother didn't let me down.

491
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,416
He built me up.

492
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,390
You need to teleport
everyone out of here.

493
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,726
- All of you?
- We need to try... everyone.

494
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,186
There are so many.

495
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,691
- They all have to be touching.
- You heard him, everybody join hands.

496
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,902


497
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,780


498
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,698


499
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,828
I'll stay...

500
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,705
take care of Samuel.

501
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,214
One, two, three.

502
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,647
So how does it feel to be ordinary?

503
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,864
Where did they all go?

504
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,869
They can't have all left.

505
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,621
They're here somewhere!

506
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:55,129
You can't leave me.

507
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,594
You cowards!

508
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:08,476
Where are you?

509
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,233
Come back here!

510
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,447
You're nothing without me!

511
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,664
I got to say...

512
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,167
I never liked carnivals.

513
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,033
Are you okay?

514
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,372
There was a man named Doyle.

515
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,041
He made me play.

516
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,919
Your friend...

517
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,296
Took care of him.

518
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,392
What do you think?

519
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,191
I like it.

520
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,030
- Is everyone safe?
- Hiro's taking care of them.

521
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,406
They'll be fine.

522
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,200
Head down.

523
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,661
Who's taking Samuel?

524
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:52,621
Is it a new company?

525
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:56,125
An old one.
Lauren called in some favors.

526
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,294
What's she telling them?

527
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,296
- There was a gas main rupture.
- Of course there was.

528
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:04,008
And all the other stuff,
the flying, the rumbling...

529
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,219
All just special effects
put on by a very gifted showman.

530
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,889
You still can't see it, can you?

531
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,558
- See what?
- The future.

532
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:16,103
One where we all get to live
out in the open.

533
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,731
You know how I feel about this.

534
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,983
How long can we keep this
under wraps?

535
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,402
Excuse me.

536
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,321
You were witnesses. What happened?

537
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,906
No comment.

538
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,366
Can you tell us
what you saw here tonight?

539
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,870
What he said.

540
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,543
Miss, please, you have
to have seen something.

541
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,254
Are you sure, miss?
Look like you want to say something.

542
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,633
Actually,
I do have something to say.

543
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,512
You're right.

544
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,848
People don't change.

545
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,566
You want to know what really
happened here tonight?

546
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,445
Keep the cameras on me.

547
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,574
Stay with her.
Don't lose her.

548
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,085
You getting this?

549
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,882
What is she doing?

550
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,718
Breaking my heart.

551
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,014


552
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,392


553
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,522


554
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,607
It's amazing.

555
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,610
- What is?
- When I saved her.

556
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,323
I didn't have a thought for myself.
I could have killed Doyle, but I didn't.

557
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,325
It felt...

558
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:56,996
- good. It felt right.
- What is she doing?

559
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,833
She's gonna change everything.

560
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,460
That's right.

561
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,173
It's a brave new world.

562
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,005
My name is Claire Bennet.
This is attempt number...

563
00:41:50,924 --> 00:41:52,510
I guess I kind of lost count.
