(HI TED)

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,600
(no intenet connectiong available)

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,500
(ted i know u're there)

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
(i am not on line,how are u doing this)

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,600
(I know what they did to u)

6
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,800
(Look at the needle)

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,800
(we should meet)

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,900
(turn around)

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,600
My name is Hana Gitelman.

10
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,400
How the hell
did you do that?

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Satellite signals.
Wi-Fi, radio waves.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Your computer can download them
and so can I.

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,300
So you can, uh,

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,700
access the internet
without a computer.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Just pull email
out of your head.

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
(yes)

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,900
And you're radioactive.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,400
Why come to me?

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,100
Because they got to me too.

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,900
I can find them, Ted.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,700
And you can nuke them.

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
previously on heroes

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,600
Turned on the waterworks,
and they were mine.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,500
 <i>They're getting the suitcase</i>
 <i>as we speak.</i>

25
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,300
Where's the bag?

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,400
You may fool Ando,
but you do not fool me.

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Matt Parkman,
here to protect you, sir.

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,500
 <i>(Matt)</i>
 <i>Sir, we've got to</i>
 <i>get out of here right now.</i>

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,300
This is a setup.

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,800
 <i>What?</i>
 <i>How do you know that?</i>
 <i>I just do.</i>

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 <i>Now, you absorb all these</i>
 <i>abilities you find.</i>

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
I'm gonna teach you how
to pull 'em out one at a time.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't have to do anything!

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,900
Except fly.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,900
 <i>(Suresh)</i>
 <i>Hello.</i>
 <i>Zane Taylor?</i>

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Yes.
You must be Dr. Suresh.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,100
 <i>Come on in.</i>

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,100
There are others out there
like you.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,700
And I am going to find them.

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,500
I could go with you.

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,100
She had an appointment
with a neurologist.

42
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,700
Your mother's been
having some headaches.

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,100
Yeah, she's also been having
some memory loss.

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,900
Did you tell them that?

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,700
I don't know
any Mr. Muggles.

46
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,900
And I don't know <i>you.</i>

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,700
Dad?

48
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,200
Dad?
Dad!

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,200
Where's Dad?

50
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,600
He's on one of
his stupid business trips.

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,100
There's something
wrong with Mom.

52
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,300
There's something
wrong with <i>you.</i>

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Mom?

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
Do you know who this is?

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,100
Claire,
leave your brother alone.

56
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,700
You recognize us?

57
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,300
Yes, you are the daughter

58
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,200
who is supposed to be
setting the dinner table.

59
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,800
I was standing right there
just a minute ago,

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,500
and you had no idea
who I was.

61
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,300
Lyle, help your sister
with the table.

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,600
Honestly, Claire.

63
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Good thing Dad's not home,

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,100
'cause he would <i>so</i>
drug test you.

65
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,900
It's good
you called us, Isaac.

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,900
 <i>I didn't know</i>
 <i>who else to trust.</i>

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,000
That man, Peter Petrelli,

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
???

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
 <i>I tried finding him.</i>

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,300
 <i>I kept painting what</i>
 <i>I thought were empty spaces.</i>

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,600
And now?

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,100
There, in the water.

73
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,600
Footprints.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,400
So...Peter's invisible?

75
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,500
That sound so crazy?

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,700
Any more than a man
who can paint the future?

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
Peter absorbs
others' abilities.

78
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,100
Apparently, he's met someone
who we assumed was dead.

79
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,200
That's the roof of the--

80
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,000
The Deveaux building.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,500
Look, there's a chance that
Peter might come here first

82
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
before we reach him.

83
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,000
What do you expect me
to do with this?

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200

HEROES 116

88
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,900
Hey.

89
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,500
Hey.
You know what?

90
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,300
Let me do that.

91
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,700
I am pregnant,
not porcelain.

92
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,900
No, I'm just trying
to be Mr. Helpful.

93
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,800
Try Mr. Get-the-hell
out-of-the-way.

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,200
What did you do?

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
You like it?

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
I love it.

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
I do.

98
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,200
Yeah?

99
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,200
Matt, we can't afford this.
I mean, we're--

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,500
Nah, come on.
I got a guy.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
He gave it to me
wholesale, so...

102
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,100
I'm so bloated.

103
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,200
You, you look so beautiful
to me.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,900
I'm sorry.
You--

105
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,700
made this beautiful gesture,
and I have to mess it up.

106
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,000
What do you mean?

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,500
A man called yesterday.

108
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
HEA Professor Suresh.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,100
He was a geneticist.

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,300
He wanted
to talk about DNA.

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Matt, your DNA.

112
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Did you te

113
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,000
I mean, you didn't
tell him anything, did you?

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Of course I didn't
tell him anything.

115
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,800
He found you.

116
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,800
He <i>knows.</i>

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
Geneticists.
Who are these people?

118
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,200
????????
I just wanted to say thanks.

119
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,500
For what?

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,700
Well, you know,
for bringing me with you.

121
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,600
You didn't have to do that.

122
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,400
It would have been
a long road alone.

123
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm glad
for the company.

124
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,300
Well, I believe in fate,
Mohinder, and karma,

125
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,000
and I'm not just saying that
'cause you're Indian.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,400
I mean, you really
came to my rescue,

127
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,200
and I won't forget that.

128
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not completely altruistic
on my part, Zane.

129
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
I have a feeling
we're gonna meet up

130
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,200
with a lot of skepticism
from these people.

131
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,200
You can help.
I'm ready.

132
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,300
 <i>(Suresh)</i>
 <i>Excuse me!</i>

133

Oh.

135
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,100
Rap music.

136
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,900
Can't stand it, but
it's the only thing I've found

137
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,800
that cancels out the--

138
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Can I help you?

139
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,300
We're looking
for Dale Smither.

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,700
You found her.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,100
Oh. O-of course.

142
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm Mohinder Suresh,
and this is Mr. Taylor.

143
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,000
Zane.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,100
 <i>Actually,</i>
 <i>it's just Zane.</i>

145
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,500
I left you several
messages this week.

146
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,400
Yeah, I got 'em.

147
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
I believe I can help
with what's happening to you.

148
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,900
I'm sure you have
lots of questions.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,800
Yeah, only one--
how'd you find me?

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
You gave blood
11 years ago.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,900
RO
Signed a consent form
to have a sample used

152
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,600
in a program called
the Human Genome Project.

153
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,000
You dialed the wrong number.

154
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,500
Look, I know what
you're thinking right now,

155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,800
that you've got
nobody to talk to,

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,700
 <i>nobody that understands</i>
 <i>what you're going through.</i>

157
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,700
 <i>But that's not true.</i>

158
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
I-I understand.

159
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,900
Yeah?

160
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,100
Damn.

161
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,900
That was my best wrench.

162
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,100
So there really
are others, huh?

163
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,400
Yes.

164
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
p
ú|
I'm proof of that.

165
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,900
That's why we're here.

166
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,900
I-I--

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,200
I thought the headaches
at first were gonna kill me.

168
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,300
I'd lie awake at night thinking
that my head was gonna explode.

169
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,200
A cockroach crawling
across my neighbor's floor

170
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,100
was like a marching band
parading through my house.

171
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm sorry.
It must be quite a burden.

172
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,700
A burden?

173
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,400
Hell, no.

174
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,100
 <i>This is the best damn thing</i>
 <i>that ever happened to me.</i>

175
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
 <i>Well, now that</i>
 <i>I've learned to control it,</i>

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm like Superman
or something.

177
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,400
I can hear rain coming
from 40 miles away.

178
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,300
I can even hear
someone's moods--

179
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,400
the tiniest changes
in a heartbeat.

180
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Yours, for instance.

181
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,600
 <i>It's racing kind of fast.</i>

182
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,200
You nervous about something?

183
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,600
Um, no, I'm just excited

184
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,900
to meet somebody like me.

185
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, if you've come
to try to take it away from me,

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
you're gonna have a hell
of a fight on your hands.

187
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,500
I can assure you
we only want to help.

188
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,200
Uh, I'd like to perform
a few tests,

189
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,300
ES
s-some questions, really,
that's all.

190
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,700
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of hours.

191
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm kinda backed up today.

192
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,900
We can come back
in the morning.

193
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,300
Okay.

194
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,300
ONE

195
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
TWO

196
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,700
THREE

197
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,400
ANDO?

198
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Is that u?i'm locked in!

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
You're not Ando.

200
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,100
S.R. Gustavson.

201
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,700
State Gaming Commission.

202
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,900
I come in peace.

203
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
??????

204
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,900
Ando is my friend.

205
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,800
I bring him from Japan
on my mission.

206
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,300
Where's the girl?
Oh!

207
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,900
Where's the suitcase?

208
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,500
She said her name Hope.

209
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,900
Tell me where they are!

210
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,800
Take me with you.
I must save Ando.

211
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,000
Not a chance.

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
I work alone, pal.

213
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,100
You take me with you

214
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,100
or she gets away...

215
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
 <i>pal.</i>

216
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,500
I so miss you, Karen.

217
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,300
I miss your laugh.

218
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
But they're gonna pay
for what they did to me.

219
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
What they did to us.

220
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,000
I know you're not gonna like
what I gotta do.

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So, uh,
I came to say good-bye.

222
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,900
Enough!

223
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,100
I say when it's enough!

224
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,800
You've got a power to stop me.
What are you waiting for?

225
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I'm trying!

226
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,300
And when you've left New York
a smoking wasteland,

227
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,500
we'll put that
on your tombstone:

228
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,100
"Here lies Peter Petrelli.
He tried."

229
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,500
Dig into that
file cabinet of yours

230
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,300
and pull something out!

231
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,100
He
Fly, stop time,
paint me a pretty picture.

232
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,600
Do...something...

233
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,500
unexpected!

234
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,600
Ha ha!

235
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,000
You pushed that away
with your mind.

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Which one of your sorry friends
has telekinesis?

237
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,300
None of 'em do.

238
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,300
Right--that guy who
was chasing Claire in Texas.

239
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,500
He sent some lockers
flying at me.

240
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,400
Texas?

241
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,800
And you pulled that little trick
out in the here and now?

242
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,300
Well, we might
just have a chance

243
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,100
at stopping you
from going nuclear.

244
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,600
 <i>(Isaac)</i>
 <i>I tried.</i>

245
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,000
 <i>Every street I painted,</i>
 <i>every building--empty.</i>

246
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,000
 I think
Peter's left New York.

247
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,200
[chuckles]
Why does this
seem so familiar?

248
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
He  
Oh, now I remember.

249
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
You'd get that same look
on your face

250
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,500
when you'd lie to me
about using.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,100
You think I'm lying?

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,800
You're right.

253
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,100
I can't willingly throw you
into another man's arms.

254
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Because you're jealous.

255
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,300
Because he's dangerous.

256
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Oh, God.

257
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,700
I don't think
I should have this anymore.

258
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,200
Keep it.
Please.

259
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,500
I would do
anything for you, Simone.

260
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Anything.

261
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Find Peter.

262
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
ES

263
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,400
 <i>Look,</i>

264
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,600
you're nothing but
a Japanese MapQuest for me.

265
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
So till we find that girl,

266
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
just sit there
and shut up.

267
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
I bring Ando from Japan
on my mission.

268
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,000
I am responsible for him.

269
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,100
All a partner ever does
is either drag you under

270
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,400
or screw you over.

271
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,100
A partner helps
by believing in you.

272
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,200
He keeps you honest.

273
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,500
Uh-huh. Well.

274
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,800
 <i>Who wanted to help</i>
 <i>the girl?</i>

275
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,500
Grab the suitcase?

276
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
take your car

277
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,900
Ando.

278
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,500
You take on a partner,

279
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,500
all you get
is their blood on your hands.

280
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,600
Why are we stopping here?

281
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,900
I thought we were going
to your mother's house.

282
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
The less questions
you ask, Ando,

283
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,300
the better off
you'll be in life.

284
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Why is that?

285
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,800
That'd be another question.

286
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Here, I will
help you with--

287
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
No, I've got it.

288
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,600
It's okay--
No--

289
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,100
What is this?

290
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,000
What did I say
about asking questions?

291
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,900
You know,
I have to admit, Zane,

292
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,500
when you first offered
to help, I was--

293
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
I was cautious.

294
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,700
In what way?

295
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know you.
You don't know me.

296
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,200
It could have been
a disaster.

297
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,700
You...made a difference
today.

298
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Thank you.

299
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Here is your key.

300
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,100
When you told that woman Dale
that you could help her,

301
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,500
is that really possible?

302
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
It's only theoretical
at this point.

303
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
But I am working on
an inhibitor,

304
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,700
a chemical that'll isolate
the genetic mutation

305
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
that causes
these abnormalities.

306
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,100
We can offer these people
understanding, control,

307
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,900
or, if needed, elimination
of their ability.

308
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,200
Elimination?

309
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,700
You make it sound like
a virus or plague.

310
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,700
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to imply--

311
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,200
It's just not all of you exhibit
the same sets of skills you do.

312
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,300
And they can be
dangerous.

313
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,400
My father had to learn that
firsthand.

314
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,800
How's that?

315
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,100
He was murdered
by a man named Sylar.

316
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,100
Well, what happened
to this...

317
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,400
Sylar?

318
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,100
I'm not sure.

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,600
He just got away
with killing your dad?

320
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,600
I only know he's gone,
locked away.

321
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,500
What does it matter?

322
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,100
Even if I could come
face-to-face with him,

323
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,300
what difference
would it make?

324
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,700
Justice can never
really be served.

325
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,000
What a shame.

326
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
They're out there.

I can feel them...

328
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,600
so innocent, so unaware
of what's happening to them.

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
We'll find them, Mohinder.

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,900
but Dad's in charge
of talking to the doctors,

357
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,600
and they will come up with
the answers.

358
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Maybe you shouldn't
trust Dad so much.

359
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,300
Now, why would
you say that?

360
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,200
What if it gets worse...

361
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,300
and next time that you--

362
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,900
Mom!

363
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,300
Mom! Mom!

364
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,400
 <i>Mom!</i>

365
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,200
Mom, please wake up.

366
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
What's this
all about anyways?

367
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,500
What's what?

368
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,700
The birds.

369
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,300
I mean, you--
you sort of hate everything,

370
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
everyone.

371
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,500
Except you treat these pigeons
like they're family.

372
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
Charles Darwin
bred pigeons

373
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
when he was working out
his theory of evolution.

374
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,900
Married up various permutations
to get maximum potential.

375
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,300
What do you mean by that,
maximum potential?

376
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,600
I think he meant you,
friend.

377
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,500
But you used to care.
About all this.

378
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,300
Didn't you?

379
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,600
All right,
sharing time's over.

380
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,000
Time to get--

381
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,500
What are you doing?

382
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,000
???

383
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,900
Claire, this isn't
a great time.

384
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
Dad, you have
to come home.

385
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,600
Mom fell
and she blacked out.

386
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
 <i>I called 911--</i>

387
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,000
What happened to her?

388
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,800
I came home and she didn't
even know who I was.

389
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
She didn't even remember
Mr. Muggles.

390
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm coming home right away.

391
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Claude'll have to wait.

392
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,200
 <i>(Janice)</i>
 <i>Matt, where are you?</i>

393
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,700
Hey, what's up?

394
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,700
The ring.

395
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,100
I took it to get
resized,

396
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,900
and the jeweler told me
it was worth $40,000.

397
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,000
Well, that's ridiculous.

398
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,700
And he accused me
of stealing it.

399
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,600
I had to tell him
my husband was a cop

400
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,400
anthere has to be
some kind of an explanation.

401
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
There is an explanation,
right?

402
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,100
He
The guy that I was
protecting, Malsky...

403
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,800
those were his.

1
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:42,699
You were gonna
get upset--

2
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,300
You let me keep
the ring.

3
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,900
It was stolen property.
What were you thinking?

4
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,700
I don't know
what I was thinking.

5
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,000
I have no idea.

6
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,500
You know, Matt,
for a guy that can...

7
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,200
read other people's thoughts,

8
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,000
you should spend a little
bit of time on your own.

9
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,900
You know what?

10
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,100
I'm just trying to figure out
how to take care of our family.

11
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,300
 I don't have a job, Jan.

12
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,000
And I'm worried
that the baby--

13
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,800
 Ever since you told me
 about this thing,

14
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,500
this thing that you do,

15
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,100
I have tried to act like
everything's okay, but it's not.

16
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,000
 It's stealing and lying.

17
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,300
Matt, you're better
than this!

18
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,000
All right.

19
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Fine, I'll take them
down to the precinct.

20
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,100
 ???

21
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
What?
Call them right now.

22
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,700
Hello?

23
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,500
What?

24
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,100
Where are you right now?

25
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,100
Yeah.
Yeah, I know the place.

26
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
I'll be right there.

27
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,500
Who was that?

28
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,400
I, uh, I gotta
go out.

29
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,600
Where?

30
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,200
Matt.

31
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,300
How you feeling?

32
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,200
You knew
they were after you.

33
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,800
Who?
I don't know who they were!

34
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,000
You wanted to know why
I was invisible all these years.

35
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,000
It was because of them,

36
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,400
and you've brought the bastards
right to my door!

37
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,400
I just saved your ass!

38
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,500
You've no idea
what you've done.

39
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,400
Your mate, the painter.

40
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,800
He took your girl
up to the roof.

41
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,000
He must have known
we were up there.

42
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,200
Isaac.
He's a comic book artist.

43
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,700
Let's call a spade
a shovel, mate.

44
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,600
It had to be Isaac.

45
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,300
 They got to him.

46
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,600
You said yourself
he disappeared for a bit, right?

47
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,600
Yeah, so?

48
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,900
 Well,
 that's how it works.

49
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,700
At least, that's how it did
in my day.

50
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,300
You drop off the face
of the earth for a few days,

51
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,100
wake up with a memory hole,
a killer headache,

52
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
and a souvenir.

53
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,400
Did he have a set of these?

54
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,300
I don't know.
What is that?

55
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,500
Those are for
the lucky ones.

56
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,399
So what do we do now--
hey!

57
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,200
We?
You watch your own back.

58
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,100
I do what I always do--
disappear.

59
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,400
I'm not letting you
run again.

60
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,600
We're getting somewhere
with all this.

61
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,600
You should have
thought of that

62
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
before you brought
your baggage to my roof.

63
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,000
I can't do this
on my own.

64
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,400
Then I guess
you go boom.

65
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,800
 Have you heard from Peter? 

66
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,800
He
  Last time I saw my brother, 

67
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,200
he flew out of a window
to get away from me.

68
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,500
I doubt he's going to come
knocking on my door.

69
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,800
He flew out a window?

70
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,400
So to speak.

71
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,900
Simone, I've got people
looking for him,

72
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,200
people I can trust.

73
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,700
Around the clock.
We'll find him.

74
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,700
But what if you don't?

75
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,000
  You need to go public, 
  call a press conference, 

76
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,800
tell everyone about
Peter's condition.

77
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,900
Nobody's gonna believe

78
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,200
somebody can explode
and destroy a city, Simone.

79
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,000
I can't believe
I believe it.

80
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,600
Let's tell them everything.

81
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,300
Isaac painting the future,

82
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
  Hiro stopping time. 

83
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,300
  Even you--what you all can do 
  is incredible. 

84
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,400
It's time people know
what's happening.

85
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,600
The truth.

86
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
Simone, look,
I know your heart--

87
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
it's in the right place.

88
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,800
You want to help Peter,
and I want to help him too.

89
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,300
But if people knew
what we were capable of,

90
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,600
they would drop
a collective brick.

91
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,000
You think they'll
burn you at the stake?

92
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,800
Yeah, pretty much.

93
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,800
Because that's what
I would do.

94
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,200
I'd round us all up,
stick us in a lab

95
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,800
on some island
in the middle of the ocean.

96
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,600
Where Peter saw hope,
you see disaster.

97
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,000
  Huh. 

98
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,600
I guess I'm voting
for the other guy.

99
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,600
Simone.

100
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,700
Do not take this public.

101
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,600
But you kissed me.
I thought you liked me.

102
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Don't remind me.

103
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,700
What will happen to me now?

104
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,900
 Damn it! 

105
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,100
 Hope!
I want my share.

106
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
Ando!

107
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,700
Hiro!

108
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,300
  Ando! 

109
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,700
Ando!

110
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,900
This way hurry!

111
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
 Gustavson, you can't 
  spend it if you're dead! 

112
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,900
   Neither can you! 

113
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,900
Hiro I'm sorry

114
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,800
I should've listened to u

115
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
No.this is all my fault.

116
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,000
I never should have....

117
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,000
brought u on my mission

118
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,000
And if you didn't...

119
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,800
i would be at my desk in tokyo

120
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,000
I would never know.

121
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,900
what it is to be a hero

122
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
I don't want to die.

123
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,700
Did your powers work?

124
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,600
I had my eyes closed!

125
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,000
Me too

126
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,100
Her GUN must have misfired

127
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,000
I guess...

128
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,800
Lucky for us!

129
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,200
Look Ando!

130
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,700
Not a scratch on the Versa!

131
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Funny.
I didn't hear your footsteps.

132
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,800
That's because
there weren't any.

133
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,900
That sound.

134
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,400
In your heart.

135
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,400
What is it?

136
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,500
Murder.

137
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,700
Is my mom
gonna be okay?

138
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,500
She's stable.

139
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,200
When your dad gets here,
we can discuss options.

140
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,700
Options?

141
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,100
Claire, why don't you
come sit down.

142
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
Your mother has
a subdural hemorrhage.

143
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,100
I got a C-minus
in biology.

144
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,600
Oh. It's, um...

145
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,200
it's like a bruise
on her brain.

146
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,000
Specifically the area
that controls memory.

147
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,300
Has your mother had any
recent exposure to radiation?

148
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,700
A history of epilepsy?

149
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Claire, if this is a result
of domestic violence--

150
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,400
No.

151
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,600
No, it's not like that.

152
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,300
Not really.

153
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,100
Then what's it like?

154
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,900
You won't believe me.

155
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,400
Anything you say will be held
in the strictest confidence.

156
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,700
There's a man...

157
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,800
who works for my dad.

158
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,200
He can make you
forget things.

159
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,600
  Anything, 

160
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,500
just by touching you
with his hands.

161
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,000
I'll talk to your father.

162
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,700
Wa, I'm telling you
the truth!

163
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,700
Hey, I only came here

164
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,200
because you said it was
a matter of life and death.

165
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,100
You can't go blowing
anything else up.

166
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
I found out what these are.

167
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,300
  They're tracking us. 

168
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Like animals!

169
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,600
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

170
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,500
The truth.

171
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,400
Hey!
What's going on?

172
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:00,199
Ted?

173
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,700
She's--she's a friend,
okay, like us.

174
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,100
She's the one who put me
onto the scratches.

175
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
It comes from
a pneumatic needle.

176
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
It injects a radioisotope

177
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,000
for tracking viruses
in Africa.

178
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,000
That's what we are to them,
a-a virus.

179
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,900
A plague.

180
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,500
Who's  them? 

181
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,100
A shipment of needles
went to Primatech Paper

182
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,900
in Odessa, Texas.

183
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,200
The tracking slip
went to a man named Bennet.

184
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,800
Sound familiar?

185
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I've already been
down this road.

186
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,700
Trust me,
it's a dead end.

187
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,300
  Really? 
Yeah.

188
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,600
Why would a paper company
need pneumatic needles

189
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,000
with a radioisotope?

190
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,900
I had my blood tested.

191
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,600
It's in me, that isotope.

192
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,500
Ted, you're radioactive
by nature.

193
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,900
How much you wanna bet
it's in you too?

194
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,800
No, it's insane.
No!

195
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,300
I want to put
this whole thing behind me.

196
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,200
My wife and I have a baby
coming, my family needs me.

197
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,400
If you got a family, that means
you got something to protect.

198
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,600
There is no putting
this whole thing behind you.

199
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,400
 ???

200
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,100
If they can track us
like you say they can,

201
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,000
he'll know we're coming.

202
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,700
Good. I can get us through
any wall they got.

203
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,600
I need  you  to get
inside his head.

204
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,800
He can't lie to us
if you're there.

205
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,900
  We'll find out the truth. 

206
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,200
Look, I cannot do this...

207
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,100
without you.

208
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,600
If we can save ourselves,
we could help others.

209
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,500
  We could be heroes! 

210
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,300
   Dad. 

211
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:49,499
 I've convinced the doctor

212
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,400
to let us take her home
in the morning.

213
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,000
  She'll be okay. 

214
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,200
No thanks to you.

215
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,400
Shut up, Claire.

216
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,900
Claire, can I talk to you
outside?

217
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,800
Please?

218
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,800
The doctor told me

219
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,300
you had an interesting theory
about your mom's condition.

220
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,000
It's not a theory.

221
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,600
You did this to her.
You erased her mind.

222
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,800
Claire,
that's ridiculous.

223
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
You tried to erase mine.

224
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,300
I don't know where
you're getting these ideas.

225
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,800
Stop. Stop it!
Stop lying!

226
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,500
After what you did to Mom,
isn't that enough?

227
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,500
What you know
is dangerous.

228
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,300
If the wrong people find out
about what you can do--

229
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,700
Like the man
who killed Jackie?

230
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Exactly.

231
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,300
Why?

232
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,400
Why did you do this
to Mom?

233
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,300
A few days ago, that man
broke into our house...

234
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,500
looking for you.

235
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,000
He found your mother
instead.

236
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,600
So I made her forget.

237
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,100
 ???

238
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,100
And people like her
shouldn't have to know

239
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,700
about people like him.

240
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,400
And maybe people like  you. 

241
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,500
I never meant for her
to get sick.

242
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,000
I only wanted
to protect my family.

243
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,400
Claire bear,

244
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,000
I promise--

245
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,000
I promise this will
never happen again.

246
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,800
No!

247
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,100
You don't just get
to say you're sorry

248
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,900
and make everything
go away.

249
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,600
 Ow.

250
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,300
Zane, are you all right?

251
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,000
Yeah, it's just, uh,

252
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,300
it's just a headache.

253
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,800
Okay. Sit tight.

254
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,100
I'll be back.

255
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,000
 Ow!

256
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,000
 Hello?

257
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,900
Anybody here?

258
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,300
Hey, maybe we should
just come back, Mohinder.

259
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,900
Dale?

260
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
Mohinder,
what's the matter?

261
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,000
 What are you doing? 

262
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,300
Dialing 911.

263
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Do you think
that's a good idea?

264
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,700
What are you talking about?
She was murdered.

265
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
And what were
we doing here?

266
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,500
What do you mean?
We found her.

267
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,300
How? Why?

268
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,700
I mean, l-look at us.
Where did we come from?

269
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,000
How did we get here?

270
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:00,999
Can we explain any of this

271
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,100
without looking
completely insane?

272
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,700
The top of her head
was removed.

273
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,100
It was Sylar.
I don't--I mean, how?

274
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,300
Sylar.

275
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,500
Okay, we have to warn them.

276
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,100
Everyo on the list.
He's after them.

277
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,400
We'll, uh, we'll leave now

278
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,100
and we'll call the police
anonymously from the road.

279
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,500
Zane, are you okay?

280
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,200
Oh, Hiro.

281
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,900
My arm still hurts a little.

282
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,100
U should drive.

283
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,100
No u always drive.

284
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,200
Take the Veasa back to the rental car place.

285
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,200
What are u doing?

286
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,000
What i should,ve done weeks ago.

287
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,300
Go home ando.

288
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Why are u doing this?

289
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,300
I said i was sorry about the girl.

290
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,700
This isn't about u.

291
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,500
It's about me.

292
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,700
I made a mistake by bringing u along.

293
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,200
I have to do this alone.

294
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,700
But u can't!

295
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,900
It's Destiny!

296
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,800
The comic book...we are going to save the world!

297
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,600
Life isn't a comic book.

298
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,400
Too many people have died since we began.

299
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,400
I don't know what i should do...

300
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,300
if I lost u too.

301
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,700
 Hiro please!

302
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,000
 Hiro! 

303
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,900
   Hey, young fella. 

304
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,400
All by yourself?

305
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,600
 Lyle.

306
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,600
Claire.

307
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,900
We'll get through this.

308
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,400
Your mom needs us.
Lyle too.

309
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,700
I don't even know if I'll
remember any of this tomorrow.

310
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,800
All I want to do is run away,
but I can't.

311
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,000
Somebody has to protect
this family from you.

312
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,100
Lyle, take your mother.

313
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,000
Get out of the house
right now.

314
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Dad?

315
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,700
I'm sure you have
a lot of questions.

316
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,000
  We all do. 

317
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,600
Why'd you do it, Isaac?

318
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,200
How'd you get in here?

319
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
  What'd they give you, 
  money? 

320
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
Drugs?

321
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,300
What's a Judas get these days?

322
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,800
  I was trying 
  to stop you. 

323
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,700
You're dangerous.
You said it yourself.

324
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,100
Without them to help,
you'll become that.

325
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,400
I had help.

326
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,500
I was learning
to control it.

327
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,400
You scared my only
chance of hope!

328
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,800
Stop it!

329
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,700
What are these marks, huh?
What do they mean?

330
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,600
They're nothing.
They mean nothing.

331
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,100
Don't lie to me!

332
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,600
This is why
you sent them after me.

333
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
  Jealousy? 

334
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,800
With me out of the way, you'd
have Simone all to yourself.

335
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,600
You stole her away from me!

336
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,300
But I did it
to save New York,

337
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,800
to stop the bomb.

338
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,700
I can do it right now.

339
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,100
With just one bullet,
I can be a hero.

340
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
 ???

341
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,800
  You're a junkie. 

342
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,000
  You couldn't even 
  save yourself. 

343
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,800
  That's why 
  she left you, Isaac. 

344
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,500
  It had nothing... 
  to do...with me! 

345
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,500
Show yourself!

346
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,300
 No.

347
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,400
Simone!

348
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,300
  No. 

349
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,600
