3
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:36,505
Where does it come from?

4
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:41,218
This quest,
this need to solve life's mysteries

5
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:44,429
when the simplest of questions
can never be answered.

6
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,100
Why are we are?

7
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,810
What is the soul?

8
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:51,687
Why do we dream?

9
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,233
Perhaps we'd be better
off not looking at all.

10
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:58,902
Not dwelving, not yearning.

11
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:02,447
That's not human nature.

12
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:05,201
Not the human heart.

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,378
That is not why we are here.

14
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:26,170
How is he doing?

15
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:30,145
I'm sorry, did I scare you?

16
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:30,763
No.

17
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:34,582
No, I just...
I keep having these amazing dreams

18
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:36,771
everytime I close
my eyes and...

19
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:38,520
Nevermind.

20
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,822
He likes me reading
the stock page.

21
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,013
Is he even conscious at all?

22
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:45,740
No.

23
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,251
It's been a week now.

24
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,243
I think he's close.

25
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,913
A couple more days maybe.

26
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:58,251
You know I don't know
what he'd do without you.

27
00:01:58,506 --> 00:01:59,793
You have a real gift.

28
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:00,921
Just doing my job.

29
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:01,631
No.

30
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,553
You're like a son to him.

31
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:06,233
Yeah, well, that would make
us like brother and sister,

32
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:09,050
it'd be a little ankward if
I ever wanted to ask out.

33
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:15,892
I'm sorry. That was...
That was inappropriate.

34
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:18,101
No, it's sweet, it's...

35
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:22,562
- I'm dating somebody and I...
- Yeah. No, really, it's okay.

36
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:28,152
I need to change his IV.

37
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:29,782
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,120
Man is a narcissistic
species by nature.

39
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,961
We have colonized the 4
corners of our tiny planet.

40
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:43,750
But we are not the pinacle
of so-called evolution.

41
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:47,220
That honor belongs to
the lowly cockroach.

42
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,673
Capable of living
for months without food.

43
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:53,396
Remaining alive headless
 for weeks at a time.

44
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:54,795
Resistant to radiation.

45
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:58,635
If god has indeed created
himself in his own image,

46
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:01,895
then I submit to you that god
is a cockroach.

47
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:10,453
They say that man uses only
a 10th of his brain power.

48
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:15,472
Another percent and we might
actually be worthy of God's image.

49
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,522
Unless of course that
day has already arrived,

50
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:22,820
the human genome project
has discovered that

51
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:25,073
tiny variations in
man's genetic code

52
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:28,152
are taking place at
increasingly rapid rates.

53
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:32,031
Teleportation, levitation,
tissue regeneration,

54
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:34,583
is this outside the
realm of possibility?

55
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:38,003
Or is man entering a new
gateway to evolution?

56
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:42,840
Is he finally standing at the
threshold of true human potential?

57
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:47,564
I'm sorry. I'm out of time.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,584
I know, I know, I'm beginning to
sound like my father. I can't help it.

59
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,924
You know they can fire
me too if they like.

60
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,967
But there is something
to it, Merad.

61
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:02,506
As crazy as it sounds...

62
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:10,014
- What is it?
- It's your father. He's dead.

63
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:15,545
How?

64
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,716
Driving a taxi in New York
City is a very dangerous job.

65
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,107
The wrong fare, the wrong time,
we may never know what really happened.

66
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,775
You know I spoke
to him 2 days ago.

67
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:26,605
He was convincing someone was following
him, trying to steal his research.

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,065
He died because of his thesis.

69
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,857
- That's crazy!
- Is it?

70
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:31,977
The man left his family,

71
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:35,284
discredited his career to chase wild
theories halfway around the world.

72
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,446
Where are you going?

73
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:39,154
To his apartment,
to get his papers and research.

74
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:41,416
He was this close to
finding the first of them.

75
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:44,194
His patient zero.
He tracked him to Queens, New York.

76
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,907
Mohinder, listen to me.

77
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,185
Your father was my
colleague and my friend.

78
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:50,784
A respected professor,
a brilliant geneticist

79
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,924
but he had clearly lost
touch with reality.

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,335
I followed in his footsteps.
My thesis is based on his research.

81
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:57,934
Yes, you always
wanted his approval.

82
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:00,147
And now you're telling that
it was all for nothing?

83
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:01,257
I'm telling you...

84
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:02,426
to let go.

85
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,895
I need to know why he died.

86
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:06,265
I need to know that it
wasn't all for nothing.

87
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,934
And then I need to
finish what he started.

88
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,956
Hello?

89
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,494
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm in his place now.

90
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,664
No, no, no, he left everything
behind but his computer.

91
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:21,176
Research, the map.

92
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,104
Yeah, let's get a team in here
to bag and tag everything.

93
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,965
I gotta call you right back.

94
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:57,855
Pervert!

95
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,464
Time to get up, Mika!

96
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:28,047
Mika.

97
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:34,724
Mika!

98
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,187
Mika!

99
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,566
- Mika!
- What?

100
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,697
Damn, Mika,
don't do that to me.

101
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:42,684
Do what?

102
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,042
You need to be careful. Right?

103
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,064
I'm just working
on my computer.

104
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,944
Prologic prog's bad.

105
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,816
So I had to build a new one.

106
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:54,236
A new one.

107
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:58,787
Anyone ever tell you you're the
smartest little man on the planet?

108
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:00,787
You  do, all the time.

109
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,584
What's this?

110
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:09,666
It's a pinhall camera.
It's for the eclipse.

111
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,547
The moon's gonna cover
up the sun today.

112
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,975
We're supposed to
look at it at school.

113
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:17,677
Speaking of which,
you need to go get ready.

114
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,554
You  can't be late. Not today.

115
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,276
Mom, I'm already dressed and
I've packed my own lunch.

116
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,315
That's what I've been doing
this morning. What about you?

117
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,144
Don't get smart with me.

118
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:29,396
I've been working
to pay our bills.

119
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,887
Yeah, that's why they
turned down our gas again?

120
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:35,586
Go grab your stuff and wait
by the backdoor, okay?

121
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:37,484
- Why?
- Just do it.

122
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,744
Mom, what's going on?

123
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,816
Nevermind, just keep your voice
down and stay close to me.

124
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:21,614
- Camera ready?
- Yeah, almost. Hold on.

125
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,375
It's like 70, 80 feet.
This is so unreal.

126
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:26,624
Okay, I'm good.

127
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:28,835
Okay.

128
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,295
Oh my...

129
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,464
Oh my God! Oh my God! Claire!

130
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,084
Oh my God!

131
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,097
Claire!

132
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:58,774
This is Claire Bennett.
That was attempt number 6.

133
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,430
You get out here, yes?

134
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:56,068
Mr. Linderman, I'm gonna have to
call you back in 5 minutes, okay?

135
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,164
Thank you.

136
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:59,186
I'm late.
I've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting

137
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,724
It happened two more times.

138
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:03,397
Sometimes I'm falling,
sometimes I'm flying.

139
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,917
- Sometimes you're in 'em.
- I don't have time for this now.

140
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,867
They aren't just
dreams, Nathan.

141
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:08,984
Hold this.

142
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,294
I thought they'd go
away but they're not.

143
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,374
I'm gonna need this back by 6,
please. Thanks.

144
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,504
This morning when I got out of bed,
my foot hovered

145
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,796
before it touched the ground.

146
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,624
Hovered for a split second
like I was floating.

147
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,376
I'm telling you,
I think I can fly.

148
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:25,257
Is Owen decided?

149
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,312
I'll tell you what,
you think you can fly,

150
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:28,754
why don't you just off
the Brooklyn Bridge?

151
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:29,809
See what happens.

152
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,927
Maybe I oughta start with something a little lower first.
It's le leng twalk.

153
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:35,926
- You're serious?
- Oh, I'm serious.

154
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,009
You need to snap
out of it, Peter.

155
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,234
Go  see a doctor.
Get some drugs.

156
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,486
Do not pull a Roger
Clinton on me, man.

157
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,877
I'm 8 points down in the polls.

158
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,557
This is not about you,
all right?

159
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,106
Something is happening to me.

160
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,834
And I have this feeling that you're the
only person that's gonna understand.

161
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,815
Why the hell would I understand
that you think you can fly?

162
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,377
Because you're my brother.

163
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:57,757
Mom, look, I can't talk right now,
I've got...

164
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,127
What?

165
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,835
I'll be there in ten minutes.

166
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,137
- What did she do now?
- She got arrested.

167
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,427
- Arrested for what?
- Shoplifting.

168
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:09,987
I'm so depressed.

169
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,657
What? What are you
talking about? Why?

170
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,444
- Camera ready?
- Yeah.

171
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,916
Besides the fact that it was so gross,
I almost fudge myself,

172
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,834
this is the single coolest thing that
happened in this town in like a
100 years.

173
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:24,225
Not if nobody finds out,
it's not.

174
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,444
Why did you want
me to tape you?

175
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,064
I have my reasons.

176
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:32,983
It's not like you're not
gonna be popular anymore

177
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,397
Popular?

178
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,793
who said anything about being popular?

179
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:39,809
my life as I know it is over, okay?

180
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,217
I've got the Bishop game next week,
SATs in October,

181
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,545
homecoming is 3 weeks from
today and I'm a freak show!

182
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:47,215
You're being a little dramatic,
don't you think?

183
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:48,708
No, I don't think.

184
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,045
I have busted like
every bone in my body,

185
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,617
stabbed myself in the chest,

186
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:56,885
I've shoved a two foot steel rod through
my neck and I don't have a scratch
on me.

187
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,717
What do you call that thing,
sticking out?

188
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:03,228
Great!

189
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:10,855
Just give me the tape, okay?

190
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:22,591
I can give you a ride
on my handlebars. If you want.

191
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:27,526
Look...thanks, okay?

192
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,289
I'll talk to you in front of
people at school tomorrow.

193
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:32,628
Promise.

194
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,399
Your son is a very
intelligent boy.

195
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,889
Gifted, actually.
That's not the issue.

196
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:40,519
His father is not around and

197
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:43,847
sometimes I think he could use a
bit of a tronger hand, you know.

198
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:48,028
I work nights a lot but uh...

199
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:50,728
we can both work harder.

200
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,307
It's not about the work.

201
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:57,511
The truth is I just don't know if
this school is the right fit for him.

202
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:00,445
- But he's made friends.
- I'm sorry.

203
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,895
- He's on the soccer team.
- I'm sorry.

204
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,316
I wrote a check for $25,000 to
get him into this snob fest.

205
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:10,238
I was told that's what it took.

206
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,765
That's on top of the tuition.

207
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,987
About the tuition,
your last 3 checks have bounced.

208
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:18,166
Fine, take it out of the
25 grand that I gave you.

209
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:21,118
That was a donation and
it was very appreciated.

210
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,667
Well, I want my money back.

211
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:26,086
I want my money back now.

212
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,218
That money went to capital
campaign for the new wing.

213
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:30,095
- It's already been spent.
- Then unspend it.

214
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,167
I'm sorry.

215
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:34,795
We can maybe discuss an extension
of the money you owe but I...

216
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:38,766
I want my money back.

217
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:41,807
That's not possible.

218
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:45,775
Come on, baby.
Let's get out of here.

219
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:47,768
You're too good for
this lousy school.

220
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,628
Mom?

221
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,737
Leave me alone!

222
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,766
For god's sakes, ma.

223
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:07,325
Are you okay?

224
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:08,828
They  dropped the charges.

225
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,638
I had to fill out a form.
No big deal.

226
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,928
No big deal?
I'm running for Congress.

227
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:13,806
Do you have any idea what this is
gonna do to me if it gets out?

228
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,006
With our family's past.

229
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:18,177
What could you possibly need so
bad that you had to steal it?

230
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,976
Nevermind, I don't wanna know.

231
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:21,966
- Socks?
- Socks.

232
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:25,768
Dad left you a fortune.
What are you thinking?

233
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:27,316
You know,
it's been one ridiculous stunt

234
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,156
after another with you
for the last 6 months.

235
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,978
Dad's gone. Just get over it.

236
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:32,448
You know what? Leave her alone.

237
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,865
She's okay.
That's all that matters.

238
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,377
I gotta keep this out of the press.

239
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,547
You know what?
Just get out of here.

240
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,825
Go worry about you,
I'll handle this.

241
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,435
Yeah, good,
I gotta make sure this stays buried.

242
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,867
Thanks a lot, ma'!

243
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,836
What were you thinking?

244
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,886
I just wanted to
feel alive again.

245
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:03,768
Nathan only cares
about himself.

246
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:05,518
Your  father was the same way.

247
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,555
Alpha dogs, both of them.

248
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,475
You, in the meantime,
for all your selflessness and

249
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,395
sitting with dying people...

250
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:17,817
What? You're gonna retire
with what you make?

251
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:19,525
Maybe I'll shoplift my socks.

252
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:20,825
Don't get smart.

253
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,697
When you put everyone else first,
you end up last.

254
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,405
You always put Nathan first,
he took advantage.

255
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:29,386
It wasn't you that was just pushing
him right out in front of me?

256
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:31,747
He takes up more
space than you.

257
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:33,111
Demanded more attention.

258
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,595
And besides it's not my fault,
you allowed it.

259
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,027
He's my brother, I love him.

260
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,387
Love is overrrated.

261
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,466
He loves me too.

262
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,805
You know it.

263
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,177
You've always been close.

264
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:45,348
Croseolorlasses.

265
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:46,938
That's cruel, mom.

266
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,327
Since dad died I know you've been
feeling free to speak your mind

267
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:54,527
but it wouldn't hurt to edit
yourself every once in a while.

268
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,397
I'm sorry if the truth hurts.

269
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,028
I'm just saying you
hero worships him.

270
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:03,198
And those feelings
will never return.

271
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,237
You're wrong.

272
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:06,705
It's biological.
I can't help it. We're..

273
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:08,828
We're connected.

274
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:14,625
I never told you this

275
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,547
but when Nathan
had his accident,

276
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,715
I knew it.

277
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,017
We all got the same call.

278
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,596
No, I'm saying before the call.

279
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,258
Like he was telling me.
300 miles away.

280
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:28,017
I woke up and I knew
that he'd been hurt.

281
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,105
I hate it here.

282
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,605
She doesn't even have
any books to read.

283
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:39,786
Baby, I'll be right back.

284
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,586
I'm just gonna go and pack
up a few things, okay?

285
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,017
We should really go see dad.

286
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,195
- What good would that do?
- He could help.

287
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,102
He should know that someone
is trying to hurt us.

288
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:51,128
Your dad is in no position
to help us right now.

289
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,088
Look, I made some mistakes.

290
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:56,888
- I admit it.
- Mom, what did you do?

291
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:00,635
Hey.

292
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:04,225
I need you to know that I would
never let anything happen to you.

293
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:05,936
I promise.

294
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,105
Mom, why did you look at yourself
like that in the fish tank?

295
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:20,115
- How long?
- A couple hours tops.

296
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,247
There's some ice
cream in the fridge.

297
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,157
Go ahead.

298
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:29,998
- What happened?
- I went to see Linderman.

299
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:31,297
How much?

300
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:32,257
30.

301
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,877
You're gambling again?

302
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:35,505
No, it's just bills.

303
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:38,185
I used the rest to get
Mika into private school.

304
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:40,807
I don't know what to do
with him in public and...

305
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,767
it's just I needed them
to think that we had money

306
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:46,058
on the mob?

307
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:48,437
Hell, Nicky.

308
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:51,857
- You weren't born yesterday.
- It's just 2 weeks overdue.

309
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,106
I thought that I
could handle it, okay?

310
00:21:54,242 --> 00:21:57,695
- I'm under a lot of stress, okay?
- Gee, I wonder why!

311
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:01,946
I feel like I'm kinda
losing it a little bit.

312
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:06,365
I'm seeing things.

313
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,446
Like?

314
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:11,376
Like I keep feeling like
someone is watching me.

315
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:14,627
Yeah, Linderman wants his money
back so he sent some mouthbreather

316
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:16,316
that's gonna put
you in the hospital.

317
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,407
No, it is someone else.

318
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:22,497
It's someone that I can't see.

319
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,377
Does this make
any sense to you?

320
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:31,916
No.

321
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,095
- I'm sorry. You know what...
- But I'll tell you what does.

322
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:38,227
I shouldn't be
telling you this.

323
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:40,015
No, let me tell you
what does make sense.

324
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,428
You need to come up with that
30 grand plus interests now.

325
00:22:43,872 --> 00:22:45,535
Or you gotta run.

326
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:48,167
Watch him.

327
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:51,047
All right.

328
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,485
Cool, huh?

329
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,114
How hot do you think
it is in there?

330
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,035
Turn on the camera.

331
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:16,801
Scotty! Scotty! Come on!

332
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:25,729
- Take it easy.
- I'm okay.

333
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:27,260
- You're all right.
- I'm fine.

334
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:35,270
There's no burns.

335
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:59,650
I was real sorry to
hear about your father.

336
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:01,201
Seemed like a good guy.

337
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:04,399
Man!

338
00:25:05,115 --> 00:25:06,779
I thought I was a slob!

339
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:09,072
They were here too.

340
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:10,739
- What?
- Nothing.

341
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:12,710
I got a guy who can clean
this up for a 100 bucks.

342
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,949
No, it's all right.
I'll take it as it is.

343
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:16,492
We rent by the week.

344
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:18,722
I'm gonna need to know
you can afford it.

345
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:21,370
- I have a job.
- Doing what?

346
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:25,131
Driving a taxi.

347
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:27,710
I'll get you an application.

348
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,702
Oh, god, what?
The si tntreatment?

349
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:47,066
Oh, boy.

350
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,180
Isaac...

351
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:52,761
what are you doing?

352
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:55,347
What the hell is wronG with you

353
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:57,264
Isaac

354
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,521
Okay, stop

355
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:02,866
What are you, crazy?

356
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:03,947
 clearly.

357
00:27:04,954 --> 00:27:06,620
I don't even remember
painting these.

358
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:08,740
I Was high, okay?

359
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:10,152
- I lied to you.
- Damn it.

360
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:11,764
I've been chasing
for a month.

361
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:14,513
Well, then get yourself back into a program
and make it stick this time.

362
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:14,522
- These are fantastic.
- No, they're evil.

363
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:19,276
What are you talking out?

364
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:22,771
Want to know what I'm talking about?

365
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:25,931
You see this?

366
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:28,164
Suice bombingin israel.

367
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:30,836
- I painted it three weeks ago
- Yeah .  and  so?

368
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:34,843
so...that's this morning's paper.

369
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,422
Look at the number on thhe bus

370
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:39,853
This happened yesterday.

371
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:42,835
Yesterday.

372
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,694
Something's wrong with me.

373
00:27:48,694 --> 00:27:50,000
Well  i'll get you help, isaac.

374
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:53,711
 I've tried that twice
and there's only one way left, and you know it.

375
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:55,781
 You can't go cold turkey. Not alone.

376
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:57,701
- I mean, let me help you, please.
-  No

377
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,630
I Love you.

378
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,643
I'll drag you down with me. I swear i will

379
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:04,749
 just leave me alone.

380
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:07,011
Get out of here!

381
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:11,403
Now!

382
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,449
 an unidentified samaritan
 witnses ribe as

383
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:25,799
youeenage girL  ran into the flames and rescued

384
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:30,206
the young lieutenant.
 Now, the train is registered
 to the nuclear
 gutory commiion,

385
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:34,701
ss and ere has been no official statement yet
 on whawas inhe c

386
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:48,575
 it wasn't easy, nathan,
 but consider it gone.

387
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,446
I know,
I owe you big on this one, Tom.

388
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,118
- I'm not gonna forget it.
- I won't let you forget it.

389
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:54,738
- Thanks.
- Sure thing.

390
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,315
Mom's wrap sheet is
now officially buried.

391
00:28:57,411 --> 00:29:00,306
It only took half of my political
capital to pull her off.

392
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,865
Why can't she get herself a hobby?
Like a normal person?

393
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,828
They were married 41 years.

394
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:10,416
It's a plea for attention.
She's lonely.

395
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,925
Give her some time, will you?

396
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:15,008
I don't have time.
I've got 8 days to make up 10 points.

397
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,765
I need all the help I can get which
is what I want to talk to you about.

398
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,255
I wanna offer you a job.

399
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:22,308
- A job?
- Yeah.

400
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,518
I trust you.
You're good with people.

401
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,618
I  need a coordinator to help
organize the volunteers and

402
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,567
you got nice guy instincts,
I could use that.

403
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:33,475
I'm a shark, Pete.

404
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,027
Everybody knows it.

405
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,046
It's starting to show
up in the polls.

406
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,618
I bring you on, it kinda reflects
well on me. You know what I mean?

407
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,728
All right,
so I'm making you look good?

408
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:43,617
That's a new one.

409
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,698
Makes me look like
I put family first.

410
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:47,878
I mean I know that
sounds self-serving but

411
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,326
this is for you too, right?

412
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,846
You gotta think of your future.

413
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:52,207
How do you do that?

414
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,997
Do what?

415
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:56,277
Even try to make it look like
this has something to do with me.

416
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:59,147
You didn't hear anything that
I said earlier today, did you?

417
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,308
You mean about how you can fly?
Yeah, I did.

418
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:04,065
I'm gonna pretend fo both our sakes
you didn't say anything like that.

419
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,995
I'm trying to do the
right thing here.

420
00:30:06,562 --> 00:30:07,608
I already have a job.

421
00:30:07,731 --> 00:30:10,477
Yeah, watching old people die,
now there's a career.

422
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,398
It's not cute anymore, man.

423
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:14,696
The dreamy kid sitting in
the back of the classroom,

424
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:15,897
staring at the window.

425
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,276
It's time for you to grow up.

426
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:23,615
Look, I cast a big shadow, Pete.
I get it.

427
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,485
Life isn't fair.

428
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:28,036
But there's nothing
I can do about that.

429
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,498
I'm trying to do the right
thing by you here, okay?

430
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,287
I don't want your pity.

431
00:31:08,372 --> 00:31:09,198
Hey.

432
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:12,327
Corner of Center
and Canal, please.

433
00:31:20,864 --> 00:31:21,731
Wow.

434
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:26,909
- Solar eclipse.
- Yeah.

435
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:29,171
Yeah, I wonder if it's
gonna be a total.

436
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:30,529
Not here, no.

437
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,622
In some other part
of the world, yes.

438
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,039
A global event.

439
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:37,711
Makes one appreciate just how
small our planet really is.

440
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:40,379
And we're all quite small really,
aren't we?

441
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:44,380
What's your name?

442
00:31:44,597 --> 00:31:45,840
Mohinder.

443
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:47,299
I'm Peter.

444
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,652
May I ask you
something, Mohinder?

445
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:52,219
Do you ever get the
feeling like you were meant

446
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:55,642
to do something extraordinary?

447
00:31:56,897 --> 00:31:58,821
I'm driving a cab,
you may have noticed.

448
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:01,332
I'm not talking about what you do,
I'm talking about...

449
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:02,691
who you are.

450
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:04,490
I'm talking about...

451
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:06,319
being special.

452
00:32:06,454 --> 00:32:08,199
Yes, we are all special.

453
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:11,162
It's not what I meant.

454
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:19,002
Some individuals,
it is true, are more special.

455
00:32:19,257 --> 00:32:21,209
This is natural selection.

456
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:23,461
It begins as a
single individual.

457
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:26,719
Born or hatched like every
other member of their species.

458
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:29,679
Anonymous, seemingly ordinary.

459
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:31,430
Except they're not.

460
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:33,809
They carry inside
them the genetic code

461
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:37,349
that will take their species to
the next evolutionary round.

462
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:40,650
It's destiny.

463
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:51,029
Hey, I can't believe
you left like that.

464
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,369
I know, I was there.

465
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:56,042
You saved that dude's life.

466
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:40,959
Welcome home.

467
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,388
Get over there.

468
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:54,048
50 grand is a lot of money.

469
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:55,309
50?

470
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:57,028
It was 30.
Even with interest...

471
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,268
Mr. Linderman wants to
be nice about this.

472
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:01,308
You should have read
the fine print.

473
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:05,408
Look, I have a son.

474
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:07,450
I'm all he's got.

475
00:35:11,255 --> 00:35:13,078
Please, I can get
you the money.

476
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:14,810
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.

477
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:17,459
I'm gonna make you a little
business proposition.

478
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:18,587
You make what?

479
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:22,259
40 bucks for every 20 minutes
you take off your clothes?

480
00:35:22,423 --> 00:35:25,342
I'm gonna give you a chance
to lower your debt a little.

481
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:28,387
And see where it
goes from there.

482
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:32,429
Come on.

483
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:41,229
Come on. Show me what you got.

484
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:53,168
Lift up your shirt, baby.

485
00:35:55,973 --> 00:35:58,378
Ooh, look at that belly.

486
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:00,968
Smile for me.

487
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:04,220
Is that what you want?

488
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:05,759
Ah, yes.

489
00:36:09,012 --> 00:36:10,257
What's the matter, baby?

490
00:36:10,394 --> 00:36:12,520
You just gotta
get it good here.

491
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:14,679
What's the problem, baby?

492
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,689
I said what's the matter?

493
00:36:21,485 --> 00:36:22,648
Screw you!

494
00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:23,818
Screw me?

495
00:38:42,092 --> 00:38:44,378
Hi, this is Nicky.
Leave me a message.

496
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,131
mom, are you there?

497
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:49,302
When are you coming
 to get me?

498
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,923
 I hate it here

499
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:54,333
 You said you'd be back soon
 just come and  pick me up  okay?

500
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:46,697

00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:22,004
where to my friend?

509
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:23,985
JFK, please.

510
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,507
Going home to my family.

511
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,885
These business trips
are wearing me out.

512
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,098
- Suresh, huh?
- I'm sorry.

513
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:45,477
Your name...
on your license there.

514
00:40:45,783 --> 00:40:47,437
That's indian, yes?

515
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:53,317
There was a professor Suresh
in the university of Madras.

516
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,237
Geneticist.
Interesting theories.

517
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,955
Don't think he's
teaching anymore.

518
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,708
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

519
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:06,207
Probably a lot of Sureshs
where you're from.

520
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:09,336
Like Smith... or Anderson.

521
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,278
And then Carla

522
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,867
had the nerve to tell me

523
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:32,697
he's not breed worthy.

524
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:36,264
Like he didn't win 5 all breed rallies,
two regionals.

525
00:41:36,364 --> 00:41:37,534
 Can you believe it?

526
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:40,107
It's just not true,
Mr. Mubbles.

527
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:43,248
It's not true, He's a little stud muffin.
 That's what he is.

528
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,489
He still humps my
leg when I watch TV.

529
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:49,159
All right, enough about,
Mr. Mubbles.

530
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:51,460
What did everybody
else do today?

531
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:53,461
Doug and I saw
this mexican guy.

532
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:55,960
A homeless dude,
on the way to school.

533
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:57,458
We thought he was dead.

534
00:41:57,555 --> 00:41:59,010
But he wasn't.

535
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:01,680
I thought dad was
coming home today.

536
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:03,930
Well, I was gonna
surprise you...

537
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,070
He finished up early,
he's coming home tonight.

538
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:07,218
Ain't that great?

539
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:09,190
Just in time to read
my report card.

540
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:12,060
So what about you Claire?
Do anything special today?

541
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:20,741
I walked through fire
and I didn't get burned.

542
00:42:24,915 --> 00:42:26,908
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

543
00:42:27,035 --> 00:42:28,459
God! You're so crazy sometimes.

544
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:29,159
Lyle!

545
00:42:31,254 --> 00:42:34,000
I think I know
exactly what you mean.

546
00:42:34,173 --> 00:42:37,381
Here I am talking dogs again

547
00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:40,970
and you go and say
something really profound!

548
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:44,259
We come up against all
kinds of fires in our lives

549
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:48,099
and when we test ourselves
and face our fears,

550
00:42:48,396 --> 00:42:50,811
we usually don't get burned.

551
00:42:51,023 --> 00:42:53,467
You are very wise, sweetheart.

552
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,140
Whatever it is you did,

553
00:42:55,267 --> 00:42:56,641
I'm proud of you.

554
00:42:56,726 --> 00:43:01,556
And so is Mr. Mubbles.
He's just so proud of Claire.

555
00:43:00,148 --> 00:43:01,742
Aren't we?
We're proud of Claire.

556
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:04,562
Yes, we're so proud of Claire,
aren't we?

557
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,230
What are you looking for?

558
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:33,322
- Morphine.
- What for?

559
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,382
I need you to come
with me some place.

560
00:44:35,415 --> 00:44:36,321
Where?

561
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:37,573
You'll see.

562
00:44:38,036 --> 00:44:40,333
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

563
00:44:40,455 --> 00:44:41,761
That is gonna have to wait.

564
00:44:41,798 --> 00:44:44,543
No, look,
I need to tell you about this, okay?

565
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,430
I need to stop living
for other people.

566
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,931
My whole life, I've...
I've no idea what I'm supposed to do,

567
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:51,982
what I'm supposed to be if I'm
gonna have a destiny of my own...

568
00:44:52,015 --> 00:44:54,393
I promise you we will talk
about this later, okay?

569
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,011
All right,
now I really need you to come with me.

570
00:44:57,147 --> 00:44:59,801
You're a nurse.
You can give out a shot.

571
00:45:00,017 --> 00:45:02,103
- You can help him.
- Help who?

572
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:06,280
I thought we could
go to the movies.

573
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:08,323
It's Saturday. Maybe...

574
00:45:08,745 --> 00:45:12,410
try on some shoes at the
new mall in Garden Dale.

575
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:15,200
Sure.

576
00:45:17,835 --> 00:45:19,211
I love you, mom.

577
00:45:20,837 --> 00:45:21,631
But?

578
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:29,301
No buts, I just...
wanted to tell you that.

579
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:33,303
No, you think I'm trying to be
your best friend again, admit it.

580
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:34,721
No, it's...

581
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:37,300
It's all right,
we can go to the movies together.

582
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:38,731
It's no big deal.

583
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:42,270
I just miss you. That's all.

584
00:45:43,946 --> 00:45:47,070
I wanna be your mom. I wanna...

585
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,402
give you advice but I
don't wanna push you away.

586
00:45:50,906 --> 00:45:52,743
I want advice, I do. I...

587
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,582
I won't push you
away I promise.

588
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:04,632
I just don't think you should
be so worried about...

589
00:46:04,717 --> 00:46:06,630
fitting in all the time.

590
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:09,341
About being so popular.

591
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,222
I don't wanna see you
make mistakes like I did.

592
00:46:12,308 --> 00:46:15,853
I wanted to be someone more
interesting than I am.

593
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:17,812
You are interesting.

594
00:46:17,937 --> 00:46:20,772
You breed show dogs.
Whose mom does that?

595
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:24,150
No, I wanted to
hitchhike across Europe,

596
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:25,401
study art,

597
00:46:25,526 --> 00:46:27,232
fall in love with some...

598
00:46:27,365 --> 00:46:29,321
poetry quoting french man.

599
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:32,651
Not that your dad isn't
wonderful but my point is...

600
00:46:32,787 --> 00:46:35,951
You should know who you are
and know that it's enough.

601
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:38,741
'Cause who you are is special.

602
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:43,582
About that.

603
00:46:45,046 --> 00:46:47,132
There's something
I need to say.

604
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:51,971
Something I never talked about 'cause
I thought it would upset you and dad.

605
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:55,842
Sweetheart, you can say anything to us,
you know that.

606
00:46:58,438 --> 00:47:01,933
I think I'm old enough for you to
tell me who my real parents are.

607
00:47:05,566 --> 00:47:07,270
Of course, you are.

608
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,280
Honey!

609
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:13,900
I'm home!

610
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:15,611
Your father...

611
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,621
Hey, honey.

612
00:47:22,168 --> 00:47:24,421
Bad Mr. Mubbles! No!

613
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,381
- I'm glad you're home.
- Oh, me too.

614
00:47:30,555 --> 00:47:33,643
I've such a headache. I slammed my
head getting out of a taxi cab.

615
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:34,843
Hi, daddy!

616
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,471
Hey, baby!

617
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:01,002
I'm just saying it's
impossible, okay?

618
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:03,630
- Nobody can predict the future.
- I saw it with my own eyes, Peter.

619
00:49:03,668 --> 00:49:05,741
Isaac! I brought
someone here to help.

620
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:06,873
He's a nurse.

621
00:49:09,215 --> 00:49:10,172
Isaac!

622
00:49:12,588 --> 00:49:13,500
Isaac!

623
00:49:18,057 --> 00:49:19,013
Isaac!

624
00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:22,748
isaac

625
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:24,471
Simone

626
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:26,433
Oh God!

627
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:28,142
Okay.

628
00:49:28,908 --> 00:49:31,312
- Oh my God! Isaac?
- He's alive.

629
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:32,902
- Call 911.
- Yes.

630
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:35,703
What have you done?

631
00:49:38,628 --> 00:49:41,028
 God,  he's overdosed.

632
00:49:45,755 --> 00:49:50,262
Yeah, I'm at 215 Reed Street.
Number 7.

633
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:52,221
I need an ambulance
here immediately.

634
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,532
he's OD

635
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,665
 no, no, he's conscious

636
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:58,893
Just barely.

637
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:05,731
I know. Listen, could you just come
and get here soon, please.

638
00:50:07,168 --> 00:50:11,217
Okay, baby,  it's okay.
 they'rr sending an ambance  right away, okay?

639
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:12,991
you just hang in there, okay?

640
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:15,268
 You're gonna be okay,
 I swear.

641
00:50:20,346 --> 00:50:21,591
We have to stop it.

642
00:50:26,685 --> 00:50:28,102
We have to stop it.

643
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,901
This quest,

644
00:50:43,077 --> 00:50:46,240
this need to solve
life's mysteries.

645
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:48,911
In the end what does it matter

646
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:53,622
when the human heart can only find
a meaning the smallest of moments.

647
00:50:55,048 --> 00:50:56,542
They're here.

648
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:58,753
Among us.

649
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,341
In the shadows, in the light.

650
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,890
Everywhere.

651
00:51:07,017 --> 00:51:08,721
Do they even know yet?

652
00:51:22,576 --> 00:51:24,323
All right, I'm here.

653
00:51:25,825 --> 00:51:27,201
Now what do you want?

654
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,292
Peter?

655
00:51:37,298 --> 00:51:39,423
I've been up here all night.

656
00:51:39,557 --> 00:51:41,263
Thinking about this.

657
00:51:41,386 --> 00:51:43,050
Thinking about my destiny.

658
00:51:44,346 --> 00:51:45,892
What you doing, Pete?

659
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:48,762
It's my turn to be
somebody now, Nathan.

660
00:51:49,187 --> 00:51:51,563
Come on, Peter.
Quit screwing around.

661
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:34,940
Peter!

662
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,198
You're flying nathen

663
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,250
You're flying...

664
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:47,094
How did you

665
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:48,898
I don't know.

666
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:55,435
no

667
