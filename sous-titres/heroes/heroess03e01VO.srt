00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,510
Manhattan new york

2
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,760
4 years in the future.

3
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,890
Come on Claire.

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,190
It's me.

5
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,940
Put down the gun.

6
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,830
I can't. It's here

7
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,000
No  no

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,940
Wait wait

9
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,610
I'm going back

10
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,040
To the day they found out

11
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,890
It's too late

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,800
It isn't.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,840
Think about it Claire.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,110
It wouldn't be like this if they never known about us.

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,230
No caves.

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,110
No experiments.

17
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,890
No hiding underground hunting like this.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,040
All these powers.

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,270
It can destory everything.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,840
I made peace with that a long time ago. You never did

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,790
What happen to you Claire.

22
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,290
How did you get to this place.

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,410
I'm different remember.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,270
Special.

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,010
I can fix.

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,030
All of this everything please.

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,460
Sorry Peter.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,900
I always loved you.

29
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,620
Present day.

30
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,770
Chapter one the second coming.

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,770
Something incredible has happend to me.

32
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,220
It changed my life.

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,550
First i was afraid.

34
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,010
But i'm not afraid anymore. I'm here to tell you the truth.

35
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,030
I have the ability...

36
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,300
Get ambulance here now.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,200
Stay with him.

38
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,900
Don't leave him.

39
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,130
Where is he.

40
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,130
I lost him.

41
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,460
Did you get a look at him.

42
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,370
No

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,480
No

44
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,680
Police currently have no lead that the cause of the shooting.

45
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,820
And the investigation is under way to locate the gunman.

46
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,570
The building has been sealed off.

47
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,760
Mr.Petrelli was in the middle of a public statement.

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,060
When he was hit with two bullets to the chest.

49
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,220
-hello  -peter it's me.

50
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,170
Is he?

51
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,250
Oh, it's bad

52
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,460
We are gonna get him to the hospital

53
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,970
I should be there i could help

54
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,120
No he is getting surgery...

55
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,130
But my blood can...

56
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,970
Claire you are in california

57
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,200
He needs to be in hospital right now

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,350
I will call you as soon as i know he is ok

59
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,830
He was down for four minutes.

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,760
Hang two units of blood, charge the paddles.

61
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,920
This is a restricted area.

62
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,860
I'm his brother.

63
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,110
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,170
Is he gonna make it?

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,060
Let's go!

66
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,480
Paddles ready. Here you go.

67
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,610
Clear!

68
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,600
Nothing.

69
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,900
No response?

70
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,410
360.

71
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,710
Clear!

72
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,520
Dr. Slade, 331.

73
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,280
You busy,sir?

75
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,880
Stop calling me "sir."

76
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,440
Just because I'm in his office doesn't mean I'am becoming my father

77
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,920
I can't help it. I'm intimidated.

78
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,410
Intimidared?

79
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,640
Why?

80
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,530
Your power. Look at you

81
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,050
You own fifty-one percent of the company now...

82
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,140
...A fleet of corporate jets... , I can teleport, remember?

83
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,280
...And two hundred and fifty million in cash

84
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,880
A temporary setback

85
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,330
I have no interest in money

86
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,760
You can always give it to me

87
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,530
I'm extremely intetestd in money

88
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,600
Money won't show me my destiny

89
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,460
I saved the world  twice

90
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,130
Now look at me, a man without a quest

91
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,900
All I do is sit here bored

92
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,310
It's not like destiny is going to come

93
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,660
Knocking at my door

94
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,360
What is it?

95
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,600
My family's lawyer.

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,130
He gave me this.  What is it?

97
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,960
Seems my father recorded a DVD message to me before he died

98
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,250
He said it was about my destiny

99
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,380
Police currently have no leads

100
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,990
As to the cause of the shooting,

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,660
And an investigation is underway

102
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,160
To locate the gunman.

103
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Hello, Claire.

104
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,090
I bet you been wondering where I've been

105
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,320
Since you saw me last, huh?

106
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,750
Let's just say I took a little...

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,700
Detour from my career path.

108
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,810
Spent a little time south of the border but...

109
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,340
It's all behind me now, like a long night

110
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,970
After a bad taco.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No.

112
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,580
I saw Hiro Nakamura kill you. I was there.

113
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,100
And yet here I am, fully recovered.

114
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,940
Well, not fully.

115
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,630
That's actually why I've come.

116
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,380
What do you want from me?

117
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,210
Same thing I did last time I came for you.

118
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,860
I want what you have, Claire.

119
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,700
I want your power.

120
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,520
Maya! Oh, my god!

121
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,490
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.

122
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,150
I thought it was Sylar coming back.

123
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,530
I saw the doorknob moving.

124
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,340
It's this damn key.

125
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,580
It's bent.

126
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,640
How did it go with Molly?

127
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,840
Harder than I had wished for.

128
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,690
Flight attendants said they'd look after her

129
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,460
Until she landed, but...

130
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,720
I just hope I did the right thing.

131
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,540
She'll be safe now.

132
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,230
No one's gonna find her there.

133
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,900
And now we can finally start my examination.

134
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,790
Yeah, about that...

135
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,050
I know I promised you, Maya,

136
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,150
But I really am in no position to help you.

137
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,390
What do you mean?

138
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,380
I mean I've hit a dead end with my research.

139
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,170
There's nothing left for me to do here.

140
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,570
I'm packing up my things and I'm going home to india.

141
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,170
I don't understand.

142
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,440
After all this time, I've found nothing

143
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,500
That leads me to believe I can take these powers away.

144
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,450
But I came all the way from south america

145
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,640
To find you... For a cure.

146
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,460
And I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

147
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,360
But you haven't even tried.

148
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,880
It's not fair.

149
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,690
You can't do this to me.

150
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,370
You have to try.

151
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,300
Maya.

152
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,110
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,270
I should go now.

154
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,660
No, wait.

155
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,320
Tell me what just happened.

156
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,600
When you got upset--angry-- your ability manifested.

157
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,680
Is it always that way?

158
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,860
Yes.

159
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,520
When I'm scared or mad, it just happens.

160
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,110
And to make it stop?

161
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,010
I just...Calm down somehow.

162
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,870
Like some kind of sympathetic nervous system response.

163
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,570
There's a mind-body connection.

164
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,400
The neural pathways that control...

165
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,100
What are you talking about?

166
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,180
Fight or flight.

167
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,670
The adrenal glands,

168
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,210
They control our stress levels.

169
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,730
My father had it all wrong.

170
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,410
For years he'd been working on a formula,

171
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,050
Trying to isolate

172
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,870
The gene for these abilities.

173
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,250
It's all here.

174
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,150
All this time I've been trying to make sense of it,

175
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,210
But he was looking in the wrong place.

176
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,360
These abilities don't originate in the blood.

177
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,390
They're produced from adrenaline.

178
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,560
All I have to do is make you mad again.

179
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,830
Hiro, if you're watching this, then I am dead.

180
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,820
I have left you my fortune.

181
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,880
But more important...

182
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,460
I leave you with a sacred duty.

183
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,590
You are now to be the sentinel of a dangerous secret.

184
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,160
A secret...?

185
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,550
One that you must keep, as I and my father before me had done.

186
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,630
It resides in my personal safe...

187
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,900
In the wrong hands, this secret will destroy the world...

188
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,320
So it is your task now, your sacred duty...

189
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,780
To never open the safe.

190
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,650
I don't want to be a sentinel!

191
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,250
I want to be a hero!

192
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,390
But you're protecting a dangerous secret...

193
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,310
That would destroy the world.

194
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,370
I'm doing nothing!

195
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,070
What are you looking for?

196
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,560
A way into the safe.

197
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,730
There must be a button.

198
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,130
Kaito Nakamura was like a father to me.

199
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,560
You will do his name a great dishonor.

200
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,580
I was nobody in my father's eyes until I proved I was my own man.

201
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,090
I can't go back to being nobody.

202
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,000
My destiny...Your destiny, Ando...

203
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,290
My destiny...Your destiny, Ando...

204
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,050
Is inside that safe.

205
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,170
Why would your thumb print work?

206
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,870
He doesn't want you to open it.

207
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,470
Or maybe he does.

208
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,470
"Press play."

209
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,450
I asked you not to open the safe.

210
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,440
But now that you have, beware, there are those...

211
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,360
Who will stop at nothing to get this half of the formula.

212
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,930
Formula?

213
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,390
Should it fall into the wrong hands,

214
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,300
There is only one hope;

215
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,880
A chosen one among you who carries the purity of blood,

216
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,150
The "light" to safeguard against the darkness.

217
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,200
Do you understand?

218
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,000
No. Not really.

219
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:38,800
So guard this half of the formula with your life...

220
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,280
The fate of the world depends on it..

221
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,660
Godspeed, my son.

222
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,070
Are you sure you should...

223
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,940
I knew I should've paid more attention in Chemistry class.

224
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,410
How are you doing this?

225
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,980
Are you a speedster too?

226
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,060
Speedster?

227
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,110
No, I'm Hiro Nakamura.

228
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,230
I stop time.

229
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,870
I got news.

230
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,470
You don't stop it completely,

231
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,380
Or we're not having this conversation.

232
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,370
So you move fast?

233
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,780
Not fast.

234
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,790
I move really fast.

235
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,200
Well, you stole something from me.

236
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,270
You mean this? Get--

237
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,490
This whole time-stopping thing, how does it work exactly?

238
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,280
I mean, if you chase me to bangkok,

239
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,190
Will time stay frozen here in tokyo?

240
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,640
I don't know.

241
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,690
Well...

242
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,050
Something to think about when you get back on your feet.

243
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,890
But I am on my feet.

244
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,990
Gotta go.

245
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,530
Peter.

246
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,140
You lookin' for this?

247
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,910
Hey, yeah, I was just...

248
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,370
Just, uh...

249
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,170
What?

250
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,930
It's pretty incredible, huh?

251
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,540
Nathan's recovery?

252
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,850
Said the bullets...

253
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,690
Went straight through him.

254
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,270
Barely any damage, like his body had

255
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,900
Already healed inside.

256
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,620
How'd you know where to find the gun, Peter?

257
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,980
I just...

258
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,850
Figured there weren't many places for him to stash it.

259
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,170
And what makes you think he stashed it?

260
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,340
You had to go and be the detective,

261
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,990
Didn't you, Matt?

262
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,720
How did--how did you--

263
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,640
I came from the future.

264
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,490
To stop Nathan from tellin' the world about us.

265
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,420
I had to.

266
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,990
It's where it all begins.

267
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,160
The future?

268
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,160
Now that you know, you can't be here.

269
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,540
Petrelli's miraculous recovery has this hospital staff

270
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,820
Completely baffled.

271
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,560
His condition has been upgraded to stable,

272
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,700
And he is resting comfortably.

273
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,440
The shocking footage that has been played

274
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,810
Over and over on news outlets and youtube

275
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,080
Has created a--

276
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,470
That's him.

277
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,720
That's him.

278
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,170
I was dead, and he gave me another chance.

279
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,260
But now I know...

280
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,640
The reason I'm here.

281
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,750
To do great things.

282
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,280
To do his bidding.

283
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,730
Mr. Petrelli,

284
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,870
Earlier today, you were about to make a statement.

285
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,740
You had a message to deliver.

286
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,660
Are you ready to do that now?

287
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,870
God is the only one with a message.

288
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,990
It's a message of hope and urgency

289
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
Because he's not gonna wait much longer.

290
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,690
His message is a simple one.

291
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,990
We're all connected.

292
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,340
Our hopes and our dreams,

293
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,960
Our children's future reflecting back in each other's eyes.

294
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,240
We fight our own personal battles.

295
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,700
But we know we're not alone.

296
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,820
Because only together can we make our short time

297
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,730
On this planet mean something.

298
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,960
Only together can we be the stewards of our own destiny.

299
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,350
And we hold in our... Collective hearts

300
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,700
One noble goal.

301
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:15,500
To save ourselves...

302
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,970
Save the world.

303
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,800
I've separated the tyrosine

304
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,400
And combined that with the dopamines produced

305
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,860
By your adrenals.

306
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,130
And what now?

307
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,060
We wait a few seconds and see if the enzymes

308
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,560
Attach to the cortisol.

309
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,870
You're very brave to have found me the way you did.

310
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,620
There was no other choice.

311
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,970
I imagine...

312
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,850
That it must be very unsettling to have these abilities.

313
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,000
But I have also imagined, many times,

314
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,230
The exhilaration one must feel to know such power.

315
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
To feel so special.

316
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,330
It worked.

317
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,210
What have you done?

318
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,650
What my father never could.

319
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,520
I've isolated the genetic building blocks

320
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,440
Of these abilities.

321
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,640
I've found its source.

322
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,720
I have to get to the loft, to my lab.

323
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,990
There's a centrifuge there.

324
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,630
I have to verify and duplicate these results.

325
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,300
This is incredible.

326
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,110
I don't understand.

327
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,410
What have you found?

328
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,490
The contents of this single syringe

329
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,360
Could give powers to anyone.

330
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,180
Give powers?

331
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,000
And with the added component of adrenaline,

332
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,140
The effects would be instantaneous.

333
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,900
I know you're scared.

334
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,470
I would be too...

335
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,660
All alone in this house with someone like me.

336
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,470
A man you barely know.

337
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,810
It isn't exactly a fair fight, I admit.

338
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,720
But I don't want to fight you, Claire.

339
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,030
I just want what you have.

340
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,240
You see, I lost everything that made me special.

341
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,150
Lost...

342
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,720
But now found.

343
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,920
There's a whole shopping list of abilities right here.

344
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,000
But I'm going to start with the best.

345
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,150
And once I have yours--

346
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,180
No!

347
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,610
What are you doing to me?

348
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,820
I'm looking for answers before I bleed to death.

349
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,670
Funny...

350
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,090
I'm looking for answers too.

351
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,330
Why don't I feel anything?

352
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,790
No nerve endings.

353
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,320
An amazing bit of machinery, this...

354
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,310
And how much of it do we actually use?

355
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,200
10%, maybe 20%.

356
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,520
Imagine the answers we'd have with 100%.

357
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,920
Why is there evil?

358
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,180
How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?

359
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,220
How do we make love stay?

360
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,890
All these answers, they're all...

361
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,400
They're all right here.

362
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,270
Are you going to eat it?

363
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,470
Eat your brain?

364
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,380
Claire, that's disgusting.

365
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,600
There it is.

366
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,160
Wait.

367
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,150
What about me?

368
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,790
Aren't you going to kill me?

369
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,350
Poor girl...

370
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,510
There's so much about yourself

371
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,210
You don't even understand.

372
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,640
Your brain is not like the others, Claire.

373
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,180
You are not like the others.

374
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,140
You're different.

375
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,590
You're special.

376
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,940
And I couldn't kill you, even if I wanted to.

377
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,130
You can never die.

378
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,990
And now, I guess, neither can i.

379
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,510
I ran two samples in the centrifuge.

380
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,390
The enzymes held both times.

381
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,630
You need to destroy that, dr. Suresh.

382
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,340
What?

383
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,710
What are you talking about?

384
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,910
It's like you said.

385
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,900
It's against the laws of nature.

386
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,020
No, Maya.

387
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,900
This is a discovery of world-changing proportions.

388
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,960
The possibilities for the advancement of science

389
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,010
For our entire species...

390
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,830
Ordinary people--

391
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,520
Will have my ability.

392
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,380
No, no.

393
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,580
Each individual's blood chemistry is unique,

394
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,740
Like fingerprints.

395
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,780
These abilities could manifest in an infinite number of ways.

396
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,230
But they can still end up terrible...

397
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,480
Like mine.

398
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,880
Or they could be wonderful.

399
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,980
Flight, telepathy, super-strength...

400
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,480
Of course it would have to be perfected.

401
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,800
There'll be research and development,

402
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,810
Clinical trials...

403
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,850
But in the wrong hands--

404
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,440
It's in the wrong hands now, Maya.

405
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,880
An entire clandestine company dedicated

406
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,550
To hiding it from the rest of the world.

407
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,200
Yes... Because of people like me.

408
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,930
People like Sylar.

409
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,160
Exactly.

410
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,800
Sylar killed my father.

411
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,290
If I had had a legitimate chance

412
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,770
To inject myself with this,

413
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,440
To give myself the power,

414
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,740
Then perhaps I could've stopped that.

415
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,880
That's my point.

416
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,080
You would actually inject yourself with that?

417
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,450
There are quantum leaps in science

418
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,480
That one dreams of being a part of.

419
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,400
This is one of them.

420
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,860
I don't see why you don't understand that.

421
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,320
I don't see why anyone would want

422
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,330
These abilities.

423
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,250
It's a curse!

424
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,510
Can what's in that syringe cure me

425
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,460
Or not?

426
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,880
Then it's evil.

427
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,190
And you should destroy it

428
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,810
For the sake of all of us.

429
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,930
Am I still here?

430
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,820
Yeah.

431
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,890
Touched by god.

432
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,690
That's what you said in the chapel.

433
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,080
I thought I dreamed that.

434
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,720
It's true, nate.

435
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,080
He saved me.

436
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,060
He came for me.

437
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,920
He brought me back.

438
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,420
We've seen what people like us can do.

439
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,910
Nathan...

440
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,970
Things no one in the world can.

441
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,700
I came back from the dead.

442
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,920
You had third-degree burns over half your body.

443
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,650
And who's to say this isn't the hand of god?

444
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,430
All of us with these powers...

445
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,560
Did you ever stop and think about it, pete?

446
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,190
We can be angels.

447
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,670
All here to do god's bidding.

448
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,050
What happened to telling the world about us?

449
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,750
Well, we couldn't be angels

450
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,780
If everyone knew, now could we?

451
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,040
I don't expect you to understand

452
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,240
What I did to you,

453
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,960
But I hope someday you'll forgive me.

454
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,290
Life is funny...

455
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,600
Isn't it Nathan?

456
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,720
Linderman...

457
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,660
You're the one who healed me.

458
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,610
"there's a divinity that shapes our ends,

459
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,980
Rough-hew them how we will."

460
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,470
It seems you and I are meant for great things, Nathan.

461
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,930
Great things, indeed.

462
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,990
The extraordinary claim of divine intervention

463
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,920
Has captured the imagination of the entire country.

464
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,890
And nowhere is it being greeted

465
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,620
With greater interest than by the leaders

466
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,590
Of the religious community.

467
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,000
In short, the elected congressman

468
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,790
From new york has become a cause celebre.

469
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,220
The poster child for political redemption.

470
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,350
Tracy, baby.

471
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,160
I think we've found our guy.

472
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,570
Isn't that my job, governor?

473
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,760
It's a message of hope and urgency...

474
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,900
'cause he's not going to wait much longer now.

475
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,310
What's his name?

476
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,900
Petrelli.

477
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,670
Nathan Petrelli.

478
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,690
Our hopes, our dreams, our children's futures

479
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,700
Reflecting back in each other's eyes.

480
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,990
I like him.

481
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,320
No!

482
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,380
Is there anybody here?!

483
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,700
It was like she was moving at the speed of sound.

484
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,100
She must known that I was going to open that safe.

485
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,560
What was so important on that paper?

486
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,200
I told you not to open it.

487
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,060
And what was my father talking about.

488
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,350
The “light”

489
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,590
Nevermind that.

490
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,620
What about the world being destroyed

491
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,240
If that formula falls into the wrong hands?

492
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,170
You have to go back to the past

493
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,970
And ask your father

494
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,970
I can't

495
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,160
I’m never going to the past again.

496
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,120
You saw what happened last time.

497
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,490
I’ll go to the future

498
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,910
The future

499
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,600
To see for myself.

500
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,670
If the world is going to be destroyed...

501
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,970
I need to see how...

502
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,310
So we can stop it.

503
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,100
But...

504
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,620
What if you get stuck or...

505
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,970
Hiro. Give me back the formula.

506
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,390
No. You betrayed me.

507
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,690
You’re wrong

508
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,520
Well...?

509
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,870
We’ve gotta find that formula.

510
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,400
What have you done with Peter?

511
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,620
Who do you think

512
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,360
You inherited your first ability from?

513
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,950
Your dreams... I dreamed you'd come.

514
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,080
I saw what you'd do.

515
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,590
Shooting your own brother, for god's sake.

516
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,640
I had to.

517
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,680
It was Nathan who set everything in motion.

518
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,100
The powers, the greed,

519
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,980
The war.

520
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,230
Who are you to play god?

521
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,050
You can see the future?

522
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,310
Then you know that that formula

523
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,940
That you and your friends tried to bury...

524
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,370
It gets out, and it destroys everything.

525
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,830
The only future I've ever seen is the one caused by you.

526
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,500
Nathan didn't die.

527
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,430
And now he doesn't have to.

528
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,030
It doesn't Matter.

529
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,260
Because by shooting him, you screwed up everything.

530
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,300
Something different happens now.

531
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,490
And it's all because of you.

532
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,570
So why don't you go back to where you came from?

533
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,030
You understand?

534
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,430
Now...

535
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,970
What did you do with my son?

536
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,530
Don't worry.

537
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,140
I put him some place safe.

538
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,040
This is a mistake!

539
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,250
I'm not supposed to be here!

540
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,280
I'm not who you think I am.

541
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,210
I'm Peter Petrelli!

542
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,850
You've gotta help me!

543
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,230
I'm Peter Petrelli!!

544
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,620
"turning and turning in the widening gyre...

545
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,300
"the falcon cannot hear the falconer.

546
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,330
"things fall apart,

00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,760
"the center cannot hold.

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."

549
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,370
I'm Peter Petrelli!

550
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,120
Please get me out of here!

551
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,900
