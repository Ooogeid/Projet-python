1
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:04,796
<i>There are nearly seven billion
people on this planet.</i>

2
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:16,941
<i>Each one, unique,
different.</i>

3
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,251
<i>What are
the chances of that?</i>

4
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:21,349
<i>And why?</i>

5
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:24,510
<i>Is it simply biology?</i>

6
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:27,425
<i>Physiology that
determines this diversity?</i>

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,747
<i>A collection of thoughts,
memories?</i>

8
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:34,407
<i>Experiences that carve out
our own special place?</i>

9
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,641
<i>Or is it
something more than this?</i>

10
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:43,717
<i>Perhaps there's
a master plan</i>

11
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:46,549
<i>that drives the randomness
of creation.</i>

12
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,932
<i>Something unknowable
that dwells in the soul,</i>

13
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:52,353
<i>and presents
each one of us</i>

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,251
<i>with a unique set
of challenges</i>

15
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:58,355
<i>that will help us discover
who we really are.</i>

16
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:02,510
You okay?

17
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:04,427
Did you have a dream?

18
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:06,927
It's Nathan.

19
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,166
- What about him?
- He's--

20
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:11,945
He's what?

21
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:13,432
In trouble.

22
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:16,252
He's not
the only one.

23
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,608
What is it, Noah?

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,131
That construction work
we passed about a mile back

25
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:22,968
wasn't real.

26
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:25,687
There's going to be a road block
a half a mile or so ahead.

27
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,552
This is where
you get out.

28
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:34,245
<i>Okay...</i>

29
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,129
Head two miles
in that direction,

30
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:38,421
and then follow the
surface streets into the city.

31
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:39,580
What are you
going to do?

32
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:40,953
I'm going
to buy you some time.

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,936
Here.
It's a secure line.

34
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,292
I will find you.

35
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,766
Get to Nathan
and make sure it is him.

36
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,318
He'll be on Sylar's trail,
by now.

37
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:50,768
- But Dad, I--
- Listen to your father.

38
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:51,995
I love you,
Claire bear.

39
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:56,808
Okay.

40
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,865
Is there a problem,
Officer?

41
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,659
What are you doing?

42
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:48,848
I told you,
I need you to be Taub.

43
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:51,281
I'm not interested
in what you need.

44
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,050
I'm--

45
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,482
<i>Such a waste.</i>

46
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,407
You could've been
so helpful.

47
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,864
Just didn't
know your place.

48
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,714
Eddie and Gordon,
send a clean up crew to--

49
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,230
That hurt.

50
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:43,211
Shape-shifting...
Gotta love it, right?

51
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,856
Ah!

52
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,784
The changes don't just happen
on the outside, either.

53
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:54,115
You remember that little,
uh...

54
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,077
off-switch
in the back of my head?

55
00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:59,050
I moved it.

56
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,696
Go ahead,
get it over with.

57
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,517
My men will
be here any second

58
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:06,109
- to collect Petrelli.
- Shh, shh, shh.

59
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,865
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

60
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:09,733
I know.

61
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,117
I got plans for them.

62
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,333
Hell...

63
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,676
<i>I have plans for
all of us.</i>

64
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,795
You going to kill him?

65
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:27,583
Later.

66
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:29,653
<i>Right after
I absorb</i>

67
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,844
all of his memories.

68
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,424
It's a little ability
Angela Petrelli

69
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:33,713
fed me
like a snack.

70
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:36,728
Because Nathan,
and--

71
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:38,749
By Nathan,
I mean, I--

72
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:41,463
Have a rendezvous
with destiny tomorrow.

73
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,628
The President's giving
a speech at the Stanton Hotel.

74
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:46,140
Senator Petrelli's
going to be there

75
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:47,777
to have a little meeting
with him right afterwards.

76
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,656
What for?

77
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:50,049
Nothing.

78
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,492
Just to shake his hand.

79
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:54,643
<i>And when I do...</i>

80
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,829
I'm going to be the
most powerful man in the world.

81
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,195
You better kill me now.

82
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,867
Because there's no way
I'm going to let that happen.

83
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:05,651
No,
I don't need to kill you.

84
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:07,740
Because in 30 seconds,

85
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,926
there's not a person
on this planet

86
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,348
who'll believe
a word you say.

87
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,229
<i>Man down!
Man down!</i>

88
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:50,835
<i>I've got him.</i>

89
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:51,637
He's in here.

90
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,871
You son of a bitch.

91
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,573
You think there's a chance
he didn't get caught?

92
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,510
Noah? No.
That was his plan all along.

93
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,740
I don't know how
my dad always manages

94
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,492
to get himself
in the middle of everything.

95
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:27,969
Because
he puts himself there.

96
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,372
Mostly
because of you.

97
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,159
You have no idea
the lengths a parent will go

98
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:33,922
to ensure
the safety of their child.

99
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:36,832
Something I hope you never have
to find out for yourself.

100
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:38,318
Now...

101
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:39,918
This is where I get off.

102
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:42,351
What do you mean?

103
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,793
I just wanted to make sure
you got here safely.

104
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,535
I'm not going in there
with you to see Nathan.

105
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:47,250
Why not?

106
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:49,050
Because I need to go
find Matt Parkman.

107
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:51,016
Is this
about your dream?

108
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,754
In it,
Parkman saves Nathan's life.

109
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,318
Okay, so why
don't you just come up

110
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:57,174
and warn Nathan and tell him
how to avoid danger?

111
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:58,712
That's not
how it works.

112
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:00,841
I cannot change
what I dreamed.

113
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:03,066
But I can help
push its outcome.

114
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:04,879
Now...
You go find Nathan.

115
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:06,641
And I will find you
later.

116
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:19,601
Mmm.

117
00:07:21,938 --> 00:07:22,786
Nathan.

118
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,168
Wake up.

119
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:29,884
Hey.

120
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:31,448
Wake up.

121
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:32,984
You want
to be convincing

122
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:34,756
when we meet
the President today, right?

123
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,556
<i>I'm going to need
all those sick, little,</i>

124
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:37,899
<i>twisted memories
of yours.</i>

125
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:41,339
<i>Such a lightweight.</i>

126
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:43,433
To hell with it.

127
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:46,635
Got plenty of memories
from all this stuff

128
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,303
you've got lying
around here, anyway.

129
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:52,839
<i>Your diploma says</i>

130
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,821
<i>you graduated
with honors from Annapolis...</i>

131
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,803
These cufflinks
tell me a different story.

132
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:01,626
Politicians.

133
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:05,003
Sir, someone here
to see you.

134
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:06,429
She claims
to be your daughter?

135
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:09,650
All right...

136
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:11,981
Send her in.

137
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:22,728
Claire.

138
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:25,518
I'm glad
you finally made it.

139
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:27,432
I was beginning
to get worried about you.

140
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:29,110
Did you find him?

141
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:29,994
Sylar?

142
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:32,793
Yeah.
But he got away.

143
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,004
<i>He's going
to the Stanton Hotel</i>

144
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,560
<i>to meet the President
in an hour.</i>

145
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,746
I'm going to intercept
the President first

146
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:39,480
and warn him.

147
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:41,594
And tell him what?

148
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:45,245
That Nathan Petrelli
is a look-a-like?

149
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:46,908
If I have to,
yeah.

150
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,083
Blow the lid off
this whole thing.

151
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,842
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to shut down Building 26.

152
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,610
And how do I know
this is you?

153
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:58,226
What are you
talking about?

154
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,055
How do I know
you're not Sylar?

155
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:04,485
Claire.

156
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,500
I am me.

157
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:20,157
We've spent a lot of time
together over the past few days.

158
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,616
Mexico.

159
00:09:25,218 --> 00:09:27,094
I was beginning to think
you knew me better

160
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,032
than anyone else.

161
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,369
Sorry.

162
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:35,238
It's all right.

163
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:36,494
Listen.

164
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:38,279
Why don't you
stay here?

165
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,515
<i>I've got a car taking me
to the Stanton Hotel.</i>

166
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:43,028
Lay low until I can clean
this whole mess up.

167
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,598
No, I want
to come with you.

168
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,509
In case
anything goes wrong.

169
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,386
It's not going
to be safe.

170
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,012
So what?
I can't get hurt.

171
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,227
And I need to
help stop Sylar.

172
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:57,302
It's time I put myself
in the middle of this

173
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:58,479
and made a difference.

174
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:02,519
I was thinking
exactly the same thing.

175
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,071
You're right.

176
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:12,822
If things
do go south...

177
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:16,646
I want you right there.

178
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:19,846
Right by my side.

179
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,792
Right out.

180
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:35,346
- Come on.
- <i>Let's go.</i>

181
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,034
<i>This way.</i>

182
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,748
<i>Fancy
meeting you here.</i>

183
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,488
I bet you're happy
to see me.

184
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:37,689
Sylar...

185
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,341
We've got to stop him.

186
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:41,278
Oh!

187
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:43,914
A lot of help
you're going to be.

188
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,603
Okay,
let's hear it.

189
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:51,614
Lecture.

190
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:55,826
The finger-wagging,
the general "I told you so."

191
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:00,312
That I screwed up.

192
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:02,587
Refused to listen.

193
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:04,767
And then you got
into bed with Sylar.

194
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,545
<i>That's all over now.</i>

195
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:08,977
Clearly.

196
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,623
That's very
zen of you.

197
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:13,216
<i>No,
it's practical.</i>

198
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,517
If we get out of here,
we're going to have

199
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,652
to throw everybody
and everything we have at Sylar...

200
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:18,597
Trying to get a spike
into the back of his head.

201
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:22,223
A spike's not going
to cut it anymore.

202
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:25,127
He moved the spot.

203
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:28,173
Great.

204
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,741
How the hell
did you do it?

205
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,850
Deal with all of this?

206
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:42,506
Can't capture all of them,
can't contain them.

207
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:45,693
There are no rules.

208
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:48,677
Not even gravity.

209
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,286
It's all
about spinning plates.

210
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,279
<i>Living in
the Gray area.</i>

211
00:13:57,184 --> 00:14:00,437
20 years of middle management,
becomes second nature.

212
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,702
So in 20 years,
I'll get it?

213
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,156
20 years
and an adopted daughter.

214
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,023
<i>If I didn't have Claire,</i>

215
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,554
<i>I'd be following
the same dogma</i>

216
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:10,832
that took you
right over the edge.

217
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:13,558
I'd be <i>exactly</i>
in your position.

218
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:18,267
You are exactly
in my position.

219
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:22,787
Yeah.

220
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:28,722
We should do something
about that.

221
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,965
Together.

222
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:17,759
- <i>Hiro.</i>
- Hmm?

223
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,801
Holy crap!

224
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:52,885
Hiro.

225
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:23,005
Hiro?

226
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,086
Is this a trick?

227
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:29,700
I don't know.

228
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:35,142
No guards.

229
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:38,536
Something's
very wrong here.

230
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,855
Hiro.

231
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:45,260
Let's go.

232
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:46,826
<i>Hiro, what--</i>

233
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:48,396
What happened?

234
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:49,706
We are rescuing you.

235
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,181
I'll try to
repay you later.

236
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:53,374
But right now,
we have to get out of here

237
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:54,154
as soon as we can.

238
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:55,324
Woah,
are you okay?

239
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:56,561
No, he's not.

240
00:16:56,768 --> 00:16:59,015
He has nosebleeds and headaches
from stopping time.

241
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:00,554
Oh, I'm fine.

242
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:01,884
You're a doctor,
right?

243
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:03,256
Then you can help him.

244
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,832
Here,
open your eyes wide.

245
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,477
Your pupils are dilated.

246
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:12,262
Do you have any stiffness
in your left arm?

247
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:13,112
<i>Or dizziness?</i>

248
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:17,627
Yes.

249
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:21,569
But Bruce Wayne only slept
two hours a night.

250
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,004
- Hiro!
- <i>Hiro...</i>

251
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:25,659
These abilities allow us
to do superhuman things,

252
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,214
<i>but you are still human.</i>

253
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:29,024
And your human body
is rejecting these powers,

254
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,543
like, uh...
like a virus.

255
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:33,584
But this power...
It is what makes me strong.

256
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:35,249
My destiny.

257
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:38,149
You can't
freeze time again.

258
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:39,464
<i>Do you understand?</i>

259
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,453
Thanks.

260
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:48,107
So what's the plan?

261
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:52,146
We just tell them
the President's in danger?

262
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:54,309
That would just send them
down a rabbit hole.

263
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,745
And then Sylar can become...
a rabbit.

264
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,773
So we got to play close
to the vest.

265
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:02,528
Follow my lead,
okay?

266
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:03,381
<i>Nathan!</i>

267
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:04,854
It's good
to see you, man.

268
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:08,522
This is my daughter, Claire.
Claire, this is Liam.

269
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:10,617
Samuels.
The President's Chief of Staff.

270
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:13,485
I live in America.

271
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,003
Your dad and I
barely survived

272
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:16,020
boarding school
together.

273
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:17,028
Barely.

274
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,376
Listen, I really
appreciate the President

275
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,650
giving me some time
this afternoon.

276
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,870
Sure, he just
stepped up onstage.

277
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,606
Speech usually clocks in
about 90 minutes.

278
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:25,514
Whatever works for him.

279
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,207
But I'd like to stick around,
close by.

280
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:28,836
Absolutely.
We got a suite upstairs.

281
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:30,189
Come here.
Uh, do me a favor.

282
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:32,187
Sign in right here,
and, uh, Frank will show you

283
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:33,455
- how to get up there, all right?
- Okay.

284
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:34,868
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

285
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:38,619
I thought
you were right-handed.

286
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:41,245
Ambi-dextrous.

287
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:42,304
I bat righty.

288
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,370
Throw lefty.

289
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,053
<i>You coming?</i>

290
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:56,741
Prisoners are gone.

291
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,031
The entire unit's
been captured.

292
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,775
Seeing as how your unit
was trying to kill us,

293
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,649
I think
we caught a break.

294
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:06,382
How the hell
did this happen?

295
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,266
<i>I tried to tell you
before this whole thing started.</i>

296
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:11,720
Your men alone are
never going to be a match

297
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:13,044
for people
with abilities.

298
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:21,281
You sure
this will work?

299
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,938
Tasers didn't work
on Sylar,

300
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:25,138
but one shot of this
will put an elephant down.

301
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:28,013
Trick is getting close enough
to the elephant.

302
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,582
Hiro.

303
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:53,289
- Hiro!
- Call 911.

304
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:54,631
I've got to get
to the Stanton.

305
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,930
I've got
to stop Sylar.

306
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:57,053
Go,
we'll stay with him.

307
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:20,470
<i>Hello?</i>

308
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:22,720
Thank God.
Where are you?

309
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:24,475
I'm with Nathan.

310
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:25,963
Are you sure
it's him?

311
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:31,092
Oh, it's him.

312
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:33,545
Don't worry.

313
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:34,492
How do you know?

314
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:42,673
Because it's me.

315
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,595
Oh, God.

316
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:55,871
This is fun.

317
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,527
Don't you love
a good Pinot?

318
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:12,894
My dad's
on his way.

319
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,070
He's going
to stop you.

320
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:16,888
And then I'm going
to kill you.

321
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:20,126
No.

322
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,651
Actually,
I'm going to kill him.

323
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,176
Or have you kill him.

324
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:30,657
I haven't decided yet.

325
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:33,422
Don't give me
that look.

326
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:36,345
Everybody dies sometime.

327
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,009
Well...
Almost everybody.

328
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:42,025
Papa Petrelli,
Mama Bennet...

329
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:44,171
Mr. Muggles.

330
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:46,635
What's your
brother's name again?

331
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:47,269
Larry?

332
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,457
Lyle.

333
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,448
Lyle, right.

334
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,284
Hmm,
he's going to die too.

335
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:58,195
As we speak,
my father's dying.

336
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:07,770
Did I tell you
I got to meet my real dad?

337
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:11,581
Boy, was that
a disappointment.

338
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,110
<i>Have you ever stopped</i>

339
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:17,530
to think about how much
we have in common, Claire?

340
00:22:19,763 --> 00:22:20,755
You were adopted.

341
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:22,680
I was adopted.

342
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:25,881
You...
can't die.

343
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,014
I can't die.

344
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:34,228
Oh,
you can die.

345
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:36,124
I'll make sure of it.

346
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:43,718
Mm.

347
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,955
Mm!

348
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:49,630
You'll get bored.

349
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:51,517
After like a 100 years
of trying to off me,

350
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,739
watching all of your
loved ones drop like flies.

351
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,973
You may eventually come
to forgive me.

352
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,719
Maybe you'll even
love me.

353
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,529
I'll keep trying
to kill you.

354
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,047
For the rest
of my life.

355
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:11,679
Well,
everybody needs a hobby.

356
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:15,401
I mean, I'm not saying
there aren't bridges

357
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:16,573
that need to be built.

358
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,120
But if we start
building them now...

359
00:23:21,421 --> 00:23:22,448
Who knows?

360
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:28,692
You could be my first
First Lady.

361
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:35,476
<i>I'm sorry, Senator.</i>

362
00:23:35,518 --> 00:23:36,499
There's a full lockdown.

363
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,331
No one gets in or out
without talking to Mr. Samuels.

364
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,062
Then you better talk
to Mr. Samuels.

365
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,301
I have
Senator Nathan Petrelli

366
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,656
requesting access
to the building.

367
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:49,671
Is there a problem?

368
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,481
He says
you're already inside.

369
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,358
<i>If you're here,
then who the hell's up</i>

370
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:55,978
in that suite?

371
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,852
And I can either know now
or after we've taken him down.

372
00:23:57,993 --> 00:23:58,589
You're not going
to do that.

373
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,596
Alright, you send your men up there,
and they will die.

374
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:01,802
He's right.

375
00:24:01,862 --> 00:24:03,961
His name is Sylar.
He's extremely dangerous.

376
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,215
And he's a target?
He's one of them?

377
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:07,358
He's one of them.

378
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:10,143
He's--
Got to stop saying that.

379
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:13,487
He's one of us.

380
00:24:17,365 --> 00:24:18,395
He's one of us.

381
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:23,471
It's all right.

382
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:26,011
Liam...

383
00:24:27,496 --> 00:24:29,067
I've been lying
to the President.

384
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,377
I've been lying
to myself.

385
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,707
And I will take full
responsibility for my crimes

386
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:38,774
when the day comes.

387
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,883
But today we're going
to course correct.

388
00:24:40,943 --> 00:24:42,373
There's a man
in that suite upstairs,

389
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,246
and he needs
to be stopped.

390
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:47,918
And how do you suggest
we do that?

391
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:48,667
You don't.

392
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:50,166
We do.

393
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:52,975
Sylar can only be stopped
by people like us.

394
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,675
My brother can do
whatever Sylar can do,

395
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,511
we just have to get him
close enough to touch him.

396
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:00,171
Just give us
a five-minute head start.

397
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:02,210
That's all I'm asking.

398
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:10,156
I'll take him high,
you take him low.

399
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:12,466
Let's cut
the son of a bitch in two.

400
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:14,459
I love you, Pete.
You know that?

401
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,283
Of course.

402
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,769
I love you too,
Nathan.

403
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:23,035
Ready.

404
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:30,364
Go!

405
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:18,787
Are you all right?

406
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,874
- Yeah.
- Where'd they go?

407
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:22,424
The window.

408
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:24,355
Can you
fly after them?

409
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:27,277
I can't.

410
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:30,243
Come on,
we have to find them.

411
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:31,876
Come on!

412
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:42,817
Ah!

413
00:26:44,197 --> 00:26:45,125
Ah!

414
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:46,703
Ah.

415
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:13,961
Oh, Claire's going to be
so mad at me.

416
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:33,681
- Taxi.
- <i>Just get out right here.</i>

417
00:27:41,354 --> 00:27:42,547
It's about time.

418
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:44,468
Mrs. Petrelli,
what are you doing here?

419
00:27:44,504 --> 00:27:46,352
- Waiting for you.
- How did you find me?

420
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:47,572
I had a dream.

421
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,057
Nathan's in trouble.

422
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,709
Something terrible
happened to him.

423
00:27:50,883 --> 00:27:52,345
And then you save him.
I don't know how.

424
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,083
All I know is you have
to come with me.

425
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,223
I can't.
I'm sorry.

426
00:27:57,604 --> 00:27:59,436
My dreams don't lie,
Mr. Parkman.

427
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:00,594
Now I need you
to come with me.

428
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:03,297
I came here to stop those agents
from coming after us.

429
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,242
I need to be able
to go back to my boy,

430
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:07,188
and know he can live his life
without being hunted.

431
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:09,161
I'm sorry about
Nathan.

432
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:10,715
Then we want
the same thing.

433
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,905
And without Nathan,
none of that is possible.

434
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:15,953
You don't have to read minds
to know that.

435
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:18,258
Come with me.

436
00:28:25,897 --> 00:28:27,068
We should separate here.

437
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,458
You go that way,
I'll look for Nathan over here.

438
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:30,143
Hold it.

439
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:31,700
Noah?

440
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,375
You tell me that's Claire,
not Sylar.

441
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:37,171
I just fought Sylar, okay.
That is Claire.

442
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:39,057
- Put the gun down.
- <i>Dad...</i>

443
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:40,646
It's me.

444
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,448
Did you take his power?

445
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:51,726
Yeah.

446
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:53,334
So we can stop him.

447
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:56,782
<i>Freeze!</i>

448
00:28:59,191 --> 00:28:59,820
On the ground!

449
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,715
The President's life
is in danger.

450
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,031
You want him
to live?

451
00:29:03,354 --> 00:29:04,568
You need
to listen to us.

452
00:29:04,682 --> 00:29:05,827
I said
on the ground!

453
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:09,476
You can either
listen to me now...

454
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:13,549
Or I'll tell you
after you shoot me.

455
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,705
They were here,
Peter and Nathan.

456
00:29:21,766 --> 00:29:22,315
I'm sorry.

457
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:24,159
Only authorized personnel
beyond this point.

458
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:25,856
This is a
Secret Service badge.

459
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:26,799
You're going
to let us through.

460
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,593
Oh, sorry.

461
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:30,458
You guys go ahead.

462
00:29:38,502 --> 00:29:39,493
You don't want
to see this.

463
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,010
- <i>No, no, I need to.</i>
- Mrs. Petrelli.

464
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,396
- No, I need to!
- Mrs. Petrelli, don't!

465
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:43,770
No, I need to!

466
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,817
- Nathan!
- Please.

467
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:46,798
Nathan!

468
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,893
No.

469
00:29:57,706 --> 00:29:59,142
No!

470
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,522
No!

471
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:17,825
I don't understand.

472
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:19,819
My dream.

473
00:30:20,963 --> 00:30:22,401
You were supposed
to save him.

474
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,059
This way,
Mr. President.

475
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:42,562
Nathan.

476
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,427
Is that you?

477
00:30:45,438 --> 00:30:46,472
Of course it's me.

478
00:30:46,902 --> 00:30:48,244
We're getting the President out
through the basement.

479
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:49,291
I can't give you
any more time.

480
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:50,954
That's all right.

481
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:53,849
You don't have
any more time to give.

482
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,139
This way,
Mr. President.

483
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,504
Thank God
you're all right, sir.

484
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,614
The Secret Service
did a hell of a job today.

485
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:39,850
And so did you.

486
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:02,458
Bet you didn't think
I took that one from you.

487
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,089
This is insane.
This will never work.

488
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:24,078
We'll make it work.

489
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:24,887
It's the only way.

490
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:25,674
And it has
to be right now.

491
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:26,839
I don't know
how much time I bought

492
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:28,446
sending Peter and Claire
after Nathan.

493
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:29,927
Why don't you
just chain him up, huh?

494
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:30,608
Or tranq him.

495
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,801
Isn't that what you guys
love to do?

496
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:33,513
I don't want
to be part of this.

497
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,292
<i>I thought you came back
to protect your family, Matt.

498
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:36,921
I did, but what you're
asking me to do is crazy!

499
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,087
Who will convince
the President

500
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:39,390
the whole thing
was a mistake?

501
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,589
Without Nathan,
nothing's going to change.

502
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:42,521
Word gets out...

503
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:44,917
that a person with abilities
murdered a U.S. senator,

504
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:46,593
you're going to have a
100 Dankos out there.

505
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:48,495
Even if I could do
what your asking me to do,

506
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:49,964
he would never
really be Nathan.

507
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:50,805
He'd always be Sylar.

508
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:53,087
If Sylar can absorb
all of Nathan's memories,

509
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:55,425
then the entire history
of anything he touches

510
00:32:55,455 --> 00:32:56,600
will fill in the gaps.

511
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,676
Physically, no one
will ever know the difference.

512
00:32:58,707 --> 00:32:59,664
It'll be permanent.

513
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:02,464
Look, the last thing
in the world I want

514
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:04,425
is to see that
son of a bitch still alive,

515
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:06,223
and I have to lie
to my family about it.

516
00:33:06,595 --> 00:33:09,186
But we need Sylar
to be Nathan Petrelli again.

517
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:09,891
<i>Matt...</i>

518
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:12,452
You don't do this...

519
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:15,381
Nathan is gone
forever.

520
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:21,611
And how do we explain
what happened to him?

521
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:27,896
There's a body in
deep freeze in Building 26.

522
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:29,912
<i>It's identical.
A shape shifter.</i>

523
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:32,228
<i>Your son,
Mr. Parkman--</i>

524
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:33,789
You just wanted to
protect him.

525
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:36,660
Can you honestly tell me that
if something happened to him,

526
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,150
you wouldn't
do anything--

527
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,240
Anything
to keep him in your life?

528
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:45,283
I can't lose Nathan,
not like this.

529
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,536
I'm begging you.

530
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:15,480
You're no longer Sylar.

531
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,533
No longer Gabriel Gray.

532
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:21,423
That life is over.

533
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:23,292
Sylar's dead.

534
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:27,947
<i>You're no longer Sylar--
Sylar.</i>

535
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,764
<i>You're no longer...</i>

536
00:34:30,105 --> 00:34:30,732
<i>Sylar.</i>

537
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:32,249
<i>No longer
Gabriel Gray.</i>

538
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:34,772
<i>Your life is over.</i>

539
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:36,498
<i>Sylar... is dead.</i>

540
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,743
<i>You're now Nathan.</i>

541
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:47,147
Petrelli.

542
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:48,220
<i>Nathan Petrelli.</i>

543
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,568
<i>Son.
Brother.</i>

544
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:52,726
<i>Father.
Senator.</i>

545
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:54,358
<i>Nathan.</i>

546
00:34:55,724 --> 00:34:56,657
<i>Petrelli.</i>

547
00:34:58,863 --> 00:34:59,877
Ah!

548
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:31,420
Ma?

549
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:44,886
<i>We are all connected.</i>

550
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:48,021
<i>Joined together
by an invisible thread.</i>

551
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:51,599
<i>Infinite in its potential,
and fragile in its design.</i>

552
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:54,991
<i>Yet while connected,</i>

553
00:35:55,714 --> 00:35:57,793
<i>we are also
merely individuals.</i>

554
00:35:58,354 --> 00:36:01,620
<i>Empty vessels to be filled
with infinite possibilities.</i>

555
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,875
<i>An assortment
of thoughts, beliefs.</i>

556
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:08,648
<i>A collection of disjointed memories
and experiences.</i>

557
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,924
It's a new beginning,
Mom.

558
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,111
<i>Can I be me
without these?</i>

559
00:36:34,794 --> 00:36:35,802
<i>Can you be you?</i>

560
00:36:45,378 --> 00:36:47,273
I take it the President
agreed to it?

561
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:52,870
Funding, resources,
deniability.

562
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,868
I told them
I found just the man

563
00:36:57,918 --> 00:36:59,082
to head up our new...

564
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,256
What were we going
to call it?

565
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:07,977
I always liked
"The Company."

566
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:42,083
I can't believe
he's really dead.

567
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,309
He's really dead,
Claire.

568
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:48,464
He really is.

569
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,217
<i>And if this invisible thread
that holds us together</i>

570
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:54,161
<i>were to sever,
to cease...</i>

571
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,777
<i>What then?</i>

572
00:37:56,722 --> 00:38:00,544
<i>What would become of billions
of lone, disconnected souls?</i>

573
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:04,203
<i>Therein lies
the great quest of our lives.</i>

574
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:07,292
<i>To find, to connect...</i>

575
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:08,857
To hold on.

576
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,073
<i>For when our hearts are pure,
and our thoughts in line,</i>

577
00:38:13,714 --> 00:38:15,296
<i>we are all truly one,</i>

578
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:18,416
<i>capable of repairing
our fragile world</i>

579
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:23,046
<i>and creating
a universe of infinite possibilities.</i>

580
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:29,809
You're number four.

581
00:39:49,894 --> 00:39:51,704
I haven't heard from you
in weeks.

582
00:39:51,844 --> 00:39:53,151
I was beginning
to worry.

583
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:55,891
<i>Nathan.</i>

584
00:39:59,786 --> 00:40:00,650
<i>Sorry, Mom.</i>

585
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:03,798
Just haven't
felt like myself lately.

586
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,089
Don't be ridiculous.

587
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:08,804
This is a great time for you,
Nathan.

588
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,349
The world's your oyster.

589
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,778
We put all that nonsense
behind us.

590
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:14,394
The family's back together.

591
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:15,560
This is your time.

592
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,668
Now come on.
We're gonna be late for lunch.

593
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:22,417
Nathan...

594
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,426
Have you heard a word
I've said?

595
00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:49,251
It's just this clock.

596
00:40:51,307 --> 00:40:53,220
It's running
a minute and a half fast.

597
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:12,088
So... Lunch?

598
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:13,886
Italian?

599
00:41:14,467 --> 00:41:15,422
<i>Or Chinese?</i>
