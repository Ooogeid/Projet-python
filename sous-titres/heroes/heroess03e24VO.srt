1
00:00:01,304 --> 00:00:02,521
<i>Previously, on Heroes... </i>

2
00:00:02,621 --> 00:00:05,791
Mom... maybe I don't
have to be special.

3
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:07,709
You could be president!

4
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:18,604
Matt Parkman,
meet Matt Parkman.

5
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:20,840
This is why
you can't give up.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,107
We're sitting next
to each other.

7
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:23,943
Hope you don't mind.

8
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:26,512
- What are you doing here?
- I'm Rebel.

9
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:29,315
I'm helping people-
people like us.

10
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:32,451
So desperate
to be someone else.

11
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:35,821
Shape-shifting...
it's your escape hatch.

12
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:38,023
We should pool
our resources.

13
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:41,460
- See that agent over there?
- What about him?

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,929
To work with us,
you'll need a new identity.

15
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:46,131
Agent Taub's
the perfect choice.

16
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,683
His life...
is now your life.

17
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,007
All right, so what now?

18
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:57,643
I'll go back to Washington.

19
00:00:57,743 --> 00:01:01,347
Take ownership of my mistakes,
talk to the President.

20
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:03,849
<i>Real change.
Change you can believe in. </i>

21
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,852
- Looks like you already have.
<i>- ... back to this country. </i>

22
00:01:06,952 --> 00:01:09,355
<i>And I promise you that when
the President</i>

23
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:10,689
<i>agrees to meet with me,</i>

24
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:13,826
<i>when he agrees
to shake my hand,</i>

25
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:17,630
<i>real change... will come. </i>

26
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,366
<i>And nothing
will ever be the same. </i>

27
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,434
- Who the hell is that?
<i>- Thank you all very much. </i>

28
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:24,036
Sylar.

29
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:26,138
Any questions?

30
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:28,489
Senator Petrelli, could you
give us any information-

31
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,137
Why does this keep happening?

32
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,361
Who are you?

33
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:23,796
No, no, no,
little Matty's fine.

34
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:26,198
I haven't even put him down
since I got him.

35
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,133
<i>- Can I talk to him?</i>
- Oh, okay.

36
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,669
Hold on.
Mommy wants to talk to you.

37
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,506
Matty?
It's mommy.

38
00:02:33,606 --> 00:02:34,640
Hi!

39
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,409
<i>I love you, sweetheart. </i>

40
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,246
<i>And I'll see you soon. </i>

41
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:42,915
I'll get him back
as soon as I can, all right?

42
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:44,884
Look, Janice...

43
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:47,820
It's really good
to hear your voice.

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,322
Thank you
for doing this, Matt.

45
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,391
Bye, Janice.

46
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,228
Bye, Matt.

47
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:58,364
Did the agents
let your wife go?

48
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:00,099
- Yeah.
- You don't seem happy, Matt.

49
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,434
- Is everything okay?
- I'm fine.

50
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:03,969
I mean, I guess-

51
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,604
Look, Janice was attacked by Danko.

52
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:07,039
This guy was abducted.

53
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,074
I guess I should be happy
she's talking to me at all.

54
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:11,911
- I'm gonna take him home.
- Is that a good idea?

55
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,213
Won't the agents just
come after baby Matt again?

56
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:16,282
- No, this time I have a plan.
- Good.

57
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:18,817
When you return baby Matt
to Mrs. Matt Parkman,

58
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:20,519
all will be forgiven.

59
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:21,820
I don't think so.

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,756
Think that train's already
left the station.

61
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:25,057
That is too sad.

62
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:27,259
Baby Matt needs a mother
<i>and a father. </i>

63
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,028
Maybe you can still protect him.

64
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:31,163
Help us take down building 26.

65
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:32,932
- Yes.
- This isn't a game, guys.

66
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:36,502
Danko and his men are killers.
Just let it go.

67
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:38,771
This isn't the Matt Parkman I know!

68
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:40,806
Matt Parkman
isn't afraid of anything.

69
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:42,775
I am afraid.

70
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,277
I'm afraid that I'm gonna miss
out on this guy's childhood.

71
00:03:45,377 --> 00:03:47,746
I'm afraid that I'm not gonna
see him take his first steps

72
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:50,215
or... throw his first baseball.

73
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,051
I want him to know
that he has a father.

74
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:53,652
This little guy's a game changer.

75
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,220
Yes.

76
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,256
Well, it's hard
to argue with that.

77
00:03:57,356 --> 00:04:01,060
Okay, Matt Parkman.
You go win your family back.

78
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,495
We will go to building 26
and stop them.

79
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:06,098
Tell us the address.

80
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:07,766
- No.
- Why not?

81
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,735
What are you gonna do,
freeze time?

82
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,704
- And then what?
- We will stop them.

83
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:13,639
Well, eventually you're gonna
have to unfreeze time,

84
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,675
and when you do, some of
those agents are gonna be alive,

85
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:17,109
and they could hurt you.

86
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,378
Or worse.

87
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:22,415
I can't have that
on my conscience.

88
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:26,119
Thanks for saving my life.
Now, go save your own.

89
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:31,390
Good-bye, Matt Parkman.

90
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,493
Good-bye,
baby Matt Parkman.

91
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,381
<i>One of my analysts
spotted Sylar</i>

92
00:04:56,581 --> 00:04:59,220
<i>on a surveillance camera
near K Street. </i>

93
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,823
I assured him he was mistaken.

94
00:05:05,023 --> 00:05:07,543
We all know Sylar's dead.

95
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,582
Except for you.

96
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,807
You understand, this is
the only way this will work.

97
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,811
Sylar died
to give you your freedom.

98
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:28,513
My freedom.
How ironic.

99
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,816
<i>How so?</i>

100
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,620
Last night,
I went to sleep as myself.

101
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,755
I woke up as Agent Taub.

102
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:38,890
I didn't-I didn't mean to change.

103
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,794
I just did.
I'm losing myself.

104
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,998
Look at this.

105
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,734
Found an extra tooth
in my mouth last night.

106
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,169
Where did that come from?

107
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,270
I'm shifting and reassembling
my DNA so much

108
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,972
it's not coming together
the same way.

109
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,541
Maybe you should just stay
as Agent Taub for a while.

110
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,612
Agent Taub's a nothing.

111
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,697
I don't like being a nothing.

112
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:08,487
Think of it this way.

113
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:13,358
As Agent Taub,
you can come and go,

114
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,495
kill who you wanna kill.

115
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:19,364
If you're Sylar...

116
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:22,902
I have no choice
but to hunt you down...

117
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:26,855
Make your life
a living hell.

118
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:32,813
It's up to you.

119
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,631
Wait.

120
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:54,182
Good.
See you at work.

122
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,556
I love hot cocoa.
Do you mind?

123
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,343
You don't wanna startle me.

124
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,179
That's funny;
there was a time

125
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,748
when I wouldn't have given you
a chance to be startled.

126
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,818
You don't understand.
I can hurt you.

127
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:24,720
Oh, I understand perfectly.

128
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,557
You have an ability.

129
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:30,460
What you don't understand
is that I'm just like you.

130
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,863
- And I'm gonna help you.
- Are you Rebel?

131
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:36,265
I'm <i>a</i> rebel.

132
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:40,570
- Why are they hunting us?
- They're afraid of us.

133
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,605
They destroy
what they don't understand.

134
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:45,041
What about you, Tom?
Why are they afraid of you?

135
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,461
Show me what you can do.

136
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,472
- I really hate to do this.
- Do what?

137
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,448
That looks like fun.

138
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,552
Fun?

139
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,687
Are you crazy?

140
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,890
Listen to me, Tom.

141
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,860
The agents-
they're on their way here.

142
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,263
You need to decide right now.

143
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:44,533
Do you pick them...
or do you pick me?

144
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:45,837
Uh...

145
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,105
You.

146
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:52,158
I pick you.

147
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,380
Good choice.

148
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,143
Jeez, would you look at that?

149
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,630
Guy's got some ego.

150
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,196
You gotta be you.
Is that it?

151
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,232
Ha. Yeah, something like that.

152
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:53,202
You put me in
a difficult position.

153
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:57,773
I got you your target...
and a little something extra.

154
00:10:57,873 --> 00:11:01,544
<i>He received a text from Rebel
just before I arrived. </i>

155
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,815
- Rebel's still in DC.
<i>- Right under your nose. </i>

156
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:08,133
That's good news.

157
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,089
I could use your help
to take him down.

158
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:16,693
My help?
Or Agent Taub's?

159
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,962
You...

160
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:22,698
need to play dead, Sylar.

161
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:25,702
You know...

162
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:28,438
One of my eyes...

163
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:34,144
stayed blue
for over an hour yesterday.

164
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:37,079
The past five years,

165
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:40,416
I've lived
eight different lives

166
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:43,152
<i>with wives and girlfriends. </i>

167
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:45,388
<i>Spoke six different languages. </i>

168
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,556
But at the end of the day,
I still know who I am.

169
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:48,857
What's your point?

170
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,760
Whatever you're going through is...

171
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,164
an identity crisis.

172
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,400
<i>You can survive. </i>

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,703
- How?
<i>- Find an anchor. </i>

174
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,305
Something that reminds you of you.

175
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:06,843
That way when you're
feeling lost,

176
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,896
you'll have something to hang onto.

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,652
My father gave this to me...

178
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,688
20 years ago.

179
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:22,859
I look at this,
and I'm home.

180
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,846
May I?

181
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,935
Rodina.

182
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:35,471
Soviet military issue.

183
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,542
It's running three minutes fast,

184
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:42,979
gaining half a second
every hour.

185
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,615
Otherwise,
it's a nice watch.

186
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:51,588
Understanding how things work...

187
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:55,392
Who'd you kill
to get that power?

188
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:02,015
That's the only one that was
ever truly mine.

189
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:19,380
You special Agent Taub?

190
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,250
So it seems.

191
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,285
Unsolved murder
of Virginia Gray.

192
00:15:24,385 --> 00:15:25,954
You don't mind me askin',

193
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,655
what's the federal government
care about

194
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:30,024
some dead old broad
from Queens?

195
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:31,675
Nice talkin' to ya.

196
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:42,646
Haaah!

197
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,575
Oh... this one
was my favorite.

198
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:55,926
Hmm.

199
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,887
I bought this for you.

200
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:08,289
I remember.

201
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:10,425
It was mother's day.

202
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:13,896
You're such a sweet boy.

203
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:18,065
Why did you lie to me?

204
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,969
I never lied.
Not to you.

205
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,889
I'm your mother.

206
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,343
I know the truth now.

207
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,245
My real mother was killed
in front of me.

208
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:34,215
- You were there, you saw it.
- A terrible man.

209
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:37,051
And you were such
a teeny little thing.

210
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,887
I wanted to protect you,
love you.

211
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:42,557
I... I didn't think
the truth mattered.

212
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,493
It mattered to me.

213
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:49,966
All my life...
I never felt like I fit in.

214
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:58,574
I went to see my real father.

215
00:17:59,874 --> 00:18:02,844
He was so alone, so pathetic.

216
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:09,417
I didn't want to become him
so I took this power,

217
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:11,385
And now I can be anyone
I wanna be,

218
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:13,322
anyone in the world.

219
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:17,041
So tell me, mom...

220
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:22,930
Why do I feel so lost?

221
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:25,333
You're not lost.

222
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,836
You're my son.

223
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:32,273
Maybe I didn't give birth
to you, but I loved you.

224
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:36,043
I wanted you
right from the start.

225
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:38,379
I saw how special you were.

226
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,816
But I killed you!

227
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:45,736
And there was no one left
to love you anymore.

228
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:50,192
But now...

229
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,361
I'm back.

230
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,180
What are you doing?

231
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:15,950
Nothing.
What do you want?

232
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,219
We found Rebel.

233
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:21,606
Tell Agent Taub
to come join us.

235
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:24,078
Target's holed up
somewhere in that building.

236
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,164
Okay... kill the lights.

237
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:36,924
Power grid's down, gentlemen.

238
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:39,260
No electricity
means no machines.

239
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,979
Time to hunt down
this son of a bitch.

240
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:45,983
Let's go!

241
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:52,423
Taub, you coming?

242
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:16,030
You're Rebel?
You're just a kid.

243
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,133
- I know who you are.
- I sincerely doubt that.

244
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:22,736
I know you have a problem.
I think I can help.

245
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:25,640
And do tell me-
What is my problem?

246
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,942
You've forgotten
who you really are.

247
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,977
Yeah.

248
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:32,580
- You're gonna help me with that?
- Yeah. I can.

249
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,616
You're one of us.
People with powers.

250
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:38,752
We're all connected.
You don't have to be alone.

251
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:41,388
You're alone, Micah.
Family's all gone.

252
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:44,725
All you have left are these
machines and your false hopes.

253
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:46,560
- We can help each other.
- Too late.

254
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,297
- I joined the other side.
- They don't know you.

255
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:51,966
They can't see
how special you are.

256
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:54,903
You can save us all.

257
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:08,110
Since when do you wear glasses?

260
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:49,484
I want every floor secured.

261
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,370
Rebel's running.
He's on the pier.

262
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:17,494
- It's just a kid.
- I said take him down-now!

263
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,567
<i>Take him down!</i>

264
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,896
You see him?

265
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:37,364
Find him yet?

266
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,683
I don't see him.

267
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:44,621
Try all the way off
the other side of the pier.

268
00:25:51,896 --> 00:25:54,214
This was very unlike you.

269
00:25:54,315 --> 00:25:57,551
Why didn't you kill him,
take his power?

270
00:25:57,651 --> 00:26:00,220
My head's already spinning
with the powers I have.

271
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,024
I thought talking to machines
seemed like overkill.

272
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:05,926
They couldn't find
the kid's body.

273
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:08,562
- Feels like a loose end.
- He's not a healer.

274
00:26:08,662 --> 00:26:10,515
Dead is dead.

275
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:15,869
We got intel from his system.

276
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:18,006
Location on dozens of specials.

277
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:22,277
I'll need you to go after
the more dangerous ones.

278
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:25,613
Be a hunter...
not the prey?

279
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:29,885
That's the idea.
You can start tonight.

280
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:34,605
Just as soon
as you change your face.

281
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:46,901
<i>I'm so proud of you, Gabriel. </i>

282
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:50,237
<i>This doesn't feel right.
It's not who I am. </i>

283
00:26:50,337 --> 00:26:51,605
<i>Why would I save him?</i>

284
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:54,275
<i>You saved him because
he's a lost little boy,</i>

285
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:56,077
<i>an orphan like you. </i>

286
00:26:56,677 --> 00:26:59,346
He doesn't have his mommy
to love him anymore.

287
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:01,582
<i>Why should that matter to me?</i>

288
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:04,151
<i>You understand
how he's feeling,</i>

289
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:07,122
<i>how lost he truly is. </i>

290
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:11,308
Isn't that right, Micah?

291
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:18,465
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

292
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:21,802
You can shape-shift.
How do you do that?

293
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:26,774
I seem to be able
to absorb people's DNA.

294
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:30,010
My mom could do
the same kinda thing.

295
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,079
On the inside.
It made her kinda crazy.

296
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:33,847
But she fought back
and became a hero.

297
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:37,251
<i>I am not... </i>
your mother.

298
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:40,387
You can change into someone
who can make a difference,

299
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:43,391
like... Nathan Petrelli.

300
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:47,029
You can tell the president
that he's made a big mistake.

301
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:50,397
I'm giving you a chance to leave.

302
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:53,602
<i>I would take it
before I change my mind. </i>

303
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:56,203
And don't come back.

304
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:59,072
If I find you again...

305
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:01,024
I'll kill you.

307
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:47,798
Look at the ribbons!
It's all so pretty!

308
00:28:49,298 --> 00:28:52,201
He was born
with a silver spoon.

309
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:56,039
He was given everything,
money, schools...

310
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:59,642
Family.

311
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:02,411
<i>Yes. But you have a gift. </i>

312
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:04,413
<i>You're special. </i>

313
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:06,182
<i>You didn't need anybody
to help you,</i>

314
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:08,184
<i>and now you'll be a senator. </i>

315
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:10,386
I am so proud.

316
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:12,555
- Stop it.
- What's the matter?

317
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:13,989
You know you're better
than him.

318
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,159
You know you're better
than all of them!

319
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,027
I'm not better.

320
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:20,196
I killed you.

321
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:22,632
It was an accident.

322
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:25,569
You didn't mean to kill me.

323
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:30,141
It wasn't an accident.

324
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:35,212
Don't you understand?
I wanted you to die.

325
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:38,981
The way you looked at me...

326
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:41,567
like I was
some kind of a monster.

327
00:29:44,738 --> 00:29:46,490
I felt so small.

328
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,509
And then you came at me
with those scissors.

329
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,482
How can I be special?

330
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,271
How can I be anything

331
00:30:01,971 --> 00:30:04,824
when I killed the only woman
who ever loved me?

332
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:12,082
So... that's how
you lost yourself,

333
00:30:13,182 --> 00:30:15,501
why you brought me back.

334
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:21,275
I forgive you, Gabriel.

335
00:30:26,546 --> 00:30:27,897
I'm so sorry.

336
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:31,267
And now you can be
anything you want.

337
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:33,803
Be a senator...

338
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:36,940
or maybe even...

339
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,060
President of the United States.

340
00:30:56,643 --> 00:30:58,561
You're right.

341
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:01,698
I can be anything I want.

342
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:04,416
I can be president.

343
00:31:11,858 --> 00:31:14,460
I won't let you down, Ma.

344
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:23,552
Look at this. See?
Mommy's coming right back.

345
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:26,856
You miss her, huh?
I bet you do.

346
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:29,141
Wow, look at this.
Mommy's doing pretty good, huh?

347
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:30,726
You know,
before you were born,

348
00:31:30,826 --> 00:31:32,328
mommy and daddy
weren't getting along so well.

349
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:34,029
I didn't even know
that you existed, you know?

350
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:35,798
She didn't know that I would
take one look at you

351
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:38,334
and fall in love...
Which is what I did.

352
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:40,970
I fell in love!
Wow, nice room.

353
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,638
You know, I know what
you're thinking.

354
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:44,573
And I can't-I can't just
put a whammy on mommy

355
00:31:44,673 --> 00:31:46,075
and make her forget everything
and forgive me.

356
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:47,543
No, I can't do that.

357
00:31:47,643 --> 00:31:49,861
'Cause we can't use our powers
on unsuspecting people.

358
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:55,084
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God!

359
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:58,021
Hi!
Hi.

360
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:00,856
Thank you
for bringing him back.

361
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:03,726
Yeah. What? Come on.
He's...

362
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:06,530
He's really a great kid.

363
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,333
It's good to see you.

364
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,318
Yeah, you too.

365
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:22,244
What is it?

366
00:32:22,344 --> 00:32:24,113
We're being watched.
I can hear 'em.

367
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:25,664
There's a van down the street
filled with agents.

368
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:26,983
I can hold them off for now,

369
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,684
but I gotta get the two
of you guys outta here.

370
00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:30,152
Uh, my folks' summer house
at the lake.

371
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:31,821
Good, good.
You pack; I'll watch Matty.

372
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:33,422
Well, what about you?

373
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:37,293
Uh... I mean,
I could come too.

374
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:39,695
I know, that's crazy.

375
00:32:40,195 --> 00:32:41,463
Janice...

376
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:45,501
I'm his father, and I wanna
be a part of his life.

377
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,988
We have a lot to talk about.

378
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:54,009
Ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,145
our country faces
the biggest challenges

380
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:58,213
we've seen in a generation-

381
00:32:58,313 --> 00:33:01,283
From terrorism
to global economic chaos.

382
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:06,388
Our leadership is ill-prepared
to meet these challenges.

383
00:33:06,488 --> 00:33:08,857
We need to shake up the
power structure in Washington

384
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,526
in order to bring
real change to America,

385
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:14,330
and I have a plan
that will do just that.

386
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,198
You may ask,
"Why aren't I presenting

387
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:19,034
this new initiative
to the President?"

388
00:33:19,134 --> 00:33:21,503
Believe me, I've tried.

389
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:23,906
My office has made numerous
phone calls to the White House,

390
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:26,308
but it seems the President
is just...

391
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:28,444
too busy to meet with me
face-to-face,

392
00:33:28,544 --> 00:33:30,879
too occupied
keeping the status quo,

393
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,648
business as usual.

394
00:33:32,748 --> 00:33:35,317
Seems he likes to talk
about change...

395
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:38,687
but he isn't ready or willing
to make it.

396
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:41,790
I know a way to bring real
purpose back to the White House,

397
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,325
back to this country.

398
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:44,727
And I promise you

399
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,563
that when the President
agrees to meet with me,

400
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:51,066
when he agrees
to shake my hand,

401
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,435
real change
will come to this country.

402
00:33:53,535 --> 00:33:56,755
And nothing...
will ever be the same.

403
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,296
- How's he doing this?
- He's a shapeshifter.

404
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:09,798
And now he's one handshake away

405
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:11,500
from being the most powerful
man on earth.

406
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,202
Well, maybe the President
won't meet with him.

407
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,770
Are you kidding me?
After that vitriol?

408
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,840
I'm sure my staff's arranging
a sit-down with him as we speak.

409
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,376
- We need a plan.
- No.

410
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,645
I gotta do this
myself, Noah.

411
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:24,947
You made that mistake before, Nathan.

412
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:27,516
Trying to do it all by
yourself-it doesn't work.

413
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:28,984
She's right.
We can help you.

414
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:30,652
Look, I don't have to fight him.

415
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:32,421
I just have to make sure

416
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:34,657
that he doesn't meet
the President first.

417
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:37,728
Sylar will expect that.
He'll be waiting for you.

418
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:42,414
I'll go with you.

419
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,302
I started this, Pete.

420
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:49,722
I gotta end it.

421
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,326
<i>Matt,
did you find his pacifier?</i>

422
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,862
<i>- Matt?</i>
- Right.

423
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,431
Okay.

424
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:24,433
Ready.

425
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:28,438
I'm so sorry, Janice.
I can't go with you.

426
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:32,007
Why not?

427
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,376
Because...

428
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:36,879
This-this is perfect.

429
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:40,582
<i>This house, our boy, you. </i>

430
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:43,251
<i>This is everything
that I've been searching for. </i>

431
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,554
And maybe
I didn't even realize it,

432
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:47,722
but Hiro was right;
I have to go back.

433
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:49,959
I have to face them,
and I have to end this,

434
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:52,662
or we can never have
a life together.

435
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:56,614
You want a life together?

436
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,704
I don't know.

437
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:04,373
Maybe.

438
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,375
But I know that I want a chance
to get to know you again,

439
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,995
and I'm gonna fight
to make that happen.

440
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,633
Oh, God, they're coming!

441
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:18,854
Come here, buddy.

442
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:22,157
Matt, they're in the back.

443
00:37:22,357 --> 00:37:24,025
- It's okay.
- We're surrounded.

444
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:25,943
It's okay, it's okay.
Stay close to me, okay?

445
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,378
I'll protect us.

446
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:30,382
<i>Go through the side. </i>

447
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:34,852
<i>Down there. </i>

448
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:47,132
<i>Looking for this?</i>

449
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,769
Get the hell
out of my body.

450
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,276
Poor Nathan.

451
00:38:01,914 --> 00:38:04,399
You loathe yourself so much.

452
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,585
What the hell
are you talking about?

453
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:20,215
I've taken a stroll
through your life, Senator.

454
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,784
You've been handed so much.

455
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,087
And yet... you wanna destroy
the one part of yourself

456
00:38:26,188 --> 00:38:29,591
that makes you truly special-
your power.

457
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,660
You have no idea
who I am.

458
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,296
Sure, I do.

459
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,598
Your mother gave me
a very useful ability

460
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:39,134
to know the history
of any object I touch.

461
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:43,139
You... have been a bad boy.

462
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,376
Deceiving your mother,
turning on your brother.

463
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:51,280
Your sweet, precious Claire.

464
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,319
And this is the jacket you wore
when you betrayed everyone.

465
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,423
I don't need to
defend myself to you.

466
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:03,992
You're pathetic.

467
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,061
You're a psychopath.

468
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:08,163
People like you are the reason

469
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,832
I went to the President
in the first place.

470
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,233
If you think for one minute

471
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:14,603
anybody's gonna believe
you're me...

472
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:17,108
you're wrong.

473
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:21,877
I'm not gonna be you.

474
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:25,315
I'm gonna be better than you.

475
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,402
Good-bye, Nathan.

476
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,728
What the hell
did you do that for?

477
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,197
Petrelli's a US Senator.

478
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,783
We need to handle him delicately.

479
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:54,643
And you... need to become
Agent Taub again.

480
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,913
We're moving to take
the rest of them down.

481
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:00,766
You should be part of that.

482
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,493
<i>For every being
cursed with self-awareness,</i>

483
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:15,130
<i>there remains
the unanswerable question:</i>

484
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,883
<i>Who am I?</i>

485
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:26,675
<i>We struggle to find meaningful
connections to one another. </i>

486
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:30,262
<i>We are the caring friend... </i>

487
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:38,187
<i>The loving father... </i>

488
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:40,789
<i>The doting mother... </i>

489
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:42,925
<i>The protected child. </i>

490
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:44,993
<i>We fight and we love</i>

491
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:47,362
<i>in the hope that somehow,
together,</i>

492
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:52,233
<i>we can understand our
significance in the universe. </i>

493
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:57,139
<i>But in the end,
no one can share our burden. </i>

494
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:02,844
<i>Each of us alone
must answer the question... </i>

495
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:05,514
<i>"Who am I?"</i>

496
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:09,485
<i>"What does it mean to be alive?"</i>

497
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:14,155
<i>"And in the vast infinity of time,</i>

498
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:16,642
<i>"how do I matter?"</i>

499
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:28,571
What are you doing?

500
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:32,574
I told you,
I need you to be Taub.

501
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:35,577
I'm not interested
in what you need anymo-

502
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,223
Such a waste.

503
00:41:48,323 --> 00:41:50,760
You just didn't know your place.

504
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,330
Agent Gordon,
send a cleanup crew to-

505
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,634
Check that.

506
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,275
That hurt.
