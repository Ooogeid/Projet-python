1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,173
I must have gotten
your ability on the street.

2
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:08,258
Ability?

3
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:21,960
Peter Petrelli?

4
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:23,004
Hiro.

5
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,111
- You're the man with a plan.
- I'm not sure I'm that guy anymore.

6
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,821
Well, it's just, you know,
kind of sad when you...

7
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:34,144
look back on your life,
you realize it hasn't amounted to much.

8
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,579
What are you talking about?
Your life is about helping people.

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,958
But I don't remember
actually helping... anybody.

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,377
The guy don't know his name,
what day it is, nothing.

11
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,837
I'm gonna help you.

12
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,256
You're a watchmaker from queens,
who murdered your own mother.

13
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:52,135
No!

14
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,763
What are you waiting for?

15
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,254
<i>A broken vessel.</i>

16
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,330
<i>An empty shell.</i>

17
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:11,076
<i>What is a man without mind,</i>

18
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,186
<i>without memory?</i>

19
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:16,107
<i>A ghost?</i>

20
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,151
<i>A body in search of a soul?</i>

21
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:24,481
<i>With no compass to guide us,</i>

22
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:27,701
<i>how can we know if our destiny
is to seek the good...</i>

23
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:33,419
<i>Or obey the demons
that whisper in our ear?</i>

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,104
<i>The blank slate hungers
to be written upon.</i>

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,241
<i>The body thrives
when the heart has a mission.</i>

26
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:54,947
How you feeling, hiro?

27
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:04,992
You collapsed in my apartment
last night.

28
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,409
You remember?

29
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,257
And you brought me to the hospital?

30
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:17,555
I spoke to the doctors.

31
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,181
Hiro, you're very sick.

32
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:22,111
Yes, I know.

33
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:24,728
Brain tumor.
I'm dying.

34
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,153
I guess I didn't want to believe

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,088
that I would end up
in a hospital bed so soon, but...

36
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,985
Here I am.

37
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:41,235
Look, I know about dying.

38
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,331
I've helped a lot of people
through this transition.

39
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,159
And I'm gonna help you
with whatever you need.

40
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:50,795
Maybe that's why you came to me.

41
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:51,927
Maybe.

42
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,467
But maybe not.

43
00:02:56,604 --> 00:03:00,096
Destiny has been sending me
to different places, different times,

44
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,387
to right many wrongs before I die.

45
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:06,352
Maybe destiny has brought me
to you, Peter...

46
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,515
To fix a problem in your life.

47
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:11,097
No, my...
my life is fine.

48
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:13,256
I really don't need any fixing.

49
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:19,835
What if, you didn't come here

50
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:23,244
so that you can fix me?
What if I could fix you?

51
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,553
I've seen the best doctors in japan.

52
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,416
- There's nothing that can be done.
- Maybe not by doctors.

53
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,056
The faster I can go...

54
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,634
The faster I can get back.

55
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,398
Go... go where?

56
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:41,187
Just sit tight, okay?

57
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,224
I'll be right back.

58
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,517
Okay.

59
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:51,549
Are you okay?

60
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:54,139
Did you send a cello to my apartment?

61
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:55,527
A cello? No.

62
00:03:57,115 --> 00:04:00,112
Something is wrong with my ability,
or whatever you call it.

63
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,180
There's nothing wrong...

64
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:05,484
It's confusing, at first.
I know.

65
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,863
It's difficult for everyone
in the beginning.

66
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,188
And I want to talk about it
with you, but I can't.

67
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,377
- Right now I have to leave.
- Leave?

68
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,872
My friend is dying, and it can't wait.

69
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:20,745
You know what...

70
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:26,004
You have questions about abilities?
You should talk to him.

71
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,434
He knows everything about abilities.

72
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,897
His name is Hiro.

73
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,525
Talk to him, and I'll be back soon.

74
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,197
Where are you going?

75
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:39,362
To save his life.

76
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:54,377
He's not what you expected.

77
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,716
For years I've heard rumors, stories.

78
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,343
Sylar, the most powerful one of all.

79
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,995
But that man seems beaten.

80
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:07,433
Afraid.

81
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,767
What happened to him?

82
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,750
I'm not sure.

83
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:16,232
It's like there are two sides
at war within him.

84
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,933
Good morning, Sylar.

85
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,403
How'd you sleep?

86
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:54,103
You called me Sylar.
Who's Sylar?

87
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,439
That's you.
That's your name.

88
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,691
The police told me my name is Gabriel.

89
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,948
You don't even know your name?

90
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:09,023
What happened to you?

91
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,095
I don't know.

92
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:16,516
I can't remember.

93
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,086
You know what I think?

94
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,172
I think a great damage
has been done to you.

95
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:24,680
And you've come to us to heal.

96
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:31,224
Walk with me.
Spend the day among us,

97
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,288
and with time,
your memories will return.

98
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:37,869
What do we call you...

99
00:06:38,036 --> 00:06:38,943
Gabriel?

100
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,025
Sylar?

101
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,517
Take a deep breath.

102
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:46,813
What's the first name
that pops into your head?

103
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,720
Call me Nathan.

104
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,845

105
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:14,407
Why are you doing this for me?
Taking me in, hiding me.

106
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:17,228
- You don't even know me.
- Of course I do.

107
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,023
You may not realize it,
but you're a man of great powers.

108
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:22,525
Powers?

109
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,251
At the police station,

110
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:28,154
I raised my hand and somehow
threw a man across a room.

111
00:07:29,592 --> 00:07:31,033
What's wrong with me?

112
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,372
There's nothing wrong.

113
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,996
You're special.

114
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,263
Take a look around.
Here, everyone is.

115
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:41,335
Hey, Teddy, show him what you can do.

116
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,686
- You mean everybody here...
- Is like you. Like us.

117
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:57,768
Lydia!

118
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,697
Come meet our new friend.

119
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,135
Show him around a bit, will you?

120
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:03,934
I think you are gonna like each other.

121
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:05,265
My pleasure.

122
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:13,546
What is it?

123
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,704
I remember shaking a lot of hands.

124
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:22,126
Like a I was a politician or something.
Is that possible?

125
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,962
I suppose anything is possible.

126
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,053
Come on.

127
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:35,715
Hi.

128
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,956
Laundry day.
Is this a bad time?

129
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,071
No...
come on in.

130
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:41,593
How goes job hunting?

131
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,222
Unproductive.

132
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,769
Well, hang in there.
It'll work out.

133
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:46,776
Thank you.

134
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,608
Can I have some quarters?
I need, like, 12 of them.

135
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,546
Yeah, sure.
Over there in the jar.

136
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:52,738
Help yourself.

137
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,563
Don't take this the wrong way,

138
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:01,159
but have you ever thought about
doing a little volunteer work?

139
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,296
Oh, wait...

140
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:09,173
Peter?

141
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,007
How did you get in the bathroom?

142
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,012
It's been a long time
since I've teleported.

143
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:27,122
I need you to deliver some tickets.

144
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,775
"Captain Lubbock, Baltimore P. D."

145
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,569
Isn't this the guy who was
hunting Sylar last night?

146
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:36,147
Something is very wrong.

147
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,817
The memories are returning,
but they're the wrong memories.

148
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:41,173
There's someone else inside his head.

149
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:45,293
We need to jump-start the real Sylar.

150
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,211
Wake the sleeping lion.

151
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,300
If the real Sylar sees
this cop coming at him,

152
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,183
he might kill him.

153
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,628
Indeed, he might.

154
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
Hiro's dying?

155
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,860
He doesn't have to
if I can find a healer.

156
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,940
That's why I came over here.
I want you to help me locate one.

157
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:17,909
What about my blood?
Can't we give him a transfusion?

158
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,501
That won't work.
A tumor is living tissue.

159
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,915
Your blood's regenerative powers
would only make it grow faster.

160
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,784
But there was a kid,

161
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:28,394
bag-and-tag of three
to four years ago.

162
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,087
How long does he have?

163
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,798
It could be a couple months.
Could be a couple hours.

164
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:34,133
That's him.

165
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,625
Jeremy Greer.

166
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,860
I found him when he was 13.

167
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,155
I was getting a report of a kid
that was bringing

168
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,697
- squashed bugs back to life.
- Back from the dead?

169
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:46,408
Not exactly.
But if just a leg still twitching.

170
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:49,381
All he had to do was touch them
and away they would fly.

171
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,777
We studied him for four days
and, of course, erased his memory.

172
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,362
He was a good kid.

173
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,548
Or he wanted to be. He couldn't decide
if his power was a gift or a curse.

174
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:02,203
Well, if he can save Hiro,
it's definitely a gift.

175
00:11:03,003 --> 00:11:04,583
Cainan, Georgia.

176
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,041
- You ready?
- Yeah.

177
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:20,103
Samuel's brother, Joseph,
began the tradition of morning chores.

178
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,394
He believed that hard work
helped bind a community together.

179
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,060
I'm certainly looking forward to getting
my hands dirty.

180
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,259
I haven't done
an honest day's work since...

181
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,587
Since I can't remember when.

182
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,444
It's nice having you here.

183
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,447
We don't see a new face
among us that often.

184
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,547
Especially one so handsome.

185
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:04,308
How you doing?

186
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:06,600
That Lydia...

187
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,987
always had a thing for bad boys.

188
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,733
- What do you mean?
- I've heard about you, Sylar.

189
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:16,652
How you steal powers
from other people.

190
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:18,551
How I...

191
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,699
I'm sorry, I have
no idea what you're talking about.

192
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,286
I'm sure you can do
some fancy tricks.

193
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,995
But you know what,

194
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,456
I have some tricks of my own.

195
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:33,919
Excuse me.

196
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,857
Those are kind of in the way.

197
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,506
Are you gonna stop this?

198
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:04,456
Boys will be boys.

199
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,628
Why don't we let the others
finish up here?

200
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,715
There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

201
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,774
It's so strange when that happens.

202
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:36,027
My hand rises up and can suddenly do
incredible things, like motor memory.

203
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:38,901
Memories don't only exist in the mind.
The body retains everything.

204
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,826
I remember flying.

205
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,532
- You mean flying in a plane.
- No, I mean, like piloting a jet.

206
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,584
I flew jets in the military, maybe.

207
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:59,672
A politician's life, jet pilot.
It all sounds like a very exciting life.

208
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,372
But it isn't yours.

209
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,052
Someone's done something to you.
Polluted your mind somehow.

210
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,389
I thought your memories would return
on their own, it's just not happening.

211
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:10,733
You want to know who you really are?

212
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,149
Of course I do.

213
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,146
Then it's time
for stronger measures. Damian.

214
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,786
This is Damian.
He has a powerful gift.

215
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:24,519
In his hands, your true memories
will be returned.

216
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,752
Are you ready to know the truth?

217
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,189
Take him to the house of mirrors.

218
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,366
Go away.

219
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:50,681
I have no more blood left.
No more blood.

220
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,244
Blood?
I'm sorry... I...

221
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:55,478
I read lips,
but yours move differently.

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,730
Sorry.
Japanese accent.

223
00:14:58,196 --> 00:14:59,631
- I'm Emma.
- I'm Hiro.

224
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:01,765
Peter Petrelli said

225
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:05,397
I could ask you questions
about my... Abilities.

226
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:07,490
You have a power?

227
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,502
How can I make it stop?

228
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:13,338
No, manifesting a power
is a wondrous time.

229
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,909
A hero never refuses the call.

230
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,045
I'm deaf.
I can't hear the call.

231
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:31,222
You must have many questions.

232
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:33,184
Just one.

233
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,267
How do I turn it off?

234
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,495
It's not a light switch.

235
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:40,397
It's part of who you are.

236
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,384
Sorry to have bothered you.

237
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:53,845
Dead plants, dead bushes.

238
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:56,372
Not exactly what you'd expect
from a healer, huh?

239
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,750
- What do you know about this kid?
- Not much.

240
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,503
You know, I tested him.

241
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,033
I wrote up a report,
threw it in the file. But...

242
00:16:03,702 --> 00:16:07,026
The kid was coming into his ability.
He had a lot of questions, so...

243
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:10,896
Naturally we wiped his memory,
Sent him back to his messed up family.

244
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:14,503
And I went on to my next assignment.
The company wasn't a support group.

245
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,113
- It's the powers, not the people.
- It's right.

246
00:16:17,832 --> 00:16:19,387
But you saw him heal, right?

247
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:22,053
Yeah. Bugs.
Dog that got hit by a car.

248
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,062
Day four I slashed my arm pretty bad.

249
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:26,110
The kid touched it, it was good as new.

250
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,485
Guess his power doesn't work on birds.

251
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:34,685
- That smells like...
- Death.

252
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:39,705
Hello?
Is anybody home?

253
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:44,837
Hello?

254
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,652
Oh... Noah. Noah.

255
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,768
- The parents.
- What the hell happened here?

256
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,420
There was a case in china.

257
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,924
This woman manifested as a healer,
But as time went on,

258
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:15,229
it evolved into something
very different.

259
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,929
There was a flip side.

260
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,135
She could control
the flow of life... give it...

261
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,841
Or take it away?

262
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:24,998
Yeah.

263
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:27,296
Jeremy?

264
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:33,023
Jeremy, is that you?

265
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:48,625
Gabriel.

266
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,621
- Hello, Gabriel.
- Mom?

267
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,326
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, no!

268
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:23,521
No, this isn't me.

269
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:25,706
This isn't me.
Why are you doing this to me?

270
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,667
Make it stop, please!
Make it stop!

271
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,341
So tell me about your ability.

272
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:44,299
I have an ability too.

273
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,726
I am the master of time and space.

274
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,904
Well, I was.

275
00:19:48,071 --> 00:19:50,465
Lately, time and space has been
the master of me.

276
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:54,810
Oh, is that my brain scan?

277
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,419
No. Mine.

278
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,702
I see sounds.
They make colors.

279
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,541
A new ability can be frightening.

280
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,752
But you must not turn away from it.

281
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,338
I want it to stop.

282
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,856
- He's not shooting to kill.
- He's just warning us to stay away.

283
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,944
Still, we're talking about a scared kid
with a small cannon in his hands.

284
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,528
- I'm going up.
- No.

285
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,322
I need to talk to him.

286
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,998
- There's a staircase out back, though.
- I'm on it.

287
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,455
Jeremy, I'm coming upstairs.

288
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,044
Unarmed.

289
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,192
I'm not gonna hurt you.

290
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,092
Talk to me.

291
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,927
Say something.

292
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,389
Stay away, all right.
I'm warning you!

293
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,560
I'm coming upstairs,
If you're gonna shoot, lock and load.

294
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,604
I told you to keep away!

295
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,703
Why?

296
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,903
What happens if I don't?

297
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,700
Everything I touch ends up dead.

298
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,336
Captain Lubbock.
I'm Samuel Sullivan.

299
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:38,672
Glad your family could make it.

300
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,258
I appreciate you sending
those tickets over this morning.

301
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,135
But a gotta ask.
Why me?

302
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,971
We always try
and do something special

303
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,697
for local law enforcement.

304
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,350
I heard about you on the news.

305
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,727
Out chasing down
some escaped prisoner?

306
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,064
You'll indulge me.
I'm showing this to everyone I can.

307
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,736
- A lot of people on the hunt for him.
- Don't think I've seen him.

308
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,035
But I could be wrong.
A lot of folks come and go around here.

309
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,741
If you spot him, call me right away.

310
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,453
I absolutely will.

311
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:11,744
Enjoy the carnival.

312
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,753
Mrs. Lubbock.

313
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,053
Stop. Make it stop.
Please... Please.

314
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,096
Oh, my God.

315
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,682
Oh, God!

316
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,810
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

317
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:35,520
Oh, my God!

318
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,732
Oh, my God!
This isn't me!

319
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,276
Please make it stop!

320
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,987
No, this can't be me.

321
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,680
Please make it...

322
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,094
- What happened?
- Don't come any closer!

323
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:06,852
Okay, I'm right here.

324
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,264
Your parents?

325
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,691
I killed them.

326
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,359
I was angry.

327
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,653
I just touched them, and they died.

328
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,123
- I didn't mean to do it.
- I know you didn't.

329
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:33,078
You know, what's happened
to you, Jeremy, it's not fair.

330
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,830
You never should have been left
to suffer through this alone.

331
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,453
And who are you?

332
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,167
You don't remember me.

333
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,710
But we've met.

334
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,671
I know all about you.
I know about your power.

335
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:45,966
I know that you're not a killer.

336
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,843
You're a healer.

337
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,179
I used to heal things.

338
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,994
And then it turned.

339
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:55,225
And now I kill!

340
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,144
No, you're still a healer.

341
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,896
- You can do both.
- Stop.

342
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,650
If you come one step closer,
I swear to God I will shoot you!

343
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,965
Stay with me.

344
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,220
Stay with me.

345
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,766
- Oh, my God.
- He's bleeding out.

346
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,935
He's never gonna make it
to the hospital.

347
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,067
You need to heal him.

348
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:43,086
I can't.

349
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:45,650
Yes, you can.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

350
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,487
You need to come over here
and lay your hands on him now!

351
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,574
- If I touch him, he'll die.
- He'll die if you don't.

352
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,045
You can do this.

353
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,661
Listen to me.

354
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,874
My power is understanding
people like you.

355
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,292
That's what I do.

356
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,892
What happened to your parents
never has to happen again.

357
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,799
You can control it,
and you can heal him.

358
00:25:11,107 --> 00:25:12,807
Everything I touch dies.

359
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,738
I'm touching you right now.

360
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,485
You can do this.

361
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:22,479
You can give life.

362
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:25,148
Come on.

363
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,749
Focus, Jeremy.

364
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:29,069
Visualize Peter healing.

365
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,405
Imagine what it's gonna look like
when the wound disappears,

366
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:36,393
his eyes open again,
and he is healthy and alive.

367
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:40,189
Picture it, Jeremy.

368
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,401
Keep that thought in your mind.

369
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:11,403
Welcome back.

370
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,352
And now,
to assist Hiro the magnificent,

371
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,272
please welcome to the stage
Emma the...

372
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:49,516
also magnificent!

373
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,319
- Hiro, what are you doing?
- Magic.

374
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,743
And we are going to need
much applause

375
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,745
for the next feat of magicalness.

376
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,020
I will make Emma...

377
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:06,508
disappear!

378
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,443
- It's like time is...
- Standing still.

379
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,430
It's all so beautiful.

380
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:17,301
There are no bad powers Emma.

381
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,828
You just have to understand them.
And when you do,

382
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,951
you will learn to use your powers

383
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,953
to do good things in the world.

384
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:30,333
But please, for now,
our magic trick.

385
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,615
Hide behind the curtains.
Over there.

386
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,861
Where did she go?

387
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,691
Where is Emma?

388
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,039
Where are you?

389
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:07,465
There she is!

390
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,901
A big applause
for Emma the magnificent!

391
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:23,470
But we have to give applause
in a different way.

392
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:24,862
Like this.

393
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:50,473
All those murders...

394
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:56,461
All those memories in my mind...
But I cannot believe that they're mine.

395
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,255
How many did I kill?
A dozen?

396
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:01,512
Two dozen?

397
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:05,762
I'm sorry for your pain.

398
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:09,119
- Truth can be difficult.
- Difficult?

399
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,226
I am a monster!

400
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:15,772
I stalk people
and slash open their skulls.

401
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,816
Has it ever occurred to you
to question

402
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,430
what brought you here?

403
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:22,372
Why providence has seen fit
for our paths to cross?

404
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:25,782
This place is a safe,
protected womb.

405
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,494
Out there's a cruel world filled
with people who persecute our kind.

406
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,996
They made you what you are,
turned you into a monster.

407
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,424
- That makes it okay?
- It makes it the truth!

408
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:39,817
You wanted to know who you are.
And now you do.

409
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:44,008
The question now is:
Where are you gonna go from here?

410
00:30:44,905 --> 00:30:46,450
Do you wallow in self-pity,

411
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,765
or do you learn to use the gifts
God gave you and command fear.

412
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:55,019
And respect, and defend against
those who would do us harm?

413
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:57,847
All in the embrace of a community

414
00:30:58,014 --> 00:31:00,692
who loves you
for exactly who you are.

415
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,242
You just met me.

416
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,862
You would take me in here...

417
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:09,033
Knowing what I've done,
and who I am?

418
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:11,283
We're family.
Family accepts.

419
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:13,355
Family forgives.

420
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:22,003
There's a problem.

421
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:25,407
That policeman who was hunting you,

422
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:26,634
he's here.

423
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,640
It's not just about you anymore,
we're harboring a criminal now.

424
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:38,021
- What do you want me to do?
- I can't make that decision for you.

425
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,651
But your presence here
puts all of us in jeopardy.

426
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,612
Something has to be done.

427
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:50,913
Where is he?

428
00:31:55,234 --> 00:31:58,791
One of my men saw him
going into the house of mirrors.

429
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:20,742
I don't know what to do with him.

430
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:21,856
A leash?

431
00:32:22,497 --> 00:32:23,497
A cage?

432
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,516
Maybe a cattle prod.

433
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:27,936
Now...

434
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:33,199
You keep your Japanese tush
in this bed!

435
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:37,413
I'm not a pet.

436
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:40,793
She's right, Hiro.
You're sick.

437
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:45,129
You need to stop using your power
before it kills you.

438
00:32:45,574 --> 00:32:47,237
But my power isn't killing me.

439
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:48,804
It keeps me alive.

440
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,460
When I was stuck in my cubicle
every day...

441
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:53,805
wasting my life,
that's when I was dying.

442
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,141
How can you be so focused
helping others,

443
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:58,935
knowing what it might cost?

444
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,340
I had a friend once.

445
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,106
She knew she was dying but,

446
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:05,525
that didn't push her off her path.

447
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:08,578
She told me to keep joy
and dignity alive,

448
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:10,545
even in the face of death.

449
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,201
Her name was Charlie.

450
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,034
Oh, my god.

451
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:18,246
I can't believe I left her
off the list.

452
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:19,618
What?

453
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,622
What are you doing?

454
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:23,599
Paper and pen, stat.

455
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,463
I had a list.

456
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,675
A list of all the wrongs
I have to right before I die.

457
00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:32,969
I can't believe I forgot her.

458
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,687
Promise me you won't leave
until Peter returns.

459
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:51,229
There's been an accident
at 2627 Otsego.

460
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,906
Please send the police
and the coroner.

461
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:58,035
Did you get his ability?

462
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,172
So what next?

463
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,842
There's an air field about six miles
south of here off the highway.

464
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,500
I called in a favor
and I got you a ride.

465
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,365
It's not as fast as how you came, but...

466
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:11,424
- You're not coming with?
- No.

467
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,805
All right, better hurry.
Hiro's waiting.

468
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,071
Okay, so, I jerry-rigged the heater.

469
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:37,407
And I backed up the vent.

470
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,876
It's gonna look like
carbon monoxide poisoning, OK?

471
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:42,497
You came home and you found them.

472
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,664
All right?

473
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:48,036
You're staying here?

474
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:51,005
- Yeah.
- How long?

475
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:54,258
Till I know that you're all right.

476
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:57,693
Jeremy,

477
00:34:58,077 --> 00:34:59,577
it used to be my job

478
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:02,104
to watch over people like you.

479
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,425
But somehow I...

480
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:08,648
I lost my way.
I dropped the ball.

481
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,334
You may not know it,

482
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:21,488
but I let you down.

483
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:23,705
Come on.

484
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:58,322
Hands above your head... Now.

485
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:04,620
You need to leave here, now.

486
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,830
While there's still time.

487
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:09,250
I got a better idea.

488
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,748
You resist arrest,
then I have an excuse.

489
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:13,527
I'm just trying to save you.

490
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:32,398
What are you?

491
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:18,861
Don't just stand there, get a mop!

492
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:05,939
- That was beautiful.
- You promised you would stay in bed.

493
00:39:07,442 --> 00:39:09,805
Joy and dignity
in the face of death.

494
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,182
Just like Charlie.

495
00:39:11,705 --> 00:39:13,255
Come on, back to bed.

496
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,177
You're safe now.

497
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:52,431
Tonight...

498
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:57,285
We welcome a new brother
into our family.

499
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:00,364
He will live

500
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,740
and work among us...

501
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:06,362
And will be welcome here...

502
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,362
all the rest of our days.

503
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,350
There, there, Edgar, don't pout.

504
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:44,275
Good thing I followed that bastard.
I knew he wouldn't follow through.

505
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,394
He's just a baby
learning how to walk.

506
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:51,796
What use is he to us like this?

507
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,228
What use is a lion that can't kill?

508
00:40:57,546 --> 00:40:59,081
Maybe it's better this way.

509
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:03,587
We just make a better sylar.

510
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,278
And when we do...

511
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,466
He'll be ours forever.

512
00:41:35,086 --> 00:41:37,808
Emma, I'm sorry it took so long.
How is he?

513
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:39,121
- Gone.
- What?

514
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,123
He disappeared.
Just disappeared.

515
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,760
"Save Charlie."
