1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,390
Mmm. Hello, governor.

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,770
Really? Is he on now?

3
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,239
There are people

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,009
Who are frankly stunned

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,079
By your seemingly meteoric rise.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,409
In the senate less than three months

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,219
And already closely allied with the president

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,559
On what many people are calling unprecedented access

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,910
To the average american's most private details.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,289
Steve, I'm just a humble junior senator from new york,

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,779
But as chairman of the senate commission

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,399
On homeland security, it's my duty

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,359
To protect and serve the people of america.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,499
I can assure you, governor,

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,709
I don't know any more about this than you do.

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,329
Trust me, that's ancient history.

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,160
I haven't spoken to him in close to two months.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,759
Now, if you don't mind,

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,320
I do have to get some sleep.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,489
The rumors in washington are

21
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,869
Of frequent private meetings at the white house,

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,829
And the question on everyone's mind is

23
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,299
What are you discussing?

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,299
Well, again, these are matters of national security.

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,849
We're protecting the american people

26
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,589
From a very serious threat.

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,939
Are we talking about terrorism?

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,039
Let me assure you, the threat is real.

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,939
We're not out to alarm the american public,

30
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,670
But it's important that we take precautionary measures.

31
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,359
Senator, I don't mean to belabor this,

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,019
Of course the questions why you?

33
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,979
Why now?

34
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,779
Well, I'd love to go

35
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,269
Into specifics with you, steve,

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,320
But these are highly classified discussions.

37
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,569
There are those that fear

38
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,919
That what you're really talking about

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,489
Is taking away civil liberties,

40
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,099
Relaxing fisa policies,

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,389
Expanding the reach of the patriot act.

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,740
What about that?

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,749
Anyone who knows my record and my career

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,879
Will tell you I've devoted my life to protecting people.

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,129
As a district attorney in new york,

46
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,820
I was tough on crime.

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,559
You want me to beg?

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,509
And now I'm continuing that passion

49
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,769
With the protection of the entire nation.

50
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,799
Well, screw you.

51
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,670
Is this about your religious calling?

52
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,680
I don't beg for anyone.

53
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,659
After your assassination attempt,

54
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,749
You made claims that god has a mission for you.

55
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,300
What do you want?

56
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,420
Yes, I stand by those comments. Now more than ever.

57
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,589
Cover her hands.

58
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,109
You got her? Got her.

59
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,500
All right.

60
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,390
All right, we're good.

61
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,150
I'm a god-fearing man.

62
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,319
I just want what's best for our country.

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,900
Tell petrelli, we got the first one

64
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,760
Tokyo,Japan

65
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,950
Open your eyes.

66
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,989
Used to be a firehouse.

67
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,319
I pulled some strings,

68
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,999
Bought it from the city.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,289
Now it's our lair.

70
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,839
Lair?

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,119
We've been over this,Hiro...

72
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,979
You're going to look very bad ass...

73
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,720
In the rest of your costume.

74
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,199
See?

75
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,670
Perfect!

76
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,859
Is this Spandex?

77
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,209
I wouldn't be caught dead in this thing.

78
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,139
A superhero must hide his true identity.

79
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,439
I know what this is about,Hiro.

80
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,279
You do?

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,389
You have no powers anymore,

82
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,779
So you want to live through me.

83
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,949
No!

84
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,239
But my power...

85
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,880
Is worthless.

86
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,769
You're a super charger!

87
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,269
For other people's power!

88
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,899
Children will speak of...

89
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,829
Your crime fighting skills for generations.

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,309
Right after they stop laughting...

91
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,779
At the way I'm dressed.

92
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,759
Ando

93
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,710
It is your destiny to become a superhero.

94
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,049
Forget it.

95
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,110
I'm not interested.

96
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,689
We'll see if you feel that way after...

97
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,059
You see the Ando-cycle.

98
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,110
There's an Ando-cycle?

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,239
It's a motorcycle.

100
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Not just any motorcycle

101
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,499
Go ahead

102
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,989
I've embedded the latest two-way communication...

103
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,100
All from right here at base camp

104
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,960
You just enter the password

105
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,449
Let me guess

106
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,089
I don't get to know the password

107
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,139
No

108
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,070
Not even a clue?

109
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,579
It's the name of someone...

110
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,240
Very important to me

111
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,269
Once I've entered the password,

112
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,789
I can track your location...

113
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,019
Anywhere on the planet...

114
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,379
With your GPS implant

115
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,119
What GPS implant?

116
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,950
This one.

117
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,079
I can't believe you did that to me!

118
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,889
Don't worry I did the same thing to myself.

119
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,359
Only hurts for an hour or so.

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,700
You're insane! I've had it with you!

121
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,100
Get yourself another superhero!

122
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,380
Ando!

123
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,330
Breathe.

124
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,170
Breathe in.

125
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,070
Breathe in.

126
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,530
Breathe in.

127
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,889
Breathe.

128
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,209
Peter, it's over.

129
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,699
No, I can save him.

130
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,170
It's no use. He's dead.

131
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,620
Damn it.

132
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,899
I could have saved him.

133
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,769
No, you couldn't.

134
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,630
He bled out in the car.

135
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,710
I should have got to him faster.

136
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,509
He was pinned in there.

137
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,590
So, I should have been stronger.

138
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,880
You can't save everyone.

139
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,090
I should have been stronger.

140
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,860
Well, any favorites yet?

141
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,149
Yeah, I mean, hamilton, smith,

142
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,250
Georgetown--they're all...

143
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,589
The best schools in the country.

144
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,689
Getting your ged

145
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,609
Was the best thing you could have done.

146
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,449
An elite education

147
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,719
Is something most people only dream about.

148
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,879
Claire, you're an exceptional young woman,

149
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,629
And you deserve an exceptional education.

150
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,360
If you say so.

151
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,300
Are you okay?

152
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,740
Look, I appreciate this.

153
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,209
You putting me up and offering to get me into school,

154
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,479
But I don't think I can do this.

155
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,170
Your father and I have discussed this at length.

156
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,060
Which one?

157
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,450
Both of them.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,619
And we all felt that going to college

159
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,029
Was the best chance that you would have

160
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,599
At a normal life.

161
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,569
Everyone keeps saying that, but none of us have a chance

162
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,609
At a normal life when he's still out there.

163
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,360
When who's still out there?

164
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,469
Sylar.

165
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,110
Claire, sylar is dead.

166
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,779
We stood there together

167
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,399
And watched primatech burn to the ground.

168
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,119
They found dental remains.

169
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,159
I know he's out there, okay?

170
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,529
I can feel it in my gut.

171
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,749
He's killing again,

172
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,449
And my father is trying to hide it from me.

173
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,219
I found an article in his desk

174
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,129
About a man who went missing in memphis.

175
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,059
They searched his house and found his entire upstairs

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,669
Filled with salt water.

177
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,809
I'm sure there's some explanation.

178
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,269
My dad keeps going away for days at a time,

179
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,049
Going on business trips.

180
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,559
It's happening again, and I should be out there

181
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,209
Helping to stop it.

182
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,199
Claire, you have got to believe me.

183
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,519
It's over.

184
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,759
All of it.

185
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,229
Primatech, the company, pinehearst.

186
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,469
All of it.

187
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,099
And we all have to accept that.

188
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,869
No.

189
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,419
You're just trying to put me on the bench.

190
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,889
He's out there.

191
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,479
And if I'm the only one who sees that, then fine.

192
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,910
I'll go find him myself.

193
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,859
You move, and I shoot. God damn thief.

194
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,329
Think you can come into my shop

195
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,549
Without meme hearing you?

196
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,010
Martin?

197
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,600
Martin gray?

198
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,569
Do I know you?

199
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,569
Did you live at 423 canmore street

200
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,870
In queens 27 years ago?

201
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,480
It was snowing.

202
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,059
In the middle of february, you went out

203
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,779
For a pack of cigarettes at 10:00

204
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,459
And never came back.

205
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,860
Or so the story goes.

206
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,600
Kind of cliche, don't you think?

207
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,949
Who are you?

208
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,290
I'm your son.

209
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,060
And I have some questions for you.

210
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,989
Oh, hey. I was just--

211
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,430
Working?

212
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,089
I got done with all my morning deliveries,

213
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,649
So I thought I'd just come home.

214
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,200
At 10:30?

215
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,250
Are you spying on me?

216
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,600
Maybe.

217
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,359
Look, I know I said I wouldn't use my speed,

218
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,709
But do you have any idea how long it takes

219
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,479
To get across midtown on a bike?

220
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,549
Yes, and that's sort of the idea.

221
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,329
But I'm all done for the day.

222
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,819
We could go to the zoo or something.

223
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,890
Some of us still have to put in a full day.

224
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,509
You know, I could use my ability

225
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,329
To work my way clear to the top

226
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,589
Of the police force, but do i?

227
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,569
No, 'cause you're a body guard who makes 12 bucks an hour.

228
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,229
At least it's honest work.

229
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,309
When you should be opening

230
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,239
Your own private detective agency, like you want.

231
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,839
I told you, I can get you the cash.

232
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,519
I'm not gonna use stolen money to open up a business, daphne.

233
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,539
What's wrong with trying to live like normal people?

234
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,189
It's boring, for one thing.

235
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,709
Well, I will take boring any day

236
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,129
Over this bizarro world that I've been in

237
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,489
Ever since this whole thing got started.

238
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,549
Come on, we talked about putting it all behind us

239
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,649
And just getting everything back to normal.

240
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,330
Just...

241
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,310
Normal.

242
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,730
Okay. Fine, you win.

243
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,860
Normal it is.

244
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,639
Yes, I know that.

245
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,719
But she has her own ideas, and now she's circling

246
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,100
The building on your whole operation.

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,939
She found an article about a guy in memphis

248
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,829
That your team picked up,

249
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,110
And, uh, she thinks it's sylar.

250
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,560
You haven't?

251
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,219
Well, then I'm sure it's all just her imagination.

252
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,299
What's your point?

253
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,939
No.

254
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,469
Well, the point is she's suspicious,

255
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,299
And I can't control her.

256
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,479
That's too bad, mom,

257
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,749
Because I was counting on you distracting her.

258
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,219
If she digs, she's gonna start finding things,

259
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,989
And today is crucial.

260
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,479
We have to keep her away from peter

261
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,229
And away from parkman when we take him down.

262
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,239
Mom, you hear me?

263
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,410
I want claire as far away from all of this as possible.

264
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,510
Mom?

265
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,600
I think we have a bigger problem now.

266
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,720
I'm very different person now.

267
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,990
That was a long time ago.

268
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,990
Maybe for you.

269
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,749
You said you had questions?

270
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,630
Well, ask 'em.

271
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,230
How does a boy

272
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,999
Without a father grow up to be a man?

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,839
How does he learn to make the hard decisions

274
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,139
He's gonna have to make in life--

275
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,690
The ones only a man can teach?

276
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,479
You want an apology, is that it?

277
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,119
You want to hear I'm sorry

278
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,319
For walking out on you and your mother?

279
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,769
I just want the truth.

280
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,949
What about?

281
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,910
That your mother was a sick, infantile woman?

282
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,419
Or that I made a mistake ever to have a child with her?

283
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,849
Let's start there,

284
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,829
Because I'm sure as hell not the son of a man

285
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,029
Who repairs watches

286
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,500
And the woman who collected snow globes.

287
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,590
So who am i?

288
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,400
Tell me.

289
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800
You were given to me.

290
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,899
By whom?

291
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,090
A man who needed money.

292
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,879
Your mother wanted a baby and couldn't have one.

293
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,819
I wanted out of a loveless marriage

294
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,970
And was too much of a coward.

295
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,709
Seemed like the right answer at the time.

296
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,780
Who was he?

297
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,229
My brother.

298
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,420
Is he still alive?

299
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,520
You're telling the truth.

300
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,300
Now please leave

301
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,069
So, you planning on seeing him?

302
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,199
See who?

303
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,889
Your brother. He's in town.

304
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,209
Saw him on tv this morning.

305
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,899
Ah, I didn't see that.

306
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,139
I haven't seen him in months.

307
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,599
Not really talking at the moment.

308
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,770
Huh. Maybe you won't mind me being honest.

309
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,879
He scares the hell out of me.

310
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,659
Why is that?

311
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,259
My family's from iran.

312
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,679
The things he's talking about,

313
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,630
Protecting the country from dangerous people,

314
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,659
It's code. It's not very subtle either.

315
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,829
He's talking about people like me.

316
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,090
We're different, so we're scary.

317
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,140
But you wouldn't know anything about that.

318
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,350
Believe me, I know more than you think.

319
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,139
Hello? Claire?

320
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,539
Peter, thank god.

321
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,979
Hey, where are you?

322
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,250
I'm in new york. We have to stop them.

323
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,619
Stop who?

324
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,179
Your mom and nathan, they're planning something,

325
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,239
Something bad.

326
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,689
I thought it was sylar, but it's them.

327
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,929
What are you talking about?

328
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,539
I don't know. I think they're talking

329
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,109
About rounding up people with abilities.

330
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,679
They already started taking them.

331
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,919
This guy, in memphis, he disappeared.

332
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,439
Look, wait a minute. Slow down.

333
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,549
They were talking on the phone.

334
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,329
Your mom, your brother.

335
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,359
They were talking about keeping me out of the way,

336
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,329
So I wouldn't find out.

337
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,559
They're going after matt parkman today.

338
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,669
We have to stop them.

339
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,269
Okay, look, just take a deep breath, all right?

340
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,619
I have to warn matt.

341
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,949
I'll go talk to my mom.

342
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,320
When I know something, I'll give you a call, okay?

343
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,310
I'm just going a few blocks. 87th and madison, please.

344
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,160
Hello, peter.

345
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,070
Mohinder?

346
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,069
This is a coincidence.

347
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,139
Last time I saw you-- I know.

348
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,869
It's been a long time. Keeping out of trouble?

349
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,530
Trying to.

350
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,119
Although you ever get the feeling

351
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,940
Like you're meant to do something extraordinary?

352
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,629
I used to.

353
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,970
Turns out I was mistaken.

354
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,959
Seen anyone? I try not to.

355
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,249
Everybody's under the radar.

356
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,259
All except your brother, of course.

357
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,609
Well, you know nathan.

358
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,769
Seems like every time I pick up a newspaper

359
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,589
Or turn on the tv, there he is,

360
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,329
Right out in the open.

361
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,440
He's not wrong, you know.

362
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,489
These powers uncontrolled, unrestricted,

363
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,169
I see only danger in that.

364
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,229
Do you?

365
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,029
I was living proof of it.

366
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,009
Okay, so what happens when the government

367
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,119
Wants to step in?

368
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,299
That's a necessary risk I'm willing to accept.

369
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,919
Segregation? Internment camps?

370
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,649
People hiding underground?

371
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,660
We'll agree to disagree.

372
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,859
How much do I owe you?

373
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,100
Ah, it's okay. It's on me.

374
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,390
Thank you.

375
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,689
Take care of yourself, mohinder.

376
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,660
You too, peter.

377
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,160
Where to, my friend?

378
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,720
Just drive.

379
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,820
It's your time

380
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,059
Who are you... And what do you want?

381
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,560
I want you to get in the van.

382
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,150
You're surrounded.

383
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,260
Get in.

384
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,320
You want to live, get in!

385
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,969
What the hell is going on?

386
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,149
Those guys who tried to kidnap me.

387
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,210
Do you know who they are? No.

388
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,669
Has anybody contacted you about people with abilities

389
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,450
Being attacked or abducted? No.

390
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,549
Have you had any contact with claire?

391
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,050
Or parkman? No! No!

392
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,819
What did peter petrelli tell you today?

393
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,440
How did you know--

394
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,150
Where did you come from?

395
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,250
What are you doing?!

396
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,300
Sorry, mohinder.

397
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,640
Mom?

398
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,870
Mom, you home?

399
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,940
She's not here.

400
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,310
It's been a long time, pete.

401
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,609
Sorry I've been out of touch. I've been kind of busy.

402
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,499
Yeah, what with all press you've been doing lately, right?

403
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,149
You know the media,

404
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,719
They like new and shiny.

405
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,929
Yeah, you got the whole country thinking

406
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,179
You're talking about terrorists,

407
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,579
But we both know who you're really talking about.

408
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,569
What can I say, pete? Last time I tried to out us,

409
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,389
I got shot.

410
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,649
I'm nothing if not a quick study.

411
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,750
Just gonna round us all up, get rid of us?

412
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,469
Let me guess,

413
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,289
You got our mother involved in this, too.

414
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,400
Mom's got nothing to do with this, pete.

415
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,629
It's not dad's plans, it's all me.

416
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,639
You know how I feel about this. We've been over it.

417
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,779
I'm doing what's necessary.

418
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,849
No, what you're doing is turning your back

419
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,189
On your own kind.

420
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,759
It's one thing to disown me, nathan.

421
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,899
But this, you're a self-loathing hypocrite.

422
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,860
And you wonder why I haven't returned your calls?

423
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,349
Look, I said some things that were pretty harsh.

424
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,900
I admit it.

425
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,000
I got a little emotional,

426
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,400
But I've had time to calm down and...

427
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,890
I'd like to talk to you about some ideas.

428
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,269
I'd like your input,

429
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,999
Your...Advice.

430
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,349
Advice?

431
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,739
What advice could I possibly give you

432
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,930
Besides kiss my ass, nathan?

433
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,869
I'm just trying to extend an olive branch here,

434
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,610
That's all.

435
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,290
How about dinner?

436
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,390
Tonight?

437
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,350
Just dinner.

438
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,170
I'll text you when and where.

439
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,390
Okay.

440
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,930
Just out of curiosity,

441
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,889
What can you do these days?

442
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,330
Do?

443
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,829
Your abilities.

444
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,580
What are you, a cop?

445
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,389
What's the last thing you saw me do, nathan?

446
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,300
You flew.

447
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,770
Hey, how the hell did you get out of your tank?

448
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,299
You're talking to a turtle again.

449
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,210
You again.

450
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,999
How did you get into my apartment?

451
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,559
What are you doing here?

452
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,319
I came to give you a message.

453
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,759
It's kind of a long trip

454
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,329
For a message, don't you think?

455
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,029
I'm not really here, parkman.

456
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,470
It's an illusion, like life.

457
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,179
It's best not to make this any more difficult

458
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,299
Than it has to be.

459
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,919
There are things you'll come to know

460
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,000
Along the way in this journey.

461
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,179
No. No, no, no, no.

462
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,649
I've taken way too many journeys already.

463
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,499
I know it's difficult to understand,

464
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,139
But I went through the same thing

465
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,170
When it happened to me.

466
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,389
When what happened to you?

467
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,910
The calling

468
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,370
To be a prophet.

469
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,489
You've been chosen.

470
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,159
No, I didn't ask to be chosen for anything.

471
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,189
All I want to do is live a normal life.

472
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,839
But you're not normal, parkman,

473
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,129
And you've known that for a while.

474
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,959
The world needs you

475
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,309
To tell them the future. The future?

476
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,799
How the hell am I gonna do that?

477
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,869
You'll paint it.

478
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,079
I can't even draw!

479
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,020
You'll learn.

480
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,760
Fine, so what am I supposed--

481
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,670
Ah, there you are, Ando.

482
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,889
Ando, this is Hiro, come in!

483
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,969
I know you're there

484
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,670
Just talk to me

485
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,379
Alright, i'm sorry i shot you in the arm...

486
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,329
But you'll thank me, i promise

487
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,119
No i won't

488
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,109
Ah ha, i knew it would work

489
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,759
Where are you?

490
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,279
I'm fighting crime...

491
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,190
Just like you wanted

492
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,990
You moved!

493
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,929
I'm looking at you and the ando-cycle right now

494
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,139
You're not fighting crime

495
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,270
You're at...

496
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,560
...A strip club

497
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,809
You should be using your powers for good...

498
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,720
Not to pick up girls

499
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,919
The ando-cycle is a chick magnet

500
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,349
You have a destiny just as i did

501
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,339
A savred duty to use your powers...

502
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,859
To do great things in the world...

503
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,830
To fight injustice wherever you find...

504
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,409
Hey. What are...?

505
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,510
No. Don't

506
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,050
Hiro?

507
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,039
Hiro. Are you okay?

508
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,430
Hiro! What's going on?

509
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,689
Thank god you're okay.

510
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,530
Claire, what are you doing here?

511
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,039
Did they come? Did who come?

512
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,459
I don't know, but you're in danger.

513
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,669
I heard angela and nathan talking

514
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,699
About sending someone to take you down.

515
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,709
Take me down, huh?

516
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,589
I came to warn you. It's happening again.

517
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,849
Sylar, the company-- they are planning something.

518
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,569
I don't know anything about that,

519
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,309
But something weird is happening to me.

520
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,030
Weird like what?

521
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,359
I made these drawings.

522
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,069
Except the thing is I don't draw,

523
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,489
Or at least I couldn't until now.

524
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,989
What does this have to do with anything?

525
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,909
They're supposed to come true, I think,

526
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,770
But they don't make any sense to me.

527
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,960
Is that supposed to be us?

528
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,699
You're right.

529
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,010
That's us, right now.

530
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,930
What is that on your neck?

531
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,669
I know we have dinner plans.

532
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,349
There's just some things I need to talk to you about

533
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,890
That can't wait.

534
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,920
Okay.

535
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,299
I can only imagine how you feel about me after...

536
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,860
Disowning you the way I did.

537
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,260
It was selfish, arrogant...

538
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,689
Obsessive.

539
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,610
Those are your better qualities, nathan.

540
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,579
I know it hasn't been easy

541
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,389
Losing me as a brother and a friend.

542
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,779
You need to know what I'm doing

543
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,270
Is hugely important for this country.

544
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,500
For the world.

545
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,479
I want to give you the chance to understand that

546
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,239
Before you make a decision

547
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,209
That may change your life forever.

548
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,530
I'm not making any decisions.

549
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,090
Okay, I'm just trying to live my life as normally as I can.

550
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,570
That's just it, pete. You're not normal.

551
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,200
Pete, please...

552
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,789
Tell me you understand that, so I can make arrangements

553
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,360
And provide you with the protection that you need.

554
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,490
Tell me you understand.

555
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,139
What are you asking me this?

556
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,909
What is it that you're looking for me to say?

557
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,929
I'm looking for you to tell me you're with me,

558
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,020
And then I'll leave.

559
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,010
I can't do that.

560
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,029
No, I won't do that.

561
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,779
Look, I don't know what you're up to,

562
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,970
But if it is what I think it is,

563
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,079
I'm gonna fight you with every breath that I have.

564
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,000
I swear to god.

565
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,810
Okay.

566
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,350
Hey, give your big brother a hug?

567
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,440
Of course.

568
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,500
I'm sorry, pete.

569
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,620
Don't hurt him

570
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,860
Hello?

571
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,250
Anybody home?

572
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,030
Mr.Gray

573
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,180
Who are you?

574
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,900
I said, who are you?

575
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,609
Simmons.

576
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,289
Agent daniel simmons.

577
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,589
All right, agent simmons,

578
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,679
Where's the man that lives in this house?

579
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,270
Where's mr. Gray? I don't know.

580
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,859
Then we'll ask another question.

581
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,910
I walked into a trap. Who sent you?

582
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,579
A challenge...Fine.

583
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,730
I like a challenge.

584
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,459
Hiro

585
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,390
"someone important to me"...

586
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,750
Kaito...

587
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,230
Kensei.

588
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,770
Ando

589
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,060
Hiro...

590
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,209
We have a couple of situations.

591
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,400
Let me guess... Sylar.

592
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,549
We've lost communication with the team.

593
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,079
I told you to put a bullet in the back of his head.

594
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,200
Right here.

595
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,300
The last thing I need is a body count to try and explain.

596
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,939
We're sending a clean-up crew,

597
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,150
But there's something else.

598
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,360
Uncuff her.

599
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,530
Give us a minute.

600
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,420
I hate you.

601
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,069
I know.

602
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,850
You're never gonna get away with this.

603
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,050
Someday you might forgive me, claire.

604
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,180
Someday you might not.

605
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,549
The important thing is that you get home right now

606
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,419
And forget everything you've just seen.

607
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,300
What makes you think I'm gonna do that?

608
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,830
What, are you gonna threaten my family?

609
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,570
Claire, I have given you a free pass.

610
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,470
Don't make me change my mind.

611
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,509
No.

612
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,370
Where are you taking them?

613
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,690
195 you are clear to take off

614
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,660
Hiro.

615
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,129
Peter. Peter, it's me.

616
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,619
Come on, wake up.

617
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,079
Come on, we need to get everyone out of here.

618
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,439
We need to break these shackles.

619
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,880
I don't have strength anymore.

620
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,540
Suresh.

621
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,550
Take this stuff off.

622
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,799
Suresh?

623
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,249
Come on, wake up.

624
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,990
Come on, wake up.

625
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,870
Wake everybody up.

626
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,910
Go to the cockpit!

627
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,670
We're gonna make an unexpected landing.

628
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,330
Claire?

629
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,639
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

630
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,519
Den mother 3-1 going down!

631
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,579
Bearing two-four-five at nine-eight

632
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,569
Off walnut ridge vortac!

633
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,620
We have lost pressure! Mayday, mayday!
