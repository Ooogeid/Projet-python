of our friend mr. Linderman.

188
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:21,633
Who the hell are you?

189
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,067
Someone who wants to help.

190
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,633
Linderman made a mess of things

191
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,334
And i'm here
to right the ship.

192
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,866
So to speak.

193
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,300
Okay.

194
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,267
You've done that
by paying our bills.

195
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,233
No, i meant helping you
with your illness.

196
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:37,900
I know you think
jessica is gone.

197
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:38,967
How do you know about that?

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
But we've discovered

199
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,900
That when
these abilities manifest,

200
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:44,133
The way the mind deals
with the new reality

201
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,400
Sometimes results
in a fracture of sorts.

202
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:50,000
A split personality.

203
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:52,067
No, i'm finished
with jessica.

204
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,434
How do you know
a new personality won't emerge?

205
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,000
I can get you
all the help you need.

206
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:03,933
The best care in the world.

207
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,967
Uh-Huh.
What's the catch?

208
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,866
The catch is you have
to leave your family

209
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,334
And enter the program.

210
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,067
I just went through hell

211
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,000
To get my family
back together.

212
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm not leaving them now.

213
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,733
There is medication
you can try at home, but...

214
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:24,933
But what?

215
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,666
It's not
without side effects.

216
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,833
And as you just said,

217
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,566
You've been through
so much for your family.

218
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:34,067
Do you really wanna risk...

219
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,267
Losing them all again?

220
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:43,466
So i just take these pills
every day?

221
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:44,300
Yep.

222
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:45,766
It's a little cocktail

223
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,666
They cooked up here
in the lab.

224
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,033
It controls the abilities.

225
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,967
Dampens them.

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,367
Like that guy who was
standing in the corner

227
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,466
Of bob's office.

228
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:58,434
The haitian.
Yeah.

229
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:00,499
Sorta.

230
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,499
So let's just call them...

231
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:06,200
Haitian pills.

232
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,099
Bye, peter.

233
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,133
Ow!

234
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,800
That hurts.

235
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,667
You'll get used to it.

236
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,366
And then
you'll start to like it.

237
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,767
Hello?

238
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Who said that?

239
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:41,934
Me.

240
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,966
(D.L.)
* he's a jolly good fellow

241
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:54,700
* it's micah's birthday
today *

242
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,500
All right!

243
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,200
11 years old.

244
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,866
Almost the man
of the house now.

245
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:04,800
Mom?

246
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,933
Did you make a wish, baby?

247
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,233
(D.L.)
Don't tell us.

248
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,633
'Cause you know
it's not gonna come true.

249
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,066
You both already know
what i wished for, anyways.

250
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,333
Micah, we've been
over this.

251
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,966
But i've got it
all figured out.

252
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:20,700
I could make the car radio
pick up the police band.

253
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:22,467
We could go to the crime scene
and be heroes.

254
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Or the police
could just take care of it.

255
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:27,300
We could be like
the fantastic four.

256
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:31,367
Minus one.
But still.

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,734
Micah, i wanna
be a hero to you.

258
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:36,834
And i finally figured out
how to do that.

259
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:40,166
I think i got a job.

260
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,266
A good job.

261
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,500
Doing what?

262
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:43,899
Something that's gonna make you
proud of me,

263
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:44,899
I promise.

264
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,500
Come on.

265
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,100
I promised
i'd take you bowling, right?

266
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,999
Let's go.

267
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:52,100
Mom, you coming?

268
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,500
Your mom's had
a long day, micah.

269
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,800
Go get your jacket.

270
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:05,933
All i want is to smile
at my boy on his birthday,

271
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:07,166
And i can't even do that.

272
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,767
They said it's just
gonna take a little while

273
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,999
For the medication
to level out.

274
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:15,333
I just don't know
how much longer i can do this.

275
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,734
I wanna say
things'll get better.

276
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,600
But i know how that sounds.

277
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,433
The truth is, they will.

278
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:04,600
You know,
it's been a month.

279
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,966
You still
haven't told me your name.

280
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,300
Please, i just
wanna be left alone.

281
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,133
You came to the right place.

282
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,667
I have to warn you,
though,

283
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,133
It does get a bit old.

284
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,166
Let me guess.

285
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,999
You were living
a perfectly ordinary life.

286
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:27,066
Until one day
you discovered you could do

287
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,933
Incredible things.

288
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:32,300
I bet it was wonderful
at first.

289
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,734
You thought perhaps
you could save the world.

290
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:38,300
And then you realized,
tragically,

291
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,866
That you were dangerous.

292
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:45,567
I'll let you talk to me
after a decade.

293
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,966
Oh, actually,
talk to me after three.

294
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:51,033
If they wanna leave me
in here forever,

295
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,600
That's fine by me.

296
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,667
You've been through
something awful, haven't you?

297
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,767
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,166
I'm peter.

299
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,866
Hello, peter.

300
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:18,100
It's nice to meet you.

301
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,367
I'm adam.

302
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:24,368
...

303
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:35,567
I'm not in the mood today,
elle.

304
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,999
Just a little one?

305
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:40,533
I'll up your dose.

306
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,667
I'm fine.

307
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,834
Just a little one.

308
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,166
Oh!

309
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,367
Not that a fistful of pills
everyday isn't fun, but...

310
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,933
It's been two months now
and i still don't know

311
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:08,066
A thing about you.

312
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,266
I was just thinking...

313
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,567
Maybe there's more to you
than the whole

314
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,300
Sadistic lightning thing,
that's all.

315
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,567
What's your story?

316
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,367
I liked you better
when you just laid there.

317
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,866
So you're not gonna tell me?

318
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,700
What are you, afraid?

319
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:26,899
No.

320
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,800
You just
like to be in control.

321
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,966
I get it.

322
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,899
I figured as much.

323
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,166
Sorry i asked.
Won't happen again.

324
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,533
I accidentally
set my grandmother's house

325
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,400
On fire when i was six.

326
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,567
Caused a blackout

327
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,767
In four counties in ohio
when i was eight.

328
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,734
I spent my ninth birthday
in a glass room

329
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,467
With an iv
of lithium in my arm.

330
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I've lived in this building
for 16 years.

331
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:05,633
Ever since the shrinks
diagnosed me

332
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,300
As a sociopath
with paranoid delusions.

333
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,600
But they were
just out to get me

334
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:12,433
Because i threatened
to kill 'em.

335
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:16,899
I'm 24 years old,
and i've never gone on a date.

336
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,667
Never been
on a roller coaster.

337
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,933
Never been swimming.

338
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:23,400
And now you know everything
there is to know about me.

339
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,767
I don't have the luxury
of being more interesting

340
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,600
Than that.

341
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,133
Later, alligator.

342
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:41,600
(Adam)
word to the wise, friend.

343
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,200
I would keep my distance
from that one.

344
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,767
I caved in a desperate moment
six years ago,

345
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,233
And i'm still paying
the price.

346
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,367
Don't worry.

347
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,633
I don't want anything
from her

348
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:52,667
Except the drugs.

349
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,567
I'm sorry,
i keep forgetting.

350
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,734
You still believe them.

351
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,700
What do you mean?

352
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,567
This cure of theirs.

353
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,866
They've been days away
from perfecting it

354
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,533
Since i got here
30 years ago.

355
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:10,633
Bob's not trying
to fix you, peter.

356
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,866
No.

357
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,667
They created this facility
to help us.

358
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,233
You're not
in a facility, peter.

359
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,433
Look around.

360
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,033
You're in a prison.

361
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:25,200
You don't believe me?

362
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:26,734
Why don't you
try getting out?

363
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:36,235
...

364
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:49,370
Oh, i'm sorry.

365
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,337
Are you all right?

366
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,836
He said it was all a lie.

367
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,337
What happened to him,
and...

368
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,737
To peter,
and the car crash.

369
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,003
I take it he told you
he thought he could fly.

370
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:21,503
And the plot
to blow up new york.

371
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:23,637
That peter was a bomb.

372
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,570
It must be
the pain medication.

373
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:31,303
You deserve to know this.

374
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:35,070
I tried to keep it
from you and the boys.

375
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:36,570
What?

376
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:42,570
There's a dark secret
in the petrelli family.

377
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:45,437
It started with their father.

378
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,136
Delusions of grandeur,

379
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,836
Paranoia.

380
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:51,203
It lead to his suicide.

381
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:53,737
But sadly...

382
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,270
That disease
has obviously been passed down.

383
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,103
My god.

384
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:03,270
Now...

385
00:24:03,303 --> 00:24:05,704
Nathan's a great man.

386
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,236
And his life is gonna
be very complicated.

387
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,337
He really deserves his dignity
and his...

388
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,303
His privacy.

389
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:18,936
So i hope you understand

390
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:24,570
That this
has to be kept secret.

391
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:29,236
Can i count on you
for that, heidi?

392
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,737
Hi, what can i do to get you
inside a--

393
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,903
Hi...hi.

394
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:43,704
What can i do
to get you

395
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:45,136
Into a brand new car?

396
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,570
Hi, what can i do...

397
00:24:46,603 --> 00:24:48,003
Depends on what
you're gonna do to me

398
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:50,737
Once you get me inside.

399
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,770
I got a great feeling
about your first day.

400
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:59,270
My butterflies
have butterflies.

401
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:02,637
Nik, i am so proud of you.

402
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,270
I knew that medication
would work out.

403
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,236
You were right.

404
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,670
I'm gonna take micah
to school.

405
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:09,704
Okay.

406
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:12,170
You have a great day
at work.

407
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,537
And when i get home tonight,

408
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,070
We're gonna celebrate.

409
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:27,470
(Gina)
he's gonna know you're
not taking the stupid pills.

410
00:25:27,503 --> 00:25:30,903
Go away, jessica.

411
00:25:30,936 --> 00:25:32,303
I don't need you anymore.

412
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:34,836
What makes you think
this is jessica?

413
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:38,704
Remember me?

414
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,503
That summer
that you ran away to l.A.

415
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:44,737
And told everyone
to call you gina?

416
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,804
You're not real.

417
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,670
Oh, you're gonna sell cars?

418
00:25:48,704 --> 00:25:51,737
I'm going back to l.A.
To go play.

419
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,603
No, i'm in control.

420
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:58,637
If i can handle jessica,
i can handle you.

421
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,036
Then why aren't you
taking your meds?

422
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,003
[Niki banging on glass]
no!

423
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:11,869
No! No!

424
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:14,403
No!

425
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:17,170
Look, i need to see my family.

426
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:19,103
Just for a day or two.

427
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:24,303
Yes, i-I think that would be
absolutely possible.

428
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:25,737
Just not right now.

429
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,403
Why not?

430
00:26:27,437 --> 00:26:30,737
They don't even know
i'm alive.

431
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,603
Look, i could let you go,
and you could explode again.

432
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:35,503
You could blow up
half the east coast.

433
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:37,070
Okay, so dose me
with some drugs

434
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,903
And i'll be back
before they wear off.

435
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:40,036
It's perfectly safe.

436
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,836
I'm sorry, peter.

437
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,303
You're just not ready
for that yet.

438
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:44,403
Okay, so send someone
out with me.

439
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,637
Elle, maybe.

440
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,470
Uh, no.

441
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:49,537
No, no,
i'm sorry, peter.

442
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,403
Um, that's just
not gonna happen.

443
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,903
I'm never getting
out of here, am i?

444
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:06,903
Suddenly the room
starts to feel like a cage.

445
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:09,203
I don't understand.

446
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,936
If they're not gonna help us,
why are we here?

447
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:14,969
To keep us
from being out there.

448
00:27:15,003 --> 00:27:17,603
Why, because we're dangerous?

449
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:21,136
No, peter, it's because
we could save the world.

450
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:26,003
Years ago, i tried
to take my abilities public.

451
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:28,603
I thought
that if everyone knew

452
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:29,704
That my blood
had curing powers,

453
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:32,537
I could help.

454
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,437
How naive i was.

455
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,537
That's why
they put you in here.

456
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,603
Well, if it were possible
to kill me,

457
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:39,869
They would have,
i assure you.

458
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:44,103
Instead,
i'm locked up in here.

459
00:27:44,136 --> 00:27:46,836
When i could be curing
your brother.

460
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:50,303
Nathan.
How?

461
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,704
Just a small amount
of my blood

462
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,804
Could help to heal him.

463
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:58,936
End his pain.

464
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,470
Even after everything
you've put him through.

465
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:10,070
So how do we get out?

466
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:16,337

a little jolt?

it's time to try.

Not as much as i love you.

553
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:02,936
Hey!

554
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,836
Man, let it go.

555
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:06,537
We're leaving, all right?

556
00:36:33,903 --> 00:36:35,137
Can i play with it?

557
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,636
Damon, come on.
Why would you ask him that?

558
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,870
Don't be so silly.

559
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,703
You're gonna be all right,
aren't you, sugar?

560
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:49,536
I don't know.

561
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,170
I think i need
to get some help.

562
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:56,937
Anything you want,
you just gotta ask.

563
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,970
You know that, don't you?

564
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:00,536
Thank you.

565
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:27,670
I've taken care of everything.

566
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,070
Plane tickets, money.

567
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:31,003
Now this.

568
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:33,837
I'm so sorry, nathan.

569
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,170
How long
until it starts working?

570
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:45,603
We don't have time
to find out.

571
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:47,204
They're going to assume
that you'll come

572
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:48,204
To see your brother.

573
00:37:48,237 --> 00:37:49,803
This is the first place
they'll look.

574
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,436
Come on.

575
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:57,503
Adam, look, look, look!

576
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,536
(Adam)
good.

577
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,603
Come on.

578
00:38:02,636 --> 00:38:04,469
Come on.

579
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,570
(Peter)
that was incredible.

580
00:38:14,603 --> 00:38:16,837
His skin was starting to heal
right there in front of us.

581
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,503
He'll be as good as new
by the time he wakes up.

582
00:38:18,536 --> 00:38:21,103
Here, passport.
Plane ticket.

583
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:22,870
Here's the plan.

584
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:25,204
You disappointed me, peter!

585
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:28,003
And just when i thought we were
getting to know each other.

586
00:38:28,037 --> 00:38:29,670
There's a warehouse
in montreal.

587
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:31,204
121 rue saint-Jacques.

588
00:38:31,237 --> 00:38:32,570
Meet there.

589
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,937
Ugh!

590
00:38:38,937 --> 00:38:40,436
Go after him!

591
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:24,170
You take me back there,

592
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:25,736
I'm just
gonna keep escaping.

593
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,770
I'm not taking you back.

594
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:30,237
You deserve a better fate.

595
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,103
Your mother helped me
when i was in need.

596
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:35,037
So now you're helping me?

597
00:39:36,436 --> 00:39:37,970
You must start
a new life, peter.

598
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:40,503
I fear
this is the only solution.

599
00:39:40,536 --> 00:39:43,137
Your secret
is safe with me.

600
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:46,970
Go with god, my friend.

601
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,436
(Mohinder)
there are many ways
to define

602
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:17,903
Our fragile existence.

603
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:19,837
Many ways
to give it meaning.

604
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,603
But it is our memories
that shape its purpose

605
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,937
And give it context.

606
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,636
The private assortment
of images, fears,

607
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,770
Loves, regrets.

608
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,304
Thank you.

609
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:56,336
Yeah.

610
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,837
(Mohinder)
for it is the cruel irony
of life

611
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,570
That we are destined to hold
the dark with the light,

612
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:15,703
The good with the evil.

613
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:18,403
Success with disappointment.

614
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:20,536
This is what separates us,

615
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:23,369
What makes us human.

616
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:31,703
And in the end,
we must fight to hold on to.

617
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:34,336
I remember.

618
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:35,736
I remember everything.

619
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,369
Good, then.

620
00:41:38,403 --> 00:41:41,436
Shall we save the world?

621
