1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,850
a child is born to innocence.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,180
A child is drawn towards good.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,620
Why,then,do so many among
us go so horribly wrong?

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,840
Everyone on the ground now!

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,200
My name is chandra
suresh. I'm a geneticist.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,180
I have a theory about human evolution,and
I believe you are a part of it.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,480
what makes some walk a path of
darkness,while others choose the light?

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,500
Is it will? Is it destiny?

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,390
Can we ever hope to understand
the force that shapes the soul?

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,390
For thousands of years,my
people have taken spirit walks,

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,970
following destiny's path into
the realms of the unconsciousness.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,460
Ok.. 
I'm ready to begin my journey

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,760
Hiro...
Hiro..

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,860
to fight evil,one must know evil.

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,610
One must journey back through time
and find that fork in the road

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,010
hiro!!

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,770
Where heroes turn one way
And villains turn another.

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:20,460
I'd like to thank all our dear friends for
coming tonight and for helping us to celebrate.

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,040
Nathan-- the finest assistant
D.A. New york has ever known.

21
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,700
Peter,whose compassionate
heart is a gift to us all.

22
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,060
-Told you he couldn't say "nurse" out loud.
-All right.

23
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,090
But most of all,to angela...

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,460
the love of my life.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,970
-Happy anniversary.
-cheers.

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,130
that was lovely.

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,470
Let me
have a ...

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,550
All right,get a room.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,620
After 41 years of marriage,you
take it where you can get it.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,690
Congratulations,mom.
Congratulations,dad.

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,180
my king. My queen.

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,000
-Congratulations.
-Thank you,daniel.

33
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,030
Congratulations.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,260
-So,nathan,are the rumors true?
-Excuse me?

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,650
I heard your office is about to launch a
full-scale investigation into all things linderman.

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,560
-Care to comment?
-I'd shave my wrists.

37
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,030
-Handcuffs chafe.
-Come on.

38
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,180
Good one.

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,010
What do you see in there,arthur?

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,300
Trouble.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,740
Well,I'm sure I can handle the heat.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,690
It's not you I'm worried about.

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,220
If he starts investigating,he's gonna see your hand behind
every enterprise I've been working on for the past 25 years.

44
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,580
We can't have the D.A.
Digging up skeletons.

45
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,730
If you fall,I fall.

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,380
Maybe you could talk
to him one last time.

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,900
Convince him to back off.

48
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,750
When nathan digs his
teeth in,he doesn't let go.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,590
-So what do we do?
-Read your shakespeare.

50
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,290
When the son challenges the
father,only one is left standing.

51
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,910
I should have one last talk
with him. I owe him that.

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,920
What happens if that doesn't take?

53
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,840
Well,then I'll...

54
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,270
kill him.

57
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,590
and now,who's the man,yo? I'm the man.

58
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,450
I'm sorry,who'd you say? Who's the man?

59
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,910
I'm the man!

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,050
Look it at there.

61
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,670
Back door
book it!

62
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,740
-Yeah,you got it, You .. 
-flint.

63
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,360
Hey!

63
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,000
Hey,buddy!

64
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,830
Hey,kiss the floor!

65
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,380
flint, let it go!

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,720
Hey,buddy! I'm talking to you.

67
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,610
You should listen to your sister.

68
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,750
Run! Flint, come on!

69
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,730
Run!

72
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,240
My name is brian davis.

73
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,350
incredible.

74
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,590
-Can you make it go away?
-Don't worry, brian.

75
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,940
I can fix it.

76
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,130
Don't,worry brian. I can fix it.

77
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,990
Hello?

78
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,040
make it go.. ,make it go .. (echo sound)

79
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,180
Are you all right?

80
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,440
Say something.

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,330
Forgive me.

85
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,840
it's okay. Everything is gonna be okay.

87
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,450
No,it isn'T.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,250
I've done something unforgivable.

89
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,900
Everybody does bad things.

90
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,030
You think I haven't felt exactly
how you're feeling right now?

91
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,710
Maybe if you talk about it.
Sometimes when you talk about it..

92
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,300
I can't.

93
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,550
A man had something that I wanted, but..
I took it at a terrible price.

94
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,710
I know it seems hard to imagine,
but you're gonna get through this,

95
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,140
because you're not a bad person.

96
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,880
You don't even know anything about me.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,660
I know what I see. 
A man who deserves a second chance.

98
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,590
The rope broke.

99
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,660
You can't tell me that's not a sign.

100
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,190
I don't even know your name.

101
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,810
Elle.

102
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,710
Elle.

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,490
Well,look at you,elle,just
showing up out of nowhere,

104
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,960
like an angel.

105
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,580
An angel with a broken watch.

106
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,360
Cute meet.

107
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,040
I still don't understand why we don't just
bag and tag this guy like the rest of them.

108
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,410
For years,scientists were stumped
by the mystery of whale migration.

109
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,540
Such a big ocean. 
How do they find each other?

110
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:25,320
And then one night in the frozen pacific, some
enterprising biologist recorded their song in the wild.

111
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,430
They don't sing in captivity.

112
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,450
So we've got to get the whale to sing.

113
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,430
Mr. Gray can do, is extraordinary.

114
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,850
The ability to transfer power from one
vessel to another is extremely rare.

115
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,180
Yeah,but how do I get him to do it?

116
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,930
Pie.

117
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,390
nine group homes in seven years.

118
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,500
Four of them burned to the
ground. There's a shocker.

119
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,630
What's the deal?

120
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,690
I mean,isn't that why we're
here,so you can offer me a deal?

121
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,590
You have a gift,meredith,and
with gift comes opportunity.

122
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,490
The company would like to
train you to become an agent.

123
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,040
It won't be easy. It'll
demand a lot of hard work.

124
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,160
Me,an agent? I don't think so.

125
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,710
Why do you hate the company so much?

126
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
I have my reasons.

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,240
And I would ask you...

128
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,540
to put those reasons aside and
make the sensible decision. That...

129
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,000
or spend the rest of your
life in an asbestos-lined cell.

130
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,760
One condition...

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,150
promise me the company
won't go after my brother.

132
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,910
You're not in a strong negotiating
position here,so what will it be?

133
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,810
agent, or prisoner?

134
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,300
When do I start?

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,680
arthur?

136
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,960
You look spectacular.

137
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,210
I wish you would reconsider.

138
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,130
He can barely fit a dozen
people in that shoe box anyway.

139
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,980
-Arthur,it's his graduation party.
-Yeah,from nursing school.

140
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,290
Be patient with him.

141
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,310
When his powers manifest,peter
will become a great man.

142
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,390
Tell him I'm sorry I couldn't get there.

143
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,340
Hey,there.

144
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,920
-Sorry, just stop by to
see if.. I tried.He won't.

145
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,560
Nathan,while you're here...

146
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,250
I really wish you'd reconsider handing
off the linderman case to another A.D.A.

147
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,460
Come on,dad,we've talked about this.

148
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm not asking as a lawyer.
I'm asking as a father.

149
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,690
I'm concerned about the pressure that your
prosecuting my client will put on this family.

150
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,560
Don't be.

151
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,310
Linderman's toxic to this family,dad.

152
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,920
Nothing would make me happier than to bury
him in a very deep hole for a very long time.

153
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,250
What?

154
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,200
You look good in a suit,nathan.

156
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,750
What does this guy want?

157
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,500
-Nathan!
-Heidi!

158
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,520
Heidi!

159
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,720
-Nathan! Thank god!
-Is he all right?

160
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,310
-Don't even talk to me,dad.
-Nathan.

161
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,440
You think I don't know who did this?

162
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,640
It was linderman's guys
that ran me off the road.

163
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,810
Are you sure?

164
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,790
That's it,dad? That's the
best you got! am I sure?

165
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
You invite that man into our home.

166
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,250
-He tried to kill me,dad!
-Come on,stop.

167
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,040
-Heidi will never walk again!
-Stop! Stop!

168
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,320
-Just stop.
-Okay.

169
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,110
Heidi...it's her spine.
She broke her back.

170
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,090
-Oh,god! Oh,no!
-Mom!

171
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,620
She just woke up,and she's
asking for you. Come on.

172
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,460
I'm gonna hurt that man.

173
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,990
And when I do,if you're standing
next to him,you're gonna get hurt too.

173
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,070
come on.

174
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,090
You might want to choose a side,dad.

175
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,550
- your client or your family.
-Nathan.

176
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,660
Any word?

177
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,440
I spoke with the neurologist.

178
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,190
Her spine is broken in three
places. It doesn't look good.

179
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,770
Arthur...

180
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,300
what nathan said about linderman...

181
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,250
you can't be serious. Come on,angela.

182
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,690
Linderman wouldn't dare
go after nathan on his own.

183
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,380
No,he wouldn't.

184
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,460
What are you asking? Am
i trying to kill my son?

185
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,530
Nathan's an assistant D.A.

186
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,520
It could've been any one of 100
indicted criminals driving that van.

187
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,970
-I will not have this conversation.
-No,I know. You're right.

188
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,870
But I need to hear you say it,arthur.

189
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,540
Did you order linderman to kill nathan?

190
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,840
No!

191
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,520
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,370
I'm sorry. I love you,arthur.

193
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,340
I love you too.

196
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,050
There's our man.

197
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,580
-You want me to light him up?
-Negative.

198
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,270
This is strictly a training mission.
You're gonna watch and learn.

199
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,450
No powers,unless I give the order.

200
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,150
Danny pine?

201
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,100
-Who wants to know?
-Jim farrell with the V.A.

202
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,630
I just need a minute of your time,pal.

203
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,580
My partner and i are trying to transition some of
the homeless vets out here into affordable housing.

204
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,150
We feel it's a crime the way this
country's turned its back on you guys.

205
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,350
Yeah,what happened to scofield?

206
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,110
Scofield?

207
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,050
-The V.A. Represent you, last week?
-Right.

208
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh,yeah,he was reassigned to dallas.

209
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,860
-Uh,farrell and I were the new team now.
-that's the story.

210
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,200
Welcome to the company.

213
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,130
Hi. Do you like pie?

214
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh,that rhymed,didn't it?

215
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,480
Come on in.

216
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,930
really, really glad you came elle.
I wasn't sure you would.

217
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,710
I have been thinking about you and wondering how you've been since..

218
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,640
Oh,better. Great,actually,um...

219
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,150
thanks to you.

220
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:41,420
I just decided to clean up this place, and all
this clutter was filling my head with bad thoughts.

221
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,760
What's this?

222
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,490
Oh,that's just,um...

223
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,700
it's just a list of people like me.

224
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,190
Nice,single guys like you?

225
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,140
Maybe I should take this list.

226
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,580
Oh,no,no...

227
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,050
um,I'm sorry,elle. There's...

228
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,050
there's something you
should know about me.

229
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:14,240
I have a kind of a power. Um.. an
ability that's out of the ordinary.

230
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,640
I don't understand.

231
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,290
Oh,my god.

232
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,640
And the other people on the
list they can do things too.

233
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,560
W-- wait. There are others?

234
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,740
-What kind of pie did you bring?
-Peach.

235
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,800
That's my favorite kind.

236
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,550
Good work,meredith.
You were born for this.

237
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,070
-Yeah,so that's it? I'm an agent now?
-Not quite.

238
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,560
Getting scum off the street,that's the
easy part. The real test is loyalty.

239
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,750
You're not gonna always agree with
the decisions the company makes,

240
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,830
but when you prove you can follow orders no questions
asked, that's when we'll call you "agent gordon"

241
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,120
Put him in cell nine.

242
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,590
Come on.

243
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,900
meredith?

244
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,120
Flint?

245
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,530
I thought you got away.

246
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,360
Yeah,well,an invisible man
tackled me in the alley.

247
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,940
What,are they gonna
make you an agent also?

248
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,130
What?

249
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,660
What do.. what do you mean also?
What did they tell you?

250
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,320
They're gonna train me,mer.

251
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,970
I'm gonna get to wear one of
them,uh,suits and everything.

252
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,890
Oh,flint.

253
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,510
This is gonna be great,mer.

254
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,590
It's gonna be you and
me,working together.

255
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,000
Is there a problem?

256
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,840
-No,sir.
-Good.

257
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,930
No problem at all.

258
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,180
This is bag and tag,baby,bag and tag!

259
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,460
I can't believe you can just
lift your finger and move things.

260
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,120
-It must feel amazing.
-It does.

261
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,730
But it can be overwhelming too...

262
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,700
like a drug that you
can't get enough of it.

263
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,150
How many others are there like you?

264
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,410
With abilities? I don't know.

265
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,680
To be honest,I don't want to know.

266
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,700
I have a kind of problem.

267
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,020
I guess you could say
I'm like an addict.

268
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,870
I have this overwhelming hunger to...

269
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,080
um,I covet the powers of others.

270
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,580
But somehow,since the other day,since...

271
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,040
since meeting you...

272
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,180
I feel like maybe I don't
have to be so special.

273
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,010
Maybe I can just be gabriel again.

274
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,160
But you are special,gabriel.

275
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,460
You're special just the way you are.

276
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,230
Special just the way you are.

277
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,910
I was afraid you were
about to burst into song.

278
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,050
I was just trying to win his trust.

279
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,150
Yeah,well,we're stalling out here.
We need to kick it into high gear.

280
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,320
I don't think he's gonna kill again.

281
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,340
I really think we should look
into someone else on this list.

282
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,670
No,we're sticking with the plan.

283
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,430
Mr. Gray is a killer. We know that.

284
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,540
The only question, is will we witness the
act,or will he do it in a dark alley somewhere?

285
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,800
But what if you're wrong? What if
his suicide attempt was a wake-up call?

286
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,950
You like this guy.

287
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,540
isn't that adorable? You
think he's sweet,is that it?

1
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,040
What about this one? trevor zeitlan?

2
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,930
I'm not gonna do it.

3
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,700
We need to see him kill.

4
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,450
I am not going to do it.

5
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,010
All right,if that's how you feel.

6
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,320
Here,go ahead.

7
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,770
Go on.

8
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,380
New york city, you could...
I don't know,become a waitress?

9
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,680
We have orders,elle.

10
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,630
You don't follow orders,you're not an agent.

11
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,620
You're not an agent,you're on your own.

12
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,930
Your father has been training you for this since you were four years old.

13
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,640
Come on.

14
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,350
Let's introduce Mr. Zeitlan to Mr. Gray.

15
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,410
I'm sorry,arthur.

16
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,210
I don't know how he survived that crash.

17
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,110
You know how badly you screwed this up?

18
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,660
Now nathan's out for blood.

19
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,170
Look,maybe we should rethink this.

20
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,220
I mean,a second attempt is bound to look suspicious,

21
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,870
and who knows how angela's gonna react?

22
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,160
What do you suggest? We abort?

23
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,460
No,no.Not abort,no.

24
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,220
Postpone.

25
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,770
You're not thinking this through.

26
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,830
The plan for new york has been years in the making.

27
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,980
Do we postpone that,too?

28
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,110
No,no,not necessarily.

29
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,320
I don't know,daniel.

30
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,830
Sometimes I worry you're outliving your usefulness.

31
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,140
You're right,arthur.

32
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,060
We should finish this.

33
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,880
I know a guy in montreal.

34
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,850
He worked for me in vegas.

35
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,910
He is good.

36
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,250
Now,I can fly him down tonight.

37
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,290
Angela.

38
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,770
Angela!

39
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,650
Angela!

40
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,590
It has to be done,angela.

41
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,810
Arthur, don't.

42
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,040
You know I'm right.

43
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,860
It has to be done.

44
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,070
He's my baby.

45
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,200
Say it,angela.

46
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,580
My baby.

47
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,730
Nathan has to die.

48
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,220
It has to be done.

49
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,200
Nathan has to die.

50
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,960
Nathan has to die.

52
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,460
Hiro.

53
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,090
Hiro!

55
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,730
Hiro,wake up.

56
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,260
no,don't wake him.

57
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,700
Why?

58
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,680
What's happening?

59
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,830
He's trapped between this world and the next.

60
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,180
If he wakes now,he could be stuck like this forever.

61
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,540
What? We have to do something.

62
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,160
Here...

63
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,100
mix.

64
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,050
Something has disturbed his dream time.

65
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,750
Part of him wants to wake,but his spirit walk is not complete.

66
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,680
Careful not to inhal the fumes.

67
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,790
It's working.

68
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,920
Yes.

69
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,910
Put your shoes on!

70
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,710
What?

71
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,300
What's going on?

72
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,210
There's a train yard a half mile from here.

73
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,330
We can catch a freight straight on into houston.

74
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,370
What are you talking about?

75
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,570
What about us being agents?

76
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,210
Now,these.. these people been nice to me.

77
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,290
They're tricking you because you're dumb.

78
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,360
You remember what daddy used to say?

79
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,040
god gave you a big sister instead of a brain.

80
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,200
Put your shoes on.

81
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,680
Now!

82
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,980
once we reach houston,we'll head straight on into mexico,

83
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,330
fly under the radar for a little while.

84
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,100
Maybe we'll work in a little cantina.

85
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,620
Mexico sounds good.

86
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,230
Flint.

87
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,470
Flint,you got to understand something.

88
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,210
You can't ever trust the company.

89
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,370
They will lie to you.They'll lock you up or worse.

90
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,290
You hear me,flint?

91
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,570
You got to promise me that you'll never,ever.. 

92
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,160
You killed her!

93
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,850
That's right,genius.I killed her.

94
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,430
Now I'm gonna kill you.

95
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,400
flint,look out!

96
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,950
Son of a bitch.

97
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,620
You were following me,huh?

98
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,900
Why do you have to screw this up?

99
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,640
Oh,come on,flint,an agent?

100
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,000
We could've given him a purpose!

101
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,590
Now--now he's our sworn enemy.

102
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,180
So am I!

103
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,220
That smells good.

104
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,810
Almost as good as my pot pies.

105
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,740
Daniel,I think arthur's downtown.

106
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,710
Yes,he is.

107
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,440
What's on your mind?

108
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,460
The question is,angela,what isn't on yours.

109
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,400
Look here...

110
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,770
it wasn't an easy decision to come,but believe it or not,

111
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,690
I still have a shred of morality left in me somewhere.

112
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,850
I can no longer stand by and watch him destroy you like this.

113
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,490
I have no idea what you're talking about.

114
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,040
I know he's working on a project.

115
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,620
I don't remember the,uh,details right now,

116
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,570
but I'm sure it has to be done.

117
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,730
I can't push a thought into your head,angela,

118
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,020
but I can heal the scars.

119
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,210
What scars? 

120
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,730
From all the times he's forced his thoughts,

121
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,230
erased your memories.

122
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,030
Each time leaves its mark, a trace of damaged tissue.

123
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,670
I don't believe you.Arthur would never do that to me.

124
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,370
Arthur is betraying you in the most heinous way possible.

125
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,380
How dare you?

126
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,550
He's gonna kill your son.

127
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,020
You're a liar.

128
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,890
I can heal the scars,angela,but you have to decide.

129
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,880
Do you want to live in blind obedience?

130
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,750
Or do you want to know the truth?

131
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,530
Nathan!

132
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,730
So you never answered my question.

133
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,360
Why do you hate the company so much?

134
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,660
'Cause they killed my baby girl.

135
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,400
It was 14 years ago.

136
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,760
They caught up with me in this little village off the panhandle.

137
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,780
They stormed in at night.

138
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,930
There was a firefight.

139
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,540
Place went up like kindling.

140
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,730
And my little girl,claire,she was killed in the fire.

141
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,880
Claire.

142
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
That's what they told you, she died in a fire.

143
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,550
What is that supposed to mean?

144
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,670
Go!

145
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,800
Go on before I change my mind.

146
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,120
What?

147
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,610
Think of it as a get-out-of-jail-free card for your little girl.

148
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,840
Go!

149
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,990
Help!

150
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,720
This ziti smells terrific.

151
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,460
can't wait.

152
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,930
Hey,have you ever been to that little theater down the street?

153
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:19,760
I saw that they had some sort of artsy spoken-word thing there tonight.

154
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,820
Maybe we should stop by later.

155
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,770
Hmm,maybe we should.

156
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,020
Oh,I invited someone to join us.

157
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,150
I hope you don't mind.

158
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,820
It's open!

159
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,860
Yeah,um,I'm trevor.

160
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,650
We spoke on the phone.

161
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,930
I'm elle.

162
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:40,590
And,um,this is gabriel.

163
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,960
I thought you two should meet.

164
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,800
Trevor has an ability,too.

165
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,160
An ability. I don't understand.

166
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,430
Don't be mad,but I got trevor's number off that list you had.

167
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,950
I really think it's important for you to get to know people like yourself.

168
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,100
I mean...

169
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,030
alcoholics can't do it alone.

170
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,550
Trevor,why don't you show us what you can do?

171
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,830
Okay.

172
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,930
That is so cool.

173
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,340
Gabriel?

174
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,290
Isn't that special?

175
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,010
Wait here.

176
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,700
I have a great idea.

177
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,440
Soup is delicious.

178
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,920
Italian lentil. your mother's recipe.

179
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,750
Something on your mind?

180
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,800
What's the matter,arthur?

181
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,360
You can't see inside it?

182
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,030
You just seem...

183
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,270
far away.

184
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,940
I just wonder sometimes if,without your power,you'd...

185
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,940
know me at all anymore.

186
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,690
Indigestion?

187
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,430
So what do you think,arthur?

188
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,360
Do you still know me?

189
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,350
Can you tell anything about me just by looking in my eyes?

190
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,560
You're my wife,angela.

191
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,190
I know you like I know my own heart.

192
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,650
Really?

193
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,180
So what am I gonna do now?

194
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,860
Am I gonna kiss you,or am I gonna kill you?

195
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,560
I love that.

196
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,460
Don't you love that?

197
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,390
That's great.

198
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,580
It's so special.

199
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,900
Let's see it again.

200
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,800
You think he's so special?

201
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,870
I bet he can't do this.

202
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,820
Gabriel.

203
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:21,080
I think you need to leave,now.

204
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,490
Gabriel,don't!

205
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,020
Please...

206
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,560
how did you..? 

207
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,120
you don't have to do this.

208
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,740
Who are you?

209
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,600
Get out.

210
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,070
We can't do this.

211
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,520
Bennet,we have to make him stop!

212
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,730
This is incredible.

213
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,460
He actually exposes the brain.

214
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,410
Oh,my god.

215
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,560
Our son,arthur,our own son.

216
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,790
There are larger issues at stake,angela.

217
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,030
You can't let sentimentality derail everything

218
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,610
that we've worked so hard for.

219
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,060
I'm sentimental because I don't want to murder our son?

220
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,470
We were gonna rebuild the world.

221
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,800
You were a great man,arthur.

222
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,420
You were a visionary,but somewhere along the line,

223
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,850
you lost your soul.

224
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,640
And I make no apology.

225
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,730
I lied.

226
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,600
It's not your mother's recipe.

227
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,860
Use the incinerator on level three.

228
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,170
Use my pass card to grant you access.

229
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,650
Should anyone ask,he's a casualty of a field op.

230
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,990
ma?

231
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,620
Nathan.

232
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,760
Anybody home?

233
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,230
Ma? 

234
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,570
Dad!

235
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,210
Oh,my god.

236
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,500
I think he's had a heart attack.

237
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,280
Is he...

238
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,440
He's still breathing.

239
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,160
He's still alive.

240
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,920
We're wrapped here. just one more loose end.

241
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,510
No,no,not that thing. the other thing.

242
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,050
Okay,I'll let you know.

243
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,050
Don't beat yourself up.

244
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,750
We've done invaluable work here.

245
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,810
Those tapes will be studied and analyzed.

246
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,080
We created a monster.

247
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,090
We set him loose on the world.

248
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,220
I wouldn't worry too much about that.

249
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,260
I get the feeling that we'll be tracking down Mr. Gray again soon.

250
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,020
That's not the point!

251
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,660
He had a soul,bennet.

252
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,020
He could've been saved.

253
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,190
We're not missionaries.

254
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,490
If they had wanted us to bring him in,that would've been the assignment.

255
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,330
It wasn't.

256
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,190
We follow orders,elle.

257
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,730
We're agents.

258
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,930
That's what we do.

259
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,940
Now excuse me.

260
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,060
My ride is here.

261
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,490
Where to,my friend?

262
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,060
Jfk,please.

263
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,350
we should call peter.

264
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,910
Maybe we should wait.

265
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,570
Until what?

266
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,260
Until we have something to tell him.

267
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,330
I'm sorry.He's gone.

268
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:04,210
He suffered a massive coronary,brought on by anterior myocardial infarction.

269
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,830
There was-- there was nothing we could do.

270
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,430
Heart attack?

271
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,200
I'd like a cremation as soon as possible.

272
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,120
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

273
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,070
We can deal with the paperwork in the morning.

274
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,050
I can't believe it.

275
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,390
He's dead.

276
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,990
It's done.

277
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,130
Yes.

278
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,560
Oh, I understand.

279
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,550
She wants a cremation.

280
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,030
I can procure another body,of course.

281
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,810
I'm afraid the poison caused irreversible damage to the peripheral nervous system.

282
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:06,760
The paralysis will likely be permanent.

283
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,320
I'm sorry.

284
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,440
He's with izzy now.

285
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,630
Izzy.

286
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,090
Thank you.

287
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,170
Izzy.

288
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,640
He hated that dog.

289
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,160
Of course.

290
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,960
It was the only living thing he met that ever disobeyed him.

291
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,240
You remember we would sit with dad out here when we were kids,

292
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,730
Watch as he buried her bones.

293
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,760
Yeah.

294
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,230
Yeah,I can't believe he's gone.

295
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,810
Let's not idolize your father because he's dead.

296
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,310
He wasn't a god.

297
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,780
He was a man...

298
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,690
deeply flawed in ways you will never know.

301
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,300
Hiro.

309
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,950
No!

310
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,990
I understand you've been dreaming about me.

311
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,070
Hiro!
