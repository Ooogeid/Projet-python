Heroes...

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,491
- What happened?
- You tried to kill yourself.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,701
I jumped, and...
you flew up and you caught me.

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,832
You jumped. 25 feet to a fire escape.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,219
I climbed up and carried you down.
That's what happened.

6
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:15,182
The rest is just crazy talk.
You understand?

7
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:19,928
I spoke to a very nice woman
at the adoption agency.

8
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:23,439
And she said they were going to try
to get in touch with your birth parents.

9
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:26,188
But you can't protect me forever.

10
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:28,734
I know. And it breaks my heart.

11
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,084
I love you, Dad.

12
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,808
<i>This is Claire Bennett.
That was attempt number six.</i>

13
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,964
It really does break my heart.

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,320
<i>Please don't hurt me.</i>

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,191
<i>Please don't--
Please don't hurt me.</i>

16
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:46,754
You are not supposed to be in here.

17
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,814
I didn't kill these people. Sylar did.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,714
- You're under arrest.
- What?

19
00:00:58,212 --> 00:00:59,467
Nice to meet you.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,260
I love New York!

21
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,431
Mr. Isaac Mendez?

22
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:22,016
Freeze!

23
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:23,471
We got a live one here.

24
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:26,906
No English, no passport,
no American money, no I.D.

25
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:28,410
How long ago did he do this?

26
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:30,618
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.

27
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:34,448
- October 2?
- October 2? No, pal.

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,801
Today,

29
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:38,345
November 8th.

30
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,478
1x03 - One Giant Leap

31
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:25,098
<i>When evolution selects its agents,</i>

32
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,460
<i>it does so at a cost.</i>

33
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:29,820
<i>It makes demands
in exchange for singularity.</i>

34
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,929
<i>And you may be asked
to do something</i>

35
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:33,634
<i>against your very nature.</i>

36
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:59,236
<i>Suddenly, the change in your life
that should have been wonderful,</i>

37
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:00,776
<i>comes as a betrayal.</i>

38
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:07,801
<i>It may seem cruel,</i>

39
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,871
<i>but the goal is nothing short
of self-preservation.</i>

40
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:13,280
<i>Survival.</i>

41
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:25,978
So, if our team wins,
there'll be a celebratory bonfire,

42
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,515
where I need to represent.

43
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,834
So it might be, like, midnight-ish.

44
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:31,203
On a school night?

45
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:33,143
A celebratory school night.

46
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:39,868
- So, is that the quarterback?
- Who?

47
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:42,589
The boy that you like, right over there.

48
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:44,679
I don't like him.

49
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,228
I mean, he's a very nice boy, but--

50
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:50,100
Yes, he's the quarterback.

51
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,174
If you really wanted to make me happy,
you'd only date nerds, you know.

52
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:55,644
Well, it worked out very well
for your mother.

53
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:58,267
I love your glasses, Mr. Bennet.

54
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,100
Thank you, Jackie.

55
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:02,196
Rumor has it you're a local hero.

56
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:03,980
Pulled a man out of a burning train car.

57
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:05,366
You heard about that?

58
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,690
O.M.G., does everybody know?

59
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:08,552
It was on the news.

60
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,491
You told half the school
to set their TiVos.

61
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,737
It's going to be the cornerstone
of my campaign for class president.

62
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,738
I'm running on a platform
of moral, mental,

63
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:18,031
and social advancement
through good deeds.

64
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:19,871
What do you think?

65
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,481
I think I need to get something out
of my locker.

66
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:32,888
Claire.

67
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,591
Be careful. Okay?

68
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,739
Suddently, I'm in New York!
Five weeks in the future!

69
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:56,880
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

70
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,003
Will you come with me?

71
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:03,343
We have to go right now!

72
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:06,575
A girl's life depends on us!

73
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:22,896
It'll work. We'll have
the fundraiser here, not the ballroom.

74
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:25,155
- Makes me look fiscally responsible.
- Yes, it does.

75
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:26,898
Pete, just the man I want to see.

76
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:29,516
- I need to talk to you.
- What do you think? Red or blue?

77
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:30,963
I don't know. Blue?

78
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:33,600
I'm gonna go red.

79
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:34,949
The president wears red.

80
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:36,893
So you gonna come
and break out the suit,

81
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,428
- have a couple of drinks?
- Yeah.

82
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,109
Rebuff the advances of my cute interns?

83
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:41,420
Yeah, I'm gonna be there.

84
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,534
Listen, I tried it again.

85
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Tried what?

86
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:46,816
What do you mean what?
What do you think that I mean?

87
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,136
I tried to fly.

88
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,501
Would you keep your voice down?

89
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,475
You were there. Last night I could fly.

90
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:53,794
This morning, nothing.

91
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:55,125
I nearly broke my neck trying.

92
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,079
Well, it would have solved
one of our problems.

93
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:58,412
So I went to the library to see

94
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:00,201
if I could find
anything on human flight.

95
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,267
I came across this amazing book.

96
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,329
Listen to this.

97
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:05,934
"Genes determine obesity,"

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,644
"blood pressure.
Out of the 30 billion possibilities,"

99
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,100
"one might contain the potential
for human flight."

100
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:12,640
This guy knows what's going on.

101
00:08:13,301 --> 00:08:14,430
Chandra Suresh.

102
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:16,039
He's a genetics professor in India.

103
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:17,212
I called.

104
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,434
They said that he quit six months ago.

105
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,501
They think he's here in New York.

106
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,606
We gotta find this guy.

107
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:24,600
- We've got a more immediate problem.
- What?

108
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,221
It's this woman reporter.

109
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,369
She's poking around into
why you jumped off the roof.

110
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,604
Look, Nathan, we flew.

111
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:31,237
Aren't you curious how this happened?

112
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:33,525
Yeah, I mean, I want answers,
just like everyone else.

113
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:35,359
I mean, just like you?
But right now, today,

114
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,288
I'm trying to find a way
to put a spin on this

115
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:39,037
so my family doesn't look like nutties.

116
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:40,871
I need to find
why this is happening to me.

117
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,665
- To us.
- Responsibilities, Pete, okay?

118
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:45,328
I've got an election to win
and a family to feed, okay?

119
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:46,732
You are so...

120
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:48,604
What do you want to tell that reporter?

121
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:50,524
I know one thing we can't tell her.

122
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:52,225
The truth.

123
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:10,746
Sorry.

124
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,854
I still have your dad's keys.

125
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,093
Maybe I shouldn't.

126
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,486
Sorry.

127
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,934
After being attacked,
every noise I hear...

128
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,069
Sorry.

129
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,175
Well, this is macaroni and cheese.

130
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,034
It's what Americans eat

131
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,262
when they want to commit suicide slowly.

132
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,942
Your dad said mine
was the best he ever had,

133
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,700
but he was from India, so...

134
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:34,817
Thank you. You're very kind.

135
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:36,942
You look like hell.

136
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,775
When was the last time you slept?

137
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,067
All this work.

138
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:42,633
I'm no closer to understanding

139
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,982
my father's research.

140
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,508
Well, what about the program
on your dad's computer?

141
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:48,302
Didn't you say he cracked some code?

142
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,853
I thought he had. But the algorithm...

143
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,589
It's gibberish.

144
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:54,788
Know anybody who speaks gibberish?

145
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,034
The man with the horned-rim glasses.

146
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,877
He chased me around the world...

147
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,826
Madras, Manhattan, this very apartment...

148
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:06,003
looking for it.

149
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:07,566
But this isn't anything.

150
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,234
Well, then, why would he build it?

151
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:11,155
Why?

152
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,216
It was always this way with my father.

153
00:10:13,368 --> 00:10:15,334
Every question met
with another question.

154
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:17,351
Never an answer. Only "why?"

155
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,432
Even after he's dead.

156
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:21,716
Well, what about the map?

157
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:23,295
The map.

158
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,691
The map is nothing until I can decipher
the principle behind it.

159
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:28,864
You know,
if I could find even one such person,

160
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:31,044
it would validate
everything he believed.

161
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:33,625
But I can't.

162
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,034
Your father had a lot of faith in you.

163
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,454
My father only cared
about proving he was right.

164
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,934
He left his country, his family,

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,414
chasing this insanity.

166
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:46,404
And now I'm wasting my life
trying to prove him sane.

167
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:48,208
Where did it get me?

168
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:50,679
Mohinder!

169
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:55,351
I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.

170
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,872
"Sylar."

171
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:19,751
What is it?

172
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:22,688
Yet another question.

173
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,694
I don't know how else to explain this.

174
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,353
I heard a little girl call for help.

175
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,467
I went to her. That's all that happened.

176
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:37,311
So you just waltzed right in,

177
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:39,076
found a kid hiding in a wall,

178
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,947
then pulled
the name Sylar out of your ass,

179
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:42,780
when only a handful
of us know that name.

180
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:43,967
It's like...

181
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,618
It was like someone was talking to me.

182
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,101
Except it was in my head.

183
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,191
Did the voices tell you anything else?

184
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,127
They want you to do things?

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,767
Rob a store, kill the president?

186
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:56,656
No.

187
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,584
It's more like I can...

188
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,788
hear people's thoughts.

189
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:04,302
Or something. I don't know.

190
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,283
Can you tell me what I'm thinking?

191
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:13,234
No, I really can't control this.

192
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:14,976
It just sort of happens.

193
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:17,311
Give it a shot, Carnac. I'm wide open.

194
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:20,961
You think I'm nuts.

195
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:22,800
Or stupid.

196
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,003
Great trick.

197
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,623
Stop wasting my time.

198
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:32,125
<i>Come on, Parkman,</i>

199
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,630
<i>I need this more than you do.</i>

200
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:35,340
<i>Nobody believes in me.</i>

201
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,067
Nobody believes in you.

202
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,592
I know what that's like.

203
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:51,434
How much longer do I have to be in here?

204
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:53,715
Depends.

205
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:58,317
How'd you like to work with the FBI?

206
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:08,067
Claire.

207
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,234
What are you doing running off
to an away game?

208
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:13,486
That tape with all your attempts
at bodily harm is still missing.

209
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,798
Yeah, well if someone finds it,

210
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:16,922
we'll just tell 'em you'rev
some visual effects geek

211
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,134
who did it with his computer.

212
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,307
Now, can I get back to my life, please?

213
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:21,637
So that's it?

214
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,293
You're just gonna go
pump your pom-poms,

215
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:25,955
and pretend you're no different
than any other girl on the squad?

216
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,117
Yes, actually.

217
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:28,600
But you are, Claire.

218
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,700
You are different. Don't you see that?

219
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,545
Don't you see that none of this matters?

220
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:34,131
School spirit doesn't matter.

221
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:36,267
Being a pretty blonde cheerleader

222
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:37,675
doesn't matter.

223
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,213
It's not who you are anymore.

224
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:40,745
Who am I?

225
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,058
So what,
I can crawl through a wood chipper,

226
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,267
and live to tell about it.

227
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,404
That narrows my choices in life

228
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:48,562
to freak or guinea pig.

229
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:50,067
In most cases, both.

230
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:53,096
What's wrong with wanting to be normal?

231
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,034
You should try it.

232
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:09,317
What are you doing here?

233
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,348
The door was open.

234
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:15,468
Isaac, you have to get back to work.

235
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:16,761
Your editor...

236
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:18,134
The comic book is late.

237
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:19,836
You were taking them, weren't you?

238
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:21,839
Yes, I'm going
to sell them in my gallery.

239
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:24,609
And with the money, we can get you
straightened out into rehab

240
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:27,327
I'm not going into rehab.

241
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,340
I found all your junk.

242
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:32,154
The drugs, all of it.

243
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,867
I flushed everything.

244
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:36,778
- How am I supposed to paint the future?
- Nobody can paint the future.

245
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,012
That's the drugs talking.

246
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,947
Look around you at all these paintings!

247
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,367
Every one of them has come true.

248
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,384
And does that include
this big one on the floor

249
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,711
of New York going nuclear?

250
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:49,106
Yes.

251
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:53,052
I don't know how,
I don't know when, but...

252
00:14:55,058 --> 00:14:56,501
I have to stop it.

253
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:04,233
I don't want to lose you, Simone.

254
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:07,858
But if you don't believe in me,

255
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,531
then you shouldn't be here.

256
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:17,932
Fine.

257
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,445
You think you can paint the future.

258
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:23,404
Paint one without me in it.

259
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:34,267
Hello?

260
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,298
I can't understand a word you're saying.

261
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:41,134
Stop calling me here.
You've got the wrong number.

262
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:42,447
Wrong number.

263
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,973
- Hi.
- Hi.

264
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:24,676
- How'd you sleep?
- Good.

265
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,893
Where are we?

266
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,277
On our way to Grandma's house.

267
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:46,761
Micah!

268
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,008
Grandma!

269
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:52,107
You've grown.

270
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:53,380
You always say that.

271
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:54,940
- I do.
- Yes, you do.

272
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:56,974
Why don't you go on inside?

273
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,146
You look thin.

274
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:06,800
Look, I know what it's like
to raise a boy on your own.

275
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,134
To be stretched so far,

276
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:09,974
you wish you could be
in two places at once.

277
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,054
I get it.

278
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,301
But that boy needs more
than you've been giving him.

279
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,662
He needs a steady hand
and a stable environment.

280
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,015
I can give him that.

281
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,886
Why, because D.L. grew up
to be such a model citizen?

282
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:25,301
My son, your husband,

283
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,451
is a good man.

284
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:31,533
You recognize this?

285
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,224
I found it in the desert.

286
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:35,661
What's that supposed to be?

287
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:39,734
This belonged to one of the men
that your son murdered.

288
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:42,431
I took it out of the grave.

289
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,167
You know that
all of D.L.'s crew wore these.

290
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:47,977
D.L. wouldn't murder anybody.

291
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:50,437
- Ever.
- Wrong.

292
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:52,745
He robbed Linderman
and got away with $2 million,

293
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:54,172
and then he killed his crew.

294
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:56,008
My son was framed.

295
00:19:56,741 --> 00:20:00,034
And he'd be rotting in some prison
if he hadn't escaped.

296
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:03,818
Besides, if D.L. had $2 million...

297
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:06,694
honey, he'd be on some
tropical island someplace,

298
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:09,404
sitting out his years, with Micah.

299
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:14,643
I want you out of my son's life.

300
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:17,058
Yeah, well,
people in hell want ice water.

301
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,847
It doesn't mean they're going to get it.

302
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:22,069
Paulette, you have no idea
what I am capable of.

303
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,597
You want to tell me why I'm still here,
or am I just gonna follow you around?

304
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,753
I need you to talk to her.
Find out what she knows.

305
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,600
- Talk to who?
- Molly Walker.

306
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:41,934
The little girl you found.

307
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:45,032
We're keeping her here, where it's safe,
until we find what to do with her.

308
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:46,238
She went through hell.

309
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:48,084
Both parents murdered
right in front of her.

310
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:49,689
She hasn't talked
since she's arrived.

311
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,029
What makes you think
she's gonna talk to me?

312
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:53,445
Well, if you're really a mind reader,
she won't need to.

313
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,201
Who is this Sylar? What's he doing?

314
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:59,167
We've pieced a trail
across a dozen states.

315
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,430
All people impaled by household objects.

316
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:02,634
Bones broken.

317
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:05,299
All without any traceable sign
of physical contact.

318
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:07,234
But only some of them
involve any mutilation

319
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,567
of the head or neck,
so they don't see the connections.

320
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:11,025
You think it's all him.

321
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,880
I think it's gonna get a lot worse
if someone doesn't go after him.

322
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:17,437
Mr. Sylar? Hello?

323
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:24,101
What are you actually gonna do
if Sylar's in there?

324
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:27,151
If Sylar killed my father,
I need to know why.

325
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,406
I suppose that would have been too easy.

326
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:33,580
Let's go.

327
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,667
No, all the answers
could be behind this door.

328
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:38,784
It's locked, and I'm kinda trying
not to freak out now.

329
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,984
So can we please just go?

330
00:21:42,772 --> 00:21:44,431
Or we could just break in.

331
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,734
A little light reading before bed.

332
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,074
Oh, my God.

333
00:22:58,945 --> 00:22:59,949
That map,

334
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:02,730
those strings--
It's exactly like your father's.

335
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:05,194
Not exactly. This map has more of them.

336
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:06,627
Dozens more.

337
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:12,235
I know that guy.
He's running for Congress.

338
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:15,477
His life may be in danger.

339
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:18,314
Okay, can we please go now?

340
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,343
- Not yet.
- Mohinder...

341
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,993
Dear God.

342
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:37,265
What was my father involved with?

343
00:23:43,077 --> 00:23:45,302
We're keeping her
in a safe room down here.

344
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:49,791
It's him. It's Sylar.

345
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,051
Freeze!

346
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:08,991
Hey, remember me?

347
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:10,216
It's okay.

348
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,997
- No one's gonna hurt you, honey.
-<i> How could he find me?</i>

349
00:24:15,044 --> 00:24:17,626
- <i>How could he find me?</i>
- That doesn't matter.

350
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:20,134
You're safe now. You're safe.

351
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:22,834
All right. All right.

352
00:24:34,592 --> 00:24:35,952
Show me your hands!

353
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:39,077
Do it or I'll put you down!

354
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:56,543
You okay?

355
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:22,033
- Simone.
- Oh, hey.

356
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:24,580
I was just coming up to check on my dad.

357
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:27,556
Where are you going?
Aren't you supposed to be on your shift?

358
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:29,208
I was just filling in my replacement,

359
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:30,745
and saying bye to your dad.

360
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:31,951
What?

361
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,524
- Listen...
- No.

362
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,041
I'm quitting.

363
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:37,056
Why?

364
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:39,406
I called the agency
and told them this morning.

365
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:42,225
But my father...

366
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:43,960
Caroline's gonna
take really great care...

367
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:45,600
But she's not you.

368
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,606
This is not where I'm supposed to be.

369
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,605
It's not what I'm supposed to do.

370
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,575
I can't really explain it.

371
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,734
Well, try.

372
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:58,601
Look, the truth is,
I've been trying to save the world,

373
00:26:58,602 --> 00:26:59,994
one person at a time.

374
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:02,398
But I'm meant for something bigger.

375
00:27:02,718 --> 00:27:05,047
Something important. I know it now.

376
00:27:05,528 --> 00:27:06,641
That's...

377
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,044
That's really all I can tell you.

378
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,337
I'll miss you.

379
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,212
It's New York, I mean...

380
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:28,040
Everyone runs into each other
sooner or later.

381
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:31,396
Maybe it'll be sooner.

382
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:41,035
Flames were everywhere.

383
00:27:41,063 --> 00:27:42,308
Oh, my God, I could...

384
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:44,222
I could hear the poor man coughing

385
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:46,467
somewhere inside the train car.

386
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,661
But there was smoke everywhere.

387
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,066
I couldn't see him.

388
00:27:50,104 --> 00:27:52,601
I was so scared, you guys.
I was really scared.

389
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,001
Nice effigy.

390
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:02,451
Thanks.

391
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:05,430
I stayed up all night
stuffing it with newspaper.

392
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,513
I would have filled his head
with firecrackers,

393
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,067
but that's just me.

394
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:10,671
That would have been cool.

395
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,925
Careful.

396
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:14,555
If you stand too close,
you'll end up like that guy.

397
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:17,496
I'm not as flammable as he is.

398
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:21,313
Dale Ledgerwood's got a keg
in the back of his truck.

399
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:27,278
- Are you sure this is okay?
- We're 30 miles from home.

400
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:28,570
Who's gonna know?

401
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,652
Jackie told me you wanna meet
your real mom and dad.

402
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:35,451
I told Jackie that in confidence.

403
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,630
You do realize

404
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:39,298
you were talking to Jackie, right?

405
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,381
Is that why you're bummed?

406
00:28:42,683 --> 00:28:44,234
The whole adoption thing?

407
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,652
I mean, you didn't,
like just find out, did you?

408
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:49,970
They told me when I was really little.

409
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:53,156
Why do you think I'm bummed?

410
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:55,314
You don't seem like yourself.

411
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:57,567
Thought maybe something was wrong.

412
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,168
You don't know me well enough
to know when I'm not being myself.

413
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:03,109
You never drink plain milk.

414
00:29:03,354 --> 00:29:04,712
It's always chocolate.

415
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,770
You draw mermaids in the margins
of your notebook.

416
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:10,255
Put crackers in your sandwiches
to make them crunch.

417
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,517
And you're usually the first person
to laugh at a joke.

418
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:15,082
But...

419
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:17,051
I haven't heard you laugh in a while.

420
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:19,144
Lately you seem...

421
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:20,727
...sort of sad.

422
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,517
Have you been spying on me?

423
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:29,286
Claire, my goal tonight
is to hear you laugh.

424
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,379
Did you put firecrackers in his head,
just for me?

425
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,483
Hey, you waited up for me.

426
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:14,025
Look, I know
I missed our therapy session.

427
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,355
- It's fine.
- No, it wasn't.

428
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:19,052
I'm sorry. I was supposed to call you,
and I meant to.

429
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,144
I had the craziest day today.

430
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:23,264
You would not believe
what happened to me.

431
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:25,204
It was so strange,
and it was amazing and--

432
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:27,234
I don't even know how to describe it.

433
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:29,449
Then don't.

434
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:32,305
That's it?

435
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:34,349
That's it?

436
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:37,353
You waited up so that you could tell me
that you don't want to talk to me?

437
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,231
I really don't want this
to turn into a fight.

438
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,769
And if I say anything else, it will.

439
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:43,446
I'm really trying, Matt.

440
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,673
You know, this marriage
may not mean anything to you...

441
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:48,215
What? It does. Of course it does.
What are you talking about?

442
00:30:48,753 --> 00:30:50,592
I have a lot of stuff
going on right now.

443
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,911
So do I.

444
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:55,218
It was supposed to be a good thing
when I made associate,

445
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:56,973
and you were suppose to be happy for me.

446
00:30:57,368 --> 00:31:00,149
But ever since, it's like you're mad
at me for getting what I wanted,

447
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,798
because you haven't.

448
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:17,007
I don't mean to be.

449
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:19,732
It's just--

450
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,116
It's hard.

451
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:26,699
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

452
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,159
<i>I wish he would just leave.</i>

453
00:31:30,573 --> 00:31:31,685
Fine.

454
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:33,476
I will.

455
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,393
Wait.

456
00:31:57,969 --> 00:31:59,684
Let's take a little break.

457
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,314
- Want to go back to the party?
- No, I just...

458
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,267
I'm going through something,

459
00:32:05,283 --> 00:32:07,791
and I don't know
if now's the right time.

460
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:09,921
You know what?

461
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,260
You just need to relax.

462
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,463
What's gotten into you?

463
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,744
I just really like you, Claire.
Don't you like me?

464
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:22,468
No, Brody, stop.

465
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,241
Don't hurt yourself.

466
00:32:27,768 --> 00:32:29,615
- No, stop it!
- I want it!

467
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,414
- This is gonna happen, Claire.
- No Brody!

468
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,734
Don't be a bitch. Let it happen!

469
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,334
You haven't say a word the all way home.

470
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:10,801
Boy, that has got to be a record.

471
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,538
Are you hungry? You know, I was thinking

472
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,474
that we could stop
by that ice cream shop

473
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:20,200
on the way home.

474
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,789
You know, the one
with those ginormous banana splits?

475
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:24,863
Why don't you believe
that Dad's innocent?

476
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:27,296
I mean,
you should be trying to help him.

477
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:29,653
I know
that you want to believe in your father.

478
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:32,434
But I know what's best, Micah.

479
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:35,734
They're gonna catch him,
and he's gonna go away for a long time.

480
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:37,534
They'll never find him.

481
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:40,049
How do you know that?

482
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:43,387
Micah, do you know where he is?

483
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,449
It's okay.

484
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:13,424
Is there a problem, Officer?

485
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,801
Mr. Linderman wants to see you.

486
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:20,067
I'm with my son.

487
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,131
So I guess sooner rather than later.

488
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:49,334
To destiny.

489
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,927
May we recognize it when we see it.

490
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:54,718
To love.

491
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:57,442
May we stay away from it
when it's no good for us.

492
00:35:01,287 --> 00:35:02,247
You know earlier today,

493
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,125
when you were telling me
how you'd changed?

494
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,171
Yeah.

495
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,348
I noticed it.

496
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,234
There's just something different.

497
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:12,684
It's like a look in your eye.

498
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:14,540
A confidence.

499
00:35:15,804 --> 00:35:17,463
There's something I should tell you.

500
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,084
Something...

501
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:22,811
I didn't think was right to say

502
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,479
when I still worked for your father.
Something...

503
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:28,939
I wouldn't have even said to you
two days ago.

504
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,618
I've been in love with you

505
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,437
since the minute
I first laid eyes on you.

506
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:38,633
<i>Excuse me.</i>

507
00:35:39,632 --> 00:35:41,037
<i>Everyone, excuse me.</i>

508
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:46,786
I'd like to apologize about the rain.

509
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:49,498
<i>If you elect me, I promise I'll try
and do something about it.</i>

510
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:52,466
<i>I'd like to welcome you all here,</i>

511
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,283
<i>on behalf of my family,
my entire campaign staff.</i>

512
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,338
I'm sure that you know my brave wife

513
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,610
would be here by my side, were she able.

514
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:03,401
<i>The life-altering event
of my father's death,</i>

515
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:06,992
is really what prompted me
to run for Congress.

516
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,955
My father hid a...

517
00:36:10,216 --> 00:36:11,701
deep depression...

518
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,244
an illness, really...

519
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:15,375
up until the day he died.

520
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:18,367
His loving wife, his attentive children,

521
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:20,806
his loyal friends...
We all knew about it,

522
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,534
and yet he suffered alone.

523
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:25,966
As many of you might have read,
my brother Peter...

524
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:27,456
<i>had an accident.</i>

525
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:28,958
<i>But what I have kept
from the press</i>

526
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:30,580
thus far is that...

527
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:33,556
Peter barely survived

528
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,328
a suicide attempt.

529
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:42,783
<i>My first instinct was to</i>

530
00:36:43,406 --> 00:36:45,017
keep his illness hidden.

531
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:47,006
<i>But no one should suffer alone.</i>

532
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,391
<i>Because we're all connected somehow.</i>

533
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,115
<i>Everyone in this room.
You, me, everyone in this city.</i>

534
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,801
<i>And we need to look out for each other.</i>

535
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:01,156
Nissan Versa. Nissan Versa.

536
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,449
That's a popular choice.

537
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,457
Let me check to see
if we still have any left.

538
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:06,967
- Nissan...
- Hiro.

539
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:28,082
You're in luck.
We have one left.

540
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,230
- So, Where to?
- Las Vegas.

541
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:06,367
How you doing?

542
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,850
Well, I'm...

543
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,979
<i>It's a rhetorical question.</i>

544
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:16,221
<i>Just say "fine" and order a drink.</i>

545
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,644
Uh, fine.

546
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,218
Whatever you got on tap.

547
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,500
<i>Do I have time for another one?</i>

548
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,667
<i>I don't want to go home to that shrew.</i>

549
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:32,135
<i>She's sucking the life out of me.</i>

550
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:37,366
<i>What's he looking at?</i>

551
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:40,657
<i>Barking up the wrong tree, pal.</i>

552
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,433
<i>Why? What am I doing here?</i>

553
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:51,978
<i>Am I that desperate?</i>

554
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:53,741
<i>She is diggin' me.</i>

555
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:55,428
<i>I am in for sure.</i>

556
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:57,163
<i>She is diggin' me.</i>

557
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,187
<i>What if I just disappeared?
Would they care?</i>

558
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:07,063
<i>Would anybody care?</i>

559
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:10,527
<i>How long would it take
to notice I'm gone?</i>

560
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:12,365
<i>Would anybody care?</i>

561
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:54,781
We were in the apartment.
We saw everything.

562
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:56,232
What you were doing in there?

563
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:57,401
Please, just follow me.

564
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:59,364
I believe this man Sylar
killed my father.

565
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:01,114
He has a list of targets,
including a man

566
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:02,901
who's running for Congress.

567
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,370
He turns around
to the other one and says,

568
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,193
"Holy cow, a talking dog."

569
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,756
You son of a bitch!

570
00:40:34,594 --> 00:40:35,999
Let him go.

571
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:39,439
Easy, Pete,
that's our mother you're talking about.

572
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:41,634
There was no reporter on my story!

573
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:43,756
There would have been, eventually.

574
00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:46,679
I had to take control of things
before something happened.

575
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,967
Do you under...

576
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:53,992
You get it, right?

577
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,660
Yeah, I get it.

578
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:57,150
Good man.

579
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:36,664
You're bleeding.

580
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:37,824
What?

581
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:42,941
Look, what Nathan said, it's not true.

582
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:45,195
- I didn't try to kill myself.
- No, I know.

583
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:20,926
<i>This force, evolution,</i>

584
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,868
<i>is not sentimental.

585
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:24,998
<i>Like the earth itself,</i>

586
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,949
<i>it knows only the hard facts</i>

587
00:42:26,968 --> 00:42:28,476
<i>of life's struggle with death.</i>

588
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,367
<i>All you can do it hope and trust</i>

589
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:34,634
<i>that when you've served
its needs faithfully,</i>

590
00:42:35,205 --> 00:42:36,694
<i>there may still remain</i>

591
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:38,231
<i>some glimmer</i>

592
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:40,936
<i>of the life you once knew.</i>

593
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,805
Holy sh...
