00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:03,985
There were 12 of us.

3
00:00:04,015 --> 00:00:08,400
now... there are nine.

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:10,300
Who wants revenge,
Mrs. Petrelli?

5
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:11,700
I want my lawyer now.

[Angela screaming]
Where is she?

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,000
It's gonna be
all right, ma.

8
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,400
So you can find
anyone in the world?

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,700
You just need
to think about them?

10
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,100
There's only one
that i can't.

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,600
When i think about him,
he can see me.

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,000
Everything that i had,
it's gone.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,100
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>Take me with you.</i>

14
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:34,600
I have a car.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,700
I'll only be gone
for a while.

16
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:38,100
And you're gonna be
staying with family.

17
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,000
It could be fun.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,800
Okay, fine.
I'm a freak, all right?

19
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,200
Claire, shut up.

20
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,600
What's on your neck?

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Last thing i remember,

22
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:51,200
this man stepping out
of the bushes calling my name.

23
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:52,600
What are you talking about?
What man?

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,700
The guy with
the horn-rimmed glasses.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,800
<i>(mohinder)</i>
<i>I'm sending you a jpeg</i>

Eight of eight.

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,500
Mr. Muggles and i
just did

28
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,600
two whole miles
at the beach.

29

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,100
Have you talked
to claire lately?

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
About what?

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,100
Oh, just about
how she's adjusting.

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,700
Has she met somebody?
A boy maybe?

35
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,100
If the wrong person
comes into her life,

36
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:33,600
it could be...

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,100
problematic for all of us.

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
What makes you so sure
it's a boy?

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,800
What makes you so sure
it isn't?

40
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,600
Is there something
on my face?

41
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Claire, your mother and i
need to talk to you...

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,500
about boys.
Oh, please, not
the sex talk again.

43
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,100
It was painful enough
the first time.

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,300
We just want to know
if you're seeing anyone.

45
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,800
Why, because
dating is forbidden too?

46
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,600
Along with cheerleading
and a social life?

47
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:04,100
Nobody's forbidding
anything, claire.

48
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,600
It's just that
any outsider

49
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,300
could be a threat
to the family.

50
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,700
Dad, believe it or not,

51
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:12,200
there are people in this world
who aren't out to get us.

52

<i>All we're saying is</i>

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,700
if there is a boy,

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
i'd like to meet him.

55
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,200
We could help you decide

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
whether this is somebody
that you could trust.

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
Dad, relax.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,300
Okay, there's no boy.

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,300
Okay, it's okay.

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,900
I'm sorry, i can't help it.
It just keeps on happening.

Shh. It's okay.

Okay.

Water, okay.

69

It's getting worse.
Two a night now.

70

Get in her head.

71
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,200
And i keep getting
thrown back.

72
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,500
So what are we
supposed to do?

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,800
I don't know.
You're the scientist.

74
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:24,000
That doesn't exactly make me
an expert on nightmares.

75
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,200
That makes two of us.

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,600
I don't know.
I'll go get the water.

77
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,600
Just keep her calm.
And we'll just...

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,300
figure it out, right?

79
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Just try to get
some sleep, sweetheart.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400

81
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,300

Who's got time
to do that?

177
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Unfortunately, i do.

178
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,100
<i>(woman on tv)</i>
<i>And you have a recipe</i>
<i>to impress.</i>

179
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,600
I'll bring dinner home
from the restaurant.

180
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,100
Mwah!
Again.

181
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,100
Wish me luck.

182
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,300
Break a leg.

183
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,300
Whatever.

184
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,400
What you lookin' at?

185
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,300
Nothing.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,300
It's just i think
i know a way

187
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,600
to get you pay-per-view.

188
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,400
I did it.

189
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,000
I killed kaito nakamura.

190
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,000
Why?

191
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,600
For all the reasons
you said.

192
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,000
Sex? Money?
Yes.

193
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,900
You know i was on the roof.

194
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,200
You have my fingerprints.

195
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,600
I did it.
I pushed him off.

196
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,800
When we, uh,
we brought you in,

197
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,200
you tried
to kill yourself.

198
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Turns out your wounds
were self-inflicted.

199
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,600
I was distraught.

200
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Overwhelmed by what i did.

201
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,700
And so l...
i attacked myself.

202
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,300
<i>(angela, thinking)</i>
<i>Write down the statement</i>

203
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,900
<i>and let it go, parkman.</i>

204
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
<i>Please let it go.</i>

205
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,000
Ahem.
Uh...

206
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,200
mrs. Petrelli,
why are you doing this?

207
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,100
My head is clear now.
I understand.

208
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,700
The only way out of this
is for me to confess.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
<i>(fuller)</i>
<i>Fine.</i>

210
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,300
I'll start the paperwork.

211
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,800
<i>(angela, thinking)</i>
<i>If they keep digging,</i>
<i>they will find out</i>

212
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:02,900
<i>about all of us</i>
<i>and what we can do.</i>

213
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,500
<i>Let it go.</i>

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,900
What's that?

215
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:17,600
Parental release form

216
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,300
to try out
for the cheerleading squad.

217
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,500
For me?

218
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,500
Yep.

219
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
I'm flattered.

220
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:25,700
I don't think i can squeeze
cheerleading into my schedule.

221
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:28,200
But you're kind of a hero
to the girls in the squad.

222
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,700
A hero? Why?

223
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:31,600
The way you stood up
to debbie on your first day.

224
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,400
You know, half of being
a cheerleader is having guts.

225
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:36,400
And you have got those
in spades.

226
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,800
I'll tell you what.

227
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,500
I'll think about it,
and then i'll let you know

228
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,200
if i change my mind.

229
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:44,900
Good!

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,100
Then take the release form
just in case.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Hi.

232
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,000
Hi.

233
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,100
I can't stop thinking
about yesterday.

234
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,300
It was so amazing.

235
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
I finally have someone
i can be myself with.

236
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,100
Uh, about that.

237
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:05,600
L... i'm not sure
we should hang out anymore.

238
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,700
It's just my parents
are really overprotective.

239
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,300
Is this because
we flew together?

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,900
I weirded you out,
didn't i?
No!

241
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,400
I like you,
i really do.

242
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,000
Then it's those marks
on my neck, right?

243
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,100
You think i was
abducted by aliens.

244
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,900
I told you, it was a guy
with horn-rimmed glasses.

245
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,100
It's my dad.

246
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
He's just really
overprotective

247
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,400
about the dating thing.

248
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,300
Then let me talk to him.

249
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,100
I don't think
that's a good idea.

250
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,400
But...

251
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,100
i can fly.
And you can regenerate.

252
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:41,900
I mean, doesn't that
tell you anything?

253
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,200
Please don't make
this harder on me

254
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,000
than it already is.

255
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,200
Okay.
I'll tell you what.

256
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,000
Tomorrow i'll totally
back off.

257
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,900
Today,
i'm asking you out.

258
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:57,700
West...
tonight, anywhere
you want to go.

259
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,600
If you want to call it off
after that, fine.

260
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Fine, but just this once.

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,300
You won't regret it.

262
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,300
What do you think you're
doing questioning a suspect

263
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:18,900
in a hospital?

264
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:20,400
Any confession is coerced.
She's sick.

265
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,300
Coerced or not,
they believe her.

266
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,300
But i know
she's innocent.

267
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,300
How?

268
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,100
The same way i know
that you can fly.

269
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,300
I can read your mind.

270
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:48,700
Just like i read
your mother's.

271
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:51,200
But i can't tell my partner
what i know or how i know it.

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
You reading my mind
right now?

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,800
No... yes, sorry.

274
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Look, your mother thinks
she's protecting somebody

275
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:03,500
by shutting down
this investigation.

276
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,200
But i'm not gonna
let it happen.

277
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,100
I'm not backing down.

278
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,500
I've got a little girl
at home that wakes up

279
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,400
in the middle of the night
screaming about nightmares,

280
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:13,000
and drawing a symbol
that... this.

281
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,900
The same symbol
that's on these photos.

282
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I know that symbol.

283
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,300
I think
it's all connected.

284
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,200
Everything.

285
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:24,000
What you and i can do.
We're all connected.

286
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,200
I know this photograph.

287
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,000
Good, because i need
your help.

288
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,600
I can't continue
this investigation without you.

289
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,400
All right, i'll help.

290
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I need five minutes
alone with my mother.

291
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,000
Alone.

292
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,400
Why are you confessing
to a crime you didn't commit?

293
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,900
Because you were
right, nathan.

294
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,800
I don't deserve
to be saved.

295
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,600
Ma, i was angry
when i said that.

296
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,000
I was drunk.
I didn't mean it.

297
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,900
Of course you did.

298
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,500
You asked me for help once.
Now just let me help you.

299
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,000
Just because you shaved

300
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,800
doesn't mean you're
clean and sober.

301
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,100
You still have to get
yourself into a program.

302
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,100
Get your family back.

303
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,400
Don't let
your children hate you.

304
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Not if you can help it.

305
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
You didn't kill
kaito nakamura.

306
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:28,500
I know that.

307
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,200
I have done so many
bad things in my life

308
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:34,000
it really doesn't matter
what crime i confess to.

309
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:34,900
Let me help you, ma.

310
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,400
No, what you want
is redemption,

311
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,800
and you're not gonna
get it by helping me.

312
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:40,200
You'll just get killed.

313
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,200
And i can't bear
to lose another son.

314
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,500
Ahem.

315
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
He has to do this.
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,600
It's all right.
I'm... i'm ready.

317
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Where's your stuff?
You're traveling pretty light.

318
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,400
I got robbed.

319
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:34,100
Been walking for three days.
Thank god you came along.

320
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,100
Ask him where he's heading?

321
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Where are you going?

322
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,000
Going home to america.
New york.

323
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,800
New york.

324
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,100
This is where
we're going.

325
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Do you have
family there?

326
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:48,900
No.

327
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Uh... we need
to find this man.

328
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,200
Maya, no.

329
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:55,500
Dr. Suresh.

330
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,700
This is a coincidence.

331
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,500
I know this book.
I've read it.

332
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,500
Really?

333
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,700
What are you doing showing him the book?

334
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:07,800
Don't worry, he's read it, too.

335
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Why are you searching
for dr. Suresh?

336
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,500
For a...
how you say this?

337
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,300
Answers.
To what?

338
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
I know dr. Suresh.

339
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,300
We're old friends.
You and dr. Suresh?

340
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:27,500
You've helped me.
Now i can return the favor.

341
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,700
I can... i can
take you to him.

342
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:30,900
I can help you find him.

343
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,600
What did he say?

344
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,000
He kowns the man who wrote the book.

345
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,800
He'll take us to him.
Of all the people to find... it's amazing.

346
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,500
Yaeh, amzing.

347
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,500
It's a miracle. A sign from god.
We're on the right path.

348
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,800
Thank you.
I don't know what to say.

349
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,300
I don't even know
your name.

350
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,900
It's gabriel.

351
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
Gabriel gray.

352
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,600
Gabriel.

353
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,200
Oh!
Like the angel.

354
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,300
Yeah.

355
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,200
Just like the angel.

356
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,900
* i spent
oh so many nights *

357
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:17,100
* just feeling sorry
for myself *

358
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:18,900
* i used to cry...
mm mm *

359
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:20,400
* but now i hold
my head up high... *

360
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,000
we've got rules against
drinking on the job, you know.

361
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,500
It's all about attitude,
camille.

362
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,400
What's about attitude?
Life.

363
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,900
And today is the first day
of the rest of mine.

364
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:33,400
Uh-huh, you sound
like a fortune cookie.

365
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:36,100
No, i sound like a woman
with a future.

366
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,300
Is there something
you're not telling me?

367
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,500
I took the test.

368
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,800
Oh, are you pregnant?

369
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,400
No!

370
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,100
Girl, now how am i
gonna be pregnant

371
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:48,700
wearing this outfit
two shifts a day?

372
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:51,300
The management
training program.

373
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:52,700
I took the test.

374
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Oh, that.

375
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
What do you mean
"oh, that"?

376
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Nothing.

377
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,500
I just think that you
shouldn't get

378
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,000
your hopes up,
that's all.

379
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,100
Only a fool
would put money

380
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
on a 1 in 50 chance.

381
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:06,300
Look, if i make manager,
i can earn enough money

382
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:08,300
to go back to school,
get my degree.

383
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:10,500
I can move my family
out of here.

384
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,900
It's not right.

385
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:13,700
One storm comes
rolling through here

386
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:16,000
and blows away
my whole life.

387
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,200
My mother.
My college education.

388
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,900
My dreams.

389
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm sorry.

390
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,800
It's just you've been
talking like this

391
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,700
since we were
in kindergarten.

392
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
One scheme after another,
and nothing every happens.

393
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,400
What in the world?

394
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Where did you learn
to do that?

395
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:47,900
I don't...

396
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,200
<i>monica, let me talk</i>
<i>to you for a second.</i>

397
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,600
Okay.

398
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
I'm sorry, monica.

399
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,700
You're just not qualified
for the management program.

400
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,400
So i didn't do well
on the test?

401
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,300
You did fine.
Not top tier, but...

402
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,000
but what?

403
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm motivated.
I'm hard working.

404
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,900
Mr. Lamont,
i've never missed a day.

405
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,200
<i>That's not the issue.</i>

406
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,300
A management position means
you need to be available

407
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,300
for any location
in the state.

408
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,600
And it's just not right
for someone in your situation.

409
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,800
My situation?

410
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:27,100
Your home life.

411
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:28,300
Your brother,
your grandmother.

412
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,600
That's the point.
I'm the breadwinner.

413
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,000
I need the money.

414
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,500
And i mean,
i can't make hamburgers

415
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,500
for the rest of my life.

416
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,200
You're good
at your job, monica.

417
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,400
What's wrong with that?

418
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,600
And you should be happy
you have one.

419
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,100
There's a lot of people
in this city who don't.

420
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,900
I thought for dessert

421
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,700
we could go to that
adorable yogurt place

422
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,200
near the bus depot.

423
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,800
I can't.

424
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,900
I have to go to the library
for a research paper.

425
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
<i>(lyle)</i>
<i>The library?</i>

426
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:02,200
Haven't you ever heard
of the internet?

427
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,200
Actually, the research paper
is on libraries

428
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,900
and how during
the digital age

429
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:10,300
they're becoming

430
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,600
increasingly obsolete
for our generation.

431
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,800
Do you need a lift?

432
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,000
What?

433
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,800
Your car?
It got stolen, remember?

434
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,100
So do you?

435
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,400
That's okay.

436
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:29,900
I think
i'm just gonna walk.

437
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay.

438
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,700
Hi.

439
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,000
Hi

440
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,300
photo's gotta be
in here somewhere.

441
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,500
It's a group shot.

442
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,900
Maybe 10, 12 people.

443
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:13,800
What kind of group is it?

444
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:15,500
It was a party
or a meeting.

445
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
My parents are in it.
Kaito nakamura.

446
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:21,500
You knew nakamura?
No, my folks did.

447
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,900
He used to come over
the house sometimes.

448
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
My father didn't seem
to care for him too much.

449
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:26,000
I remember
the last time i saw him,

450
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,600
my mom hugged him,
and it lasted

451
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:29,400
just a little bit
too long.

452
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,800
What about the others
in the group?

453
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:32,800
Linderman was in it.

454
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,800
Charles deveaux too.

455
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,800
A lot of them
are dead now.

456
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,600
<i>These your boys?</i>

457
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,100
Yeah.

458
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,000
What, you don't
see 'em that often?

459
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:49,800
Look, i don't...
i'm sorry,

460
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,500
i don't really
know you that well.

461
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,700
My wife... my ex-wife,
uh, cheated on me.

462
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Which i could've
forgiven her for,

463
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,400
except for the fact
that she was pregnant

464
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:02,900
with his baby.

465
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,100
Why are you telling me
all this?

466
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,000
I just... i know a bunch
of stuff about you.

467
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,600
I figure it's only fair.

468
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,400
If you want to unload,
go ahead.

469
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,300
Six months ago,
i was a cop in l.a.

470
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,300
Married,
expecting a child,

471
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
and then all of a sudden
this stuff started happening.

472
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,100
It just turned
everything upside down.

473
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm just looking
for answers.

474
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,600
Maybe this'll help.

475
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>That's the same photo.</i>

476
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,300
<i>Half the people</i>
<i>in this picture are dead.</i>

477
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,300
<i>It's the like killer's</i>

478
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:43,600
picking 'em off
one by one.

479
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:44,900
Maybe one of these
is the killer.

480
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,400
<i>Look, here's my father,</i>

481
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:47,200
<i>here's my mother.</i>

482
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,300
<i>Charles deveaux.</i>
<i>Linderman.</i>

483
00:22:49,341 --> 00:22:51,700
<i>Kaito nakamura.</i>
<i>This guy's name is bob.</i>

484
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Bob... i don't know
his last name.

485
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:55,600
I don't know
the rest of the people

486
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:56,600
<i>in the picture either.</i>

487
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,800
<i>I know him.</i>

488
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,800
How?

489
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
That's my father.

490
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,200
<i>(camille)</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

491
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,500
Ugh.
Making hamburgers?

492
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,600
Is he kidding me?

493
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:30,100
I swear, i'd like to smack him
upside his head.

494
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:32,800
I'm glad you didn't.
You can't afford to get fired.

495
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,700
I can't explain it,

496
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:37,100
but i know i'm supposed
to be somebody.

497
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:38,600
I feel like there's
something inside me

498
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:40,000
that wants to come out.

499
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,900
Does that make any sense?

500
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,300
You lost more than most
in the storm,

501
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,000
and that kind of loss,
it takes a while.

502
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,900
You shouldn't be
in such a hurry.

503
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,700
I don't know. Maybe god's punishing me.

504
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,000
Now why would he do that?

505
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,000
For being selfish.

506
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,600
I pray for it
every sunday in church.

507
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,400
For god to find me
a way out of here.

508
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,600
Everybody else is praying
for the community.

509
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:07,600
To put things back together,
to give them strength.

510
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,900
Not me.

511
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,100
I'm just praying
for a way out.

512
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,700
That's terrible,
isn't it?

513
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,100
Monica, given the situation,

514
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,000
i'd say it's pretty normal.

515
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Normal.

516
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,900
Yeah, that's me all right.

517
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,800
I offer
to take you anywhere,

518
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:33,000
and this is all
you can come up with?

519
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,200
Well, what can i say?
I'm a cheap date.

520
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,300
You got a thing
for heights, huh?

521
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,000
There was this place near where i used
to live in texas.

522
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,900
It was this old
gravel tower.

523
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:51,000
I used to climb up
to the top of it.

524
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,800
See what i could do.

525
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,700
You'd jump off?

526
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,100
Yeah.

527
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,900
Guess i've just been
thinking a lot about my life.

528
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,500
How it all went away
so fast.

529
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,900
Why did it go away?

530
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,500
I can't tell you that.

531
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,400
The truth is
so many terrible things

532
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:19,100
happened to me
while i lived there...

533
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,100
i'm not sure i could ever
open up to anyone again.

534
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,400
Well, we're here together.

535
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,100
So part of you
must want to share something.

536
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,700
I want to trust you.

537
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,900
Then jump.

538
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,200
What?

539
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:43,300
Trust begins with a leap.
Oh!

540
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,200
Cheesy, but true.

541
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,900
Oh, no, it'll be gross.

542
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:47,700
My arms pop out
of their sockets

543
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:49,900
and sometimes my feet
come out facing each other.

544
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,700
It's... it's not cute.

545
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:54,900
Claire, these fears
you have

546
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,300
of someone finding out
about you,

547
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,800
of feeling different
forever,

548
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,100
i have them too.

549
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,800
You can share them
with me,

550
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:10,200
but i can't help you
if you don't trust me.

551
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,000
Okay.

552
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
You caught me.

553
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,300
Of course i did.

554
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
But i would've been fine.

555
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,000
I know you can
heal, claire.

556
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,800
But i never want
to see you hurt.

557
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,500
I don't understand.

558
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,300
You don't even
have tools.

559
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:17,600
Just hold on.

560
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Almost got it.

561
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
You know if this doesn't work,
you're dead.

562
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,600
You know that, right?

563
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Wow, you did it!

564
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,000
All right, you got
your stay of execution.

565
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,600
Is that pay-per-view?

566
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,700
Uh-huh.

567
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,700
How did you get that?

568
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Turns out micah's
some type of genius

569
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:04,100
and rigged the cable.

570
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,600
Is that true?

571
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,800
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

572
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,200
I was just trying
to help.

573
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,700
Look, i know it's tough

574
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,700
being stuck
with your cousins like this

575
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:33,700
after everything
you've been through.

576
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,600
But i promised your mother
that i'd look after you.

577
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:38,900
So you gotta obey the rules
around here, okay?

578
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,400
I know.

579
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,700
I, uh, i got dinner
for you guys.

580
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,000
You can eat
in front of the tv.

581
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,300
Hey, you okay?

582
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,900
Yeah.

583
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,100
I just wish i could fix
your dreams for you.

584
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,600
You're a sweet kid.

585
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
Go tell damon
dinner's ready.

586
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Dinner's ready.

587
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,800
Yeah, in a minute.

588
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,600
Here goes a 619.

589
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
<i>That's awesome.</i>

590
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Matt, you're home!

591
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,200
Hey, yeah!
I'm home.

592
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh, and i need
to talk to you.

593
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
Uh, both of you, actually.

594
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:03,800
Is everything okay?

595
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:05,900
Yeah, yeah, i, um...

596
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,500
i have to find
my father.

597
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,100
You don't know
where your dad is?

598
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:13,300
He left me
when i was 13.

599
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,300
He gave me 120 bucks
and a pat on the head.

600
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:18,500
And you haven't
seen him since?

601
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:21,200
I've tried, but that's
the thing about criminals.

602
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:23,600
They... they don't like
to be found.

603
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,300
He's a bad guy?

604
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:28,500
My dad stole a lot of money
from a lot of people.

605
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,200
And the case that
i'm working on right now,

606
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:31,800
i have a feeling
that he's in the middle

607
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:33,200
of something
really dangerous,

608
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:34,300
and i need to talk him.

609
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,900
So i need you
to help me find him.

610
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Okay?
Okay.

611
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:41,900
All right, good.

612
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,400
There he is.
That's my dad.

613
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,200
Molly, what is it?
Molly, what's wrong?

614
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:54,500
Put it away!
Put it away!

615
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:55,800
Molly.
Molly, what's wrong?

616
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:57,000
Please don't make me
look for him.

617
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,400
Please don't make me look.

618
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,200
I don't understand.
Why not?

619
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,300
He's the man
in my dreams.

620
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:04,400
He is the nightmare man.

621
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
I'm gonna make
things right, pete.

622
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,600
Get away from me!

623
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh, my gosh,
look what time it is.

624
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,400
My dad's gonna kill me.

625
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:13,200
What lie did you use
to get out of the house?

626
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:16,200
'Cause i'm guessingyou didn't say you were flying around
in the arms of some kid from school.

627
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,000
I said i was going
to the library.

628
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,600
Ouch.

629
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,700
I'm sure he didn't
suspect a thing.

630
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm sorry,
i'm a lousy liar.

631
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,200
Look...

632
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,100
if we're gonna keep
seeing each other,

633
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:29,700
you've gotta come up
with something good.

634
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,700
Something consistent.

635
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,300
Like what? I'm volunteering
at a soup kitchen.

636
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:34,600
Claire, the credible lies

637
00:32:34,641 --> 00:32:36,200
are the ones
that make you look bad.

638
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
What else is it that your dad
doesn't want you to do?

639
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,800
I think i have
just the thing.

640
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,100
Aren't you gonna
say good night?

641
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,300
You're killing me.

642
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,000
Gabriel.

643
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,500
Come here.
Check this out.

644
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,300
There are killers
in the car with us.

645
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,700
What?

646
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,600
"Homocidio."
Right there.

647
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,600
Well, golly,
they seem so...

648
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,800
dude, i have been riding
with them for two days.

649
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,600
We gotta ditch 'em.

650
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,100
Okay, um...

651
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,100
all right,
i'll distract them.

652
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,700
And you... you go call
the police.

653
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:57,100
There's a payphone
right inside.

654
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,800
What's taking them so long?

655
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
We have a problem.

656
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,300
I'm gonna ask you
a question,

657
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:19,900
and you need
to tell me the truth.

658
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:21,100
Yes, of course.

659
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:21,900
What is it?

660
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,500
This.
Is this you?

661
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,100
Say no.

662
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,900
Yes, this is us,

663
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:35,200
but it is not our fault.

664
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,600
We didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

665
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,400
Well, you can tell
the police that,

666
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:42,900
<i>because derek</i>
<i>is calling them right now.</i>

667
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:45,200
No, no, no, please, no!
He cannot!

668
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:46,200
What, what, what?

669
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:48,000
Derek is calling the police.

670
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,300
Maya!

671
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,900
What are you doing to me?

672
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Calm down.

673
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,500
Calm down.

674
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,900
Calm down.

675
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Calm down.

676
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
You both...

677
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,300
have power.

678
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,200
This is not our fault.

679
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,700
We don't know
what's happening to us.

680
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:30,800
That's why you need
to find dr. Suresh.

681
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,400
Yes.

682
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,600
Believe me, i understand
what you're going through.

683
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,000
To be held responsible

684
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,500
for things that
you didn't mean to do.

685
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,300
Being hunted.

686
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
I've helped suresh
with so many people like you.

687
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:45,900
He'll know what to do.

688
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,000
But the police.

689
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,500
They have
to catch us first.

690
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,400
How was the library?

691
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,000
[Sighing]
Dad, i can explain.

692
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,700
You don't need to.

693
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,600
You were with a boy.

694
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,500
No, no, there's no boy.

695
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,400
Okay.

696
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,600
So...

697
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:41,400
i'm waiting.

698
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
I tried out
for cheerleading.

699
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,000
Cheerleading?

700
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,000
I made the squad.

701
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,600
I forged your signature
on the release form.

702
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,500
The girls took me out
to celebrate.

703
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,100
You...

704
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,000
first you get
your car stolen, now...

705
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:01,700
l-i told you
no cheerleading.

706
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:03,600
I was very specific
about that.

707
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,800
Dad, cheerleading
makes me happy, okay?

708
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,000
Look, i know, it's scary
and i know there are risks.

709
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,700
Just please let me have
this one thing.

710
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,100
I've done everything else
you've asked me to.

711
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:16,800
I've given up my friends
and my life.

712
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:18,900
I just need one thing
that's normal.

713
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,000
I had no idea
that cheerleading

714
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,400
meant that much
to you.

715
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,300
Took me by surprise too.

716
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,700
You're gonna let me do it?

717
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,800
I'll make you a deal.

718
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,400
You cheerlead,

719
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,500
but you promise me

720
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,800
that you will not date

721
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,600
for now.

722
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,000
Okay.

723
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay.

724
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,200
I have a lead
on the paintings.

725
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,000
We have to go
to odessa.

726
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,100
Texas.

727
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:38,300
The ukraine.

728
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,000
It's a long trip.

729
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,700
What will you tell
your family?

730
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,500
Oh, i'm sure i'll think
of something.

731
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,400
She's finally
settling down.

732
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,900
I'm sorry.

733
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You didn't know.

734
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,200
No, i'm sorry, because...

735
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,800
molly has to find my father.

736
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:08,400
That is out
of the question.

737
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,700
A lot of people
in this photo are dead.

738
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:15,500
This guy, dead.
This guy, dead.

739
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:18,200
Kaito nakamura, murdered.
Angela petrelli, attacked.

740
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:19,900
This is my dad.
He may already be dead.

741
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,800
He be the next victim.
He may be the killer.

742
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,300
I have to find that out.

743
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,500
Look, this man here?

744
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:28,400
<i>This is the man i work for.</i>
<i>His name is bob.</i>

745
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:29,400
I'll take you to him.

746
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,400
Fine.
After we find my dad.

747
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:33,700
You leave molly
out of this!

748
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:34,700
You're asking a little girl

749
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:36,200
to confront
her worst nightmare!

750
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,700
Maybe confronting it
is exactly what she needs.

751
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:40,600
Oh, so this is
all about helping molly?

752
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:42,400
Because to me it sounds
like a 13-year-old boy

753
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:43,600
trying to make his daddy
pay for leaving him.

754
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:45,900
And you know everything
about daddy issues.

755
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,100
Yeah, i do.

756
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,500
I'll do it for you, matt.

757
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,200
I'll find your father.

758
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,000
Thank you.

759
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,100
Monica, it's dead tonight.

760
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:14,800
Let's close up.
You get the front door.

761
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:16,800
I'll get the back.
Sure.

762
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,000
Sorry, we're closed.

763
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,500
But the sign say
y'all close at 10:00.

764
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:29,300
Look, i'm hungry.

765
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:31,600
My boss, he's making me
close up for the night.

766
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,700
And i said i'm hungry.

767
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:34,500
And while you're at it,

768
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,100
i'll take everything
you got in the register!

769
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:36,700
Okay okay

770
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:38,000
sit down right there!

771
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,000
Did you just see...

772
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,200
where'd you learn that?

773
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,800
On tv.

774
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,300
We're right here
for you.

775
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:20,400
Yeah, we're gonna
protect you.

776
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,200
I see a city.

777
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,500
Philadelphia.
Good.

778
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,300
An apartment building.
<i>What floor?</i>

779
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:44,100
I don't want to go in.

780
00:41:44,141 --> 00:41:45,600
He can't hurt you.
It's okay.

781
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
Third floor.
<i>(matt)</i>
<i>Okay, good.</i>

782
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,300
Good, what's
the apartment number?

783
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,800
He knows i'm here.
He's coming.

784
00:41:54,841 --> 00:41:56,700
Okay, molly, what's
the apartment number?
<i>Quickly, come on.</i>

785
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,800
Nine.
Nine, good girl.

786
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:01,100
All right, get out
of there right now.

787
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,200
He sees me, he...
leave me alone!

788
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,800
Molly, get out of there!
Leave me alone!

789
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,600
[Screaming]
Molly, molly!

790
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,300
Matt.

791
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,000
Molly?
Molly!

792
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,400
She's breathing.
What happened?

793
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
She's in shock.
She won't wake up.

794
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:21,900
Come on, molly,
you did it.

795
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:23,400
Molly, it's time
to get up!

796
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:24,900
Come on, wake up!
<i>Matt, don't.</i>

797
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:25,600
Don't.

798
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,600
<i>(molly, thinking)</i>
<i>Matt, help me!</i>

799
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,600
<i>Matt!</i>
