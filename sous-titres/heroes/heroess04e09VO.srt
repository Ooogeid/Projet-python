your life back, Emma.

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,311

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:26,151
and now his consciousness
is rattling around up in here.

11

polluted your mind somehow.

went through your body,

21
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,982

you're totally fine now.

Wow, 4 1/2 hours at the airport,

166
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,231
trying to talk your way
out of that airport jail,

167
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,442
only to still be on the no-fly list.

168
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,610
And now this.

169
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,196
How did I not see
that huge chunk of metal

170
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,740
in the middle of the road?

171
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,659
Maybe I made it
so you didn't see it.

172
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,168
Oh, man, I could get used to this...

173
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,420
Playing the bad guy, the saboteur.

174
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,925
Do you have any
upper-body strength at all?

175
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,219
Actually, I'm deceptively strong.

176
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,972
Strong enough to stop your ass
from getting to New York.

177
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:28,808
{\Yeah, }I don't think so{\, Matt}.
I'm in control.

178
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,935
You sure about that?

179
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,649
You okay, son?

180
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,069
Yeah, I'm fine.

181
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,862
My car, not so much.

182
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,074
Well, there's a trick
to loosening the stubborn bolts.

183
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,368
- Want me to give it a go?
- Be my guest. I'd appreciate that, Mr.,

184
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:49,995
Hank. Ain't nothin'.

185
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,292
Can you hand me that
tire iron over there, please?

186
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,877
Sure thing, hank.

187
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,847
You okay over there?
That looked like that could have hurt.

188
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,598
No, I'm fine.

189
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,143
{\You know, }It looks like it's going to be
a long trip to New York.

190
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:14,979
What?

191
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,483
Oh, what are you gonna do?
You gonna hit me?

192
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,695
Hey, hank.

193
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,668
You're right.

194
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,336
Deceptively strong.

195
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,839
You just killed him.

196
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,090
No, I didn't.

197
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,301
You did.

198
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,352
Okay, let's go over the rules.

199
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,646
I'm pretty clear from
our phone conversation

200
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,606
- what the rules are.
- Recap for me.

201
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,900
We make all the bad stuff
go away, like this Becky...

202
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,570
- Man on the floor.
- You get to keep all the good stuff,

203
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,655
like your new friend Gretchen.
Am I right?

204
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,866
- Close enough.
- I will do my best{\, Claire},

205
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,035
but life isn't always that simple.

206
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,829
Let me get inside the room
and see what I can find.

207
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,706
- It's that one on the end.
- Okay.

208
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,792
{\ All right, Claire,} Why don't you go on
back to the dorm, back to your friend?

209
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,544
I'm coming with you, Claire.

210
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,213
What?
No. No, no, no.

211
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,966
We just went over the rules.
Don't you remember what {\the }rules are?

212
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,552
You are not supposed
to wipe Gretchen's memory.

213
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,138
She must be a really good friend.

214
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,099
Dad, just... please.

215
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,518
He's not going
to erase Gretchen's memory.

216
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,062
He's going with you
so that if Becky comes near,

217
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,106
she won't be able to stay invisible.

218
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,942
Okay?

219
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,781
That's actually a really good plan.

220
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,908
This is not my first rodeo.

221
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,160
Thanks, dad.

222
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,745
We'll regroup soon.

223
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,339
Come on, Rene.

224
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,387
He was helping you.

225
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,389
Exactly.

226
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,265
In his death,

227
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,851
he has helped me
prove a point about the line.

228
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:19,853
What line?

229
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,856
The one I can cross and you can't.

230
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,192
The one that says
I can do anything I want,

231
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,819
- like killing people in cold blood.
- No, you can't just...

232
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,822
The world is my hostage, Matt.

233
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,281
Anybody.

234
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:33,575
Anytime.

235
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,119
So no more sabotage, okay?
Because I'm the one

236
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,914
that's in control here.
Do you understand me?

237
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,292
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,129
I don't think I heard you.

239
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,093
I understand you.

240
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,472
Good.

241
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,863
I'm... fine.
I'm fine.

242
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,249
I can't...

243
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,043
Too many people need help.

244
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,172
This power, it keeps draining out of me,
and then it comes back,

245
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,258
and then it drains out of me again.

246
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,470
Maybe you shouldn't use it anymore.

247
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,183
And be ordinary?

248
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,647
I got to get back in there.

249
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,193
Thanks.

250
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,404
Hey, you know,
they could use your help.

251
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,657
Earlier I saw you
with the, uh, suture.

252
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,535
Where'd you learn how to do that?

253
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,953
Clown college.

254
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,123
Clown college.
Seriously.

255
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,920
Medical school.

256
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,464
I dropped out.

257
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,773
You're packing.

258
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,193
- Why are you packing?
- Because I'm going home.

259
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,612
Maybe forever.

260
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,572
No. No, no.
You can't do that.

261
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,574
I told you
that I was gonna handle it.

262
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,868
With what?
Baby powder?

263
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,329
That doesn't exactly
inspire confidence.

264
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,372
I know. I know.

265
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,418
And that's why I called my dad.

266
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,798
You're too important...

267
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:54,883
To me.

268
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,554
I just don't want to lose you.

269
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,519
I'm sorry.
I already booked my flight.

270
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,771
Wait.
You don't understand, okay?

271
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,189
This is Rene,

272
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,900
and he can keep Becky
from being able to turn invisible.

273
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,153
I'm scared for my life, okay?

274
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,238
- I know.
- Do you? Because...

275
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,825
Becky's after me. She's not after you,
because you can't get hurt.

276
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,076
But I can.

277
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,373
Gretchen,
everything's gonna be fine.

278
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,792
My dad and I have done this
a thousand times.

279
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:29,918
Exactly!

280
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,461
This is everyday life for you,

281
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,630
but it's not for me.

282
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,176
I'm just not like you.

283
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,524
Stay with her, please,
until she gets on the plane.

284
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,583
Can I help you?

285
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:12,627
Possibly.

286
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,379
Hopefully.

287
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,553
I apologize for this
awkward introduction...

288
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,306
and my more awkward agenda.

289
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,807
My name is Samuel,

290
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,268
and I'm here looking for
my niece, Rebecca.

291
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,482
{\pos(192,240)}And why would I know
where your niece is?

292
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,319
{\pos(192,240)}Because she told me
who you are, Claire.

293
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,030
{\pos(192,240)}At least a little bit.

294
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,740
{\pos(192,240)}I know you're special.

295
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,575
{\pos(192,240)}Like her. Like me.

296
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,994
I know you're asking yourself {\*right about now}

297
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,580
"Who is this guy?
What could he{\*possibly} know about me?"

298
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,833
Yeah, something like that.

299
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,128
I also know it's very hard
to trust anyone in this world being...

300
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,880
one of us.

301
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:59,299
So why should I trust you?

302
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,926
You shouldn't.

303
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,262
Not until you hear me out.

304
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,642
If you have a moment to listen,
I might have some answers for you.

305
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,389
I had a partner like you once.

306
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,685
As I recall, about 10,000 volts
of electricity

307
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,687
should make you materialize...

308
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,898
And then some.

309
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,735
Don't want to have to use this.

310
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,574
Why do I find that hard to believe?

311
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:14,040
Just you today?

312
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,835
{\pos(192,240)}I'm actually hungry enough
to eat for two.

313
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,050
If memory serves,
the Tahitian pancakes are really good.

314
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,301
And a coke.

315
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,388
A diet coke.

316
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,724
I'd say go for the real thing.

317
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,851
Life's too short
for artificial sweeteners.

318
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,394
Well, amen to that...

319
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,272
Lynette.

320
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,274
Regular coke it is.

321
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,031
She's so sweet.
Isn't Lynette so sweet?

322
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,366
Funny story...

323
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,660
I tried to kill
a waitress here once.

324
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,787
You can't kill her.

325
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,707
I'm sorry. Did you miss my whole
"the world is my hostage" bit earlier?

326
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,543
No, I got it. I got it.
I've done nothing.

327
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,837
- And I've kept quiet.
- And now...

328
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,797
I want you to talk.

329
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,008
Hostages are used to get things
that you want,

330
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,135
and I want to know everything...

331
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,764
Exactly how I ended up in your head,
and where the hell my body is.

332
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,859
It's nice and isolated back there.

333
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,738
Nobody'd ever hear her scream.

334
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,533
Come on.

335
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,044
Stop. Please.

336
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,921
Come on. Stop it.

337
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,674
Okay, fine.

338
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,219
Just tell me what I want to know.

339
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,515
Your choice.

340
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,393
Her life is in your hands.

341
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,982
Do you need something, sweetheart?

342
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:04,943
As a matter of fact, I do.

343
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,864
All right.
Fine, fine.

344
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,825
I'll tell you anything.
{\*you want to know.}

345
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,831
Thank you very much.

346
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,464
So you can move the earth?

347
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,300
Something like that.

348
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:30,051
We're all like you.

349
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,886
A family of sorts.
People with...

350
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,805
extraordinary abilities.

351
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,852
Rebecca came to us
when she was still very young.

352
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,770
{\*So}She's not really your niece?

353
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,731
A family is more than blood.

354
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,650
It's about trust,

355
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,527
about love.

356
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,030
About those who embrace you.

357
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,740
The real you.

358
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,742
Unconditionally.

359
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:57,579
Becky pushed my roommate
out the window. Do you embrace that?

360
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,164
No, of course not.

361
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,666
But Rebecca's complicated.

362
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,545
Her father was murdered
when she was just five years old.

363
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,173
Okay, but how is that my fault?

364
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,716
It's not.

365
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,094
You're not the one she's after.

366
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,221
It's all about you.

367
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,517
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

368
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,811
You don't remember me at all?

369
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,814
I guess you wouldn't.
You never saw me.

370
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,484
But I remember you.

371
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,821
I was five
when you came to my house,

372
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,824
when you tried to take me
and my dad away.

373
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,701
He told me to stay out of sight.

374
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,704
I had never seen him so scared.

375
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,631
And then in came my dad?

376
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,051
Shooting first,
asking questions later.

377
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,053
I'm sure he had a good reason.

378
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,140
The reason is we were different...
Potentially dangerous.

379
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,226
Your father needed neither
warrant nor probable cause.

380
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,269
Not for people like us.

381
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,313
Life is more complicated.

382
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,190
I hid under the bed and I wished...

383
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,984
Wished that you wouldn't find me.

384
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,117
And my wish came true.

385
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,827
You didn't see me.

386
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,578
Your ability manifested.

387
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,455
I kept making wishes,

388
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,708
that that whole night
had never happened,

389
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,793
for my dad to come back.

390
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,631
I have spent my entire life
wondering why I could make a wish

391
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,676
and save myself, but not him.

392
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,971
I thought perhaps
Becky moved past it, but...

393
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,639
She came to get revenge on him.

394
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,099
Through you.

395
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,518
{\*And then}When I found out
that you had a daughter,

396
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,937
I stopped making wishes
and I made a promise.

397
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,357
I'm gonna take away all of the dreams
that you had for her,

398
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,234
just like you did to me.

399
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,364
I'm sorry about your father.
I take responsibility for that.

400
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,826
But you're not going to hurt
my daughter.

401
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,995
I'm gonna hurt you both.

402
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,793
Becky, I picked up your costume.

403
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:13,673
- Hi. What are you doing in here?
- Just...

404
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,678
... looking for someone.
I guess she's gone. Excuse me.

405
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,810
I am truly sorry for what
happened to your roommate.

406
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,896
Both of them.

407
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,190
But it was good of you
to send the other away.

408
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,984
I didn't send her away.

409
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,862
She left.

410
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,534
{\*Well,}It's a slanted perspective
to see the extraordinary throught...

411
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,745
ordinary eyes.

412
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,373
Fear is easier than understanding.

413
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,795
So how do you deal with it?

414
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,841
By not having to deal with it.

415
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,513
I simply surrounded myself
with people who, by definition,

416
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:02,889
are like me.

417
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,727
It's a {\*whole }lot easier for someone like you
to understand you.

418
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:12,273
Which is why I came to you
and not your father.

419
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,737
We both know exactly what
he would do in this situation.

420
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,450
No, tell me.

421
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,412
What would Bennet do?

422
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,713
I don't mean you any harm.
I swear.

423
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,507
He said he was Becky's uncle.

424
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,342
You were stalling.

425
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,677
You kept me talking.

426
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:43,305
You seem to like to talk.

427
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,018
You actually think
that I would trust you over my dad?

428
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,271
I just ran into your niece.

429
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,772
She's...

430
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,858
not all there, is she?

431
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,735
Rebecca's a very disturbed girl.

432
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,614
But in all fairness,
you had a hand in that.

433
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,741
A responsibility.

434
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,623
{\*Okay,}Let's talk responsibility.
What do you know about this?

435
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,630
- What is that?
- Every time I see that compass,

436
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,007
it comes with a dead body.
First was Danko's.

437
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:23,261
Agent Danko killed my brother.
He started all this.

438
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,680
We didn't want any bloodshed.

439
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,057
{\*Well,}You forgot to tell
that to your knife-wielding friend

440
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,517
who sliced my guts open.

441
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:33,271
In the wrong hands, this compass
could mean trouble for my family.

442
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,815
We just need to stay hidden.

443
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,150
From who?

444
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,027
{\*Well,}For starters, you.

445
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,321
No offense, sir,
but you have a reputation

446
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,449
for scorching earth
to get to people like me.

447
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,873
Please, I just need to find Rebecca
and get her some help.

448
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,002
And I want some answers.

449
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,893
{\pos(192,240)}Help!

450
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,353
{\pos(192,240)}Somebody help!

451
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,777
- She's not breathing.
- Let's get her to the ER.

452
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:24,239
No time. It's a pneumothorax.
I can do this.

453
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,866
Thoracotomy kit.

454
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,996
Take over.

455
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,478
Hey, sweetheart.

456
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,230
You're gonna be okay, all right?

457
00:30:58,856 --> 00:30:59,899
You did it.

458
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,207
You {\*really }should watch how you treat us
in front of your daughter.

459
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,126
After all, she's like me.

460
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,588
You really ought to watch
what you say to my daughter.

461
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,258
Don't blame your father.

462
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,593
He really doesn't understand us.

463
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,762
Get in the car.

464
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,784
No, come on.

465
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,413
Dad, don't!

466
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,581
Look out!

467
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,048
Dad, no!

468
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,938
I'm so sorry.
You all right?

469
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,523
I'm sorry.

470
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,286
Okay, here's the truth.

471
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,497
After Peter took you down,

472
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,541
I pushed Nathan's memories
into your mind.

473
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,419
I made your body think
that it was him.

474
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,799
Your shape-shifting took care
of the rest. I'd never done this before.

475
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:51,886
I thought that I was pushing
all of Sylar out of that body.

476
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,514
I didn't... I had no idea...

477
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,183
that all of it would stay with me.

478
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,978
Well, that's just crazy.

479
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,317
Just the check, please, Lynette.

480
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:07,902
Thank you.

481
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,780
Clearly you didn't decide
to do this on your own.

482
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,365
Who else was involved?

483
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,285
Mama Petrelli, right?
Who else?

484
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,288
Everyone else thinks you're dead.

485
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,916
Well...

486
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,003
I was off to see the wrong brother.

487
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,047
I got to go find Nathan.

488
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,801
- Get my body back.
- Then what are you gonna do?

489
00:33:33,135 --> 00:33:34,136
Then...

490
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,013
I'm gonna kill...

491
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,559
every single person
even remotely involved.

492
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:12,008
You should really pay more attention
to what you're doodling on a napkin.

493
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,511
Police. Freeze.

494
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,972
What the hell are you doing?

495
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,599
I'm crossing that line.

496
00:34:21,183 --> 00:34:22,101
You told me...

497
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,104
that I'm not man enough
to take a life.

498
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,484
Well, you know what? You're wrong.
'cause I'm gonna take yours.

499
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,444
You're an idiot.
You'll die with me.

500
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,409
I know.

501
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:49,754
Gun!

502
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,170
I'm sorry I pushed you.

503
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,426
- It's okay. I don't bruise easy.
- No, you don't, do you?

504
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,479
{\pos(192,240)}You're amazing.

505
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,564
{\pos(192,240)}You know that?

506
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,318
{\pos(192,240)}Think you mean... extraordinary.

507
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,822
{\pos(192,240)}I want you to have everything.

508
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,865
You deserve it.

509
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,700
A social life.

510
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:03,077
The education.

511
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,580
The white picket fence.

512
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,790
All of it.

513
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,173
Well, as you said,
sometimes life just isn't that simple.

514
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,553
Good night.

515
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:27,476
Night, Claire Bear.

516
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,106
Who's that?

517
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,359
My nephew, Christopher.

518
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,744
He drowned.

519
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,291
I was babysitting, and...

520
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,294
I got distracted for a moment.

521
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,837
I didn't hear him.

522
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,511
I tried to revive him.

523
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:49,767
It was right before
my second year...

524
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:52,019
of residency.

525
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,647
That's why you dropped out.

526
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,751
Megan wanted you to have that.

527
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:19,422
She said it's only for
very special people.

528
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,221
Special.

529
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:30,182
I couldn't save him.

530
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,853
But you saved her.

531
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,115
You saved me.

532
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,493
Thank you.

533
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,502
Are you gonna go back to school?

534
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,337
Go be a doctor?

535
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,807
Can you see the colors?

536
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,810
I don't have that power anymore.

537
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,439
But we could still play...
if you like.

538
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,163
Still asystolic.

539
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,706
All right. 360.

540
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,003
Clear.

541
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,459
I'm sorry I had to do that to you.

542
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,588
I'm sorry that I messed things up
with Claire. I just...

543
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,840
Got impatient.
Sloppy.

544
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:28,133
Don't worry.

545
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,886
Might not have been the plan
as conceived, but...

546
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:33,931
I think Claire Bennet's right
where we want her to be.

547
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,434
Look, when I asked you to do this,
I promised you revenge,

548
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,979
and you'll still have it.

549
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,319
We have a problem.
A big problem.

550
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,071
What?

551
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,490
Sylar, he's gone.

552
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,169
Nathan, what are you... what?

553
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,838
- Thank God.
- What are you doing?

554
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:49,673
What's going on?

555
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,425
I think I'm in trouble, Pete.

556
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:56,805
