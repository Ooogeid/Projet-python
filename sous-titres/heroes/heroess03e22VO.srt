00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,680
Previously on Heroes...

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,710
Daphne!

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,660
This woman is dying.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,130
I need to get her to an emergency room.

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,620
I can't do anything to help her here.

6
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,650
I don't want you to help her.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,420
Got another assignment for you.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,270
I want the perimeter locked down.

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,770
A-team, rip apart the rectory.

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,580
All clear.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,750
I slept, and I had a dream.

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,540
I know what we have to do now.

13
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,920
We need to go find Nathan and Claire.

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,090
We need to bring this family together.

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,700
And they're coming for little Matt.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,830
We were sent to help.

17
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,400
Janice Parkman, we have a warrant to
bring you and your child in for questioning.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,380
We should pool our resources.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,150
You desperately want to find Martin

20
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,780
so you can get that ability, don't you?

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,680
Shape shifting.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,870
You're salivating.

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,350
It'd be a lot easier for us to operate

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,530
if everybody thinks I'm dead.

25
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,520
*******

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,880
No pulse.

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,290
No body temp.

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,120
Believe it.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,560
Sylar's dead.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,460
Impressive work.

31
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,010
I never did catch how you pulled it off.

32
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,160
Four-inch pocket blade.

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,450
Replaced by a six-inch metal spike.

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,400
Metal's a good choice.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,600
Last time it was glass.

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,550
Killed him just fine until it melted
in the primatech fire.

37
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,360
Oh, trust me.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,600
He won't be getting up again.

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,090
I've been chasing this one for a long time.

40
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,240
It's a funny thing.

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,770
You're on the hunt all these years, 

42
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,170
and I show up, and bang, he's dead.

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,870
Maybe you didn't really want to catch him.

44
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,070
Or maybe you're just better at this than me.

45
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,290
Bennet. You have a visitor downstairs.

46
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,280
Says she's your wife.

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,390
My wife is here?

48
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,170
Send her up.

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,670
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

50
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,220
and is no longer in service.

51
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,650
I've arranged travel to India.

52
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,800
If it's safe, I'll get
what I can from the apartment

53
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,680
and leave by ship from New York.

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
Avoid the airports. Smart.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,920
Washington's far too dangerous for us.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,620
You should come with me.

57
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,650
I'm not going anywhere.

58
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,240
Matt.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,230
Matt, I know how you feel about Daphne.

60
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,690
And what they did to her was inhuman, 
but this is--

61
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,310
What they did to Daphne was protocol.

62
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,120
She died because she was different.

63
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,560
I can't get over it, Mohinder.

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,320
I can't get it out of my head.

65
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,020
These agents, they're too powerful.

66
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,030
We tried to stop them before.

67
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,860
We went after the wrong guy.

68
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,960
Emile Danko, he's been
pushing this whole thing.

69
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,500
And that bastard killed Daphne just as
sure as he pulled the trigger himself.

70
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,960
So it's revenge.
You just want to see him die?

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,210
I want him hurt.

72
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,340
I want him to feel what he's done.

73
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,040
Matt, please, let's just talk about this.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,630
You've been a really good friend, Mohinder.

75
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,280
Good-bye, Mohinder.

76
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,570
Sandra, what are you doing here?

77
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,300
I am not gonna sit home any longer, Noah.

78
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,690
Agents burst into our house, 
our daughter goes missing, 

79
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,160
and you ignore my phone calls.

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,980
That's not fair.
I have returned all your calls.

81
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,650
And told me nothing.

82
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,570
I know when I'm being handled, Noah.

83
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,980
Claire is safe.

84
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,220
You know how this works.

85
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,780
The less you know, the better.

86
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,260
That's not good enough.

87
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,620
I can't believe a word you say, 
and I want to see my daughter.

88
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,620
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting your busy day?

89
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,320
There's a body inside.

90
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,770
They're telling me that it's Sylar, 
but I don't know.

91
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,080
Something just doesn't feel right.

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,720
Will you listen to yourself?

93
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,950
Claire has disappeared, 
and you are talking to me about Sylar.

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,340
You must be Mrs. Bennet.

95
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,960
I've seen your picture.

96
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,060
I'll bet you have.

97
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,320
From the surveillance cameras
watching my house?

98
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,980
Nice meeting you.

99
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,720
Sandra.

100
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,140
Please.

101
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,080
Go back to Costa Verde.

102
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,080
I am staying at the regency.

103
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,340
And I am not leaving until you find her.

104
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,110
It was fun being you.

105
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,390
Commanding the respect of others.

106
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,310
What the hell are you doing?

107
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,810
But you really ought to have
that mole checked.

108
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,030
You know the one I mean.

109
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,170
I showed Bennet the body.

110
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,860
Should have seen his face.

111
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,690
Do you know how dangerous this is?

112
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,650
This isn't a game.

113
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,910
It's not about you finding some
clever way to kill Noah Bennet.

114
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,090
I'm not gonna kill him.

115
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,380
I'm gonna destroy him.

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,390
This is Bennet.

120
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,780
Noah, Angela.

121
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,370
I've been worried about you.

122
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,890
I've had a dream.

123
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,540
Do you know about what happened
at the place called Coyote Sands?

124
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,520
I've heard whispers. Rumors.

125
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,610
For 20 years, anyone I ever asked
always told me the same thing.

126
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,940
Which is?

127
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,080
That I should never ask again.

128
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,310
Peter and I are headed there now.

129
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,380
I spoke with Nathan.

130
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,060
He and Claire will meet us.

131
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,610
I need you with us.

132
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,380
It's time everyone knew the truth.

133
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,990
Just have a few loose ends to tie up.

134
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,870
They showed me a body.

135
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,110
Our old friend with a
six-inch spike in his skull.

136
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,470
-Sylar?
-So they tell me.

137
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,610
There's only one way to be sure.

138
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,140
No, leave it alone, Noah, 
get out while you can.

139
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,500
Where'd they take the bodies?

140
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,780
Crematorium. Barbecue day.

141
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,650
No, leave it--
Are you listening to me?

142
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,860
Leave it alone.

143
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,440
Leave.
Noah, Noah.

144
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,090
Noah!

145
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,490
Someone's gonna have to pay for that.

146
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,450
Who took my papers? My father's work?

147
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,990
They said they were
from homeland security.

148
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,920
Also told me that if you
or the big guy showed up, 

149
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,510
I should give 'em a call.

150
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,080
I'd advise against it.

151
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,370
Might have to implicate you.

152
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,800
I checked the building before I came up.

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,140
No one's watching.

154
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,620
These guys must have got what they wanted.

155
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,120
First the feds, now you.

156
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,530
I don't need this in my life.

157
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,620
Don't worry.

158
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,910
I'll be gone tomorrow.

159
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,730
I don't believe this.

160
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,590
Oh, and your crazy old man, 
he left some stuff in storage downstairs.

161
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,180
Do me a favor.
When you go, take it with you.

162
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,570
Show me.

163
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,780
Oh, don't go getting all foreign on me.

164
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,820
Y'all are from the mother ship, huh?

165
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,700
Uh, habla a little ingleso?

166
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,480
Si. I am Hiro.

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,550
This is Ando.

168
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,370
And this is baby Matt Parkman.

169
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,240
Well, climb aboard, amigos.

170
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,110
Name's Sam Douglas from Lubbock, Texas.

171
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,880
Car trouble, huh?

172
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,210
Yes, we are trying to get to the
east coast to find the baby's father.

173
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,900
Yeah, I got me a buddy mechanic
in the next town.

174
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,770
He can get you all fixed up.

175
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,160
Oh, that's fantastic.

176
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,090
Thank you.

177
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,330
No problemo.

178
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,280
Yeah.

179
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,910
Well, let's rodeo.

180
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,050
Hey, everything shut down.
Ignition, electrical.

181
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,290
Even my cb went out.

182
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,740
Something's not right.

183
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,230
That's it, Emile. Feel it.

184
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,390
Feel it.

185
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,330
It's a hell of a thing
not knowing who you can trust.

186
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,730
That's it. Feel it.

187
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,820
The person closest to you is in danger.

188
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,910
Go to them.

189
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,320
Make sure they're okay.

190
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,230
Wait.

191
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,340
Stop. Don't move that body.

192
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,120
Mr. Bennet, can I help you?

193
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,660
-Draw your weapons.
-Sir?

194
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,160
Get a beat on the back of his head.
Do it!

195
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,520
Mr. Bennet.

196
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,150
Quiet.

197
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,200
Okay, I need this sent to Strathmore Labs.

198
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,990
I need a DNA analysis.

199
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,580
This is an a1 priority.

200
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,580
-You got it?
-Sure.

201
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,300
You want us to go ahead
and cremate the body?

202
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,120
I have a signed order
to cremate the body.

203
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,520
Mr. Bennet.

204
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,060
Who are you?

205
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,030
Alena.

206
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,770
Is everything all right?

207
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,370
Sandra, hi, come on in.

208
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,450
So this is your new home.

209
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,430
Well, you said it couldn't wait, 

210
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,440
so I assume you want
to know about Claire.

211
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,170
No, Claire's fine.
She called about a half an hour ago.

212
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,320
I just need you to sign these.

213
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,940
What is it?

214
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,270
It would be easier if you just sign.

215
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,270
Divorce?

216
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,310
This is the real reason you came
all the way to Washington?

217
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,930
Was to serve me? What does it say?

218
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,400
That you have perpetually lied to me, 

219
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,070
brought loaded guns into the home, 

220
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,620
endangered the lives of our children.

221
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,250
-Sandra.
-I already changed the locks, Noah.

222
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,520
-Just sign the damn papers.
-Now, Sandra, 

223
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,340
don't throw away 22 years of marriage.

224
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,420
Marriage? Is that what you call this?

225
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,970
This isn't a marriage.
It's an arrangement.

226
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,490
It's cover so you can go
around shooting at people.

227
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,310
Look, I'll be done with my work here soon.

228
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,520
I will come back to California.

229
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,650
-Don't insult me with promises.
-We will go to counseling.

230
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,650
It's too late.

231
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,440
We owe it to Lyle and to Claire...

232
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,270
-You're not listening.
-To try to hold this family together.

233
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,570
It's too late. I don't love you anymore!

234
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,000
You're a liar and a betrayer.

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,500
You say you care about your family.

236
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,000
You don't.

237
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,290
It's over, Noah.

238
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,070
I don't love you. I don't trust you.

239
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,190
I don't even respect you.

240
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,990
And when that's gone...

241
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,050
Look, I'm sorry for all y'all's troubles, 

242
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:13,730
but what say we try moving your magic
baby the hell away from my truck?

243
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,260
Well, I still got a load to deliver.

244
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,960
Thank you for the ride.

245
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,310
Good luck to yous.

246
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,170
Come on, baby Matt Parkman.

247
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,500
Please.

248
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,750
I make a funny face for you.

249
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,820
Come on, baby Matt.
Look at uncle Ando.

250
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,640
In English, Alena.

251
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,720
You promised you'd practice.

252
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,530
For you, Jakob.

253
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,800
But only you.

254
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,240
Do you really have to leave so soon?

255
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,660
I told you. This was all last minute.

256
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,490
I have to fly back to Chicago tonight.

257
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,980
I know, I know.
"A mix-up at the warehouse.

258
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,470
" Car's here.

259
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,830
I gotta go.

260
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,140
Give me a smile.

261
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,740
I'll be back in Washington before you know it.

262
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,440
Who are you? How did you get in here?

263
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,750
The door, uh-- I'm sorry.

264
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,670
I'm sorry. This was a bad idea.

265
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,180
I don't believe it.

266
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,200
They sent you to me, didn't they?

267
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,320
Sent me?

268
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,510
The escort service.

269
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,740
They gave you my address, right?

270
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,560
I told them I was finished.

271
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,380
No more. But they never listen.

272
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,430
So the guy who was just here was a client?

273
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,910
Mr. Prodasa.

274
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,070
Mr. Prodasa.

275
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,830
How do you know about Jakob?

276
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,280
Jakob and I work together.

277
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,630
He asked me to meet him here.

278
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,660
You're from his work.

279
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,700
Yeah.

280
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,950
I've never met any of his friends.

281
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,770
But now that I have you, I insist.

282
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,720
Please, sit.

283
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,420
Strathmore Labs. This is Nigel.

284
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,830
This is Noah Bennet.

285
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,170
I'm awaiting results of a DNA sample
I sent earlier today.

286
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,030
Yes, Mr. Bennet, 
I was just emailing you now.

287
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,810
DNA matches one James Martin
of Arlington, Virginia.

288
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,700
Martin.

289
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,010
Thank you.

290
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,210
Sylar's a shape-shifter.

291
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,700
Have you been seeing Jakob a while now?

292
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
Almost a year.

293
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,500
Jakob and I met through the...

294
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,070
He ever talk to you about his work?

295
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,770
A bit.

296
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,750
School books.

297
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,610
He says his company sells
all over the world.

298
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,540
It sounds boring, actually.

299
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,680
Yeah.

300
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,210
Well, his sales calls
do keep him on the move.

301
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,280
That and his family.

302
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,380
He talks to you about his family?

303
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,980
His wife.

304
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,490
Two boys, yes.

305
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,990
He told me about them right away.

306
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,870
He's going home to Chicago
to be with them, 

307
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,240
but he promised once
his children are grown that we--

308
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,150
You were gonna be together, yeah.

309
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,610
After what I have been through, 
it is a miracle.

310
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,950
To have someone like
Jakob come into your life.

311
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,220
He loves me.

312
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,530
You know what?

313
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,340
The sick thing is...

314
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,210
he probably does.

315
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,800
But he does not deserve you.

316
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,050
Whatever you think he is, 
it's a lie, Alena, a lie.

317
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,640
And you need to get away from him now, 
while you still can.

318
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,220
No, you are scaring me.

319
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,760
Who are you, really?

320
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,990
You want me to tell you all about Jakob?

321
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,720
I'm gonna show you.

322
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,770
Hello, Dr. Suresh?

323
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,120
This is Hiro Nakamura.

324
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,080
Yes, I know.

325
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,780
My very angry landlord said
you've been calling all day.

326
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,720
Yes, it is important that
we find Matt Parkman.

327
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,970
Do you know where he is?

328
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,080
Still in Washington, I'm afraid.

329
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,920
I did what I could.

330
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,610
But...

331
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,130
Hiro, Matt's changed.

332
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,790
He's committed himself to
a very destructive course.

333
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,610
What? We must save him.

334
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,360
Believe me, I tried.

335
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,890
It's difficult to dissuade a man

336
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,970
who's decided he has
nothing to live for.

337
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,820
I'll tell you the place
where Matt was last headed.

338
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,940
Thank you, Dr. Suresh.

339
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,220
What's it called again?

340
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,000
Coyote Sands.

341
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,400
Here it is.

342
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,310
Looks like a million miles from nowhere.

343
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,840
Why do we have to meet her there?

344
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,450
I have no idea.

345
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,860
When your grandmother has a dream, 
it's a good idea to pay attention.

346
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:37,190
It appears my father was looking for information
on an abandoned government project in the 1960s.

347
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,930
Focusing on an "Operation Icarus."

348
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,990
Files are heavily redacted, 
but it mentions medical research

349
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,190
and a place called Coyote Sands.

350
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,070
My father was there.

351
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,370
There's cash in my purse.

352
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,650
I'm not here for your money.

353
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,370
Noah.

354
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,020
You say another word and you die.

355
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,820
Noah, what are you doing?

356
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,230
Divorce papers?

357
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,500
Nice.

358
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,340
Did you really think I wouldn't notice
that your signature doesn't match?

359
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,280
What are you talking about?

360
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,950
Sandra never even
left California, did she?

361
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,130
Noah, it's me. It's sandra.

362
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,460
Shut up. I know who you are.

363
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,990
Your mother's name is Anita.

364
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,500
We honeymooned in Puerto Vallarta.

365
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,330
- You've done your homework.
- You sleep on your left side.

366
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,480
- Your joints ache when--
- You can mind-read now?

367
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,620
- What?
- Who did you kill?

368
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,610
- Matt Parkman?
- I didn't kill anyone.

369
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,730
Danko's in on it, isn't he?

370
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,520
He was going after James Martin.

371
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,910
Did he feed you his catch?

372
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,060
- Noah.
- Answer me.

373
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,080
Is Danko in on it?

374
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,260
I don't know what you're talking about!

375
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,750
Noah! Please, the kids.
Don't do this.

376
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,630
Where's your phone?
Where is it?

377
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,860
What? In my coat pocket.

378
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,480
Hello.

379
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,180
Dad.

380
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,180
Lyle, what do you need?

381
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,690
Um, I'm supposed to give Muggles
some kind of pill while mom's away.

382
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,760
I forgot where she keeps the pills.

383
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,560
Where are Muggles' pills?

384
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,030
I don't know.

385
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,450
Top shelf of the
refrigerator on the left.

386
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,160
Not the green bottle, the brown one.

387
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,710
Top shelf of the fridge on the left.

388
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,390
The green bottle or the brown one?

389
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,740
Brown.

390
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,180
Get out.

391
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,390
Sylar's a shape-shifter.

392
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,350
- Leave.
- He came to me as you.

393
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,350
You filed for divorce, 
you'd changed the locks.

394
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,600
Probably a good idea.

395
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,340
No, no, Sandra, don't you understand?

396
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,110
This is exactly what he wants.

397
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,600
Get out!

398
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,830
You gotta believe me.

399
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,930
I do believe you, Noah.

400
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,490
But it doesn't matter.

401
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,180
It's too late.

402
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,200
I really want you to leave.

403
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,230
Now.

404
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,080
Alena.

405
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,970
What are you doing here?

406
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,160
I don't understand.

407
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,840
You live here?

408
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,360
Damn it, Alena, 
I'm not gonna ask you again.

409
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,190
How did you find me?

410
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,420
I brought her here.

411
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,690
Parkman.

412
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,200
What the hell did you do to her?

413
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,620
Inside. Both of you.

414
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,600
Don't even think about it.

415
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,060
Even if this place is bugged, 
your soldiers won't get here in time.

416
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,360
So this is what you've been reduced to?

417
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,400
What kind of garbage did you push
into her head to get her to come along?

418
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,740
It didn't take much, Danko.

419
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,850
Danko?

420
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,460
Why does he call you that?

421
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,080
And this place, you said you
lived in Chicago with your family.

422
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,530
Stop, Alena. Don't listen to him.
He'll work you.

423
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,280
Make you believe
things that aren't real.

424
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,220
What's the matter, Emile?

425
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,800
What, are you worried she's not
gonna roll out the red carpet

426
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,900
when she finds out what her
boyfriend really does for a living?

427
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,540
Oh, shove the psychobabble, Parkman.

428
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,260
You have no idea who I am.

429
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,220
I used to be a cop.
I was surrounded by basket cases like you.

430
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,640
Your job's a nightmare, so you
seek out anything to ease the pain.

431
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,510
Nothing relationships.

432
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,020
Fantasies of a normal life.
Trust me, I've been there.

433
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,570
Go to hell.

434
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,080
Your boyfriend kills
people for a living.

435
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,740
Jakob, tell me you are not this person.

436
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,930
Go ahead, Danko.

437
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,870
Tell her.

438
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,590
My name isn't Jakob.

439
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,520
There is no family in Chicago.

440
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,620
No house.

441
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,430
I'm a soldier.

442
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,260
I hunt people for the government.

443
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,880
Son of a bitch.

444
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,580
Tell her what you did
to the woman I loved.

445
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,720
All of it.

446
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,930
The woman, Millbrook...

447
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,420
Daphne...

448
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,960
she was a threat.

449
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,630
You killed her?

450
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,530
No, it's worse than that.

451
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,120
He had a choice, and he let her die.

452
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,660
You were everything to me, Jakob.

453
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,210
Why did you lie?

454
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,930
Because I knew you couldn't possibly
love someone who did these things.

455
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,500
You really care about her, don't you?

456
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,580
This is the only way...

457
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,640
that you're gonna truly understand...

458
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,160
what you did to me.

459
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,870
Go ahead, Parkman.

460
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,820
But if you think killing her
is gonna make a difference, 

461
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,400
or change how I feel about
the program, forget it.

462
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,730
Whatever you do, nothing's ever
gonna be more important to me

463
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,010
than putting you and your friends down.

464
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,520
My god, Jakob.

465
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,930
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,690
I'm so sorry.

467
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,390
This is what he's done to us.

468
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,050
In his world there's
no room for mercy...

469
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,510
Jakob, no!

470
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,000
Go ahead.

471
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,790
Finish it.

472
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,670
Close one.

473
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,290
Parkman!

474
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,190
Alena.

475
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,510
Monster.

476
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,100
Stay away from me.

477
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,340
What is it, Bennet?

478
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,450
Guess again.

479
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,960
I went to Bennet's apartment and
told his doorman that I forgot my key.

480
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,520
Bennet's old Primatech files.

481
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,940
Looks like he's been holding out on you.

482
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,590
I'm not surprised.

483
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,930
No? Are you surprised now?

484
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,680
If I were Sylar, I wouldn't
need this now, would I?

485
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,560
Gun.

486
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,970
I knew he couldn't have
gotten to James Martin alone.

487
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,430
Not right under your nose.

488
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,300
What do you want?

489
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,000
How dumb are you?

490
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,430
How did you think it was gonna end?

491
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,010
Who did you think would be left
standing the minute Sylar got bored?

492
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,260
You?

493
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,530
- What do you want?
- I want Sylar on a platter.

494
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,820
Then maybe I'll overlook this
pathetic little cry for help.

495
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,330
He's been going on assignment as
agent donner, leader of team six.

496
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,050
They've been racking
up a lot of wins lately.

497
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,100
Where are they now?

498
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,890
On a mission.

499
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,860
They should be back in an hour.

500
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,860
I'll wait.

501
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,340
And so will you.

502
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,390
I know you meant well, Hiro, 
but I didn't ask to be rescued.

503
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,220
Dr. Suresh told us about your plan.

504
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,400
It is one thing to defend yourself.

505
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,430
But a true warrior knows the difference
between a righteous battle and--

506
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,620
What, retribution?
See, that's where you're wrong.

507
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,530
It's the only thing that
the other side understands.

508
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,190
But that is why we are better than them.

509
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,450
That is why we had to save you.

510
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,190
Matt!

511
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,170
Finally.

512
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,990
What's going on?

513
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,130
I cannot make the face anymore.

514
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,090
What's with the kid?

515
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,820
Matt Parkman, meet Matt Parkman.

516
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,820
He is your son.

517
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,890
Wait.

518
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,540
My son?

519
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,170
We rescued him from government
agents in California.

520
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,850
He has a power like us.

521
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,080
This is why you can't give up.

522
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,400
A boy needs his father.

523
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,570
I have a son.

524
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,580
I have a son.

525
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,510
Outstanding. Great work.

526
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,130
Wade.

527
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,590
Good job.

528
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,870
Agent Donner.

529
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,920
Yes, sir.

530
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,360
A word, please?

531
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,010
I do something wrong?

532
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,780
Just wanted to say congrats.

533
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,960
You guys have really
been on a roll lately.

534
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,980
Thank you, sir.

535
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,280
This man is not Donner.

536
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,220
He's Sylar.
He has shape-shifting abilities.

537
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,810
Get a lock on the back of his head.

538
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,770
Whoa, whoa, guys.

539
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,350
It's just me.

540
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,170
Tell 'em, Danko.

541
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,120
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

542
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,360
Agent Danko has betrayed you.

543
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,000
He and Sylar are working against you.

544
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,000
Guys, this is a huge mistake.

545
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,190
Put the gun down, Bennet.

546
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,400
This is Sylar.

547
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,600
He's killed a dozen agents, and
Danko is protecting him.

548
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,990
Everybody, stand down.

549
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,630
Look, you're under a lot of stress.

550
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,180
Yeah, because of the
divorce and everything.

551
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,290
How would you know a thing like that?

552
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,620
Everybody, freeze.

553
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,290
This is Sylar, and I can prove it.

554
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,020
He's gonna heal. You watch.

555
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,720
Now get up.

556
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,300
Get up. Get up.

557
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,230
Get up!

558
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,170
He's dead.

559
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,590
Sylar was never even in the building.

560
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,470
You just killed an innocent man.

561
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,730
Nobody move.

562
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,510
Put your weapons on
the ground right now.

563
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,670
Weapons down, 
or I will blow his head off.

564
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,930
Get him!

565
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,550
I didn't have a lot of options.

566
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,220
I had to direct him somewhere.

567
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,740
It seemed the safest choice.

568
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,840
You almost got me killed.
You could have said I was Agent Foster.

569
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,700
Except if Bennet shot Foster, 
Foster would be dead.

570
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,980
I didn't know you could bleed like that.

571
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,130
I squeezed out a little extra.

572
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,990
For show.

573
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,580
Sandra, just called to say...

574
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,170
I don't know what.
I love you.I miss you.

575
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,210
I miss my family.

576
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,610
All my old numbers are burned.

577
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,050
I can't leave you this one.

578
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,870
I'll call again when it's safe.

579
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,540
Alena, it's me.

580
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,260
I know how you must feel.

581
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,080
Betrayed.

582
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,500
Angry. But what I said before, 
it's not true.

583
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,690
You mean so much to me.

584
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,580
The way I am with you, it's not a lie.

585
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,430
Jakob Prodasa is the man I want to be.

586
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,200
I can't do it without you.

587
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,960
I'm begging you.

588
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,190
Please.

589
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,480
Give me a chance to prove myself.

590
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,550
I still don't understand
what we're doing out here, mom.

591
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,690
This is the place, Peter.

592
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,930
This is where our story really begins.

593
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,600
Yeah?

594
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,120
Why did you call him here?

595
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,200
This family has to come together.

596
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,940
Whatever has happened, 
Nathan is still your brother.

597
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,400
Yeah, well, I have a hard
time believing that.

598
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,480
Peter.

599
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,150
Claire, it's all right. Let him vent.

600
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,010
Enough.

601
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,030
There's been too much
misery in this place.

602
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,030
What happened here, ma?
Why'd you call us together?

603
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,810
I never wanted you to see this.

604
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,490
Any of you.

605
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,370
But I realize now that was a mistake.

606
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,930
And to prepare for the future, 
you have to understand the past.

607
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,270
You want the answers?

608
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,020
Then you'll have to dig.

609
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,860
It is our nature to
protect our children.

610
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,620
For each generation to pass on
their cautionary tales to the next.

611
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,470
So it is with the myth of Icarus, 
the legend of a boy who fashioned

612
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,330
wings from feathers and wax, 
daring to fly into the heavens.

613
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,450
I need a light.

614
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,860
His father was fearful and
warned Icarus to be careful.

615
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,030
Find something?

616
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:19,090
Begging him not to tempt fate
by flying too close to the sun.

617
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,990
But in the end, the boy couldn't resist.

618
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,370
His waxen wings melted
from the sun's rays.

619
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,860
Mom.

620
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,990
And he plunged...

621
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,710
to his death.

622
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,550
You know who that was?

623
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,750
I knew...

624
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,860
all of them.

625
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,970
All of them?

626
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,260
Exactly how many are here, mom?

627
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,650
Keep digging.
