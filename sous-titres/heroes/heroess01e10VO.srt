1
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:03,628
<i>To everything, there is a season,</i>

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,621
<i>and a time to every purpose.</i>

3
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:07,366
The world needs to know
about my findings,

4
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:08,544
that's all that's important!

5
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:11,246
It is one thing to publish a book
in the comfort of the university,

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,032
it is another to leave
everything behind,

7
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:15,047
chasing a theory that is pure fantasy!

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,493
<i>The earth spins at 1,000 miles an hour</i>

9
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:20,275
<i>as we desperately try to keep
from being thrown off.</i>

10
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:24,907
<i>Like the first blush of winter
that signals a great migration.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,041
<i>Was there any warning of their arrival?</i>

12
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,102
She has a name: Jessica.

13
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:39,136
<i>A sign, a single event
that set this chain into motion?</i>

14
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:42,806
This is what you've been waiting for.

15
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:44,658
<i>Was it a whisper in God's ear?</i>

16
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:46,308
Be the one we need.

17
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:48,579
<i>Survive. Adapt.<i>

18
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:49,949
<i>Escape.</i>

19
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,755
<i>And if we could mark
that single moment in time,</i>

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,173
<i>that first hint of the prophecy
of approaching danger...</i>

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,916
I found a tape of a conversation
my father had with a man named Sylar.

22
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:02,353
<i>Hello, Chandra, you made me this way.</i>

23
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,273
<i>... would we have done anything
differently?</i>

24
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:08,073
<i>Could it have been stopped?</i>

25
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:09,559
<i>You helped me to discover</i>

26
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:10,775
<i>my potential.</i>

27
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:13,167
<i>Or was the die long ago cast?</i>

28
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:15,396
<i>And if we could go back,</i>

29
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:16,943
<i>alter its course,</i>

30
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:19,239
<i>stop it from happening... would we?</i>

31
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,137
My name is Hiro Nakamura!

32
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:37,917
I'm here to save your life!

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,116
Hey, Charlie!

34
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:43,819
Charlie, come on over here,
and blow out the candles!

35
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:46,236
Hold that thought, okay?
I just gotta make a wish.

36
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:47,374
Come on.

37
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:50,109
Come on, honey!

38
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:54,909
Please, listen.

39
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,204
Very important.

40
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,356
Say: "cheese!"

41
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:48,945
Can I help you?

42
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:51,106
I hope so, Mr. Gray.

43
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:57,138
I can fix it.

44
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:59,145
My watch isn't broken.

45
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:01,012
Actually, it is.

46
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:12,270
Yeah, the self-winding coil is loose.

47
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,196
Your watch is running two seconds slow.

48
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,337
How did you know?

49
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:19,051
Just a talent I have for...
the way things work...

50
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:21,395
how the parts should go.

51
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,886
That looks rather complicated.

52
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:24,818
That... The body's standard,

53
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,541
but the parts, the insides, are German.

54
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,407
1917.

55
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,755
I've been working on it for seven years.

56
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:38,495
How much do I owe you?

57
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:39,963
Please.

58
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,407
Don't worry about it.

59
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,483
You didn't come here for the watch.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,475
I came to find you, Gabriel.

61
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,534
My name is Chandra Suresh.
I'm a geneticist.

62
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,733
I have a theory about human evolution.

63
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,118
And I believe you...

64
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:00,915
are a part of it.

65
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,364
Read it.

66
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:06,027
If you'd like to talk more, I've written
my phone number and address inside.

67
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:36,304
License and registration.

68
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,671
Oh, this isn't my car, I kinda stole it.

69
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:41,838
Can you take off the glasses for me,
please?

70
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,522
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car.

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,375
No, I don't feel like it.

72
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,406
That wasn't a suggestion.

73
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:57,311
Well, here's a suggestion.

74
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:00,005
Why don't you go get back in your car,

75
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:01,621
and eat a dozen donuts.

76
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,452
That is what you cops like to do, right?

77
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:07,537
I said step out of the car. Now.

78
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:12,214
I think you really want to eat
some donuts.

79
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:53,312
Major developments!

80
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:54,553
Lori Trammel skanked

81
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,650
her way through the entire
football team!

82
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,039
Who told you that?

83
00:05:58,078 --> 00:05:59,548
The entire football team.

84
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:02,475
Anyway, somehow she found shame
and resigned.

85
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,298
Turned in her pom-poms...

86
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:07,553
I'm in? Are you kidding?

87
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:09,317
Claire, destiny is calling you.

88
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:11,645
Come on, try it on.
You can model, I'll take pictures.

89
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,245
We'll totally commiserate the event.

90
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:14,629
I think you mean "commemorate."

91
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:16,732
And...I'll try it on later.

92
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:19,570
'Kay, most girls can't wait to get
their uniforms on. I mean,

93
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,420
except Lori Trammel.
She couldn't wait to take it off.

94
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:24,422
Why do you have to be like that?

95
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:27,947
Okay, first of all, I've earned that.
And if you don't want it or this,

96
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,583
Kristy Chan is salivating
for your position.

97
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:31,837
I want it, I do.

98
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:32,976
Then show it!

99
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:35,225
Show me some S.P.I.R.I.T!

100
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,865
I'm not gonna drool!

101
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:38,254
Then prove it, Claire!

102
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:39,547
Prove it!

103
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:46,589
Oh, my God.

104
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,139
What were you girls doing?

105
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,463
This is gonna need stitches.

106
00:06:50,482 --> 00:06:52,132
I'm gonna take her
to the emergency room.

107
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:53,889
Jackie, honey, grab my purse. Let's go.

108
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:55,401
Come on, come on.

109
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,894
<i>- Mr. Bennett?</i>
- Yes.

110
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:01,804
My name is Chandra Suresh.

111
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,578
I need to speak to you
about your daughter Claire.

112
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:11,460
No, no.

113
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,458
I teleport from future.

114
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:15,599
Do not go to work tomorrow.

115
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:17,181
Very, very...

116
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:21,136
it wasn't raining yesterday.

117
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:24,126
April showers.

118
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,637
It's been storming all week.

119
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,591
April? No, no, October.

120
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:31,223
No, april 24th. It's my birthday.

121
00:07:47,744 --> 00:07:49,073
Birthday cake?

122
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:51,611
Happy birthday.

124
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,616
Hi, my name is Niki.

125
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:14,914
And I'm an alcoholic.

126
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:16,940
Hi, Niki.

127
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,893
I'm one year sober today.

128
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:20,810
Happy anniversary!

129
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,068
I work 60 hours a week.

130
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,113
I stink of cigarettes.

131
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,357
I got a kid so smart
that he is flunking out of school.

132
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:40,956
My husband can't find a job because
no one wants to hire an ex-con.

133
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,291
There's a leak in the roof.

134
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,275
And I'm feelin' thirsty.

135
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,444
Feels like too much for one person.

136
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,567
So why are you here?

137
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:01,186
I don't want another year to go by
without you in my life, Nicole.

138
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:04,270
Not being in your life
was never my choice.

139
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:05,977
You kinda made that happen.

140
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:07,902
Look, I know how you feel about me.

141
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,069
And Lord knows I deserve it.

142
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:12,001
I was awful to you,
and everyone I ever met.

143
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:14,533
You weren't awful,
you just weren't there.

144
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,687
You can't be awful
if you're not present.

145
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,413
You know, I'm married now.

146
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,254
I heard. Look, Nicole...

147
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,909
I would love to meet him some time.

148
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:29,194
I really want to get to know
my grandson and my son-in-law.

149
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:31,259
And you.

150
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:37,898
Yeah, well, I don't know
if I'm ready to get to know you.

151
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:48,759
Hey. What's going...?

152
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:50,355
Ladies, ten and a half.

153
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,809
You know, the reason I became a nurse
was to wear shoes like this,

154
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:55,268
- thank you very much.
- Of course.

155
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,037
- Get a drink?
- Yeah, it's right inside.

156
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:59,172
- I told him it wasn't funny.
- I know.

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,385
- Hey, mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

158
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,608
- How are you? Come on in.
- I'm good.

159
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,581
Your father is very proud of you.

160
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,829
- And still couldn't make it.
- Well, he had a meeting.

161
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:12,467
Mr. Linderman's in Atlantic City...

162
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,609
Listen, I did this without his blessing,

163
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,345
and without his money.

164
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:19,140
Okay? So I think it's only right
that we celebrate without him.

165
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,913
I have always wanted a nurse
in the family.

166
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,258
- We have enough lawyers.
- Thanks, mom.

167
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,287
So, Peter, have you chosen a specialty?

168
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:39,332
I'm thinking of hospice care.

169
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:41,396
Taking care of dead people?

170
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:42,612
They're not dead.

171
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:43,866
They're dying.

172
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:45,207
And I think it's noble.

173
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:47,021
Thank you.

174
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,098
What's the pay?

175
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:50,845
Honey.

176
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,117
You know, I'm gonna go call the sitter,
and when I come back...

177
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:56,722
you are gonna dance with me.

178
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:10,012
What's going on?

179
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:13,330
The DA wants me to prosecute Linderman.

180
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:16,845
Dad's biggest client.

181
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:22,232
The DA thinks Linderman's
mob ties run so deep,

182
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,460
if I can take him down,
the empire crumbles.

183
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:26,042
You do that, though,

184
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,389
dad'll go down too.

185
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,553
You used to tell him

186
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:31,880
he was a criminal

187
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:33,572
for protecting criminals.

188
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,604
Here's a chance to set things straight.

189
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,885
Take the stink off the family na...

190
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:41,043
He's still our father.

191
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,644
No matter what he's done.

192
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:44,448
You go after him,

193
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:46,695
you're never going to forgive yourself.

194
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,049
Ever.

195
00:11:58,745 --> 00:11:59,883
Come on, handsome.

196
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:05,778
- Hold this for me, will you?
- Yep.

197
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:07,482
May I?

198
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,994
So... what? You're gonna cut me open?

199
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:34,540
I'd like to run some tests.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,528
EEG, EKG, nothing invasive.

201
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,580
A friend at Columbia

202
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:41,470
has access to an MRI.

203
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,549
Mapping the brain ?

204
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:46,520
Measuring alpha waves,
resting rates, neuron clusters.

205
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:49,562
The brain controls

206
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:52,176
every human action,
voluntary or involuntary.

207
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:53,892
Every breath, every heartbeat,

208
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,203
every emotion.

209
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,094
If the...

210
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,757
soul exists,

211
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,637
scientifically speaking,

212
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,914
it exists in the brain.

213
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:06,390
When I was a kid...

214
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:10,769
I used to wish some stranger

215
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:13,599
would come and tell me my family
wasn't really my family.

216
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,879
They weren't bad people,

217
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,089
they were just...

218
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:19,366
insignificant.

219
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:22,444
And I wanted to be different.

220
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:25,506
Special. I wanted to change.

221
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,091
A new name, a new life.

222
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:31,722
The watchmaker's son...

223
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,175
became a watchmaker.

224
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,923
It is so futile.

225
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,374
And I wanted to be...

226
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:43,227
important.

227
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,832
You are important, Gabriel.

228
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:49,388
What do you think my abilities might be?

229
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:52,160
Grand theft auto, larceny,

230
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:53,813
robbery, arson,

231
00:13:54,664 --> 00:13:56,860
and suspected of murder in Oklahoma.

232
00:13:57,648 --> 00:14:00,430
That's no way for a young lady
to behave, now is it?

233
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,363
You need a goal, Eden purpose.

234
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,698
Let me go.

235
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:14,685
Now!

236
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,820
You know, with your ability,

237
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:24,811
you can get anything you want.

238
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:26,528
Created your own morality.

239
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:30,094
There's no person in the world
that could say no to you.

240
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,006
Now there is.

241
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,144
Matt.

242
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:10,590
What are you doing?

243
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:13,464
What?

244
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:16,807
What are you doing sitting here?
Detective test is in an hour.

245
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,762
- Right.
- You're not chickening out, are you?

246
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:22,144
No, man, of course not.

247
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:25,091
All right, good, 'cause second time's
the charm for you, I can feel it.

248
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,737
Just don't go being a nervous wreck
this time, okay?

249
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:29,589
What's up with the donut?

250
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:36,542
You're like a walking cliche.

251
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,038
Yeah, well, you know what?

252
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:45,962
After today, I am gonna be
a different man.

253
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:47,745
Confidence! I like that.

254
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,236
Right? Let's go crush it.

255
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,751
Hello, what's up?

256
00:15:57,575 --> 00:15:59,697
I don't know what we'd do
without you, Hiro.

257
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:01,774
Because, you have such
an amazing attitude.

258
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,009
I have gift for you.

259
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:09,266
Happy birthday.

260
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,289
A Japanese phrasebook.

261
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,565
I love it.

262
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,678
Oh, now we can understand
each other better.

263
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:25,050
Maybe you visit Japan.

264
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,406
Very soon.

265
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:29,383
Get out of Midland, far away.

266
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,172
You speak Japanese very quickly.

267
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:40,108
Lately, I've just been able
to remember everything.

268
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,171
You have power,

269
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,791
big memory.

270
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:47,322
It will only get stronger in the future.

271
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,460
The future. Right.

272
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,695
I keep forgetting
that's where you come from.

273
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,969
You don't believe me?

274
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,666
I bend time and space.

275
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,198
Yeah, of course you do.

276
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,525
Charlie, honey. Your order's up.

277
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,869
- Where'd these come from?
- Flower store,

278
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:11,968
two blocks from here.

279
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:13,685
Funny.

280
00:17:16,154 --> 00:17:18,117
Hang on, I have an order up.

281
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:19,255
Already finished.

282
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:24,465
Lynette!

283
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:26,612
You have got to see this!

284
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:28,406
Hiro's a magician!

285
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:29,506
Oh, no,

286
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:30,760
it's not a trick.

287
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,948
A very, very bad man

288
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:42,090
is going to come here and...

289
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,890
tomorrow, the Swallow

290
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,270
will slay the Dragon.

291
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,512
Having a drink with your sister?

292
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,113
Thinking about it.

293
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,291
Used to be,

294
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:14,735
couldn't go an hour
without missing Jessica.

295
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:21,739
It's important not to forget.

296
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:29,909
Hal is back.

297
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,462
He came to one of my meetings.

298
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:37,053
He wants to meet you and Micah.

299
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,267
He won't meet anybody
unless you want him to.

300
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:42,444
He's got money.

301
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:46,177
He could...  he could help with tuition.

302
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:49,169
We can get Micah
into that private school.

303
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:51,982
Now, you wanna have Hal over,
let's have him over for dinner.

304
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,981
We can all say a prayer for Jessica.

305
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,687
My brother Peter, the hospice nurse.

306
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:08,785
Can you believe it?

307
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:10,203
It's a perfect fit.

308
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,535
He's selfless and empathic...

309
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:14,122
he's self-centered and righteous.

310
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:15,356
Self-righteous.

311
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:16,940
He's a hell of a lot nicer than you.

312
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:18,174
He can afford to be.

313
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,260
He hasn't been under as much scrutiny.

314
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:24,862
My dad did what he had to do
to take care of his family.

315
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,585
And that's something that Peter
is never gonna understand.

316
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:29,205
And you do.

317
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:31,370
It's my responsibility.

318
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,024
It's my inherited... birthright.

319
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:38,548
I didn't ask to be dad's favorite.

320
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,561
I never asked to be loved more
than Peter, but that's just...

321
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,336
the reality.

322
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:49,938
What does this guy want?

323
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,507
How is she?

324
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,440
She's been in surgery for ten hours.

325
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,271
It's something with her back, her spine.

326
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:53,871
I should probably call mom.
She's got the kids.

327
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:56,008
It's what Heidi would do.
You have your phone?

328
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,952
You're not hurt?

329
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,116
Landed 300 feet away from the wreck.

330
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,055
Couldn't tell you how I got there.

331
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:05,622
Couldn't tell you much of anything.

332
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,124
Let me see that, let me see.

333
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,715
Yeah, that's a bad cut.
You need to lie down.

334
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,462
No, not until Heidi's all right.

335
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:12,887
Won't get a signal.

336
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:14,297
Do you remember the other car?

337
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,638
- What?
- In the accident.

338
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:26,018
Who told you that?

339
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,525
I had a dream right before you called.

340
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:33,261
My wife's in surgery,
and you're dreaming.

341
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,730
That's great.

342
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:38,124
There was another car, wasn't there?

343
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:45,965
Wasn't there?

344
00:21:50,857 --> 00:21:52,266
It was Linderman's guys.

345
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,844
Must've found out about the DA's plans.

346
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:57,987
It's my fault for even considering it.

347
00:21:58,064 --> 00:21:59,036
Taking them on.

348
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,859
This is... this is not your fault.
This is dad's fault, okay?

349
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:05,060
And you know, you know
that this is not gonna end.

350
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:06,931
If...

351
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:11,127
if I agree to take the DA's case,
will you give a deposition?

352
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:16,075
Against your father?

353
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,230
- Mr. Petrelli?
- Yes?

354
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,391
Please.

355
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:48,587
They did it!

356
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,857
See, the Swallows slay the Dragons!

357
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:57,486
"The Tokyo Swallows defeated
the Chunichi Dragons yesterday

358
00:22:57,563 --> 00:22:59,923
"with a surprising rally
with two out in the ninth."

359
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,780
What, what is this? Baseball?

360
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:03,493
You read Japanese flawless.

361
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:04,655
In one day.

362
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:07,568
You have power.

363
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:09,458
I have power too.

364
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:14,865
So because you knew
this baseball team was gonna win,

365
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:17,302
I'm supposed to believe
you're from the future.

366
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:21,612
There is an ancient Japanese tradition,
origami.

367
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:24,814
- Folding paper.
- I read about that.

368
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:27,236
Yeah, it says if a person can fold
1,000 cranes,

369
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,606
you'll be granted one wish.

370
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,860
Yes.

371
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:45,544
How did you...

372
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:56,951
A trip to Japan?

373
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,363
I don't care if you don't believe me.

374
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:00,443
Just...

375
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:03,588
please tell me you'll go.

376
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:08,777
Only one ticket?

377
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:15,243
Just in case you said yes.

378
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,776
Why do you repair watches, Gabriel?

379
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:28,459
My father didn't really gave me
a choice.

380
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:31,349
Yes, but why not do what you want
to do? Why not change?

381
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,783
You use a phrase in your book...

382
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:37,757
evolutionary had imperative.

383
00:24:37,795 --> 00:24:39,157
That which we are destined to do.

384
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:42,261
Sea turtles die on the same exact beach
where they were born,

385
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:44,451
lions slaughter gazelles,

386
00:24:44,644 --> 00:24:46,204
spiders eat their young.

387
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:47,670
They don't want to.

388
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:49,194
They have to.

389
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:50,694
Well...

390
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:53,286
the good news is you're healthy.

391
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:56,797
You mean normal?

392
00:24:57,661 --> 00:24:58,950
What, there's still no signs?

393
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:02,670
Well, maybe tomorrow.
We're still going to the CT scan, right?

394
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,580
I think we should prepare
for the possibility

395
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:06,278
that I may have been wrong.

396
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,376
You may not have a special ability.

397
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:10,494
I am so close.

398
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:12,859
I can feel it.

399
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,078
You came to me!

400
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,065
I am on your list!

401
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:19,560
These tests aren't 100%.

402
00:25:19,855 --> 00:25:20,859
Don't give up on me.

403
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,365
There are other opportunities
I need to focus on.

404
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,063
What... what, these people,

405
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:27,240
they're important? This guy?

406
00:25:27,453 --> 00:25:29,703
Brian Davis,
you think he's... telekinetic?

407
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,070
Moves things with his mind,

408
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:32,927
or are you just gonna
toss him aside too?

409
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:35,692
You better leave now, Mr. Gray.

410
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,909
That's a very generous gift, Hal.

411
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:05,569
Oh, it's amortized over 10 birthdays.

412
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:08,096
Hell, then, you skimped.

413
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:11,110
Thanks, grandpa.

414
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:12,640
It's my pleasure, young man.

415
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:14,812
Now, go break the Internet
in half, or something.

416
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:20,620
If I could buy stock
in that kid right now...

417
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:23,320
I wish his teachers saw it that way.

418
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:26,584
We want to move him
into a private school,

419
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,567
it's just, you know, we're trying
to figure out the details.

420
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,744
Details?

421
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:34,168
If you're trying to ask me
for something,

422
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:36,155
it's already yours.

423
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:39,632
It's a man's god-give right
to dote on his grandson.

424
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:42,275
Thank you.

425
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,799
It'd make a really big difference
for us.

426
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,696
You know, I feel lucky
that you even let me through the door,

427
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,297
after all the things I've done.

428
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:52,931
Stop saying that.

429
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,223
You didn't do anything.

430
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,670
Why do you keep doing that?

431
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:58,136
Doing what?

432
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:01,656
You... you're only
as sick as your secrets, Nicole.

433
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:06,248
I know the mantras, Hal.

434
00:27:06,526 --> 00:27:08,690
I've been reciting them for over a year.

435
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,359
Well, I guess I'll go see
what the boy's up to now.

436
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:24,595
You are doing great.

437
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,227
What the hell is this?

438
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:33,146
You've torn the whole damned
computer apart!

439
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,335
That computer cost $2,000!

440
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,289
What the hell you think you're doing?

441
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:39,427
You okay?

442
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:43,966
I have no business being here.

443
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,107
Then why did you bother?

444
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,089
I owe you more
than an apology could ever do.

445
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,250
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- I don't know.

446
00:27:54,598 --> 00:27:55,775
Make your life easier,

447
00:27:55,794 --> 00:27:57,300
I don't care how, okay?

448
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,037
What did you do that was so bad
I can't have my father back?

449
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:05,458
You really don't remember, do you?

450
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:19,673
So what's going to happen to my Claire?

451
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,332
How is this...

452
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,850
this genetic abnormality
going to effect her?

453
00:28:24,158 --> 00:28:25,914
I don't know.

454
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,575
It's possible nothing might ever happen.

455
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:28,694
It's possible

456
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:29,793
I might be wrong.

457
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,662
Where did you find this picture?

458
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:34,469
Union Wells high school website.

459
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,611
She's growing up so quickly now.

460
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:42,660
I couldn't do anything to stop it.

461
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:43,798
You cannot,

462
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,602
try as you might.

463
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:47,839
You have a daughter?

464
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,943
How old is she?

465
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:51,969
She...was five.

466
00:28:54,998 --> 00:28:56,108
I'm so sorry.

467
00:28:56,224 --> 00:28:57,548
Mutations are

468
00:28:58,802 --> 00:29:02,434
much like cancers or diseases,
meant to eliminate a species.

469
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,117
Shanti had a genetic anomaly,

470
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:06,912
and that was the portal
into my research.

471
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,240
My hope is that...

472
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,783
no one will suffer as she did.

473
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:12,577
If you do figure this out,

474
00:29:13,675 --> 00:29:14,775
what happens then?

475
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:17,300
We can change the world.

476
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:20,335
Give people hope for the future.

477
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:22,800
That is your daughter's destiny.

478
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:26,717
I'd... very much like to meet her.

479
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:29,502
You can see how that might be a problem,

480
00:29:30,658 --> 00:29:31,796
for my family?

481
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:33,011
Yes, of course.

482
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:35,732
Let me think on this

483
00:29:35,964 --> 00:29:37,461
and the best way to proceed.

484
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:40,633
Well, I appreciate your coming,
Mr. Bennett.

485
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:42,987
It was educational.

486
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:05,628
You do remember.

487
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,836
How could I forget?

488
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,476
Nicole!

489
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,730
Not Niki.

490
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,557
It's me, daddy, Jessica.

491
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,603
The daughter
that you threw beer bottles at.

492
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:23,282
The daughter that you choked.

493
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:25,230
The daughter that you killed.

494
00:30:25,272 --> 00:30:26,526
I didn't kill anyone!

495
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,314
No... it was an accident.

496
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:32,701
And they left Niki
with you to be your punching bag.

497
00:30:32,817 --> 00:30:34,508
I came to apologize, Nicole.

498
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:35,638
Apologize?

499
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:37,539
You don't apologize to Nicole.

500
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,777
You apologize to me.

501
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,356
Niki doesn't remember.

502
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:47,345
But I do.

503
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:49,882
Someone had to be there to protect her.

504
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,936
I remember
the stink of alcohol on your breath.

505
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:54,962
I took every punch,

506
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,441
so that she wouldn't have to.

507
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:58,525
You are not Jessica.

508
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:01,330
You have no idea who I am.

509
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,383
You need help.

510
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:09,849
You're right, she does.

511
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:12,552
I thought she had learned
to protect herself,

512
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,693
but no such luck.

513
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:19,491
You're going to go away,
and never come back.

514
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:37,609
Cheerleading, huh?

515
00:31:40,962 --> 00:31:43,014
- What do you think?
- I think I can't wait

516
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:44,576
to go to my first game.

517
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:50,319
Well,

518
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:51,921
you might be getting a little bit old

519
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,159
for the bears
from around the world, but...

520
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:55,603
- No, I'm not.
- No?

521
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:56,972
I love my bears.

522
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,860
Am I a terrible person?

523
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:05,083
What are you talking about?

524
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,607
I wanna be a cheerleader.

525
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:10,144
I mean, I've worked hard
to be a cheerleader, but...

526
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,768
sometimes, Jackie can just be a...

527
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:14,138
A bitch?

528
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:17,924
Yeah, a bitch.

529
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:20,862
No, it's your actions
that make you good or bad,

530
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:22,232
cheerleader or not.

531
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,573
Let's take a look at that hand.

532
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:28,951
The pain went away,
but I think it's still kinda...

533
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:34,710
That's healed really nicely.

534
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,095
Hey, baby.

535
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:47,946
You hungry?

536
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:51,705
Thought I'd make some eggs...
carbonara style.

537
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:53,605
Does that sound good?

538
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:56,371
I didn't pass again.

539
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:00,095
You studied so hard.

540
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:01,592
It's not about the answers, Jan.

541
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:02,769
I know all the answers.

542
00:33:02,788 --> 00:33:04,895
I don't know
why you don't just tell them the truth.

543
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:07,331
Yeah, I'll just waltz in
and tell them I can barely read,

544
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:09,930
half the words I see backwards.
There's a good career move.

545
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,301
My baby.

546
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:14,362
Don't.

547
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,495
Come on.

548
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:18,447
A little morning sex,

549
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:20,916
some eggs...

550
00:33:21,514 --> 00:33:23,853
everything's gonna seem so much better.

551
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:25,667
How can you wanna kiss me?

552
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:27,269
<i>You're my hero.</i>

553
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:34,142
You are everything that I want.

554
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,380
Hero.

555
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,254
I'm a hero.

556
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,038
Look at me.

557
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,059
11 years,
and I am still directing traffic.

558
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,466
I'm ready to give the deposition.

559
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:05,891
There isn't going to be one.

560
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:08,129
What are you talking about?

561
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,243
Can't back out now,

562
00:34:09,282 --> 00:34:11,095
we gotta tell the DA everything.

563
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:12,814
About Linderman, about dad, all of it.

564
00:34:13,335 --> 00:34:14,435
Dad's dead.

565
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,136
He had a heart attack this morning.

566
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:24,818
Take comfort
in the fact that he didn't know

567
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,091
his sons were about
to stab him in the back.

568
00:34:36,821 --> 00:34:40,300
24-hour samurai film festival
at the drafthouse in Austin!

569
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:41,908
Austin?

570
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:43,915
That's over 300 miles away.

571
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,294
We can make it in time
to see <i>Yujimbo</i>,

572
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:47,490
<i>Seven Samurai,</i>

573
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:48,763
and <i>The Hidden Fortress.</i>

574
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,695
It'd be perfect for our trip to Japan!

575
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,457
You still do want to go?

576
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:57,776
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

577
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,256
No, it's not that.
It's just... ever since I met you...

578
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:04,875
I don't know, you just,
you've made me so happy.

579
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:07,483
You make me happy too.

580
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:09,259
Well, it's more than that.

581
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,866
I don't let people get very close.

582
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:20,055
There's a blood clot in my brain...

583
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:22,554
inches away from an aneurysm.

584
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:27,456
I'm dying.

585
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:29,463
But...

586
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,568
I'm supposed to save you.

587
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:34,826
You did.

588
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:37,905
Before you got here,
I'd decided to give up.

589
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:42,470
But you have made me feel more alive,

590
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:46,134
and more full of joy
than I could have ever imagined.

591
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:06,554
Charlie?

592
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,010
Can I help you?

593
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:13,181
Yeah, somebody called me?

594
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:15,064
My name is Brian Davis.

595
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:22,384
Yes, I called you.

596
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:25,073
My name is...

597
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,773
My name is Sylar.

598
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:35,689
Gabriel Sylar.

599
00:37:55,932 --> 00:37:57,128
It's incredible.

600
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,845
Can you make it go away?

601
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:01,139
Why would you wanna do that?

602
00:38:01,313 --> 00:38:02,908
I don't know what this is.

603
00:38:03,229 --> 00:38:04,400
Or who I might hurt.

604
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,287
I don't want it.

605
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,729
You're broken.

606
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,172
What?

607
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:17,028
Suresh was right. It's so clear now.

608
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,208
How it all works,

609
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:21,741
pieces fitting together.
It is in the brain.

610
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,014
So you can help.

611
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:26,428
Don't worry, Brian,

612
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:28,183
I can fix it.

613
00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:30,748
It's an evolutionary imperative.

614
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:42,690
Whatever bad you've done in the past,
it's over.

615
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:46,310
You have a rare opportunity

616
00:38:47,371 --> 00:38:49,258
to start again, to rewrite the past,

617
00:38:49,297 --> 00:38:50,512
to do better.

618
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:53,268
But if you're not interested,
we could just...

619
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:55,216
put you back in your old life.

620
00:38:56,777 --> 00:38:58,726
Odds are you'd be dead in a week.

621
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:03,048
What do you want me to do?

622
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,035
There's a professor.

623
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:09,201
Dr. Suresh.

624
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:11,019
He has a list of names.

625
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:15,151
You're going to get Claire Bennet's name
off that list.

626
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:35,974
I'm sorry about the glass.

627
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,127
It's just glass.

628
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:45,417
About the other day...
I should've behaved myself.

629
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:47,359
I was uncalled for,

630
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,056
- I'm sorry.
- You were angry.

631
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:52,911
A man can say and do
the most awful things when he's angry.

632
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,010
Well, I'm different now.

633
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:56,302
I feel I've been given a chance
to start over.

634
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,903
A new life, new identity.

635
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:00,925
New purpose.

636
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,073
I came halfway around the world
looking for proof,

637
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:06,834
I threw him out the door.

638
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:11,208
No one returns my phone calls anymore.
They all think I'm insane.

639
00:40:11,401 --> 00:40:12,520
I don't.

640
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:14,529
These people

641
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,901
are all out there waiting to be told
that they are important.

642
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:22,272
Waiting to unlock their true potential.
I know it.

643
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:25,850
I can feel them.

644
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,940
We'll find them together.

645
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,064
We are the future.

646
00:41:45,556 --> 00:41:46,772
<i>This list...</i>

647
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,743
You found them.

648
00:41:50,264 --> 00:41:51,363
<i>these people...</i>

649
00:41:53,158 --> 00:41:55,861
<i>their future is written on their DNA.</i>

650
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:59,381
<i>Just as the past, it seems,
is written in stone.</i>

651
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:01,557
I have something I have to tell you.

652
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:05,657
<i>Was the die cast
from the very beginning?</i>

653
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:09,045
<i>Or is it in our own hands</i>

654
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:10,955
<i>to alter the course of destiny?</i>

655
00:42:11,264 --> 00:42:12,682
<i>Of all our abilities,</i>

656
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:15,936
<i>it is free will
that truly makes us unique.</i>

657
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:21,595
<i>With it, we have a tiny,
but potent, chance to deny fate.</i>

658
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,756
<i>And only with it</i>

659
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:25,769
<i>can we find our way back</i>

660
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:27,853
<i>to being human.</i>

661
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:36,848
I loved her.
