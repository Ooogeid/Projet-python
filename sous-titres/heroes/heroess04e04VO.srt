1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,129
There's a lot of change
going on with me.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,803
{\pos(252,205)}- Really?
- It's like, when I look back on my life,

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,216
{\pos(265,210)}It just seems like it's not my life
I'm looking back on.

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,510
It's a mid-life crisis.
That's all this is.

5
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:13,345
{\*Pete, }It's me again.

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,723
I have left you three messages.
You need to call me.

7
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:18,600
Something's happening to me,
And I think you're the only person

8
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,562
Who's going to understand
what it is.

9
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:23,555
{\pos(200,245)}For years,
i put my job ahead of my family.

10
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:25,346
{\pos(200,245)}Now I'm eating cereal for dinner,

11
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:27,735
{\pos(200,245)}And a strange man
is answering my wife's phone.

12
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,279
{\pos(200,245)}That's no way to live.

13
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,489
{\pos(200,245)}So what did we win?

14
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,086
{\pos(200,245)}A compass.

15
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:35,743
{\pos(200,255)}A broken compass.

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,495
You can never change the past.
It's bad.

17
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,988
If you want to change one thing...

18
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:46,880
That's all you do.

19
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,023
What if I could make it so that Danko
Wasn't interested in you anymore?

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,866
- Why do you want to do this for me?
- Maybe we're both looking for redemption.

21
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,967
I want my old life back.

22
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:20,454
I go back to my apple martinis
and overpaid lobbyists.

23
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:37,149
{\i1}Seeing that you're still here?

24
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:40,019
{\i1}Here

25
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:44,489
{\i1}It's not me, no
{\i1}It's my bad body double

26
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:47,481
{\i1}I got bad body double trouble
{\i1}Oh no

27
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,261
{\i1}My bad body double

28
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:53,498
{\i1}I've got bad body double trouble

29
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:56,001
{\i1}Bad body double

30
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:58,200
{\i1}I've got bad body double trouble

31
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,773
{\i1}Oh dear my bad body double

32
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,332
{\i1}I've got bad body double trouble

33
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,113
{\i1}She's trouble

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,546
{\i1}She's trouble

35
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,382
{\i1}She's trouble

36
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,989
{\i1}Yeah yeah yeah

37
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:20,059
{\i1}She's trouble

38
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:22,561
{\i1}She's trouble

39
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:27,000
{\i1}She's trouble, all right
yeah yeah right there

40
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,378
{\i1}Everywhere I go everywhere I go

41
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:30,993
Excuse me.

42
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,781
Tracy?
Is that you?

43
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:39,511
Hello, governor.

44
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:40,713
I'm back.

46
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:12,807
Nathan.

47
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:14,431
Mom.

48
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:17,185
What brings you to D.C.?

49
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,052
You cleaning out the garage?

50
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,968
Yes, as a matter of fact.

51
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,737
Here, come look.

52
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:26,486
Just what the doctor ordered:
a trip down memory lane.

53
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,131
Last we spoke, you said something
About looking back on your life

54
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:32,298
And it feeling like someone else's.

55
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,682
Well, Nathan,

56
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,684
{\pos(200,230)}This is your life.

57
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:39,651
{\pos(200,230)}Gee, mom, you didn't really
have to do that.

58
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:42,508
{\*Yeah, }{\pos(200,230)}I don't recognize any of this stuff.

59
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:44,391
{\*Well, }Of course you do.
{\*Come on, }Pick something up.

60
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,028
{\pos(200,230)}Ma, really, I got to...

61
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:49,234
{\pos(200,230)}here.

62
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:53,315
{\pos(200,230)}Used to be your favorite toy.

63
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,024
{\i1}Midnight at the oasis

64
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,179
{\i1}Send your camel to bed

65
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,318
Uncle Tim bought this for me.

66
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,654
When we took that trip up the coast.

67
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,599
{\pos(200,230)}- I was in the back seat of the car.
- That's when you decided

68
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,372
{\pos(200,230)}You wanted to be a fighter pilot.

69
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:20,290
You remember?

70
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,407
{\pos(200,230)}Yeah, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

71
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,755
{\pos(200,230)}Literally.

72
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,588
{\pos(200,230)}Is there something wrong, Nathan?

73
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:53,394
{\pos(200,230)}No, everything's fine.

74
00:08:58,186 --> 00:09:00,034
{\pos(200,230)}Come on, what happened to you?

75
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,917
{\pos(200,230)}I mean, it feels like you fell
off the face of the earth.

76
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,706
{\pos(200,210)}It was family.

77
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:07,416
{\pos(200,220)}It was a family crisis.

78
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,377
{\pos(200,220)}It was complicated and dramatic,

79
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:12,885
And it's behind me.

80
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,595
So, you're back.

81
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,557
{\pos(230,270)}I'm back.
And i'm looking for work.

82
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,397
Not anymore, you're not.

83
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,959
I can use you back in new york. That is,

84
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:25,191
{\pos(200,210)}- if you're willing to come work for me.
- I'd be a fool to turn it down.

85
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,561
Terrific.

86
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:29,331
- So what's going on?
- I could use your help

87
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:31,810
To ease some legislation
through the mine fields.

88
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:35,533
You know, cut a few corners,
Charm a few regulators.

89
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,254
It's right up your alley, trace.

90
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:40,829
- Right, baby?
- Not a problem, governor.

91
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,351
Have dinner with me tonight.

92
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:45,932
We can discuss the particulars.

93
00:09:51,964 --> 00:09:54,921
So happy to have my tiger lady back.

94
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,306
- {\*Hey, }Noah, you got a minute?
- Sure, come on in.

95
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,270
{\pos(192,210)}I thought you wanted nothing
to do with me.

96
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,049
I {\*need to }show you something.

97
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,360
- That's a very nice arm.
- No, it...

98
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,642
There was a tattoo.

99
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,558
{\pos(192,210)}- Right here. I noticed it last night.
- Mystery tattoo?

100
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:47,104
No, it was a compass.

101
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:49,755
{\pos(288,268)}{\*Just }Like the one {\*that }you pulled out
of the {\*safe deposit }box.

102
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:51,692
Mystery compass tattoo.

103
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:54,733
I know where you're going{\*, Noah}.
{\*And }I'm not seeing things. It was there.

104
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,314
- I thought you'd help me...
- {\*I don't know, }What are we going to do{\*, though, Peter}?

105
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,500
Seriously, are we going {\*to go }on the road,
{\*and }search for this speedy guy with {\*the }knives,

106
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,164
and uncover some giant conspiracy?

107
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,583
Not particularly.
You want to get cut up again?

108
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:10,789
I don't.

109
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,618
That's what I'm telling you,
I'm not up for it.

110
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:17,556
{\pos(288,268)}- That's all.
- Got it.

111
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:20,484
{\pos(288,268)}So what am I doing here?

112
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:27,444
{\pos(288,268)}- Sorry to bother you, Noah.
- {\*Oh, }Not at all. Any time.

113
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:32,837
{\pos(200,250)}- What are you doing here?
- I had to ask your dad...

114
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:35,486
{\pos(192,240)}a question, {\*He was helping me}clear my head up, but...

115
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:40,283
{\pos(192,240)}I'm good. I got to go.
I got to be at work in ten minutes.

116
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:42,759
{\pos(192,240)}Ten minutes?
You live in New York City.

117
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:46,316
{\pos(192,240)}- New power?
- Ask your father about it.

118
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:54,797
Just a...

119
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,176
fishing expedition.
Doesn't amount to anything, it's over.

120
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:01,077
Can I get you something to eat?

121
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,574
A bowl of cereal?

122
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,413
{\pub}Before you put that in...

123
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,765
{\pos(192,240)}The guy didn't tell us
he was diabetic.

124
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,084
- I left you three messages.
- I'm so sorry, man, I'm so sorry.

125
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,124
- I've been slammed. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I need to talk to you.

126
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,873
- Can it wait?
- Five minutes.

127
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:41,964
So what's up?

128
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,937
- When did that start{\*happening}?
- A couple days ago.

129
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:55,436
I'm like a swiss army knife
of superpowers now.

130
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:57,895
It's a new power every day.

131
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:00,788
Guess it runs in the family.

132
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,735
- {\*Yeah, but }There's something else.
- What?

133
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,195
I'm seeing things{\*, Peter}.

134
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,517
Memories. Images.

135
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:09,658
Memories, but they're not {\*my memories}mines.
Not exactly.

136
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,918
I'll touch something, and...

137
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:15,516
It's freaking me out.

138
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,457
I've read about this.
It's called psychometrics.

139
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:21,667
It has something to do
with seeing the history of an object,

140
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,797
where it's been,
what it's experienced.

141
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,674
So what I'm seeing, it's real?

142
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,651
Possibly. I don't know, why?
What are you seeing?

143
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,444
- You remember Kelly Houston?
- Kelly Houston.

144
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,725
Before or after she ran away
and broke your heart?

145
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:37,144
I don't think she ran away{\*, Pete}.

146
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:40,731
I really don't.
I touched my old baseball hat,

147
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,450
and I got a flood
of images of her and me...

148
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:46,987
in a pool.

149
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,365
I know how all of this must sound.

150
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,246
But she was dead,
and there was blood everywhere.

151
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,009
- {\*You think }Somebody killed her?
- I don't know.

152
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,419
If what I'm seeing is real,
then yeah.

153
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:05,204
- What would you do?
- {\*Then }You got to find the truth.

154
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,509
Go by the house.
{\*I mean, }Her mother still lives there{\*, right?}.

155
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,927
Millie? Yeah.

156
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:12,805
You want me to go with you?

157
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:18,748
It's my mess.

158
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,034
I'll clean it up.

159
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,879
Tell me the truth, Claire.

160
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,069
Why are you here?
You checking up on {\*the old man}me?

161
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:30,531
Can't a daughter just drop in
on her father unannounced?

162
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:34,285
I worry about you.

163
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:37,538
Since mom's gone
and the company's not around,

164
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,138
you just seem plan-less.

165
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,060
- You always have a plan.
- I'm fine.

166
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:47,295
That "fine" sounds
very unconvincing to me.

167
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:50,968
{\*You're not fine.}You're living off of cereal
and Japanese take-out.

168
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,013
{\*Well, }That is a good point.
Tonight, I order Italian.

169
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:57,629
- What about a job?
- What about it?

170
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:01,682
{\*I know }It's a down economy and all,
but {\*I'm sure }there's something you can do.

171
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:04,023
My particular skills
aren't {\*really all }that marketable.

172
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,858
That is not true.

173
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:09,612
You were middle management
of Primatech Papers for over 20 years.

174
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,966
{\*During which time, my skills}
Which consisted of lying to my family,

175
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,991
breaking down doors,
bagging and tagging.

176
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,337
On the plus side,
you are a people person.

177
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:20,093
Look.

178
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:23,744
Lumber salesman.

179
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:26,669
Minimum five years sales experience.

180
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:30,129
You do know that was a cover, right?

181
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:32,384
I never actually sold anything.

182
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:35,387
Yes, but you don't have
to admit to that.

183
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:38,328
Okay, say you're at the interview,

184
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,914
and I'm the interviewer,
and you're the interviewee.

185
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,394
Are we really...

186
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,199
Tell me, Mr. Bennet,

187
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:47,858
what is your greatest strength
as a salesman?{\*what do you think your greatest strength as a salesman is?}

188
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:52,124
If they won't buy from me,
I can always just shoot them.

189
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,789
What are you doing here?

190
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:03,540
Reminiscing about Kelly.

191
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,072
I {\*happened to be }was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd stop by{\ and say hello}.

192
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,648
That calls for a drink.

193
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:10,368
What can I get you?

194
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:12,508
Nothing. I'm fine, thanks.

195
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,416
Sit down, Nathan.

196
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:16,377
Thanks.

197
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,533
Nobody ever talks to me about Kelly.

198
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:23,564
Guess they figure
it's a sore subject.

199
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,044
Truth is,
I'm made of sturdier stuff.

200
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,798
So...?

201
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:34,238
I was just going through
some old things in my office...

202
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:36,281
{\*I }Started thinking about {\*Kelly}her.

203
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:38,867
Got to wondering if you...

204
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,434
If I'd heard from her?

205
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:43,247
I wish I could say that I have.

206
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:48,226
Wish I could say {\*that all this time,}she's been living
in the South of France.

207
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,971
That she became an artist.

208
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,617
That she has a daughter
named Francoise.

209
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:57,094
Do you ever wonder
if maybe she didn't run away?

210
00:18:57,688 --> 00:18:59,745
To be perfectly honest,
there was a time

211
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:02,141
when I thought
{\*maybe }you knew more than you were saying.

212
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:05,352
After all, we were away that weekend,
but you were in town{\*, Nathan}.

213
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,769
And I knew that you and Kelly
had been seeing each other.

214
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:15,195
I never told your mother,
but I hired a private investigator.

215
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:19,510
Turns out, you're in the clear.

216
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:23,162
Kelly, in fact,
used her credit card to buy

217
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,278
to buy a one-way ticket
to London Heathrow

218
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:28,848
where she claimed
her checked baggage,

219
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,253
and no one has {\*seen or }heard from her since.

220
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,856
You think it's possible
something else might have happened{\*, Millie}?

221
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,371
Trust me,
I've been over this ad nauseam.

222
00:19:39,648 --> 00:19:43,648
Kelly was willful
and spiteful and full of herself.

223
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:47,709
Add to that, me not being...

224
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:50,585
the most attentive of mothers.

225
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:53,525
{\*It's }No wonder she ran off.

226
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:00,616
I've got a hair,
nail and body sculpting thing.

227
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,410
- I don't want to be late.
- I understand.

228
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,120
- So, you'll show yourself out?
- Of course.

229
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Here you go.

230
00:20:36,065 --> 00:20:37,528
Broke out the good stuff.

231
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,293
I've already had too much.

232
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,615
And my mom
would kill me if she found out.

233
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,516
There's no way she'll find out.

234
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,201
You're right.

235
00:20:46,014 --> 00:20:48,416
{\*You know, }My folks won't be back until Monday.

236
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:51,708
Is that an invitation?

237
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,127
- Do you want it to be?
- {\*I don't know. }You've been drinking.

238
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:56,338
I wouldn't want to take advantage.

239
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:58,256
Don't be such a prude.

240
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,264
You want it, Nathan?
Come and get it.

241
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:24,398
Come on, Nathan.

242
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,536
Come and get it.

243
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:29,548
- You better give me that.
- Come and get it.

244
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:30,715
Come here.

245
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:50,725
{\pub}You wanted to see me?

246
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:53,035
Millie called.

247
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:54,698
Chardonnay.

248
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:58,839
She said you came to her
asking questions about Kelly.

249
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:02,997
Do You have any idea
what your trip down memory lane

250
00:22:03,164 --> 00:22:04,703
is doing to that poor woman?

251
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,833
Kelly didn't disappear.

252
00:22:11,322 --> 00:22:12,322
She died.

253
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:16,694
I was there.
{\*What }I want to know {\*is }why I can't remember{\* any of it}.

254
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,170
How would I know?

255
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,680
{\*Because }Every time
there's a secret buried someplace,

256
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,971
I find you with shovel
behind your back.

257
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:30,952
You should write mother's day cards.

258
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:35,061
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this{\*, one way or the other},
so you can tell me, or...

259
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,606
Fine, I took care of it.

260
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,634
And you don't need
to know the details.

261
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:46,031
You made sure
I wouldn't remember anything.{\, didn't you?}

262
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:50,994
You were drunk and foolish,
so, yes, I took care of it.{\* All of it.}

263
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,397
I had the Haitian wipe your memory.
I disposed of her body.

264
00:22:54,564 --> 00:22:56,291
I bought the plane ticket{\* to London}.

265
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,330
- It was an accident.
- It didn't look like one, dear.

266
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:02,005
So what would you have me do?

267
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:05,931
Her death
would have ruined your life.

268
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:13,612
I'm just waiting for the part
that makes any of this okay.

269
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:18,350
I made a choice to protect my son.

270
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,064
You want to vilify me for that?
Fine, I {\*have been }was vilified for so much less.

271
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:27,107
But, please, Nathan,
don't destroy yourself over this.

272
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:31,310
{\*So what, }You're gonna have {\*your old friend }Millie
{\*go on believing }believe her daughter ran away

273
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:33,120
because she was a bad mother?

274
00:23:35,677 --> 00:23:37,699
Millie has made her peace with this.

275
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:41,647
I suggest you do the same.

276
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:47,770
I'll be in touch.

277
00:23:51,093 --> 00:23:52,521
Did you forget something?

278
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:55,618
There's something
I need to tell you{\*, Millie},

279
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:57,464
and I'm not sure how to do it.

280
00:23:57,631 --> 00:23:59,123
You all right, Nathan?

281
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,278
{\*Look, }I can't tell you how I know this.

282
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,821
- {\*but }I'm not {\*really }sure I should.
- What are you talking about?

283
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:10,407
Say it.

284
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:13,910
Kelly didn't run away. She died.

285
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,862
And I was there. It was an accident.

286
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:20,125
And it was my fault.

287
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,795
- She got on a plane.
- There was no plane ticket.

288
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,338
She died, Millie.

289
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:29,495
And the whole thing
was covered up by my...

290
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:31,762
family.

291
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:35,891
What kind of twisted,
pathetic game are you playing?

292
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,101
I'm {\*just }trying
to tell you the truth for once.

293
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:44,648
I think you should leave.

294
00:24:48,463 --> 00:24:49,463
Please.

295
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:51,394
Go.

296
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,031
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:12,969
<i>{\*So }You never answered{\* the question}.</i>

298
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:15,097
Greatest strength.

299
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,199
I would d have to say
that above all else, I am...

300
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,962
a company man.

301
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:23,327
You won't find
anybody more dedicated

302
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,967
to his job than me.

303
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:29,911
See, that's perfect.
What lumber company wouldn't you{\want to hire you}?

304
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,831
I'm a real people person.

305
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,938
What's the matter?

306
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,546
I don't know.
It's just, you know, kind of sad when...

307
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,691
you look back on your life
and {\*you realize }it hasn't amounted to much.

308
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,962
What are you talking about?
You have been trying to help people.{\*Your whole life has been about trying to help people.}

309
00:25:47,802 --> 00:25:50,736
Have I?{\*Has it?}
Because all I see is pain.

310
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:55,511
I shot them, cuffed them,
locked them up, wiped their memories,

311
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,410
but I don't remember
actually helping...

312
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:01,685
anybody.

313
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:03,395
That's not true.

314
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,992
- You've helped plenty of people.
- Yeah, name one.

315
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:07,868
Me.

316
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:23,816
Life changes. We all change.

317
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:29,037
Sometimes you have
to remember who you were

318
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:31,347
to figure out who you want to be.

319
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:37,768
Why do I suddenly feel
like you're the parent, and I'm the kid?

320
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:40,377
We'll take turns.

321
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:47,709
- You don't really want to sell lumber{\*, huh}?
- Nope, not at all.

322
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:19,316
{\pub}Fancy meeting you here.

323
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,565
- Am I that predictable?
- You live upstairs.

324
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,487
- How are you?
- Okay.

325
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:30,874
So what brings you
to my neighborhood?

326
00:32:31,505 --> 00:32:33,701
I got my old job back,
with Governor Malden.

327
00:32:34,143 --> 00:32:36,152
That was quick.
Good for you.

328
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:39,082
Let's celebrate.
I'll buy you a tuna roll.

329
00:32:39,598 --> 00:32:40,667
I'm not {\*really }hungry.

330
00:32:44,373 --> 00:32:45,616
So why are you here?

331
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:48,709
I don't know.

332
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,569
You got your life back, Tracy,

333
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,305
and that's what you wanted,
isn't it?

334
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,189
It just feels like
something's missing.

335
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:02,063
Something needs to change.

336
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,139
You got a job in government.

337
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:09,124
- That's a good start.
- {\*Please, }Malden isn't about helping people.

338
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,072
- Then quit.
- I can't.

339
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,783
{\*Do you know how }Many people
would kill for my position.

340
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,027
Life changes, Tracy.

341
00:33:16,443 --> 00:33:18,059
We have to change with it.

342
00:33:18,826 --> 00:33:20,456
Maybe you just can't go home again.

343
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:26,621
{\*Maybe you have to }Remember who you were
to figure out who you want to be.

344
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:36,353
I got to go.

345
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,460
I have a dinner with Malden,
and I can't be late.

346
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:45,333
Thanks for the advice, though.

347
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:46,983
Any time.

348
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:12,308
I can't tell you how great it is
to have you back, Trace.

349
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,764
- I missed you.
- It's nice to be missed.

350
00:34:16,812 --> 00:34:19,563
Cosmo still your drink?
One cosmo, please.

351
00:34:20,864 --> 00:34:23,366
Look at us.
Just like old times.

352
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,362
Kind of.

353
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:28,415
This job...

354
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,597
I want it to be more.

355
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,630
I want to set agendas,

356
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:35,448
help people
who can't help themselves.

357
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:38,837
So much for small talk.

358
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:43,684
I want a job where I'm making
a real difference in people's lives.

359
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:46,584
Trace, you don't have
to work so hard to impress me.

360
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,878
We both know
what you bring to the table.

361
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:54,133
Tell you what.
Why don't we skip dinner?

362
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:58,073
Let's go upstairs.
Make each other happy.

363
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,432
Just like old times.

364
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:07,035
Will you excuse me for a moment?

365
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:09,783
Sure, yeah.
Don't be long.

366
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:30,545
Dear god.

367
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,043
There you go.

368
00:35:57,586 --> 00:35:58,906
Everything okay, baby?

369
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:01,283
No.

370
00:36:02,366 --> 00:36:03,953
No, everything's not okay.

371
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,748
I don't understand.

372
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,326
I wouldn't expect you to.

373
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,269
Hello, yes.

374
00:36:36,436 --> 00:36:39,605
I'd like to speak with someone
in the homicide division.

375
00:36:40,595 --> 00:36:41,630
Yeah, i'll hold.

376
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:18,427
I've been looking for you.
What's the matter?

377
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:26,272
You are thinking about something.

378
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,664
Is it the new people that
Samuel's bringing into the family?

379
00:37:32,736 --> 00:37:34,547
You think he'd be bringing in more

380
00:37:34,924 --> 00:37:36,170
If joseph was alive?

381
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,502
I don't know.

382
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:41,425
It was his brother,
And he has a right to his revenge.

383
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:43,606
No matter what it means
for the rest of us?

384
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:45,368
I'll tell you what it means.

385
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:52,236
I'm the one who's left to make
all the decisions for this family.

386
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,107
I'm the one that decides
which direction we travel.

387
00:37:58,163 --> 00:38:00,139
We were just talking is all.

388
00:38:04,554 --> 00:38:05,945
Come with me.

389
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:08,108
Time to find another.

390
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:20,611
You know you can
tell me anything, don't you?

391
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:22,605
Of course.

392
00:38:22,772 --> 00:38:25,494
If anyone tells you
they're dissatisfied with me,

393
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,391
If you're dissatisfied.

394
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,142
I'm not dissatisfied.

395
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:35,628
Good.

396
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:46,837
What are you doing?

397
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:48,683
Why are you showing him to me?

398
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,722
I show you what you need to see.

399
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,059
Why would i need to see bennet?

400
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,888
He retired.
He's no longer interested in us.

401
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,407
He may have changed his mind.

402
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,989
Nathan seemed...

403
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,061
very confused.

404
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:38,135
Wanted to make sure i heard
his side of the story.

405
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:40,673
It was upsetting

406
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,242
To say the least.

407
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:45,117
Well, Nathan has always been
overly theatrical.

408
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:48,900
You know, i'm sure that's why
He's drawn tothe spotlight of politics.

409
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:52,848
What exactly did he say?

410
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:55,643
I feel so silly telling you this.

411
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,309
No, please. He's my son.
I want to know.

412
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:00,994
He said that Kelly was dead.

413
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,599
That he was with her when she died.

414
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:07,898
I told him, "no,
she bought a ticket,

415
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:10,770
Got on a plane, never looked back."

416
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:12,665
Millie, i am so sorry

417
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:14,935
That he bothered you with this.

418
00:40:15,798 --> 00:40:16,648
Nathan...

419
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:19,917
Nathan just hasn't
been himself lately.

420
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,794
You know how much
i've always cared for Nathan.

421
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:27,239
I apologize for his behavior.

422
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:31,444
No one should have to
go through that pain twice.

423
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,819
I can honestly say...

424
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:37,893
i don't care anymore.

425
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,632
I just hope Kelly's happy.

426
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:45,477
I think that's

427
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:48,945
About as close to closure
as i'm ever going to get.

428
00:40:51,877 --> 00:40:54,035
Would you excuse me just one second?

429
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,411
Hello?

430
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:57,578
The package is delivered.

431
00:40:58,907 --> 00:40:59,919
Wonderful.

432
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:01,438
Thank you so much.

433
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,378
Something important?

434
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:07,348
- Not at all.
- Good.

435
00:41:09,816 --> 00:41:10,930
Where were we?

436
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:12,554
Closure.

437
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,097
Of course.
To closure.

438
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,600
To closure.
