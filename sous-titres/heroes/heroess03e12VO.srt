1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Previously on Heroes

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,970
This is the last posthumous issue.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,410
But it's not the last story.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,580
The day that he died,

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,010
Isaac mendez bequeathed his sketchbook

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,410
To a humble bike messenger.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,010
You find that messenger,

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,750
You find your story.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,320
It's got nothing to do with dad.

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,020
I'm going to pinehurst.

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,250
His idea,

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,990
Giving people abilities,

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,320
The right people.

16
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,930
It's wrong. it's not wrong.

17
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,290
It's so right.

18
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,060
We're taking claire with us.

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,830
That's what we came for in the first place.

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, I've read your files, gabriel.

21
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,430
You're not their son.

22
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,040
They're just leveraging your mommy issues

23
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,700
And turning you into their weapon.

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,010
And I understand now

25
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,980
That I'm never gonna change.

26
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,510
Theoretically this formula is sound,

27
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,110
But something is missing,

28
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,550
Some kind of catalyst.

29
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,080
The key component of this catalyst

30
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,480
Would live in a human host.

31
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,190
I think I'm the catalyst.

32
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,890
That's claire, and that's hiro hiding behind the ferns.

33
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,920
I think hiro has to take claire here

34
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,410
To get his memory back.

35
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,340
I must go, right now.

36
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,800
Hiro!

37
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,670
Save the cheerleader

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,950
What did you do?

39
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,250
What the hell is going on?

40
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,350
We think she died in the fire.

41
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,590
Dad?

42
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,970
Once again. Not a request.

43
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,670
That baby's me.

44
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,520
You're hiro nakamura, aren't you?

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,070
Hiro Nakamura! Yes!

46
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,310
Peter told me about you.

47
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,880
You're a time traveler,

48
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,450
So you brought me back in time.

49
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,930
Why did you bring me here?

50
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,270
I don't understand a word you're saying.

51
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,550
You don't speak english?

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,170
Less talking. More watching.

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,010
Don't get too close.

54
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,530
Oh, look.

55
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,630
Is that you?

56
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,900
Am I here for you?

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,850
Sorry. I only had one semester English.

58
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,700
All I know is...

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,950
Where is train station?

60
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,210
I must use toilet.

61
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,220
More waffles, please.

62
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,290
Hiro.

63
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,300
Mommy!

64
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,290
Mommy?!

65
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,650
My mother is here! I have to see her!

66
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,600
Hey, where are you going?

67
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,840
Should I stay with me, or should I go with you?

68
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,250
Hey, what am I supposed to do?

69
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,650
Hiro, not so rough.Your mother is ill.

70
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,420
It's all right.

71
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,900
How are you?

72
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,940
Our son can hear us.

73
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,570
Speak english.

74
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
Are you feeling better?

75
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,450
We must face the inevitable.

76
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,920
I am dying.

77
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,450
I think it will happen tonight.

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,790
We must make arrangements

79
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,090
For the catalyst

80
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,030
Before it is lost forever.

81
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,280
The catalyst.

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,580
Catalyst?

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,230
What are they saying?

84
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,520
I hate it when they speak English!

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,640
Are you sure?

86
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,580
Nothing will ever be the same.

87
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,150
You must think of the future, kaito.

88
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,490
I will have noah return with the baby.

89
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,730
She is the perfect candidate.

90
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,230
I wanted to keep it in the family.

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,640
Absolutely not.

92
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,770
Our son couldn't possibly.

93
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,060
Mommy! Look!

94
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,340
Yes, my Hiro...

95
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,090
A dove is sick.

96
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,450
This conversation isn't over yet.

97
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,450
What is it, Hiro?

98
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,370
Wil he die?

99
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,490
Let's see.

100
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,100
My mommy is a healer.

101
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
-I know what I have to do. -I know what we have to do!

102
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,340
-I think I can stop the catalyst. -I think my mommy can heal my brain!

103
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,670
-Before they put it in me. -Restore my memory!

104
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,170
-I can be a hero. -I can be a hero.

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
-I don't understand what you're saying. -I don't understand what you're saying.

106
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,650
I have to follow my dad, protect that baby,

107
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,150
So they don't inject the catalyst into me.

108
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,550
I'll meet you here tonight.

109
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,580
Stay out of trouble, okay?

110
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,490
Okay.

111
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,470
What are you doning here?

112
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,200
You should be in the kitchen.

113
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,090
My wife's been waiting for breakfast all morning.

114
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,910
Aren't you the new chef?

115
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,530
Hurry up, then!

116
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,910
She wants Tamagoyaki.

117
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,130
What?

118
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
You were supposed to be here by now.

119
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,100
Where's claire?

120
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,840
Gone into thin air.

121
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,340
What happened?

122
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,640
Don't know, don't care.

123
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,940
I'm not helping you anymore, arthur.

124
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,510
I'm not helping anyone.

125
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,280
I talked to bennet. he told me everything.

126
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,280
He told me you're not my father.

127
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,350
I want the truth.

128
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,590
And I know exactly where I'm gonna find it.

129
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,960
I've got a whole new list of people with abilities.

130
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,490
It's gonna be very useful.

131
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,930
Don't do this.

132
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,100
Come see me.

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,260
Don't worry, I will.

134
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,170
Very soon.

135
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,150
Good-bye, elle.

136
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,700
One shot to the back of his head

137
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,700
And it's done.

138
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,630
You want me to kill him?

139
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,670
Why do you think I sent you and your brother

140
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,000
To find the haitian?

141
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,740
He makes arthur vulnerable.

142
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,440
And now that nathan

143
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,910
Has switched his allegiance,

144
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,810
It's all up to you.

145
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,720
Your father is far too powerful.

146
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,950
He won't be contained.

147
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,620
If the tables were turned,

148
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,360
He would not hesitate to put a bullet in your brain,

149
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,190
Or nathan's.

150
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,660
Why do you think I poisoned him,

151
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,730
The man I loved,

152
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,700
Father of my children?

153
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,140
He tried to kill your brother.

154
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,140
And if you get in his way, he will destroy you.

155
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,110
You don't know that.

156
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,010
I know that he will stop at nothing

157
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,350
To get what he wants

158
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,450
By any means necessary, no matter who gets hurt.

159
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,990
There's no other way.

160
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,910
So d.o.d. is on board. we're all set.

161
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,610
Well done, tracy.

162
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,180
Nathan, nice to see you.

163
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,520
What are you doing here?

164
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,220
It's my job, senator--

165
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,690
Finding opportunities for you.

166
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,930
Have you reconsidered my offer, son?

167
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,490
I agree with what you're trying to do.

168
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,960
The world's a dangerous place and it's not getting any better.

169
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,370
We need a leader, somebody with vision.

170
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,970
And that somebody isn't you.

171
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,770
Is it you?

172
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,740
I'm taking over pinehurst,

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,580
The complete program.

174
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,280
I'll work out of my office.

175
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,750
We can use my resources.

176
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,120
Who do you think you're talking to?

177
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,850
I made you.

178
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,690
You wouldn't have gone

179
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,260
To all this trouble to make me

180
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,990
If you didn't need me.

181
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,030
You wanted a legitimate face for pinehurst,

182
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,730
A person with authority.

183
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,140
Senator nathan petrelli.

184
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,040
All right, nathan. you win.

185
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,280
Brief him on what we've done.

186
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,280
You're angry.

187
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,290
What do you expect?

188
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,650
You went behind my back.

189
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,020
You're supposed to be working for me.

190
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,490
That's exactly what I was doing.

191
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,590
We're on your side, nathan.

192
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,190
Your father sees the problems in this world--

193
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,200
War, terrorism.

194
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,600
He wants to make it a better place.

195
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,370
You have no idea who my father is.

196
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,800
I know he's crossed some lines,

197
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,470
But he has a vision for the future,

198
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,140
And you're in it as president of the united states.

199
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,270
That is where you belong, nathan.

200
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,880
And I belong there with you.

201
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,920
We'd like to call it "intelligent design."

202
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,590
Until now abilities have been random,

203
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,020
Given to good people and bad,

204
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,790
Whether they deserve them or not.

205
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,660
When we perfect the formula,

206
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,760
We get to choose who gets what power.

207
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,730
And we have chosen the best.

208
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,530
Meet the future.

209
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,430
Fall in!

210
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,440
A-ten-hut!

211
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,090
Okay, almost there.

212
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,990
Hang in there.

213
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,360
Oh, gosh.

214
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,100
Come on. hang in there.

215
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,730
Okay, here we go.

216
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,170
Oh, my gosh, let me help you.

217
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,070
Oh, thanks.

218
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,340
Oh, my husband bailed on me.

219
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,470
Our first day with an adopted baby,

220
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,310
And he had to go back to work.

221
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,880
Oh, my gosh, thank you. no worries.

222
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,150
I'm bonnie, by the way.

223
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,480
I'm staying next door with the monacos.

224
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,650
I'm their niece.

225
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,920
Hi, bonnie. I'm sandra.

226
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,150
Thank you so much. put 'em anywhere.

227
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,520
Thank you.

228
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,690
Come on, baby girl.

229
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,620
Here we go.

230
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,430
We made it home.

231
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,990
Nice place.

232
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,600
She's probably just wet

233
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,330
And doesn't know how to tell you yet.

234
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,540
Let's see.

235
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,440
Up we go.

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,770
There we go.

237
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Yeah, she's definitely wet.

238
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,980
You want me to change her? sure.

239
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,320
There we go.

240
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,780
There we go, little one.

241
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,020
There we go.

242
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm so glad I ran into you.

243
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,060
To be honest, I'm a little overwhelmed.

244
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,630
She's so little.

245
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,460
And I'm completely unprepared.

246
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,400
I don't have a clue about how to take care of a baby.

247
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,370
Well, I have a feeling you'll do just fine.

248
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,600
Besides, I have major babysitting skills.

249
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,370
I could teach you a thing or two if you want.

250
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,310
That would be great.

251
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,410
What about your husband, is he good with kids?

252
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,780
Not really.

253
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,350
Noah's very busy at work.

254
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,480
He just got a promotion.

255
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,690
Apparently he is, um--

256
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,320
He's very good at what he does.

257
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,320
I'll bet he is.

258
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,530
All done.

259
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,760
There we go.

260
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,630
Thank you.

261
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,230
There we go.

262
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,670
Oh, it's so strange.

263
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,400
I've only known claire a few hours,

264
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,170
And I'm so in love with her.

265
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,100
I think she knows that.

266
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,180
Yeah.

267
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Don't let her out of your sight, okay?

268
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,080
What do you mean?

269
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,020
Oh, I just mean that

270
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,590
She's gonna grow up really fast.

271
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,120
Believe me, I am gonna watch her like a hawk.

272
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,330
Hi, baby girl.

273
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,770
Hey, sue, is it really your birthday?

274
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,710
Hey, birthday girl!

275
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,040
Sue landers?

276
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,310
Special delivery.

277
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,250
You're lying.

278
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,120
You're not here to make a delivery.

279
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,220
Impressive. how did you do that?

280
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,490
What do you want?

281
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,670
To understand what you do.

282
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,800
Human lie detector, how does that work?

283
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,400
When someone tells a lie, does it tingle?

284
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,910
How did you know about me?

285
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,740
Who are you?

286
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,840
Someone who covets your ability.

287
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,910
I have to find out the truth about something.

288
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,020
No, you don't.

289
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,350
Trust me.

290
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,390
I'm sure it's hard,

291
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,950
Seeing the ugly truth at every turn.

292
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,190
It must make it hard to trust anyone.

293
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,600
It's not gonna hurt a bit.

294
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,840
Got me.

295
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,780
That's a lie.

296
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,390
I almost forgot how good this feels.

297
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,830
Happy birthday!

298
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,300
Cake.

299
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,700
Tell me what you know about this program.

300
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,170
It's gonna make us better marines, sir.

301
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,370
Yeah. but how?

302
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,740
Not exactly sure.

303
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,670
Some kind of drug. I'm told it's safe.

304
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,480
Sergeant, I want you to know

305
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,910
Exactly what it is you've signed up for.

306
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,310
The drug that we're developing,

307
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,680
It'll change your life

308
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,350
In ways you can't possibly imagine.

309
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,090
Forever.

310
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,860
I get it, sir, but I have my reasons.

311
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,430
I did two tours in iraq.

312
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,740
In the last mission, last tour,

313
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,110
Rpg took out our humvee

314
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,080
Three klicks south of kirkut.

315
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,110
Boatload of hadjis has us pinned down,

316
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,120
And we fought as best we could.

317
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,490
End of the day though,

318
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,550
12 of us went in, only 2 came out.

319
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,530
That's tough.

320
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,790
The trip back to stateside,

321
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,930
I couldn't help thinking,

322
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,070
"why couldn't I have been better?"

323
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,700
You're being too hard on yourself, marine.

324
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,970
Everybody says that.

325
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,670
You're only human.

326
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,310
If only I was more than that,

327
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,280
Maybe they'd still be alive, you know?

328
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,520
Yeah, I think I do.

329
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,190
I like teleporting better.

330
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,960
Less windy.

331
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,630
I don't care where you are. hey.

332
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,860
It should been there an hour ago.

333
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,270
They're ready. get it to them.

334
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,130
Excuse me, we're looking for a messenger.

335
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,400
Sure, pal, what do you need delivered?

336
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,900
We need to find something, someone.

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,210
Yeah, a messenger picked up a package

338
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,640
From an artist at a downtown loft,

339
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,810
Isaac mendez.

340
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,110
We need that package.

341
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,310
Sorry, can't help you out.

342
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,810
Johnson, 57th and lex!

343
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,410
The messenger picked up this package last year.

344
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,550
If you just--

345
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,350
Wait, last year? you're kidding me.

346
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,190
I can barely keep track of what we delivered last week.

347
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,720
You have records, right? receipts.

348
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,960
Just look it up.

349
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,890
His name was isaac mendez. m-e-n-d-e--

350
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,390
Look, I would like to help.

351
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,190
City regulations prevent me from talking about deliveries.

352
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,930
There's no city regulation about that.

353
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,530
What are you, a cop?

354
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,630
-He knows something, matt. -right.

355
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,470
Sorry to do this to you, buddy.

356
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,680
He does know about the sketches.

357
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,680
Wait, how do you know that I know?

358
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,450
I also know that you're skimming off the top.

359
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,050
What, $5,200 already this year.

360
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,520
Give us the sketches now.

361
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,560
Okay, fine. I got it in the back.

362
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,730
It's in the safe. I'll go get it.

363
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,730
That's a great idea.

364
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,040
We found them.

365
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,240
Hey, you've been a good friend to hiro, nemesis.

366
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,870
How come?

367
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,840
Well, it's kinda my fault.

368
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,450
I mean, I started this whole mess stealing the formula--

369
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,950
No, no, no, it's more than that.

370
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,720
You're doing it because that's the right thing to do,

371
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,720
And that's who you are.

372
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,320
Guys.

373
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,290
He's getting away.

374
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,390
He's got the sketchbook. we have to stop him.

375
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,760
Allow me.

376
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,100
Hey, watch it!

377
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,700
Watch out!

378
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,340
What the--

379
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,820
Fine, I give.

380
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,170
Remember, fifth grade a boy named danny.

381
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,180
He's cute, but he'll break your heart,

382
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,580
So whatever you do

383
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,180
Do not share your juice with him.

384
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,750
Don't do it.

385
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,980
Don't do it, okay?

386
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,520
Who are you?

387
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,390
I'm, uh--

388
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,030
I'm, uh--

389
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,430
I'm bonnie.

390
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,410
I was just watching the baby

391
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,300
while sandra set up the nursery.

392
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,500
Hi, hon.

393
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,300
I thought I heard you come in. how's work?

394
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,610
You left the baby alone with some strange girl?

395
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,010
She's not strange.

396
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,510
Bonnie, this is mr. bennet.

397
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,350
She's a potential new babysitter for us.

398
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,150
Is there a problem?

399
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,390
You can't let a stranger come in our home

400
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,720
Under any circumstances.

401
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,060
Don't worry, claire.

402
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,660
I'm here to protect both of us.

403
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,870
Something wrong?

404
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,840
Tell me who you are again.

405
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,070
I'm the monacos' niece.

406
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,570
The monacos don't have a niece.

407
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,910
So I'm gonna ask you one last time.

408
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,010
Who are you?

409
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,280
And what the hell do you want?

410
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,260
You don't understand.

411
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,060
I'm here to protect her and this family.

412
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,930
Who sent you?

413
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What's going on, noah?

414
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,330
Nothing; just go on back in the bedroom.

415
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,670
Does this have something to do

416
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,130
With how we got the baby?

417
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,240
No questions. that was the arrangement.

418
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,770
Please, just go sit in the bedroom and wait.

419
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,910
I'll take the baby.

420
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,310
No, everything is fine, sandra.

421
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,670
Please, just go.

422
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,810
I know you're scared.

423
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,680
You're a company man.

424
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,420
And this little baby is your assignment.

425
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,150
You're thinking, how can she possibly

426
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,260
Be your daughter when they could

427
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,560
Take her away from you at any moment?

428
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,360
You're trying so hard,

429
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,930
But you can't let yourself love her.

430
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,200
What is this? are you one of them?

431
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,370
Are you a mind reader?

432
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:37,070
Something like that.

433
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,910
Believe me, this little baby

434
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,380
Will be in your life for at least 16 more years.

435
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,610
And many more hopefully after that.

436
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,350
She's gonna need you to protect her

437
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,020
From so many things,

438
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,650
Terrible things.

439
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,520
But you're gonna love each other so much.

440
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,060
How do you know all this?

441
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,460
No, don't answer that.

442
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,330
Why not?

443
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,630
It's the company, okay?

444
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,000
They want to take her back just for a minute.

445
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,710
But they're going to do something to her.

446
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,510
And it's gonna change everything.

447
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,950
This little baby, your clair-bear,

448
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,650
She's fine

449
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,450
Just the way she is.

450
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,120
Trust me.

451
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,830
Claire-bear, huh?

452
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,550
Thank you.

453
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,600
We are both here, my son.

454
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:14,500
Now is our chance. Tell me about your life.

455
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,190
I became a master of space and time.

456
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,990
And I have saved the world...twice.

457
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,950
I always knew you were meant for greatness.

458
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,590
Did your father see this?

459
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:39,210
Yes. My father and I grew to

460
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,440
He saw me become a great hero.

461
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:52,790
And now I have the chance to save the world again.

462
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,460
Give me the catalyst, Mother.

463
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,730
Give me the light. I will defend it.

464
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,380
Your father wants me to give it to a baby.

465
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,300
He is calling Noah Bennet now--

466
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,030
I am strong enough to protect it.

467
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,330
I can keep it safe.

468
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,250
Believe me.

469
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:31,210
I've always believed in you, my son.

470
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:05,620
I am so proud of you, Hiro.

471
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,890
You are the one who did it.

472
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,810
You showed me what it means to be a hero...

473
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,900
Mother?

474
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,970
Mother!

475
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,820
Please...don't go!

476
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,170
Mother...

477
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,320
Mommy.

478
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,240
Farewell.

479
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,630
Present day.

480
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,960
Your silence betrays you.

481
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,370
What? no, I'm fine.

482
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,700
You know, I was just thinking

483
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,000
It's too bad the eclipse had to end.

484
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,340
The world be a lot simpler without powers.

485
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:07,780
To kill one's own father is a horrible thing.

486
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,580
He tried to kill my brother.

487
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,820
He took away my powers.

488
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,420
He'd kill me if he had to.

489
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,020
But he didn't.

490
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,850
You and I both know

491
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,620
The world isn't safe with my father in it.

492
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,260
But I also know you, peter.

493
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,230
You want to save the world.

494
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,930
You always have.

495
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,330
It's that part of you that wants to save your father.

496
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,740
Give the gun to me.

497
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,010
I'll do it.

498
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,770
No.

499
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,510
Just like your brother was your responsibility.

500
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,350
This one is mine.

501
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,000
Something wrong?

502
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,510
No.

503
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,640
No.

504
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,520
Does kind of tingle.

505
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,400
I found it in some guy's locker

506
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,130
After he got canned.

507
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,270
I had no idea how much it was worth.

508
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,000
Every fanboy in the city's been trying to grab it.

509
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,570
My life's been a living hell.

510
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,550
I don't understand.

511
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,390
This is how it ends?

512
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,920
What's happened to hiro?

513
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,160
Maybe it's not so bad.

514
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,590
Right.

515
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,690
Maybe this is just the cover to get people to buy it.

516
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,100
Hiro will come back.

517
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
He has to.

518
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,000
16 yeas ago.

519
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,890
Cheerleader, it's over.

520
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,430
We can go home now.

521
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,700
Hey, you speak english.

522
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,830
-I thought that--  -it's a long story.

523
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,240
Just know that I have taken the catalyst.

524
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,410
The light is in me now.

525
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,740
We have saved the future.

526
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,110
Wait, you put the catalyst in you?

527
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,110
Guess I showed up just in time.

528
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,020
Keep away, arthur petrelli.

529
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,420
I will save the cheerleader again.

530
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,460
I don't think so.

531
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,330
I'll take the catalyst and your powers too, hiro.

532
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,910
You're a dead man.

533
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,310
No!

534
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,450
Hiro.

535
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,720
As for you,

536
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,420
I need you to deliver a message for me.

537
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,930
Tell angela it's over. I've won.

538
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,510
Cheerleader!

539
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,750
Hello?!

540
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,990
Anybody there?

541
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,590
Help!

542
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,690
Help.

543
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,330
Please.

544
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,270
I can't believe it.

545
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,210
Hiro's stuck back in time 16 years ago and no powers.

546
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,680
Maybe it isn't all bad news.

547
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,050
Arthur petrelli has the catalyst.

548
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,320
He could perfect the formula.

549
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,450
Yeah, wait, he-- he can give people powers.

550
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,390
So that means that there could be another time traveler.

551
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,020
Someone to save hiro.

552
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,960
Maybe it could be me.

553
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,530
I can go back in time

554
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,460
And save hiro.

555
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,430
We've got to find the formula.

556
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,940
How do we find the formula?

557
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,340
Doctor.

558
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,960
Ready to change the world?

559
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,800
I.d. please.

560
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,580
We'll need 50 doses to begin--

561
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,940
One for every marine?

562
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,980
We'll just try it on one first.

563
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,180
Let's make sure this thing works.

564
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,980
No offense.

565
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,350
What is it?

566
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,550
Nothing.

567
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,690
Just a minor inconvenience.

568
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,160
Call your first marine.

569
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,130
I'll be back.

570
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,530
Peter.

571
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,370
I'm glad you're here.

572
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,140
Nathan and I have just been--

573
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,710
Don't be ridiculous.

574
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,920
So...

575
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,720
You're here to kill me.

576
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,690
I'm here to stop you.

577
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,520
Creating abilities like this,

578
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,030
Giving them out,

579
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,900
It'll destroy the world.

580
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,330
In your opinion.

581
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,470
I've seen it. this ends now.

582
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,540
I don't think you have the nerve to kill me, peter.

583
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,280
I like your choice.

584
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,850
Very all-american.

585
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,120
We could put him on a poster.

586
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,690
Where's my father?

587
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,290
We don't need him.

588
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,420
You're in charge, remember?

589
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,000
All right, let's do this.

590
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,270
What the hell happened to you?

591
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,470
A mistake.

592
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,170
Hopefully this formula will fix all that.

593
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,380
What's in there?

594
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,880
It's all right, scott.

595
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,950
Who is this guy?!

596
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,040
What's happening?

597
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,750
I'm not sure.

598
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,750
He's too strong.

599
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,220
I cannot hold his powers back.

600
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,420
Listen to me, son.

601
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,020
There is another way.

602
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,930
The formula is ready. nathan is here.

603
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,630
I can give you your abilities back.

604
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,760
- We can start over. - No.

605
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,830
Peter!

606
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,930
- Wait. just wait.- Shoot now.

607
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,770
That your problem, son.

608
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,810
Too much thought. not enough action.

609
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,440
How could you be my son?

610
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,720
Hello, arthur.

611
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,890
Gabriel, you're here.

612
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,990
I am.

613
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,430
No place I'd rather be than with family.

614
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,170
Are you really my family?

615
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,070
Of course.

616
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,040
I'm your father.

617
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,180
No, you're not.

618
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,020
Now I know the truth.

619
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,690
You're not a killer, peter.

620
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,960
I am.

621
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,140
There'll be no need for that.

622
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,600
I'm not gonna kill you.

623
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,710
You don't have anything I need anymore.

624
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,540
I'm sorry, peter.

625
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,250
Your father was the one who had to die.

626
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,820
Go after sylar.

627
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,500
It's over.

628
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,280
How do you feel?

629
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,960
I feel good.
