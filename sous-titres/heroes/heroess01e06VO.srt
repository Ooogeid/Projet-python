1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,881
They have
extraordinary abilities.

2
00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:05,147
Claire searches for the
answers to her powers.

3
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:08,140
I think I'm old enough for you to
tell me who my real parents are.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,690
While her father
shows a darker side.

5
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:13,442
- He tried to force me.
- The quarterback?

6
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:20,227
Claire is a very special girl.
Do you understand me?

7
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:23,872
While Nathan escapes
the face of evil.

8
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:26,546
Niki and her son

9
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:30,377
- are about to get a visit 
from her fugitive husband.
- He's here!

10
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,652
D.L. Hawkins is a killer.

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,635
And Peter gets a
message from the future.

12
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:42,697
- This is what you've been waiting for.
- That will define their destiny.

13
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:44,434
The girl, you have to save her.

14
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:46,333
Save the cheerleader,
save the world!

15
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:47,980
We are all connected.

16
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,460
If this thing that you painted,
this bomb, is true,

17
00:00:50,496 --> 00:00:51,720
we're all dead.

18
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:54,553
And now, Heroes continues.

19
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,383
Chapter Six - Better Halves

20
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:07,911
Evolution is an imperfect
and often violent process.

21
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,551
A battle between what exists

22
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:13,391
and what is yet to be born.

23
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,180
In the midst of
these birth pains,

24
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:18,372
morality loses its meaning.

25
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,573
The question of good

26
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:24,142
and evil reduced to
one simple choice:

27
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:28,162
survive or perish.

28
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:30,203
We have to save her.

29
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,723
Ignore it. It's a wrong number.

30
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:37,070
Some Japanese guy keeps calling,
leaving messages.

31
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:43,110
Hello?

32
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,032
Mr. Isaac? Isaac Mendez?

33
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:47,511
Who is this?

34
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:51,053
Uh...my name is Hiro Nakamura.

35
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:53,193
My name is Peter Petrelli.

36
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:55,603
I have a message for you.

37
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:56,810
What did he say?

38
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,382
He has a message for you.

39
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:00,053
What message?

40
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:02,982
What message?

41
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:05,162
Save the cheerleader,
save the world.

42
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,841
Save the cheerleader,
save the world.

43
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:09,121
Cheerleader?

44
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:11,461
What cheerleader? Where?

45
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:13,682
What cheerleader? Where?

46
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,242
I don't know where she is.

47
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:16,800
Yeah, but you painted these.

48
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:19,001
So did you.

49
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:24,172
We don't know who she is.
We don't know where she is.

50
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:25,741
We just know that we
need to save her.

51
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:29,473
- Tell him about the guy from the future.
- He is the guy from the future.

52
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:32,900
A Hiro Nakamura
from the future,

53
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:36,700
who speaks English and
carries a sword stopped time

54
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:38,813
to tell me that I have
to save the cheerleader.

55
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,313
That's... that's all I know.

56
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,901
You came from the future and...

57
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,750
told them to save
the cheerleader.

58
00:02:46,076 --> 00:02:48,212
And you had a sword.

59
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,031
I had a sword?

60
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:52,912
Get to New York.

61
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:55,180
We'll find out where
the cheerleader is.

62
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,162
I had a sword.

63
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:03,052
Grab that side.

64
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:06,491
We must be missing something.
Some sign of where they are.

65
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:09,850
See, these paintings, they fit
together like pages in a comic book.

66
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:14,900
There's a panel missing.

67
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,482
What was right there?

68
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:19,240
Nothing. This is everything
I painted last night.

69
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,560
But there's a piece about that size.
I painted it weeks ago.

70
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:26,423
Simone has it.

71
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:28,161
Simone.

72
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:31,303
She took a bunch of
my paintings to sell.

73
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,050
It's with them.

74
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:34,692
What was it of?

75
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:37,573
I don't remember. I was high.

76
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,750
Then we need to get it back.

77
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:47,033
Tell her a guy from the
future said you needed it.

78
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,740
I'm sure she'll love that.

79
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:54,200
DeeDee wants to breed Mr.
Muggles with her poodle.

80
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:57,883
A poodle, for God's sake.

81
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:02,423
They call it a Pomapoo
or a Pooranian.

82
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:05,300
Mr. Muggles doesn't
want  anything to do...

83
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:07,770
with a breed that has
"poo" in its name.

84
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:10,380
"No, I don't,"
says Mr. Muggles.

85
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,662
Honey, I think we left
those cupcakes in too long.

86
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:17,213
- Smells like something's burning.
- They look okay.

87
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,010
I thought Mr.
Muggles doesn't like poodles, anyway.

88
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:23,112
Not after what happened
at the dog park.

89
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,960
I thought that big dog was
gonna chew your hand off.

90
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:29,431
Which would've put an end to
your cheerleading career.

91
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,051
It looked worse than it was.

92
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,780
And my cheerleading career is
scissor-kicking off the field as
we speak.

93
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,341
At least I'm playing my
part in the bake sale.

94
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:40,903
Cupcake? Only a dollar
for a very good cause.

95
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:42,713
Not  right now, Claire Bear.

96
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:46,033
You've been on the phone for an hour.
Who you been talking to?

97
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:48,572
Yeah, about that.

98
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:50,192
You know how you've
been wanting to

99
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:53,480
- meet your biological parents?
- Yeah?

100
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:55,460
I just got off the
phone with them.

101
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:58,290
Turns out they want to
meet you too, tomorrow.

102
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:00,672
Wait just a minute.
What about school?

103
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:03,490
We can't just drop
everything for these people.

104
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,671
- Who do they think they are?
- I didn't say yes.

105
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,062
Nobody's dropping anything.

106
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,121
Unless Claire wants us to.

107
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:16,050
This doesn't have to happen now.
You don't have to do this.

108
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,580
Not unless...

109
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,840
you're absolutely ready.

110
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:26,693
I'm ready.

111
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:12,693
You look beautiful, Nik.

112
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:15,571
D.L.

113
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,433
How the hell did
you get in here?

114
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:25,660
The police are right outside.

115
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:28,683
If  I scream,
they will be in here in two seconds.

116
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,963
Then I hope you don't scream.

117
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:56,033
You're not wearing
your wedding ring.

118
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,313
I think that you better leave.

119
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,372
You being here.

120
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:06,703
Come on,
that's not a good idea.

121
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:12,782
- Micah doesn't need this.
- Micah needs his father.

122
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:16,581
And I need my wife.

123
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:18,850
This is still my home.

124
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:26,740
I'm not going anywhere.

125
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,393
You can either
believe me or not.

126
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:32,742
I'm going to check on our boy.

127
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:36,320
- Open the door, ma'am.
- I'll let you get the door.

128
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,680
Ma'am, please open the door.

129
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:47,873
Ma'am, we thought we heard
something inside the house.

130
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,980
Is everything all right?

131
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:51,810
I was, uh...

132
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:55,411
- I was just talking with my son.
- Well, if you need anything,

133
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,801
we'll be out here till
tomorrow morning, okay?

134
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:00,832
Is something wrong?

135
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:08,541
If you want us to come inside,
just nod your head.

136
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,663
I'm fine.

137
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:16,753
You know, God,
it's just been a really long night.

138
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:22,363
Then we'll let you
get back to bed, okay?

139
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:26,022
- Just remember, we're here if you need us.
- Thank you.

140
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,773
You're welcome. Good night.

141
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,073
Okay.

142
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:45,791
So tell me what happened.

143
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:48,353
- I planned the job...
- I know that you planned the job.

144
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,135
"Baby, it's gonna solve
all out problems."

145
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:54,567
- It was $2 million. Enough to get us out of Vegas.
- The money that you stole from Linderman.

146
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:57,814
And if we ran with Linderman's money,
he wouldn't just kill me.

147
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:01,581
He'd kill you, Micah.
So I stepped out.

148
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,472
Only someone
stepped in after me.

149
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:07,483
Someone who knew the plan.
Someone who killed my crew.

150
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,833
Oh, and they just made
off with all the money?

151
00:09:09,868 --> 00:09:11,460
You have no idea who that is.

152
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,553
I know it was a woman.

153
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:15,743
A  woman?

154
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:18,263
There's a guy in North Vegas,
cleans money.

155
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,420
Heard he just cleaned
somebody $2 million,

156
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:22,011
so I'm gonna pay
him a visit tomorrow

157
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,981
and see if I can't
squeeze a name out of him.

158
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:26,431
Baby... Baby, don't worry.

159
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:31,571
How am I supposed to ask
someone if they're a freak

160
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:34,272
when they're probably just
gonna lie about it like I do?

161
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,792
Why don't you just ask them

162
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,870
what happens when
they cut themselves?

163
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:39,900
Or you could just cut
them and find out.

164
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:43,442
Probably just think I was all
bitter because they gave me away.

165
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:46,210
You're a little
bitchy sometimes,

166
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:47,883
but I don't think
you're all that bitter.

167
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,581
About the adoption thing,
I mean.

168
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:50,950
I'm not.

169
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,601
I mean, I'm curious about it.

170
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,863
And it's a little weird
and maybe a little sad,

171
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:00,303
but I'm not mad.
I mean, I love my parents.

172
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:05,763
What if your biological parents raised
you, though? It'd be an entirely
different scenario.

173
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:08,651
What if they can
do what I can do?

174
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:11,620
What if they're like me?

175
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:13,700
Well, I hope they're not.

176
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:16,031
No offense, but I like...

177
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:18,180
I like that you're the freak.

178
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:23,562
It makes you more...
special or whatever.

179
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:27,963
- Are you flirting with me?
- No.

180
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:29,621
Believe me, no.

181
00:10:29,918 --> 00:10:33,991
Um, look, do you plan on
coming out to your parents?

182
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,612
I mean,
the ones who raised you?

183
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,251
No.

184
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:39,281
My dad would unspool.

185
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:40,970
He's a really simple guy.

186
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:43,741
He'd never be able to wrap his
mind around something like that.

187
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,202
It would break him.

188
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:48,033
He's gonna find out.

189
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,822
What happens if we
get to New York...

190
00:10:55,006 --> 00:10:56,440
and it explodes?

191
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,133
If we get to New York...

192
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,321
it won't explode.

193
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:01,631
That's the idea,
it's the heroic journey.

194
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:03,742
It's your heroic journey.

195
00:11:04,257 --> 00:11:06,581
It's our heroic journey.

196
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,321
You don't have to
have superpowers...

197
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:10,722
to be a hero.

198
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:16,533
So why didn't "future you"...

199
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:18,852
come to see us?

200
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,732
Why did he go to
some Peter guy...

201
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,501
in New York that
we've never met?

202
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:25,752
"Future me" was afraid
of causing a rift...

203
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:29,203
in the space-time continuum.

204
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,551
You're talking out of your ass.

205
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:32,212
You don't know how
any of this works.

206
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:34,140
- I know exactly how this-
- Stop!

207
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,691
It's the High
Roller you cheated!

208
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:44,563
I cheated?

209
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,520
Quick! Teleport us somewhere!

210
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:51,771
It's okay.

211
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,402
I just want to talk to you.

212
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,763
I told you. We no cheat.

213
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,761
- Japanese people very lucky.
- I know you cheated.

214
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:03,491
I just don't know how.

215
00:12:03,937 --> 00:12:07,641
- Now it's time for a little payback.
- Huh?

216
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,801
Claire, honey,
your guests are here.

217
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:14,000
Hi, I'm Lisa.

218
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:26,643
You sure you don't want me to shove
'em into something on the way out?

219
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,172
- So how are we gonna do this?
- We don't.

220
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,192
You're couching me?

221
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,041
What do you think, D.L.?

222
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:39,023
You think you can just strut back in
here like nothing's ever happened?

223
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:41,801
Do you have any idea what I've
been through the last six months?

224
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,991
- No.
- No, you don't.

225
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,480
- I didn't want to leave you.
- But you did.

226
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,450
It was going fine.
We were making it.

227
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:50,580
Oh, 30 grand a year
doing construction.

228
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:52,253
That wasn't enough for you?

229
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:53,920
No, Nik,
it wasn't enough for me

230
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:56,241
because that business doesn't
fly when you have a family.

231
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:58,991
When you left,
I became another person.

232
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:01,791
I don't care that you took off
your clothes on the Internet.

233
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,562
I'm not mad about it.

234
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:05,481
Look, you did what
you had to do.

235
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:12,921
Look, you can stay
here tonight.

236
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:16,672
But you need to
leave in the morning.

237
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:20,480
If that's what you want.

238
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:32,821
Come to bed.

239
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,102
We've won enough.

240
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:45,402
We need to leave,
our mission awaits.

241
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,711
We still owe him more,
we can't leave yet.

242
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:51,062
Give them good cards,
but not too good.

243
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:54,233
Hey, Japanese guy,
you in or not?

244
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,493
I'm in.

245
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,112
So what's your system,
huh, pal?

246
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:05,200
Some ancient Oriental voodoo?

247
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,653
No  system.

248
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:08,352
Japanese people very lucky.

249
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,800
Japanese people better
run out of luck soon.

250
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:13,650
- I'm starting to think 
I'm getting hustled.
- Easy, Ernie.

251
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,743
It's a friendly game.
No one's getting hustled.

252
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:17,800
No hustle. Only good fortune.

253
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:57,660
Well, let's go.

254
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:05,850
I'm in for $400.

255
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:12,912
I will bet... $1,000.

256
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:20,803
Sorry. Beg pardon.

257
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,890
- We must use bathroom.
- Now?

258
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:38,690
We're in the middle of a hand.

259
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:41,721
Sorry. Must go now.
Too much beer.

260
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:43,830
You guys go to the
bathroom together?

261
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:46,813
Yes. It is how we roll.

262
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:56,230
I don't need to pee.

263
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:58,870
They're going to kill us!

264
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:00,011
What?

265
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:02,221
The man with the scary face...

266
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:04,200
has a gun under the
table pointed at me.

267
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:05,282
A gun?

268
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,682
- Hey, who invited her?
- What should we do?

269
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:10,430
We? No. You.

270
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,383
You need to get us
out of here now.

271
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,512
What's that?

272
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:18,843
What are you doing?

273
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:20,270
I need to stop it.

274
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,311
I couldn't save them.

275
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:36,032
I just hid in here.

276
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,023
A hero doesn't hide...

277
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:41,551
He does if he wants to live.

278
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,773
We need to get out of here.

279
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:48,092
Before whoever did
this comes back.

280
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,181
Your hair is getting so long.

281
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:06,653
- It's a mess.
- I like it.

282
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,011
Reminds me of when
we first met.

283
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:14,291
God, we were kids.

284
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,173
It was fly.

285
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:31,971
Oh, you should get some sleep.

286
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:34,802
You  didn't get much last night.

287
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,131
- I slept as much as you did.
- Uh-uh.

288
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,723
I heard you getting up.

289
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:41,611
Trying to be all quiet.

290
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:44,352
I did?

291
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:47,083
When?

292
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,361
What's wrong, baby?

293
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:08,811
Dad?

294
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:15,203
Oh! I missed you.

295
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,940
I missed you, too.

296
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:23,252
I guess the flying
Petrelli didn't fly.

297
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:25,052
We were on the train together,

298
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:28,033
then suddenly he started carrying
on about a mysterious traveler

299
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,660
who stopped time and told
him to save a cheerleader.

300
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:32,210
It was all very fascinating.

301
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,170
I should write a paper
on the experience.

302
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,520
Maybe you provoked
him with sarcasm.

303
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:39,002
Peter Petrelli went
from steady as a clam

304
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:41,142
to, as you say,
crap-house rat in a blink.

305
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:42,811
No provocation whatsoever.

306
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:44,981
Except maybe from
a time traveler.

307
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:48,501
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah, well, so would you.

308
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:53,072
Did I tell you that the man who
paints the future is a heroin addict?

309
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:56,371
- Did you see any of the paintings?
- I didn't see him.

310
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,600
After what I witnessed on the train,
I doubt he even exists.

311
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:01,532
Now what?

312
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:04,342
You just take Papa
Suresh back to India?

313
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:07,013
Just get on a plane
and that's it.

314
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:09,073
Yes,  that's exactly it.

315
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:11,772
And what about Mohinder?

316
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:15,671
We were no good for
each other anyway.

317
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,262
Thank you, Eden.

318
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,111
For all that you've done.
For both me and my father.

319
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,810
You're welcome.

320
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:28,273
You know, you can go back 
and scatter those ashes,

321
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:30,092
but you're always
gonna wonder if maybe

322
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,471
there was something to
what your father was doing

323
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:34,593
if you just looked again.

324
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:37,870
- Will I?
- Oh, yeah.

325
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:39,221
You're not done here.

326
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,632
That's why I'm not even
gonna say good-bye.

327
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:45,293
Good-bye, Eden.

328
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:47,492
See you later.

329
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:21,271
Like I said... see you later.

330
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,740
You're still
reading these, huh?

331
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:27,190
Remember all those comics
my granddad used to have.

332
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:28,493
Tales From the Crypt.

333
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:30,192
Vault of Doom.

334
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:32,682
Ooh! 9th Wonders!

335
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:35,590
Told you not to read them,
but you had to do it anyway.

336
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,753
Scared you silly.

337
00:21:38,268 --> 00:21:43,612
I am Luru the Invincible!

338
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:51,771
I'm sorry for not being around.

339
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:56,960
How's your mom?

340
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:59,803
- How's she doing?
- Okay.

341
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,752
You're looking
after her, right?

342
00:22:02,678 --> 00:22:05,181
'Cause you're the man of the
house when I'm not around.

343
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:06,941
I know. I'm trying.

344
00:22:11,637 --> 00:22:14,590
Dad... How'd you
get out of jail?

345
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:18,361
Between you and me...

346
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:21,433
I walked out.

347
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:24,460
Out of prison? How'd you do it?

348
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:27,463
- Ain't no jail can hold your old man.
- Why not?

349
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,931
'Cause I got a secret.

350
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:35,793
- Like Superman?
- Yeah. Just like Superman.

351
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,160
Got a bunch more comics.
Want to see?

352
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,963
Big Daddy, go get 'em.

353
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:46,992
It's gonna crush him
when you run again.

354
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,861
There won't be
any more running.

355
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:50,383
Not after today.

356
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:52,262
This is not just gonna go away.

357
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:54,562
It will when I get
that woman's name.

358
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:58,973
I guess I could hunker down in your
backseat, and you could give me a lift.

359
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:00,673
Every cop in Vegas
is looking for me.

360
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:02,610
So you want me to
take that risk.

361
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:05,611
I want you to hear that I was
set up from the horse's mouth.

362
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,540
I know you, Nik.

363
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:12,162
You're starting to believe me because
I'm standing here staring you in
the face.

364
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:15,250
But once I'm out of your sight,
you're gonna start to wonder.

365
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:19,273
And I don't ever want you
to wonder about me again.

366
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:28,882
She has your mouth and your nose,
doesn't she?

367
00:23:29,725 --> 00:23:33,590
Yeah, it looks like it,
doesn't it.

368
00:23:35,608 --> 00:23:38,523
I wonder what else
of yours I have.

369
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,361
Can I get anybody
anything to drink?

370
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:49,502
Lemonade, just made a
pitcher from scratch.

371
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:51,031
We have sodas, iced tea.

372
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:52,933
We have cupcakes,
don't we, Claire?

373
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,943
Just made 'em last night.
The two of us.

374
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:57,222
Sort of a thing we do.

375
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:04,050
- I would love some lemonade, thank you.
- Me too.

376
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:06,650
- Claire?
- Yes, please.

377
00:24:06,665 --> 00:24:09,762
Three lemonades
coming right up.

378
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:20,130
So, what can we tell
you about ourselves?

379
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:41,941
I don't see a welcome mat.

380
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:43,991
It's all right.
I know these guys.

381
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:46,131
We used to get stuff
done for Linderman.

382
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:55,201
Wasn't that locked?

383
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,660
Guess not. Come on.

384
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:03,252
Maybe they moved.

385
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:05,671
They didn't move.

386
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:11,442
Go back to the car.

387
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:15,912
Go back to the car now.

388
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:24,531
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

389
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:27,402
- Come on. Come on!
- No!

390
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:31,792
Oh, uh,
we're not together anymore.

391
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:34,842
As high school sweethearts, we

392
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:36,792
didn't even make
it to graduation.

393
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:40,422
Once Lisa got pregnant,
it was over.

394
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:42,202
He wanted to keep the baby.

395
00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:43,651
You.

396
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:46,011
And I didn't.

397
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,721
You probably think I'm a bad
person for giving you up.

398
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,942
No, I don't think that.

399
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:58,222
This is so awkward
I've got lip sweat.

400
00:25:58,446 --> 00:26:00,420
Should you be eavesdropping?

401
00:26:01,236 --> 00:26:04,192
- Yes.
- Oh, I guess.

402
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:05,991
What else are we gonna do?

403
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,033
So is there anything
I should know?

404
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:10,920
Like, medically.

405
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:14,941
Anything weird or
out of the ordinary.

406
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:21,701
Well, there is something.

407
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:25,820
I have diabetes.

408
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,163
Diabetes.

409
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:34,051
All you gotta worry about
from my side of the family

410
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:37,251
is a history of cancer
and heart disease.

411
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,642
Great.

412
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:45,311
Sorry!

413
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:47,571
Sorry.

414
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:51,643
Hello. Yeah.

415
00:26:52,116 --> 00:26:53,511
Yes, how are you?

416
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:55,570
Hold on a second. It's work.

417
00:26:56,246 --> 00:27:00,981
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Suresh just left for India.

418
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:03,442
Then stop him.

419
00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:05,222
I tried.

420
00:27:05,468 --> 00:27:07,712
We both know you
can try harder.

421
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:09,482
He's already gone.

422
00:27:10,557 --> 00:27:12,152
But he'll be back.

423
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:18,551
What about Peter Petrelli?

424
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:21,733
He claims he can fly,
but I don't have confirmation.

425
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:25,190
Also, there may have been an encounter
with somebody who can stop time.

426
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:28,252
Really? That's cool.

427
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:30,771
Evidentially he had a
message for Petrelli.

428
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,442
He told him to save
the cheerleader.

429
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:40,943
- Are you still there?
- Yeah.

430
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:44,023
Thanks for the update.

431
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,492
So what do you want me
to do with the precog?

432
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:48,531
Bring him in.

433
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,243
I've never seen
anything like that.

434
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:04,860
I have.

435
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,580
- In the garage.
- In the garage?

436
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:20,940
After you left,

437
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:22,852
I borrowed money
from Linderman.

438
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:26,163
- How much?
- 30.

439
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,360
I got behind on the rent.
Micah's tuition.

440
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:31,541
I didn't know what else to do.

441
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,042
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:37,873
When didn't I pay
Linderman back in time,

443
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:40,183
he sent two guys to collect.

444
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,212
It got physical.

445
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,613
I got knocked out.

446
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:46,352
When I woke up,

447
00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:48,460
they were dead.

448
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:52,632
And it looked like
what we saw today.

449
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:54,843
- What, they were torn apart?
- Uh-huh.

450
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:58,233
I have gone over it a
thousand times in my head.

451
00:28:59,107 --> 00:29:01,211
I didn't see anything.

452
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:03,371
Anyone.

453
00:29:03,986 --> 00:29:06,023
I was the only person there.

454
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:10,970
It was me.

455
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:13,570
Nik, look at me.

456
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,843
- You did not do this.
- What if I did?

457
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,770
W-what if I got up in the middle
of the night and I went...

458
00:29:20,997 --> 00:29:23,301
Baby, you are being played.

459
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:25,252
Whoever set me up set you up,

460
00:29:25,587 --> 00:29:28,130
and they're making damn
sure I can't clear my name.

461
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:31,321
- I don't...
- But the one thing 
they're not counting on...

462
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:32,643
is us.

463
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:36,531
Us?

464
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:40,252
Mom, have you seen my backpack?

465
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,251
Did you leave it at Tina's?

466
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:46,502
No, I had it when I came home.

467
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:49,493
Okay, honey,
will you just give me another minute?

468
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,190
We need to tell the police.

469
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,820
They'll never believe us.

470
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:00,841
The only way I
can clear my name

471
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,521
is to find the person
that did this myself.

472
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:05,483
Okay, it's been a minute.

473
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:11,091
I'll come help you.

474
00:30:19,806 --> 00:30:20,341
Micah.

475
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:51,263
- Micah, where'd you get that?
- Get what?

476
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:52,733
Your backpack.

477
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,362
You just gave it to me.

478
00:30:57,078 --> 00:30:58,791
I did?

479
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:01,841
Yeah, Mom,
you were just in here two minutes ago.

480
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,720
You told me to
pack some clothes

481
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:05,840
and that we were going
to Grandma's house.

482
00:31:05,937 --> 00:31:09,013
- Mom, are you okay?
- No.

483
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,500
No, you know what? I just...

484
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:14,973
I need to go lay down.

485
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:16,633
I'm not feeling well.

486
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:30,133
God... what's happening to me?

487
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:34,913
No!

488
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:40,170
You need to pull
yourself together.

489
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:46,792
- You're not real.
- Oh, I am as real as you are.

490
00:31:49,465 --> 00:31:53,882
No. No,
I have a tumor or something.

491
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,302
- This is...
- Poor little crazy girl.

492
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:59,752
A hallucination.
Is that what you think you are?

493
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,051
Oh, we're a lot
of things, Niki,

494
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:03,952
but we're not crazy.

495
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,292
Micah, where's Mom?

496
00:32:06,587 --> 00:32:08,293
She's in her bedroom.

497
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,272
She didn't feel good.

498
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:12,042
Yeah.

499
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,831
Yeah, she's had a hard day.

500
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:18,411
What do you think D.L. is gonna do
when he finds out what we've done?

501
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:20,261
What we've done?

502
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:22,970
Are you and Mom gonna
get back together?

503
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,072
Most of the time...

504
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:40,841
in relationships,
when somebody makes a mistake,

505
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:43,502
the other person just
pretends it didn't happen.

506
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:48,592
But when someone thinks you made
a mistake and you didn't, it...

507
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:53,173
It just gets a lot
more complicated.

508
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:56,582
We framed him.
We killed his crew.

509
00:32:56,877 --> 00:32:58,872
Stole $2 million.

510
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:00,911
We killed those
thugs in the garage.

511
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:04,100
Killed those little
bitches at the poker game.

512
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:08,870
- We've been very busy.
- Those men were ripped apart.

513
00:33:09,105 --> 00:33:12,580
Yeah, well... What can I say?

514
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:16,510
- But they didn't do anything to me.
- Leaving witnesses would be sloppy.

515
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:17,952
I did what had to be done.

516
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,290
Like I always do.

517
00:33:20,908 --> 00:33:23,320
Are you getting back
together or not?

518
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:27,531
I don't know.

519
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:32,480
I hope so.

520
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:36,180
And this is what
we're gonna do now.

521
00:33:39,095 --> 00:33:40,862
You're gonna get the money,

522
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:45,081
and you're going to take Micah as
far away from D.L. as you can.

523
00:33:45,308 --> 00:33:47,982
- I'll do the rest.
- D.L. can take care of me.

524
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:53,062
- I don't need you.
- Niki... He'll think you're crazy.

525
00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:56,240
And then he'll take
Micah away from us.

526
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:59,431
He'll put it all together,
and when he does...

527
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:03,950
it's really only a question of
whether he kills you before he leaves.

528
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:06,621
Dad, you know how
you have a secret?

529
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:09,221
Mm-hmm.

530
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:12,791
Mom has a secret too.

531
00:34:13,075 --> 00:34:14,811
So you have a choice.

532
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:21,223
You can let D.L.
take our son away from us forever, or...

533
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:25,180
you can do exactly what I say.

534
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:32,821
Where's the money?

535
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:35,380
Good choice.

536
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:44,723
I should have saved them.

537
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,142
You'd have been killed.

538
00:34:49,427 --> 00:34:51,931
I've been given a gift, Ando.

539
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:55,100
I'm supposed to use
it to help people.

540
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:56,770
To save people.

541
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,063
I failed.

542
00:35:01,606 --> 00:35:03,723
You're being too
hard on yourself.

543
00:35:07,377 --> 00:35:12,761
Maybe I'm not the
hero I thought I was.

544
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:17,723
Every hero is on a journey to
find his place in the world.

545
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,800
But it's a journey.

546
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:21,801
You don't start at the end.

547
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:25,241
Otherwise, they can't make
a movie about it later.

548
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:28,020
What if I'm on the wrong path?

549
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:30,912
What if I was supposed
to save those people?

550
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,923
You can bend time and space.

551
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:34,683
Maybe when you can
do it better...

552
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,931
you can come back
here and fix things.

553
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,263
Like a do-over?

554
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:40,722
Exactly.

555
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:45,670
A do-over. I like that.

556
00:35:53,227 --> 00:35:55,052
Where's your father?

557
00:35:55,416 --> 00:35:59,243
I mean, not your biological father,
but, you know, your dad.

558
00:35:59,636 --> 00:36:02,072
He's walking out
the bio-parents.

559
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:05,283
Is that what you're calling them,
the bio-parents?

560
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:09,410
Oh, that's so cold and impersonal.
And fitting.

561
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,233
Thanks again for coming out.

562
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,582
I know your visit
meant a lot to Claire.

563
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:16,502
When I was her age,
I had enough weighing on my head.

564
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:17,962
I'm glad I could help.

565
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:21,992
Thanks.

566
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:24,132
Thank you.

567
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,572
I think that went pretty well.

568
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:32,063
Yeah.

569
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,853
If there's anything
else you need...

570
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:37,572
I'll keep you posted.

571
00:36:40,057 --> 00:36:42,132
Was it what you
were hoping for?

572
00:36:43,155 --> 00:36:44,560
Not really.

573
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:47,501
I mean,
I don't know what I was hoping for.

574
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:51,103
I guess I just wanted
them to tell me who I am.

575
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:54,400
They don't know any
better than I do.

576
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:59,120
Baby, nobody can tell
you who you are.

577
00:36:59,328 --> 00:37:02,120
That's just something you
gotta figure out for yourself.

578
00:37:06,317 --> 00:37:07,981
Can we throw these away?

579
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,451
- Are they burnt?
- No.

580
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,091
I'm just afraid I'll
eat 'em all if we don't.

581
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:15,801
You know,
I have to hand it to your dad.

582
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:19,582
This isn't the first time we've
tried to find those bio-parents.

583
00:37:20,086 --> 00:37:22,210
- It's not?
- Un-uh.

584
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,130
When you were a baby...

585
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:27,990
we thought you had something wrong
with your chromosomes. Some disease.

586
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:31,221
We needed to screen your parents
to see if they were carriers.

587
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:35,080
I was scared to death,
and they were nowhere to be found.

588
00:37:35,347 --> 00:37:36,890
What kind of disease?

589
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:39,601
How did you know there was
something wrong with me?

590
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:41,741
Nothing was wrong with you.
You were fine.

591
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:44,461
It's just, I don't know,
one of those things.

592
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:46,131
Of what things?

593
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:49,101
Was I doing anything abnormal?

594
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:51,190
You had a cough, Claire.

595
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:53,731
Don't turn hypochondriac on me.

596
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:56,083
Your brother's
bad enough. Mwah!

597
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,931
Come on, you. Come on.

598
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:07,461
So... Was that as scary
for you as it was for me?

599
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:11,541
You're a very brave man, Dad.

600
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:11,690
Oh, God.

601
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,152
All this time.

602
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:26,543
I can explain.

603
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,671
You played me for a fool.
Set me up.

604
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:30,400
No, I can explain everything.

605
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:32,923
I know...
I know what this looks like.

606
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:35,372
- I loved you, Niki.
- No, there is this other person.

607
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:36,393
I can't control it.

608
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:39,011
I don't know what's
happening to me.

609
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:42,862
I'm taking Micah.
And I'm taking the money.

610
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:46,191
Good-bye, Niki.

611
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,213
You're not taking anything.

612
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:58,111
- Mom, is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

613
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:01,422
Your dad and I are
just moving furniture.

614
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:04,061
Go to your room.

615
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:23,982
So this is how you
got out of jail.

616
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:34,121
Mom?

617
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:42,800
Isaac Mendez?

618
00:41:44,857 --> 00:41:46,261
Who are you?

619
00:41:46,497 --> 00:41:48,272
I'm an admirer of your work.

620
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:51,101
May I come in?

621
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:58,610
Evolution is an imperfect
and often violent process.

622
00:41:58,857 --> 00:42:01,053
Morality loses its meaning.

623
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:07,313
The question of good and evil
reduced to one simple choice:

624
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:11,162
survive or perish.

625
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:15,071
Thanks to Raceman
