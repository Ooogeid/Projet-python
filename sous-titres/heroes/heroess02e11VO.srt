2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,680
Tell me where I can find the virus

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,930
So I can stop it.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,320
Odessa, Texas.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,320
Texas.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,580
Wait!

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,610
I was there when your father first brought you in,

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,160
And then they started the testing.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,190
My father would never let that happen.

10
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:21,960
We need to be heroes like dad.

11
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,066
Being a hero is what got your father killed.

12
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:25,765
You're gonna help me get back my dad's medal?

13
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,637
As long as you stay out of the way.

14
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:30,500
Anything crazy happens, I need you safe.

15
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:34,540
I'm taking my sister!

16
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:39,713
Gabriel!

18
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:42,423
I just wanna help you.

19
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:45,270
You have done that, and so much more.

20
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:49,131
Why am I not dead?

21
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:50,131
You would have been,

22
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:52,022
If not for an infusion of your daughter's blood.

23
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:53,092
Your recovery has proven

24
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,331
This blood has tremendous regenerative properties.

25
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:57,181
Kidnapped me and murdered my father.

26
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:00,183
I'll show everyone exactly what I can do.

27
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:01,173
Once the secret's out,

28
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:03,710
You won't be able to touch me or my family.

31
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:11,090
I think I found the cure, Niki.

32
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:12,410
I'll bring it to you on the next flight.

33
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:14,183
Mohinder. Sylar?

34
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:16,551
I convinced the babysitter to take the night off.

35
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:34,181
Welcome home, dr. Suresh.

36
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:36,050
What happened to your nose?

37
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:37,763
Where's Molly?

38
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:38,710
Asleep.

39
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:40,943
Keep your voice down. we don't wanna wake her.

40
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:43,302
What is it you want?

41
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,170
Breakfast?

42
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:55,133
I hope you don't mind. Maya cooked.

43
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:58,971
She makes the most amazing chilaquiles.

44
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,391
It's such an honor to meet you.

45
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:04,503
she is the one should be honored.

46
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:06,150
Maya came all the way from south america

47
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,660
Just to be here, Mohinder.

48
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:08,523
Really?

49
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:09,992
Why's that?

50
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,243
I read your father's book.

51
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:14,433
He has so many answers.

52
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:17,530
But I have so many more questions.

53
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,023
Sit. eat.

54
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,023
I'm starving.

55
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,323
I knew fateabriel told me brought us together. other,ot

56
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,113
Gabriel.

57
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,611
You mean Sylar, don't you?

58
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,100
You do know this man's a killer.

59
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,053
Yes.

60
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:39,052
He told me.

61
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,251
He did?

62
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:47,401
And I am ashamed to admit that...

63
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:49,660
I have taken lives as well.

64
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:53,133
I have this sickness that comes out of me.

65
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,062
It poisons everyone around.

66
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,363
I need your help, dr. Suresh.

67
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,403
So that's what this is about.

68
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:01,881
We both need your help.

69
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:03,500
Why's that?

70
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,772
I was reading about your lab work on the laptop--

71
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,160
The Shanti virus.

72
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:11,002
Does it really take away a person's abilities?

73
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:13,303
It also has the unfortunate side effect

74
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:15,202
Of killing the person infected.

75
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:16,783
Is that why your powers are gone?

76
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,273
That you have this virus?

77
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:31,581
Gabriel...

78
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:33,901
What are you doing?

79
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,933
Maya, I need you to stay calm.

80
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:36,793
Apparently, Mohinder,

81
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:39,160
Your blood is the answer to my ills.

82
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:40,572
No. no, not always.

83
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,873
Trust me, there are many different strains of the virus.

84
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:46,470
But when you mix it with a certain cheerleader's blood,

85
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,340
It changes, doesn't it?

86
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:49,750
And it heals anything.

87
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,270
Isn't that right, doctor?

88
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:55,222
You lied to me?

89
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,310
I don't know what he told you, but he is not my friend.

90
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:02,822
He's a monster. Maya?

91
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,491
Do not spoil this!

92
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:10,142
My brother was right t to trust you.

93
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,402
Do you really wanna kill dr. Suresh,

94
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,102
The one man who can save you?

95
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:17,313
Molly!

96
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,802
And she dies...

97
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,971
A sweet, innocent little girl.

98
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:30,261
Stop it, Maya! now!

99
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:46,272
All right.

100
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:49,121
I'll help you, but not here.

101
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:52,440
We need to get to my lab.

102
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,573
Lead the way...

103
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:57,713
Doctor.

105
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:04,912
I suppose I have you to thank

106
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,742
For my early release from jail.

107
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:08,533
You didn't kill anyone, mom.

108
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:10,721
But Adam Monroe did. again.

109
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,021
Victoria pratt is dead.

110
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:14,823
I found her body at her place in Maine.

111
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:16,962
Adam signed it with one of these.

112
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,541
Where's Adam going next?

113
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:24,370
How long are we gonna suffer for your sins?

114
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:26,083
For your generation's deeds?

115
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:31,942
Adam wanted revenge on those of us who betrayed him.

116
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:35,201
It's done now. let it go, Nathan.

117
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:36,722
It's over.

118
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:37,943
Peter's alive.

119
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,572
Mom.

120
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:43,213
And he's working with Adam.

121
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:44,780
They both killed Victoria Pratt.

122
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,931
Their fingerprints are all over the murder scene.

123
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:58,991
It all went so wrong.

124
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:01,930
30 years ago,

125
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:06,673
A group of us came together to change the world,

126
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:07,962
To fix it.

127
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:09,741
And Adam...

128
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,870
Had a perspective on history that was compelling,

129
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,573
And we believed in him.

130
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:17,072
I did.

131
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:19,611
Linderman. your father.

132
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:21,250
Bosaid you locked him away.

133
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:24,781
No. not at first.

134
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,592
In the beginning, I helped him.

135
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:29,711
You what?

136
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:32,162
And in the end, Adam decided

137
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:33,542
That the world just wasn't worth fixing,

138
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:35,813
And that it needed to be wiped clean

139
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:37,950
With an unstoppable virus.

140
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,520
Just before it was too late i, um...

141
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,990
I came to realize how wrong it was.

142
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,062
Did you?

143
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:48,970
You and Linderman wanted to blow up new york

144
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,406
To save the world.

145
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:54,695
Doesn't sound to me like you've changed much at all, ma.

146
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,587
Only someone with Peter's abilities

147
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,452
Could get to where the virus is stored.

148
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:02,911
That's why Adam chose him.

149
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,173
Where would that be, mrs. Petrelli?

150
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:05,303
Odessa.

151
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,090
Texas. Primatech.

152
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,910
Adam will never quit.

153
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,391
One bullet right through his head.

154
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:24,702
It's the only way.

155
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:27,922
Come on.

156
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:29,403
If you can't stop Peter,

157
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,541
If you can't stop Peter,

158
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:33,781
You'll have to kill him too.

159
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,142
Right through the head.

160
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,241
This doesn't look like the sort of place

161
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:46,681
Where they'd store a virus that could destroy the world.

162
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,310
Paper company's just a front.

163
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,233
The good stuff's three floors down.

164
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,772
Laboratories, jail cells...

165
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:07,740
Hiro?

166
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,043
Peter petrelli?

167
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:11,052
What are you doing here?

168
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:13,012
Adam monroe killed my father.

169
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,640
And for that, he must pay.

170
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:17,542
No!

171
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:23,752
I can't let you hurt him.

172
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:32,193
Why are you protecting him?

173
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,620
Adam is my friend.

174
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:38,191
He was my friend too. 400 years ago.

175
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:42,342
He betrayed me. he will betray you.

176
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:47,843
He saved my brother's life.

177
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:49,612
He murdered my father.

178
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:52,561
Your father had him locked away for 30 years.

179
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,682
I know. I was in that same prison.

180
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:10,223
Hiro...

181
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:12,530
I went into the future.

182
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:14,860
There's a virus.

183
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,551
It kills almost everyone.

184
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:20,162
And it starts here. today.

185
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:22,273
Adam and I are gonna stop it.

186
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:28,011
Hiro?

187
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,470
He froze time.

188
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,283
Said he knew you.

189
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:34,201
We were friends once.

190
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:36,760
A very long time ago.

191
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:38,363
He tried to kill you.

192
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:40,751
He said I shouldn't trust you.

193
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:41,981
And what did you think about that?

194
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,100
Let's go destroy the virus.

195
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:46,131
Right.

197
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:08,892
Dad left records

198
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,401
Of pretty much everything he did for the company.

199
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:14,522
You are really going through with this.

200
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,340
They killed dad.

201
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:17,661
They're never gonna leave us alone.

202
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,011
You do realize what'll happen to us

203
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,252
If you tell everyone what you can do.

204
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:23,941
Yes.

205
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:26,783
No more running. no more hiding.

206
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,312
No more secrets.

207
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,673
Your father couldn't take down this company, Claire.

208
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:32,421
What makes you think you can?

209
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:37,102
I don't know if you can understand it.

210
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:40,400
They only target pple with abilities.

211
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:43,213
People like me.

212
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,753
You are still my daughter, Claire.

213
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:52,493
I dream about you going to college,

214
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:53,842
Getting married someday.

215
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,711
What if they take you from me...

216
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:02,733
Use you in some lab experiment?

217
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:07,600
I love you, mom.

218
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:11,441
I can't live in fear of some big "what if?"

219
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,372
Do you realize how much damage you've done

220
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:22,190
By provoking claire?

221
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:23,510
I couldn't help it.

222
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:26,852
She was just so...weepy

223
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,951
And earnest and...

224
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:30,642
Who knew she'd turn whistle-blower?

225
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:33,652
It's totally unprofessional, not to mention petty.

226
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,191
And Claire is not even in your league!

227
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,860
She isn't working with a gunshot wound.

228
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:39,712
You and I both know

229
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:42,933
You have performed well below what you can do.

230
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:46,652
You're benched.

231
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,283
No more field assignments.

232
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:54,592
How's about if I said I was sorry?

233
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,173
When I think about all the hard work

234
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,482
I put into raising you...

235
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:04,711
Daddy...

236
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:23,102
You said you knew all about my ability.

237
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:25,511
Tell me what my dad did to me.

238
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,102
I'm stuck in this hellhole.

239
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:31,771
My family thinks I'm dead.

240
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,940
There's not a lot of incentive to share.

241
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:41,000
I could make you tell me.

242
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:43,010
You could try.

243
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,430
Please.

244
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:55,572
I don't have anyone else to talk to.

245
00:12:57,465 --> 00:13:00,361
They wanted to see how much wattage you could discharge.

246
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:02,953
Enough to power a flashlight,

247
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:06,162
Street lamp, an entire city block?

248
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,421
During testing, you'd pass out from the strain.

249
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:11,321
We'd all want to call it a day,

250
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:14,012
But daddy said, "no, my girl's tougher than that."

251
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,620
You were seven.

252
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:20,961
You know, the hardest thing a parent ever does

253
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,711
Is to have to see their child in pain.

254
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,542
Most parents.

255
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:30,760
Elle.

256
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you doing here?

257
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:39,882
Leaving.

258
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,901
Noah, we have a problem.

259
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,403
I'm not part of your "we."

260
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:52,883
Do you remember?

261
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:55,402
This is about Claire.

262
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,153
She's becoming difficult.

263
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:02,162
Is she?

264
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:05,992
I need to know if she could possibly have

265
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:09,560
Any hard evidence which could leave this company exposed.

266
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:19,981
That's unfortunate.

267
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,630
Because now we're going to have to take measures

268
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,561
To keep your daughter quiet.

269
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:31,720
Mom!

270
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:33,661
Micah! where have you been?

271
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,052
I've been looking everywhere for you.

272
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:37,583
Monica tried to get my stuff back that was stolen.

273
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,091
Dad's medal, my comics.

274
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:40,963
I told you to let the police handle it.

275
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,183
She got caught.

276
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:43,942
I'm calling the police.

277
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,882
You can call them after we find her.

278
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,423
She was taken in a redan. we have to rescue her.

279
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:49,803
With your super strength--

280
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:50,741
Micah, stop.

281
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:53,241
I don't have my strength anymore.

282
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:54,671
What?

283
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,791
The virus-- it has side effects.

284
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:58,300
But it's okay.

285
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:00,312
I got a call from dr. Suresh.

286
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:01,871
He maybe found a cure.

287
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:03,560
He's on his way here to make me better.

288
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:05,983
I hope so.

289
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:09,883
But right now, Monica needs my help.

290
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:11,620
So all you have to do is drive.

291
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,480
Warning. security breach.

292
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:25,821
Unauthorized personnel the area.

293
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,503
I believe it's up to the left.

294
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,962
Oh, please. it's been 30 years.

295
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:39,030
Warning security breach.

296
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,500
Take care of that, will you?

297
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,093
Warning. security breach.

298
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,262
So what do we do now?

299
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:58,210
I guess you'll have to pry it open

300
00:15:58,215 --> 00:15:59,692
With that brain of yours.

301
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,711
I'm not sure I have that sort of power.

302
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,273
There's not much at stake here--

303
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:08,620
Just the fate of the entire human race.

304
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:12,730
Did you kill Hiro's father?

305
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:15,642
I did.

306
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,152
He saw to it that the virus be safely kept here.

307
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:21,901
If he didn't plan to use it, why not destroy it?

308
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,611
Why don't you make me believe you, Adam.

309
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,431
Hiro said not to trust you.

310
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:28,420
The woman you love is trapped in some horrible future

311
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,012
Where nearly everyone's dead.

312
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:32,062
You can change that.

313
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:34,741
She needs you, Peter.

314
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:39,790
We all need you... to open that door.

315
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:12,570
You're nothing like you said you were.

316
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:14,641
Alejandro was right about you all along.

317
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:15,853
You wanna get rid of your powers,

318
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:17,283
I want mine back.

319
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:19,703
After Suresh fixes me,

320
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,833
I'll gladly take yours off your hands.

321
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:25,812
There's a bed over there.

322
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,283
Stay put. stay calm.

323
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:30,613
And remember...

324
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,511
Mohinder.

325
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:34,913
It'll be okay, Molly, I promise.

326
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:39,870
So this is your... laboratory, huh?

327
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:43,302
I killed that artist, Isaac Mendez,

328
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,270
Right on this very spot.

329
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:50,883
I'm going to have to take

330
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,213
A sample of your blood.

331
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:53,073
Why?

332
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:54,670
You self-diagnosed.

333
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:57,000
I need to know what strain of the virus you have.

334
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,441
Or if you even have it at all.

335
00:17:58,445 --> 00:17:59,670
Just give me the remedy.

336
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:00,872
Doesn't work like that.

337
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:02,971
The wrong dosage will kill you.

338
00:18:15,406 --> 00:18:16,833
Your father helped me find my gift.

339
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:18,263
Now here you are restoring it.

340
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,160
Life has its poetry, doesn't it?

341
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:21,602
My father who you murdered.

342
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:23,161
Your father who betrayed me.

343
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,920
Don't make that same mistake, Mohinder.

344
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:12,901
Does Suresh know you have him on video surveillance?

345
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:21,493
Sylar.

346
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:27,420
Oh, daddy, you're gonna be so proud of me.

347
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,433
Where am i? that doesn't matter.

348
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:45,011
Both you and it are about to get country fried.

349
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:46,563
Please, let me go!

350
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,281
I swear, I was only trying to help somebody!

351
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:50,523
You shoulda thought about that

352
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:52,113
Before you started messing up my business.

353
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:54,712
So you thought you was gonna be a hero, huh?

354
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:58,552
You know what happens to heroes in the real world?

355
00:19:58,566 --> 00:19:59,861
They end up dead...

356
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:01,280
Just like you.

357
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:10,671
Turn left here.

358
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,840
Explain to me how that works.

359
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:16,212
Monica has a cell phone,

360
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:18,631
And the battery emits a tiny gps signal

361
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:20,601
Which I can use to try and get her position.

362
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:22,343
Basically, I told

363
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:23,860
Your cell phone to find her cell phone

364
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:25,341
And show me where it is.

365
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:26,541
You told the phone.

366
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:28,623
Yeah.

367
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:30,972
Don't slow down.

368
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:32,442
The light'll change.

369
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:41,040
Let me guess. you told it to?

370
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,310
Slow down, slow down, slow down!

372
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:57,581
We don't talk about that ever again.

373
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:58,530
Agreed.

374
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:00,990
Look, before we go in,

375
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,883
I need to know something.

376
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,551
Is Peter as dangerous as he was in Kirby plaza?

377
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,050
You know, with the whole--puhh!

378
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:08,340
I haven't seen him since that night,

379
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,312
But I trust him with my life, Parkman.

380
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:11,650
Yeah, but your mother...

381
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:13,230
Your mother told me

382
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:16,431
That if I had to that I should kill Peter.

383
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:20,290
Listening to my mother has never led to anything good.

384
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:22,443
If Peter becomes a problem, I'll handle him.

385
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:24,930
Flying man!

386
00:21:27,925 --> 00:21:29,441
Who's this guy supposed to be?

387
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:40,253
Oh, good, you're here.

388
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,943
Uh, so these two boxes are done.

389
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:42,851
They can go in the car.

390
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:45,460
I didn't come to help you, Claire.

391
00:21:46,396 --> 00:21:47,550
I came to stop you.

392
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:52,361
These people ruined my life.

393
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:54,000
Your life.

394
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:55,861
No. they didn't.

395
00:21:56,696 --> 00:21:58,082
But what you're about to do--

396
00:21:58,147 --> 00:21:59,681
I'm pretty sure that will.

397
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:02,030
West, you're the one who said that we were special,

398
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:04,600
That the rules didn't apply to us.

399
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:06,310
I think you misunderstood me.

400
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:07,731
If we show everyone what we can do,

401
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:09,213
They'll listen to us.

402
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:12,991
I can't. I like my secrets.

403
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:15,521
And I liked finding in you

404
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:18,003
Someone who I could share that with.

405
00:22:18,648 --> 00:22:20,883
But after you go public, it's all gone.

406
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:23,453
You saw what they did to my dad.

407
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:27,321
This is the only way to beat them.

408
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:30,650
Exposing us isn't going to bring him back.

409
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:34,051
Fine.

410
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:37,672
Here's your file.

411
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:39,363
It's everything they have on you.

412
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,163
Now there isn't an "us" for you to be worried about.

413
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:44,093
Claire, please, don't do this.

414
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:13,513
You won't leave me, will you, mr. Muggles?

415
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:33,522
Hello, Claire-bear.

416
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:37,993
I wish Alejandro was here to help.

417
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:39,273
Who's that?

418
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:40,610
He's my brother.

419
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:42,982
I sent him away.

420
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:45,470
Gabriel said--

421
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,292
I can find him for you.

422
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:52,302
Even if he's far away.

423
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:54,963
So you know he's safe.

424
00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:56,123
You can?

425
00:23:56,877 --> 00:23:57,790
How?

426
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,611
I just know where people are.

427
00:24:01,948 --> 00:24:04,610
I need a picture or something to think about.

428
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:09,312
This is Alejandro.

429
00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:12,163
Here.

430
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:31,902
He's not anywhere.

431
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:34,400
But...

432
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:36,680
If he's not anywhere...

433
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:48,701
How--

434
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,943
You have the same strain of the virus Niki has.

435
00:24:53,445 --> 00:24:55,331
The company injected you as well.

436
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,092
Injected me?

437
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:58,960
Someone did this to me?

438
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:00,520
You killed him?

439
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,532
You killed my brother!

440
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:14,212
Now look what you made me do.

441
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:26,931
Where is the "heal anything" blood?

442
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,862
Please.

443
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,623
You had it here all along?

444
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:44,913
You and I have trust issues, doctor.

445
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:46,950
Give it to her first.

446
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:47,742
Let me see you save her.

447
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,423
Then if it works... I'll let you save me.

448
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:54,560
It was a lie?

449
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:55,201
Another lie?

450
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:56,400
No, please, eau have to understand.

451
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:58,653
None of this was my decision.

452
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,610
But I saw you get shot.

453
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:02,712
I saw it! it's because of you.

454
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:05,021
They injected me with your blood.

455
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:07,563
You healed me.

456
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:11,612
I-i don't get it.

457
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:13,331
And we're just supposed to pretend you weren't dead?

458
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:15,251
This is an impossible situation

459
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:16,983
And it's just getting worse, Claire.

460
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:17,843
You have to stop.

461
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:20,033
Stop what? your plans to expose the company.

462
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,010
It's unacceptable.

463
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:23,511
If we destroy them, we get our lives back, you back.

464
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:25,701
No, if you push this, they will react.

465
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:27,073
React?

466
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:29,400
No, it--it's not gonna come to that.

467
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,470
I've made a deal that' gonna keep you all alive.

468
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:33,630
What deal?

469
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,302
I have to go back with them.

470
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,423
And you all will live normal lives.

471
00:26:39,426 --> 00:26:41,171
That's all I've ever wanted for you.

472
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:42,543
You can't.

473
00:26:43,257 --> 00:26:44,290
Please.

474
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:45,351
You were right, Claire,

475
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:47,040
When you said it was all my fault.

476
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:48,071
Noah!

477
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:54,460
I never meant to hurt you.

478
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,322
It's done.

479
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,683
Go. get the virus.

480
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:50,081
I must stop you, Kensei.

481
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:03,990
He's going to keep at it, Peter,

482
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:05,860
Unless you do something about it.

483
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,261
Let Hiro go.

484
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:24,550
Go after Adam. he's using you, Peter.

485
00:28:24,556 --> 00:28:28,690
Let Hiro go. go after Adam.

486
00:28:29,537 --> 00:28:31,590
Let Hiro go. go after Adam. he's evil.

487
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,883
I don't think so.

488
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:36,981
He wants to destroy the whole world.

489
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:39,202
You're wrong. Adam wouldn't do that.

490
00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,913
He's going to release he virus.

491
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:42,780
He wants to destroy the virus.

492
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,670
Don't you understand?

493
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:51,281
You're on the wrong side!

494
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,111
What about me, Pete?

495
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:55,743
Nathan?

496
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:58,403
Am I on the wrong side too?

497
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:09,693
Kensei.

499
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:14,823
You were more than a friend to me.

500
00:29:15,597 --> 00:29:17,031
You were my inspiration.

501
00:29:17,778 --> 00:29:19,690
I was a rudderless drunk, and then you came along,

502
00:29:19,695 --> 00:29:21,110
You taught me to be a hero.

505
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,611
I went to the company. I saw Adam's history.

506
00:29:35,718 --> 00:29:37,371
Who he is and what he wanted.

507
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:38,610
Pete...

508
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:41,291
He tried to release the virus.

509
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:43,543
Do you wanna know how your burns got healed, Nathan?

510
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:46,951
He gave you his blood. I was there.

511
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:48,551
You should be grateful.

512
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:49,163
He used me.

513
00:29:49,165 --> 00:29:51,653
Wars, famine...

514
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:52,492
Disease.

515
00:29:52,496 --> 00:29:55,760
400 years later, nothing has changed.

516
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:58,041
When god wasn't happy with what he'd created,

517
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:00,282
He made it rain for 40 days and 40 nights.

518
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:02,011
He just washed it all away.

519
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:03,640
He had the right idea.

520
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,650
Because when this virus is released,

521
00:30:06,897 --> 00:30:09,791
Those of us who are left will be grand a second chance.

522
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:12,750
And I'll be their hero.

523
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:14,832
He used me to get to you.

524
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:16,501
Don't you see it?

525
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:19,481
He tried to manipulate you like that. Nathan, he--

526
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:21,472
Peter, that night at Kirby plaza when I carried you away,

527
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:22,852
It's because I believe in you.

528
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:24,792
You're my brother, Pete.

529
00:30:26,637 --> 00:30:27,760
I love you.

531
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:32,443
Really?

532
00:30:32,658 --> 00:30:34,903
I've lived for over 400 years.

533
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,292
Who's to say I'm not going to live 400 more?

537
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,411
Can you really trust Adam?

538
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,053
Is that it?

539
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:37,330
Where'd those guys go?

540
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:39,120
They're gone.

541
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:43,290
What is all this stuff?

542
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:48,522
I saw what this could do. I almost--

543
00:31:48,758 --> 00:31:50,590
Peter, you're not responsible

544
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:52,042
For something that might have happened.

545
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,243
You came here to destroy the virus.

546
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:55,481
Now, finish the job.

547
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:57,790
Step back.

548
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:25,271
What the hell's going on?

549
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:27,441
Your mother and my father--

550
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:28,543
God knows what else they've done.

551
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:30,711
How much longer are we gonna have to clean up their mess?

552
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:31,881
Matt, you're right.

553
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:34,013
You're right.

554
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,481
We've been used by these people,

555
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,733
Manipulated.

556
00:32:40,015 --> 00:32:43,111
But it's over. it stops here.

557
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:47,322
No more secrets.

558
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:48,910
So what do you wanna do?

559
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,252
We take this all public.

560
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,731
We expose them for what they are,

561
00:32:53,747 --> 00:32:55,981
What they've done, that they're the enemy.

562
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:57,623
I wanna have a press conference.

563
00:32:57,636 --> 00:32:59,090
Matt, I need your help.

564
00:33:00,006 --> 00:33:01,660
Make sure everybody listens to me.

565
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,612
That's it? just a simple injection?

566
00:33:31,606 --> 00:33:33,151
I'm sure maya will understand

567
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,792
If I'm notere when she wakes up.

568
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:35,911
Sylar!

569
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,571
Molly!

570
00:34:01,468 --> 00:34:02,760
The blood! oh, my god.

571
00:34:03,937 --> 00:34:05,033
Niki.

572
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,351
Mom, we're almost there.

573
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:24,591
Girl, what you doing?

574
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:25,641
Gimme that phone!

575
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:27,781
I didn't call nobody! I swear!

576
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:29,372
I swear I didn't call anybody!

577
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,022
Look at that, look at that.

578
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:36,230
Look what you did, huh?

579
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:37,163
No.

581
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:40,961
who you think's gonna rescue you?

582
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:43,091
No, don't leave me here!

583
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,890
No! no, don't leave me here, please!

584
00:34:47,926 --> 00:34:49,861
Please don't leave me here!

585
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:53,220
Stop.

586
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:56,442
It's right around here.

587
00:34:58,816 --> 00:34:59,901
The van!

588
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:01,731
That's the guy who took Monica!

589
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,410
Hold on.

590
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:20,860
You crazy bitch! what's wrong with you?

591
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:25,072
Where's Monica?

592
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:26,250
Go to hell.

593
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:28,980
Mom, the building!

594
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:30,121
She's in there!

595
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:33,910
Micah, stay in the carand call 911!

596
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:42,191
Monica! Monica!

597
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,923
I'm here!

598
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:44,123
I'm here! help me!

599
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:49,130
How'd you find me?

600
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:51,061
Micah. oh, I love that kid.

601
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:52,063
You okay?

602
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:57,873
Niki, look out!

603
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:03,372
When I lift that bea you pull the door open.

604
00:36:10,227 --> 00:36:12,440
Go! go, I'm right behind you.

605
00:36:25,198 --> 00:36:27,040
Monica! you're all right!

606
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:29,512
C'mon! c'monrun!

615
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:29,383
I thought...i was dead.

616
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:33,183
You very nearly were.

617
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:36,842
Sylar's gone.

618
00:37:40,776 --> 00:37:42,132
I doubt that very much.

619
00:37:42,578 --> 00:37:45,341
If you hadn't arrived, Sylar would have slaughtered us all.

620
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:47,230
We owe you our lives.

621
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:49,292
Really?

622
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:52,760
Cool.

623
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:01,322
Sure you're all right with this?

624
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:04,921
Yeah, I just keep thinking if I hadn't listened to Adam.

625
00:38:04,938 --> 00:38:06,300
If I hadn't listened to Linderman.

627
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:10,303
You tried to do the right thing.

628
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:12,553
You always do.

629
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:15,331
You trusted that people are as good as you are.

630
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:18,860
But if you see yourself as a monster, Pete,

631
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,550
This guilt is just gonna eat you up inside.

632
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:24,042
Believe me, I know.

633
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:27,911
What?

634
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:30,563
Just really missed you.

635
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:33,532
I missed you too.

636
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,423
Okay, I did it. they're ready for you.

637
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:41,941
They'll definitely hear what you have to say.

638
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:43,501
Good afternoon.

639
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:46,831
Most of you have no idea who I am.

640
00:38:47,638 --> 00:38:49,213
My name is Nathan Petrelli,

641
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,990
And I was elected to congress in the state of new york.

642
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:54,453
Seems like a long time ago.

643
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:57,553
I lost my position.

644
00:38:57,977 --> 00:38:59,262
I lost my brother.

645
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:01,833
I lost my family.

646
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:05,952
I'm sad to say that I lost my way.

647
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:09,162
But while I was gone, I had the chance

648
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:11,520
To see the world through newly-humbled eyes.

649
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:14,342
Witnessed amazing things.

650
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:16,970
I've seen ordinary people among us,

651
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,691
Trying the best each day

652
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:20,762
To be heroes.

653
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:25,692
These ordinary people... like you.

654
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:26,852
Like me.

655
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:30,652
Are capable of extraordinary things.

656
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,653
You have no idea...

657
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:35,712
How extraordinary.

658
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:41,383
But there are other people, organizations,

659
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:48,430
Who don't want you i, myself, kept secrets.

660
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:54,160
But last year...

661
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,071
Something incredible happened to me.

662
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,330
And it changed my life.

663
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:05,721
At first, I was afraid.

664
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:08,923
But I'm-- I'm not afraid anymore.

665
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,953
I'm here to tell you the truth.

666
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,093
I have the abil--

667
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,042
In Odessa, texas, where the former

668
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:54,981
New york congressman elect Nathan Petrelli

669
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:57,483
Was shot by an unknown assassin.

670
00:40:58,438 --> 00:40:59,280
Authorities--

671
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:01,172
I know.

672
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:02,481
It was unavoidable.

673
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:08,920
You do know that you've now opened pandora's box.

1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,550
Previously on Heroes

29
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,993
Adam wants to release this virus!

30
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:07,832
I must avenge my father's death

104
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:03,800
Chaper eleven "Powerless"

196
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:51,273
Believe this is mine, cop

498
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,093
You were my friend.

503
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:23,542
Only to have you become a villain.

504
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,721
I learned that from you.

530
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:31,023
You are not God.

534
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:42,151
I should have killed you. Long ago.

535
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:45,043
And I should kill you now.

536
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:47,032
For my father

607
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:34,661
Mom!

608
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:43,570
Hiro

609
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:45,450
Where have you been?

610
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:48,831
I went to face my father's killer.

611
00:36:50,246 --> 00:36:52,073
Well, did you find him?

612
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:55,031
Did you kill him?

613
00:36:57,556 --> 00:37:00,740
He can never hurt anyone ever again.

674
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:21,671
End of volume two

674
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:26,671
Volume three "Villains"

675
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:29,290
I am back
