4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,950
the sun rises on a new dawn. 

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,860
Yet few of us realize the debt we
owe to those responsiblefor this. 

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:26,690
To those who dwell among
us, anonymous, seemingly ordinary, 

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,870
whom destiny brought together to
repair, to heal, to save us from ourselves. 

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,180
If evolution can do this for
even the smallest of creatures, 

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,860
then why not these human beings? 

10
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:41,710
If someone here. . . 

11
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:44,023
found out about me, what would happen? 

12
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:45,516
When will they stop? 

13
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:46,917
I don't know. 

14
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:51,443
she's a shiny new
toy, and she's all mine. 

15
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:57,490
and they're still out there, among
us, in the shadows, in the light. 

16
00:00:57,548 --> 00:01:03,421
We pass them on the street without a
glance, never suspecting, never knowing. 

17
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,480
Do they even know yet? 

18
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:15,261
That they are bound together by a common
purpose, a glaring reality, to be extraordinary? 

19
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:19,302
Teleportation, tissue generation;
these are no longer simply theories. 

20
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:21,970
I have seen them with my own eyes. 

21
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:24,102
And when destiny does anoint them. . . 

22
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:25,603
my name is hiro nakamura. 

23
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:27,183
I'm from the future. 

24
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:29,081
How do they hide from it? 

25
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:33,990
You may feel confined here, but this is far
freer a cage than the one they'd put you in. 

26
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:37,703
how long can they dwell in
the shadows before either fate

27
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:43,530
or their own flawed humanity draws
them out into the light again? 

28
00:01:43,576 --> 00:01:48,402
And how will they know what
awaits them when it finally does?

{\a6}MOHINDER SURESH CAIRO, EGYPT

32
00:01:55,686 --> 00:02:01,472
A virus which strips them of their
powers and leads to their eventual death. 

33
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:04,932
In the last few months, I have
discoveredwhat I believe to be a plague. 

34
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:08,482
A plague which targetsonly
these unique individuals. 

35
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:10,982
It's a disease which threatens
to eradicate them all. 

36
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:15,680
And in doing so, deprives our species
of its evolutionary advancement. 

37
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:18,952
Without this advancement, the
challenges of the modern world:

38
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:22,510
Global warming, terrorism, diminishing
resources, 

39
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:27,082
seem almost insurmountable
on our thin shoulders. 

40
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,242
The fate of humanity
itself hangs in the balance. 

41
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:34,823
But with proper funding and research, we
can stop the advancement of this disease. 

42
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:38,632
I urge each and every one of you to
take up this cause, spread the word, 

43
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:41,870
and fight those who would
keep the world from the truth. 

44
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:44,543
Thank you all for coming. 

45
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:53,342
Inspirational lecture, dr. Suresh. 

46
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:56,141
I was wondering if I could
trouble you for an autograph. 

47
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,581
Your father would've been so proud. 

48
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,131
So would your sister. 

49
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:04,753
Who the hell are you and
why are you following me? 

50
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:05,673
This isn't necessary. 

51
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:06,272
I'm nobody. 

52
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:07,411
What, you think I didn't recognize you? 

53
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:09,041
- You've been at three of my lectures. 
- Yeah. 

54
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:10,950
The company sent you to bag and tag me? 

55
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:11,763
Is that it? 

56
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:13,502
A year ago, I would've
run, but not anymore! 

57
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,660
Well, that's good, because if you had, I
wouldn't be able to offer you a job. 

58
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:22,902
I've been down that road before. 

59
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:24,813
It doesn't end well. 

60
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:27,142
Where will you go, dr. Suresh? 

61
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:30,213
No one even believes they exist. 

62
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:37,291
I found your father's book in the parapsychology
section in-between hypnosis and alien abductions. 

63
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:39,291
They don't take you seriously. 

64
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,820
They all think you're nuts. 

65
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:44,702
But not me. 

66
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:48,781
So if you're really
interested in saving the world, 

67
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:52,023
the least you can do is
let me buy you a drink.

FOR NOW

72
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:46,071
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING

00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:49,210
WE'VE BEEN RUNNING

74
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:50,670
I CAN'T RUN ANYMORE

WE HAVE NO CHOICE

76
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,711
WHAT IF WE DON'T MAKE IT? 

77
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:57,671
IF WE GET CAUGHT, PEOPLE COULD DIE

78
00:04:57,768 --> 00:05:00,150

COSTA VERDE, CALIFORNIA

85
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:45,070
All the electives I wanted
filled up last semester. 

86
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:46,040
Come on. It's your first day. 

87
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,382
You should be excited. 

88
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:48,450
I am. 

89
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,633
Well, it's easy for you to say. 

90
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:53,192
You're not wading into the
shark-infested waters of 11th grade. 

91
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:56,820
I don't have one friend. 

92
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:57,953
I am shark bait. 

93
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:59,921
Oh, you're gonna do fine. 

94
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:02,992
They don't look any different
from the kids in texas. 

95
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,113
Okay, except for her. 

96
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,441
So maybe they're a little bit more. . . 

97
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:12,213
sophisticated here, but
you're gonna fit right in. 

98
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,872
If you say so. 

99
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,652
Just remember what we talked about. 

100
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:16,622
I know. 

101
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm claire butler. 

102
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:19,313
I won't slip up. 

103
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:20,361
It's not just the name. 

104
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:21,673
It's everything. 

105
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:22,230
Trust me. 

106
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,713
The company is still out there. 

107
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:27,010
And they will find us unless
we're flawless with our plan. 

108
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:28,363
From now on. . . 

109
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:33,043
you have to be entirely
un-extraordinary. 

110
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:36,813
Right. 

111
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:38,222
Don't stand out in any way. 

112
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:38,851
Exactly. 

113
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,020
Don't raise your hand in class. 

114
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:44,100
And don't even think about
trying out for cheerleading. 

115
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:44,980
Oh, come on, dad. 

116
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:46,313
That's all behind me. 

117
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,092
Just blend in. 

118
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,600
Be ordinary, right? 

119
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:50,893
You got it. 

120
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,882
You know, we might want to start
by you not driving me to school. 

121
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:57,001
It kind of draws attention to me. 

122
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,011
And, you know. . . 

123
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:06,030
don't you think it might
be easier on all of us if. . . 

124
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:08,142
I had my own car? 

125
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:12,700
Your mother and i were going to
surprise you on your birthday next month. 

126
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:14,781
BuT. . . 

127
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,383
oh, my gosh. The rogue? 

128
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,872
Thank you, daddy! 

129
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:20,561
It's yours. 

130
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:21,670
You're the best dad in the world. 

131
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:22,932
I know. 

132
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,571
I know. 

133
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:26,340
Claire. 

134
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:29,491
It's just. . . 

135
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:36,091
I just can't help thinking about how many times
I've said good-bye to you on the first day of school. 

136
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:41,020
I'm so sorry for everything
I've put you through. 

137
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,253
Hope you know how much I love you. 

138
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:07,602
Sorry. 

139
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,032

143
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,840
THE PAST IN'T A VERY SAFE PLACE

144
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:02,623

I MUST SAVE YOU

149
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:30,751
I'm asking one more time. 

150
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,901
Come out with your hands up. 

151
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:39,310
Look, I know this sucks, nypd
showing up at your door like this. 

152
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:39,940
I get it. 

153
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:43,401
But this is what happens when
you take somebody hostage. 

154
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,723
I just need to make sure everybody
gets out of there safely, okay? 

155
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:09,773
Both of you, hands up. 

156
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:13,041
- No, I'm the hostage! Shoot her. 
- PUT YOUR HANDS UP

157
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:18,383
- I'm the hostage. Shoot her! 
- I'm the hostage! No, shoot him! 

158
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:19,311
Shoot her. 

159
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:20,581
Shoot her! 

160
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,210
Shoot her! 

161
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:23,283
Dude, it's her. 

162
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,471
Shoot her. Shoot her. 

163
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,071
How did you know? 

164
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:34,772
okay, guys. Good job. 

165
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:36,252
Let's clean this place up. 

166
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:38,040
All guns to the armory. 

167
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:42,012
How did you know which one to shoot? 

168
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:43,631
I don't know. 

169
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:45,291
Tone of voice. Eye contact. 

170
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:46,201
The hostage looked me in the eye. 

171
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:48,231
The other was looking for an exit. 

172
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:51,001
Well, most people notice a
gun under the bad guy's shirt. 

173
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:51,713
Right. 

174
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,592
Yeah, that too. Of course. 

175
00:11:55,287 --> 00:12:02,653
You know, guys who get shot like you did, they
just take that worker's comp and call it a day. 

176
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:06,432
I've been, uh, I've wanted
to be a cop my whole life. 

177
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,811
Four bullets to the chest
aren't gonna change that. 

178
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:11,840
Well, we were gonna drag
this out, make you sweat. 

179
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:14,082
But I figured, what's the point? 

180
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:15,811
Take that off. 

181
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:26,040
I figured that, uh, you'd
rather have a real one. 

182
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:31,542
- Well, you gonna take it? 
- Yeah. Yeah. 

183
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:33,060
Thank you. 

184
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:34,242
Wow, thank you so much. 

185
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:38,273
turn on your bunsen
burners, people, and be careful. 

186
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,331
you got a death wish? 

187
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,392
Uh, you talking about that? 

188
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:04,030
I was just seeing how hot it was. 

189
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:06,450
Pretty sure it's hot. 

190
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,753
- It's called a "flame. "
- Yeah. 

191
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:11,153
I was just kidding around. 

192
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,682
Like you were this morning when
you stepped in front of my car? 

193
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,902
That's okay. 

194
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:19,940
Made my morning interesting. 

195
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,963
I'm west. 

196
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,532
Claire. 

197
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:25,541
You're new, right? 

198
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:26,731
Yeah. 

199
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:28,940
So what are you? 

200
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,573
Meaning what, exactly? 

201
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:35,262
Meaning are you oneof them. . . 

202
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:37,633
or one of the others? 

203
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:40,820
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at. 

204
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:42,192
Well, let me break it down for you. 

205
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:46,330
Are you a robot or an alien? 

206
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:48,022
'Cause everyone in the
world is one or the other. 

207
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,041
Robots do what they're told. 

208
00:13:50,077 --> 00:13:50,993
Stick with the herd. 

209
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:54,731
Aliens, on the other
hand, do their own thing. 

210
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,762
Well, uh, I don't know. 

211
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,752
Do I have to choose? 

212
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:00,812
Most people do. 

213
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:03,041
So what are you? 

214
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:04,942
okay, everyone. 

215
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:14,460
In the struggle for survival, it is the fittest
who win out at the expense of their rivals. 

216
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:17,742
Now who said this? 

217
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,173
Come on, people. 

218
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,732
Journey of the beagle. 

219
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:25,693
Evolution. 

220
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,071
Anyone? 

221
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:31,882
Charles darwin. 

222
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:33,890
It's charles darwin. 

223
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:35,523
Easy one. 

224
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,811
Looks like my lucky day

225
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,272
How much? 

226
00:14:58,116 --> 00:14:59,621
Ten thousand Lempiras. . . 

227
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,630
I'll take you as far as Sonora. 

228
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:06,033
That's six hundred miles
from the American border. 

229
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:11,161
Okey. 

230
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,681
You two married? 

231
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:18,520
She's my sister

232
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,253
Even better

233
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:24,651
You can ride with me up front

234
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:27,193
In your dreams

235
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:31,932
Ride with me or you don't ride at all

236
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:33,932
She stays with me

237
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:35,593
We'll ride in back

238
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,440
You are late. 

239
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:01,811
No, I believe I'm right on time. 

240
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:04,021
I believe that your watch is slow. 

241
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:06,032
- Guess what? 
- What? 

242
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:08,001
Max grossman tried to kiss me today. 

243
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:10,031
- What? 
- Mr. Parkman? 

244
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:10,833
Yeah. 

245
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:12,661
Can I speak to you for a minute? 

246
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,011
Uh, sure. Can you give us a second? 

247
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:16,370
Sure. 

248
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:21,402
Is everything okay? 

249
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:24,030
Yeah, I'm just a little
concerned, that's all. 

250
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:26,753
Molly's been falling asleep
in class the last week or so. 

251
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:30,223
And when I asked her about it, she
said she's been having some nightmares. 

252
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,623
Um, she's got kind of a big imagination. 

253
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:36,480
And I realize that there's really
nothing I can do about them, 

254
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,950
so I'm just trying to make
her feel as safe as possible. 

255
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:42,692
About that, I know it's
not exactly my place, 

256
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:46,272
but your situation
isn't the most stable. 

257
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:48,193
My situation? 

258
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,350
Your injurieS. Your divorce. 

259
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:53,093
Look, uh, my divorce is my business. 

260
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:58,932
And all you really need to know is that molly is
loved and well-cared for and she's doing great. 

261
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:00,810
She's struggling, Mr. Parkman. 

262
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:03,480
Why? Because she's
having a few nightmares? 

263
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:05,130
Because of these. 

264
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,550
She started drawing
them a week or so ago. 

265
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,610
Every day, they get a little worse. 

266
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,072
Oh, my god. 

267
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:21,273
And I have to ask you, what is this? 

268
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:24,200
It's in every single picture. 

269
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:32,200
KAITO NAKAMURA ADDO MANHATTAN

270
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:40,973
Excuse me. 

271
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:45,403
Sir, with no disrespect to you or Hiro. . . 

272
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,240
it's been almost four months. . . 

273
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:49,702
and there's been no sign of him

274
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,483
Maybe he's not coming back

275
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,582
For close to thirty years. . . 

276
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:56,613
I have seen my son as a disappiontment

277
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:59,801
A dreamer who excelled at nothing

278
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:03,023
It was not until Hiro
began this quest. . . 

279
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:08,310
that i saw his
strength. courage and wisdom

280
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,720
There is legacy. . . 

281
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:15,292
that i am meant to hand down to him

282
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:19,480
No. . . i will wait for Hiro to return

283
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:23,893
I am a man of patience

284
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,102
This can't be

285
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:45,593
Where did you get this newspaper? 

286
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,763
From your office

287
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,632
Sir what is it? 

288
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:55,652
What does it mean? 

289
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:00,572
In twenty-four hours. . . 

290
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,820
I'll be dead

291
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:18,142
NATHAN ANGEKA PETRELLI
PETERS APT. NEW YORK

292
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,090
What are you doing here, ma? 

293
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:23,091
It's time to move on, nathan, he's dead. 

294
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:24,660
You don't know that. 

295
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:25,691
Leave his stuff alone. 

296
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,900
He's gonna want it when he gets back. 

297
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:34,860
You're drunk. 

298
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:39,812
Thank god your father
isn't here to see you. 

299
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,842
Or you, for that matter. 

300
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:46,940
You killed your brother. Drove
heidi away. Drove your kids away. 

301
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:48,292
If you'd
followedour plan--

302
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:52,061
if you'd done what you were
supposed to do, he would be alive now. 

303
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:54,751
To think I almost listened to you. 

304
00:19:57,547 --> 00:19:59,752
You're evil, ma. 

305
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:05,353
Get out. 

306
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:44,380
I did it

307
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,663
What happened? 

308
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,252
How did we get here? 

309
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:54,362
I brought you here

310
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:57,482
They were about to put holes in you

311
00:20:57,498 --> 00:21:00,212
Fifty ryo is not worth dying for

312
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:01,911
You can tell Takezo Kensei. . . 

313
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,011
he can keep his damn money

314
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,652
But if you're not Takezo Kensei. . . 

315
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:09,911
Then who is. . . 

316
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,141
What did you do? 

317
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:16,072
You made him run away! 

318
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,003
What did you do? 

319
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:22,163
What did you make them scatter? 

320
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:29,280
If i put an arrow through
that leader's heart

321
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:31,363
I would've been a very rich man

322
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,720
Takezo Kensei? 

323
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,222
What are you? 

324
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:37,611
Some sort of monk? 

325
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:39,482
You dress so strangely for a monk

326
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,612
And you wear glasses like a doctor

327
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:43,710
I'm not a monk

328
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:46,540
I'm your biggest fan

329
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:50,092
I know all about you. Takezo Kensei

330
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:51,910
I know all stories about you

331
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:55,123
I stole your sword

332
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:08,622
You are the hero Kensei? 

333
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:11,403
My name here is Kensei

334
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,392
But no one's ever
called me a hero before

335
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:21,180
can you excuse me? 

336
00:22:21,197 --> 00:22:22,551
You were late. 

337
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,223
It's my daughter's
first day of high school. 

338
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:25,843
Had to make sureshe was okay. 

339
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:28,020
COPY KINGDOM COSTA VERDE, CALIFORNIA
And that's, uh, somehow my problem? 

340
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:29,923
That shipment of toner
cartridges came in last night. 

341
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:31,291
I know. I was here. 

342
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:34,372
And when exactly were they
going to get installed? 

343
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:36,802
'Cause I don't see
anybody else here doing it. 

344
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:40,112
I'm gonna do it this morning. 

345
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,980
And if I wasn't here
watching your every move? 

346
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:47,351
You know, you've been here
for a few months, butler. 

347
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:50,611
I think it's time I saw some
commitment to excellence from you. 

348
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:52,452
When I was assistant manager, 

349
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:55,803
we were fully set before the first
customer walked through that door. 

350
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:59,023
That is how I got this. 

351
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:03,593
Paper business is dog eat dog. 

352
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,283
You gotta live it and
breathe it. You gotta want it. 

353
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:08,882
Do you want it, butler? 

354
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:11,533
Do you? 

355
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:15,211
Yes, sir. 

356
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:17,623
Yeah. 

357
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:21,700
Well, we'll see. 

358
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:26,593
The company was formed 30 years ago
with a group of like-minded individuals, 

359
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:31,582
ordinary men and women who were
gifted with extraordinary powers. 

360
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:34,363
They wanted to help their own. 

361
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:37,763
To find them and to protect them. 

362
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:42,681
We find people, and we make sure
they don't become dangerous. 

363
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:48,550
Now sometimes that can mean making sure they
understand entirely what they're capable of. 

364
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:52,733
And teaching them to use their
abilities for the good of mankind. 

365
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:57,513
And sometimes it can
mean eliminating them. 

366
00:23:57,876 --> 00:24:00,530
Who the hell are you to
judge who lives and who dies? 

367
00:24:00,547 --> 00:24:06,221
If I'm not mistaken, you yourself tried to put
a bullet in the brain of a man named sylar. 

368
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,530
He was a monster. 

369
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:08,763
Yes. 

370
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:12,192
And you were willing to kill
him for the greater good. 

371
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:17,440
You acted on a moral imperative
to protect your specieS. 

372
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,473
It doesn't matter one way
or the other about sylar. 

373
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:21,481
He's no longer a threat. He's dead. 

374
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:24,533
And now you have molly. 

375
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:29,722
You and matt parkman
are protecting her. 

376
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:33,542
Now we're not interfering with
that arrangement. Far from it. 

377
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,802
We're offering to help you. 

378
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:40,110
We have resources to
offer you, dr. Suresh. 

379
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,222
The plague. 

380
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:44,231
You talked about the disease
which killed your sister, shanti. 

381
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:46,311
- The virus. 
- Yes. 

382
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:50,603
We have the funds you
need for your research. 

383
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:55,772
Now, can you imagine what would happen

384
00:24:56,486 --> 00:25:01,750
if that virus mutated and crossed
over into the general population? 

385
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:07,272
Look, the type of research you're
talking about is extremely expensive. 

386
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:08,643
Trust me. 

387
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:10,743
That won't be a problem. 

388
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:20,172
Let's just say we have
our own private fort knox. 

389
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:27,202
So can we count you in? 

390
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:33,341
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome. 

391
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,393
SURESH'S APARTMENT BROOKLYM Dinner! 

392
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:40,392
Uh, shouldn't I be eating some
vegetables every once in awhile? 

393
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:43,783
Well, that is why I got you a
vegetable pizza, smarty-pants. 

394
00:25:43,795 --> 00:25:45,910
Plus I got your favorite
rocky road for desert. 

395
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,821
You're just trying to bribe
me 'cause you never cook. 

396
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:50,593
I miss mohinder. 

397
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:51,290
He cooks. 

398
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:52,641
Hey, I can cook. 

399
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:55,993
I just thought why not order
pizza? Give us time to talk. 

400
00:25:57,998 --> 00:26:00,253
Talk about what? This? 

401
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:02,483
Does that mean you passed
your detective's exam? 

402
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:04,813
With flying colors. Why? You proud of me? 

403
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:07,333
Mm, depends. Did you cheat? 

404
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:10,361
Why would you ask me that? 

405
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:13,852
Reading the answers out of
people's minds, it's unfair. 

406
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:16,491
No, it is my natural talent. 

407
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,391
You wouldn't think a baseball player's
cheating 'cause he's athletic, would you? 

408
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:22,581
- It's not the same and you know it. 
- No. 

409
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:27,953
You know what, I want to talk to you about
these drawings that you made at school. 

410
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,873
You're changing the subject. 

411
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:32,353
Ms. Gerber's concerned and so am I. 

412
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:36,081
You don't want to talk about your exams, I
don't want to talk about my dreams. 

413
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,960
Molly. I want to help you. 

414
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:39,641
I don't want
you to be--

415
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:42,851
I said I didn't want to talk about it! 

416
00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:51,350
Can I finish my dinner in my room? 

417
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:57,103
Sure. Go ahead. 

418
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,182
This book is incredible, Alejandro

419
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:15,131
This man has figured it all out

420
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:15,970
Yes. . . 

421
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:18,972
if he knows the
cause. there has to be a cure

422
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:23,392
Yes, it's just that, God would
not have done this to me

423
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,450
without a chance for salvation

424
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:30,793
Maya. it's not you fault

425
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:33,120
You have to believe that

426
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,960
You keep saying that. . . 

427
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:39,320
but you words don't make
it any easier, Alejandro

428
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:41,260
Especially when i know what can happan

429
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,723
Noting will happan

430
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,362
Not when i'm with you. I
won't let it happen

431
00:27:53,577 --> 00:27:55,293
Why did we stop? 

432
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:00,761
You guys

433
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,223
Come with me

434
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:06,552
Just stay here

435
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,200
What's the problem? 

436
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:15,981
Our financial arrangement. . . 

437
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:18,300
Did i say ten thousand Lempiras? 

438
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:20,711
What i meant to say was. . . 

439
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:22,072
ten thousand. . . 

440
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:24,062
for each of you

441
00:28:24,575 --> 00:28:25,321
No. . . 

442
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:27,270
I remember it was for both of us

443
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:28,551
Pardon me

444
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:29,913
I made a mistake

445
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,542
What i meant was. . . 

446
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:33,851
that you ride in the back. . . 

447
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:37,581
and your sister rides up front with me

448
00:28:37,597 --> 00:28:39,913
I told you she stays with me

449
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:42,532
That's it. . . 

450
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:45,411
the deal, take it or leave it

451
00:28:47,218 --> 00:28:49,050
You son of bitch

452
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:56,710
No! You don't understand. . . 

453
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:58,373
for God's sake! 

454
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:01,040
You're making a mistake

455
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,473
Alejandro! 

456
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:05,741
Alejandro! 

457
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:08,320
Alejandro! 

458
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,510
Maya! 

459
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:16,041
Maya! 

460
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:32,393
Claire! 

461
00:29:40,775 --> 00:29:42,323
Nice move, ballerina. 

462
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:44,892
How's that floor taste? 

463
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:47,330
Are you okay? 

464
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:52,812
Don't listen to them. I'm going
to go find the birdie thing. 

465
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:02,451
Thank you. 

466
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,710
No problem. 

467
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,473
Robot. 

468
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:07,230
So I'm a robot now, huh? 

469
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:08,240
Far as I can tell. 

470
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:11,651
Okay. 

471
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:12,880
Birdie, please. 

472
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:18,461
You don't even know me. 

473
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:22,012
You had the answer today in class, 
but you didn't say it. 

474
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,723
You don't want people to
know that you are smart. 

475
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:27,191
You just have me all figured out, huh? 

476
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:30,353
Know a robot when I see one. 

477
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:35,252
Come on, martha. 

478
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,420
It's just a back flip off the tower. 

479
00:30:37,908 --> 00:30:39,613
And you know the girls will catch you. 

480
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:44,021
Just leave her alone, okay? 

481
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:45,402
Okay, one--

482
00:30:45,415 --> 00:30:46,523
don't know you. 

483
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:49,013
And two--as captainof the cheerleading squad, 

484
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:52,352
it's totally within my rights
to recruit talent where I see it. 

485
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:56,581
I think martha here has what
it takes to be a cheerleader. 

486
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:01,783
So you can do a back tuck off the tower? 

487
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,063
What's the big deal? 

488
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:06,931
If it's so easy, why don't you try it? 

489
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:10,510
In fact, if you can do a back tuck off the tower, 

490
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:12,531
martha here is off the hook. 

491
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:20,142
All right. 

492
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,453
I'll do it. 

493
00:31:22,495 --> 00:31:23,800
This should be good. 

494
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:56,430
We're waiting. 

495
00:32:04,905 --> 00:32:06,043
You're right. 

496
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:08,153
Can't do it. 

497
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,891
There's a shocker. 

498
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:37,683
help! 

499
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:40,472
Help me! 

500
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:45,591
Don't hurt me. 

501
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:46,990
No! 

502
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:52,910
noooo! 

503
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,553
I can see you. 

504
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:01,621
It's okay. 

505
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:03,670
It's all right. It was just a dream. 

506
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:05,393
It was just a dream. 

507
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:06,913
Oh, my gosh, he can see me. 

508
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:08,700
Did you see him? 

509
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:10,433
See what he look like? 

510
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:13,710
Okay, you tell mewhere he is
and I will take care of him. 

511
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,750
No. 

512
00:33:14,765 --> 00:33:16,220
He's too dangerous. 

513
00:33:17,106 --> 00:33:20,841
If I tell you where he is, he'll kill you too. 

514
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:22,661
No. No, no, no. 

515
00:33:22,677 --> 00:33:24,481
Nobody's going to kill anyone. 

516
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:26,132
I promise. 

517
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:30,261
I promise. I'm right here. 

518
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:33,350
Don't go, please. 

519
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,011
Why are you still here? 

520
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:22,643
U're still on your break. 

521
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:26,390
Yes, I am. 

522
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:28,660
You were supposed to be back
on the floor five minutes ago. 

523
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,913
There's a line of customers out there. 

524
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:41,931
Just finishing my coffee. 

525
00:34:42,308 --> 00:34:44,172
Uh, no, you're finished. 

526
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:45,220
Get out there. 

527
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,673
Just a few more sips, that's all. 

528
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:50,060
You look at me when I talk to you. 

529
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:52,683
Do you hear me? 

530
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:54,680
I hear you all right. 

531
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:58,302
Now you hear me. 

532
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:01,672
I am done eating your crap. 

533
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:05,970
From now on, I will work how
and when I feel like it. 

534
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:07,912
I will take breaks when I want to. 

535
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:12,101
And you will not say a
damn word to me ever again. 

536
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:13,891
Do you understand? 

537
00:35:19,956 --> 00:35:21,402
Square on that? 

538
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:23,670
Yeah. 

539
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,300
i don't undstand

540
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,561
Takezo kensei the legendary samurai master. . . 

541
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:33,711
my father raead me stales of. . 

542
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:35,873
is a gajin? 

543
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:38,573
i have to pee

544
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:47,501
are you sure u'r takezo kensei? 

545
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:53,222
Good. . . . 

546
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:56,542
Men. . . 

547
00:35:56,826 --> 00:35:59,710
i. . . 

548
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:01,290
You are english? 

549
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:06,143
Oh, and there's a surprise. 

550
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:09,811
You know, there's very few locals here
with whom I can speak plain. 

551
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,270
Thank god for you, young man. 

552
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:14,420
- Eh, sorry. 
- Yuck! 

553
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,400
So I came over on one of the few
trade vessels your emperor let pass. 

554
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:22,912
The boat left full of tea, 
I kept on to find my fortune. 

555
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:26,053
You should see what I got
paid to fend off those bandits. 

556
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:28,461
Kensei takezo does not fight for money. 

557
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,672
He fights for honor. 

558
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,690
Really? 

559
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:32,823
Well, as long as it's honor I can spend. 

560
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,323
It's not a bad lot. 

561
00:36:34,337 --> 00:36:37,812
I mean, I find a stout brute, put
him on a horse, put him in a field, 

562
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,322
and tell him to shout on about
how he's fearsome old kensei. 

563
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:44,081
Then I repair to the branch of a tree and
start to pick off the black guards one by one. 

564
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:45,563
That's fighting dirty! 

565
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,851
That's fighting smart, sir. 

566
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:50,400
What? I give him a fair wage. 

567
00:36:51,157 --> 00:36:52,353
If he lives. 

568
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:57,012
No. 

569
00:36:57,027 --> 00:36:58,431
This can't be. 

570
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:01,483
No. I come from the future. 

571
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:03,663
Many years from now. 

572
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:06,501
Your noble deeds become part of our history. 

573
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,920
- The future? 
- Yes. 

574
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:08,962
That's a good one. 

575
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:10,330
No, it is true. 

576
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:11,910
I know what happens to you. 

577
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:16,721
As a boy I read the book
the trials of takezo kensei. 

578
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:19,151
How you killed the black bear of sakashita, 

579
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:22,451
your love of the swordsmith's daughter, 

580
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:28,080
and you defeat the terrible white bearded
warlord and save the village of otsu. 

581
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:30,980
- Otsu? 
- You smell smoke? 

582
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:42,860
what village is that? 

583
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:45,263
that would be otsu

584
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,241
sir. . . 

585
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:56,493
i am. . 

586
00:37:57,217 --> 00:37:59,013
this. . 

587
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,322
who. . . 

588
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:03,003
i. . . 

589
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:05,490
could. . . 

590
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,290
them? 

591
00:38:08,975 --> 00:38:10,501
all. . 

592
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:12,992
are. . 

593
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:21,252
you. . . 

594
00:38:21,905 --> 00:38:24,202
i. . 

595
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:27,812
it's. . . 

596
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:30,841
i cannot

597
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,021
i. . . 

598
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:37,450
it. . . 

599
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:40,791
very well

600
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:44,683
if we. . 

601
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:46,792
can. . 

602
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:49,150
i'll. . 

603
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:54,861
it's ok

604
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:10,852
Let me see it. 

605
00:39:15,935 --> 00:39:18,531
I do not take death threats idly. 

606
00:39:18,546 --> 00:39:20,202
Someone's playing a trick. 

607
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,592
Are they? 

608
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:23,641
Charles deveauX. 

609
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,443
Linderman. 

610
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:26,852
Your husband. 

611
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:28,690
All of them. 

612
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:30,460
Dead. 

613
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:35,562
Now there are nine. 

614
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,681
So you think one of us sent these? 

615
00:39:39,265 --> 00:39:40,193
Yes. 

616
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:42,703
For the pain we cause. 

617
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,591
The people we have killed. 

618
00:39:46,077 --> 00:39:48,691
There is no end to our suffering. 

619
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:57,532
I sought redemption by helping
hirofulfill his destiny to save the world. 

620
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:02,040
How did you help your son? 

621
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:07,573
Angela. 

622
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:10,903
I am leaving for japan tonight. 

623
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:15,052
I suggest you disappear as well. 

624
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:27,240
What happened here? 

625
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:31,263
Bandits. They took everything. 

626
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:35,400
Is there no God to protect us? 

627
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:41,282
Oh, no. I broke history. 

628
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:42,462
Villages burn. 

629
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:44,812
Those things happen. 

630
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:46,373
But not like this! 

631
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:49,753
The future may not exist as I know it. 

632
00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:53,292
No future. No cars. No ando. No me. 

633
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:55,230
Great scott. 

634
00:40:55,237 --> 00:40:59,882
You mustn't fret everything, my
very strange little friend. 

635
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:03,140
Here, have some sake. 
It'll brighten your day. 

636
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:04,552
No, forget sake! 

637
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:06,833
You're supposed to be a hero. 

638
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:10,841
Being a hero never filled anyone's
sack with salt and saffron. 

639
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:12,820
It's a waste of time, huh? 

640
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:19,581
In the stories, you are rewarded
with more gold than the emperor. 

641
00:41:20,165 --> 00:41:25,621
And you took the swordsmith's daughter, the most
beautiful woman in all japan for your princess. 

642
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:32,623
We gave you everything
we had to defend us. 

643
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:34,280
Now our homes are burned. 

644
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:36,750
Those bandits took my father hostage. 

645
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:39,173
And you sit here drinking? 

646
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:42,623
No need for everyone's day to be ruined. 

647
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:45,291
You swore to challenge them in battle. 

648
00:41:45,298 --> 00:41:47,043
I did, Yaeko. 

649
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:48,991
But this man got in the way. 

650
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:55,713
- My sword! 
- My sword! 

651
00:41:57,338 --> 00:41:58,570
It's my father's sword. 

652
00:41:58,898 --> 00:41:59,922
He forged it. 

653
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,882
He gave it to you as
payment for your protection. 

654
00:42:05,548 --> 00:42:07,131
She's the swordsmith's daughter? 

655
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,303
And I don't think she
wants to be my princess. 

656
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:11,690
Wait! 

657
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:13,523
Swordsmith's daughter! 

658
00:42:13,528 --> 00:42:14,593
Where are you going? 

659
00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:16,500
Someone must rescue my father. 

660
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:18,832
If Kensei will not. . . 

661
00:42:19,095 --> 00:42:20,751
I will! 

662
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:27,953
Wait! Don't leave! 

663
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:29,830
- No? 
- No. 

664
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:33,960
You have to rescue the swordsmith and
make the daughter fall in love with you. 

665
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:38,471
You have to become the legendary
japanese hero that you are destined to be. 

666
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,493
You have to fight black bear. 
You have to fight the 11--

667
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:49,860
The only thing I have
to do is find me a drink. 

668
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:52,093
Come on. 

669
00:42:58,198 --> 00:43:00,791
This is going to be tough. 

670
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:31,033
86 straight days of sunshine. 
You just can't beat that. 

671
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:34,562
Right, lyle? 

672
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:37,143
I don't know. I guess. 

673
00:43:41,657 --> 00:43:42,770
So, claire, 

674
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:46,531
lyle was saying that his first
day of school was uneventful. 

675
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,911
How about you? Anything special happen? 

676
00:43:55,627 --> 00:43:56,523
No. 

677
00:43:57,627 --> 00:44:00,871
No, nothing. I, uh, skated by unnoticed. 

678
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:03,662
It was like I wasn't even there. 

679
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:06,693
That's good, honey. 

680
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:11,140
And how about you, sweetheart? 

681
00:44:14,475 --> 00:44:15,521
Me? 

682
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:20,163
Anything interesting happen
today at copy kingdom? 

683
00:44:24,526 --> 00:44:28,990
I, uh, I made a calendar
for some grandparents. 

684
00:44:28,997 --> 00:44:31,253
And a coworker brought in donuts. 

685
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:35,570
That's great. 

686
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:40,640
I just think it's amazing how well we
have all adjusted to our new lives her

687
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:43,370
it's inspirational, really. 

688
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,781
The bennets were given
lemons and what did we make? 

689
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:53,463
- Uh, lemonade? 
- Exactly. 

690
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:55,483
I'll second that. 

691
00:44:55,786 --> 00:45:00,231
We're all flourishing
really, all except Mr. Muggles. 

692
00:45:00,786 --> 00:45:06,040
No one has any idea you won two regional
championships, five all-breed rallies. 

693
00:45:06,846 --> 00:45:07,660
Poor little guy. 

694
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:12,732
I mean, how do you go back to the
farm after you have seen gay paris? 

695
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:15,813
N'est-ce pas? Mais oui. 

696
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:18,502
Thank you. 

697
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:25,232
Must be work. 

698
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:27,793
'Scuse me. 

699
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:31,352
'Scuse me. 

700
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:37,232
Well? 

701
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:39,092
they finally took the bait. 

702
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:41,753
They caught up with me in cairo. 

703
00:45:43,555 --> 00:45:45,461
- I'm in. 
- Good. 

704
00:45:46,507 --> 00:45:48,861
It's all falling into place. Just. . . 

705
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:51,950
just stay careful. Watch your back. 

706
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:56,051
And you and I will bring
this whole company down. 

707
00:46:28,548 --> 00:46:29,442
No. 

708
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:44,990
Maya. 

709
00:46:48,636 --> 00:46:50,722
What did i do. . . what did I do? 

710
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:53,561
I didn't want to do it. 

711
00:46:54,936 --> 00:46:55,751
I know you didn't. 

712
00:46:55,756 --> 00:46:56,871
Don't worry. 

713
00:46:57,608 --> 00:46:58,862
My God. . . 

714
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:01,423
My God, what have I done? 

715
00:47:02,857 --> 00:47:03,661
Maya. . . 

716
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:05,822
We have to go. 

717
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:09,741
We have to get to the United States. . . 

718
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:12,562
to New York. 

719
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:14,912
That doctor is the only
one that can help you. 

720
00:47:16,006 --> 00:47:16,720
Come. . . 

721
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:18,893
Maya, listen to me. 

722
00:47:20,106 --> 00:47:21,621
Give me your hand, let's go. 

723
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:24,123
And the others? 

724
00:47:24,957 --> 00:47:26,351
We'll go to where it's safe. . . 

725
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:28,482
and that's where we'll bury
them. Let's go, let's go. 

726
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:44,332
Why are you calling me? 

727
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:46,910
I don't know. I'm not sure. 

728
00:47:47,676 --> 00:47:49,340
Well, don't do it again. 

729
00:47:51,106 --> 00:47:53,312
- I gotta go. 
- No, wait. 

730
00:47:55,056 --> 00:47:57,332
Listen, I know why you're doing this. 

731
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:59,810
I get it. I miss him too. 

732
00:48:02,367 --> 00:48:03,562
I just. . . 

733
00:48:03,936 --> 00:48:05,770
I need someone to talk to. 

734
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:08,443
I don't know if I can do this anymore. 

735
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:10,292
Do what? 

736
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:14,901
Not be who I really am. 

737
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:19,110
And I know that I-I can't
be who they want me to be. 

738
00:48:19,116 --> 00:48:21,780
And I just feel like I'm gonna burst. 

739
00:48:22,556 --> 00:48:25,063
Look, I know you're looking
for answers. We all are. 

740
00:48:27,077 --> 00:48:31,420
But trust me, I am not the
guy. . . to give 'em to you. 

741
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:34,193
I'm sorry. 

742
00:49:27,105 --> 00:49:27,982
Ando. 

743
00:49:49,526 --> 00:49:53,550
All of them, I never
expected it would be you. 

744
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:01,722
Sir. . . I have it. 

745
00:50:03,528 --> 00:50:04,701
Hey! 

746
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:05,972
Sir! 

747
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:12,360
Sir! 

748
00:50:20,346 --> 00:50:23,120
CORK, IRELAND

749
00:50:33,457 --> 00:50:35,952
What are you trying to
do? Kill the poor bastard? 

750
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,472
Sorry. 

751
00:50:37,478 --> 00:50:41,400
Drag him someplace where he'll stay dry. And
make sure he's breathing, for the love of pete. 

752
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:42,840
Right you are, boss. 

753
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:45,432
We're looking
for 9-1-0-9. 

754
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:47,461
The numbers are on the side here. 

755
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:49,961
Supposed to be the third row back. 

756
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:55,000
Hey, boss! Over there! 

757
00:50:59,046 --> 00:51:01,701
Hey, I figured I'd
keep a case for meself. 

758
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:05,201
What are you gonna do with a dozen
ipods? You can barely use a computer. 

759
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:06,811
Ah, what do you know? 

760
00:51:08,928 --> 00:51:10,050
What the hell? 

761
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:12,963
Maybe we got the wrong number. 

762
00:51:12,968 --> 00:51:15,741
No, the number's right. 
Something else is wrong. 

763
00:51:16,817 --> 00:51:17,963
What's that? 

764
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:25,031
What the hell are you doing here? 

765
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:27,951
Where are the ipods? 

766
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:30,032
You heard the man. 
How'd yous get in here? 

767
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:34,470
Maybe this will jog your memory. 

768
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:39,601
What the hell was that? 

769
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:41,133
Who the hell are you? 

770
00:51:44,216 --> 00:51:46,452
I said, "who are you?"

771
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:48,181
What's your name? 

772
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,340
I don't know. 

773
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:54,363
I don't know.
