1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,270
previously on Heros

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,530
Thank god you came along.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,100
I know dr. suresh.

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,670
I can take you to him.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,070
Right after we deft his enti army.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,230
She won't wake up, and her vitals are getting worse.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,370
I am taking her to t company.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,700
The moment you trust them

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,470
With what you care about most,

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,430
They'll have you.

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,030
We have someone else who needs us.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,730
We would like you to bring her in.

13
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,470
A lot of the people we encounter

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,770
Aren't in control of their ability.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,070
But we need you out there

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,430
Doing the good work that you do

17
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,400
Helping others like her.

18
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,930
You were with a boy.

19
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,270
There's no boy, dad.

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,730
I tried out for cheerleading.

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,600
But you promise me that you won't date.

22
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,670
Okay.

23
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,770
I painted that,

24
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,670
But all the street signs are in french.

25
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,700
It could be montreal.

26
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,730
Ricky!

27
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,830
The woman who did this to Ricky,

28
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,170
She was looking for me.

29
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,700
I'm so sorry.

30
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,470
I shouldn't have let him cover for me.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,230
It was his choice, Peter.

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,700
My brother could be a right fool sometimes.

33
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,800
The woman who killed ricky,

34
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,770
She was looking for me.

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,770
You saw what she could do.

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not gonna let you be next.

37
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,030
I'm gonna find her,

38
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,870
Find out who she is, what she wants.

39
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,270
How are you planning on doing that?

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,870
The plane ticket, the painting.

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,130
It all points to montreal.

42
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,300
It's a start.

43
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,470
I'm going with you.

44
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,270
No.

45
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,930
I'm not risking your life too.

46
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,800
We were both in that montreal painting.

47
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,130
I think i'm supposed to go with you, Peter.

48
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,070
Besides, when you find Ricky's killer,

49
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,030
I want to be there.

50
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,130
What for?

51
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,430
To kill the bitch.

52
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,900
1, 2, 3, 4...

53
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,070
R-E-C-Y-C-L-E !

54
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,000
5, 6, 7, 8...

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,400
It's our planet, let's plant a tree!

56
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,270
Whoo!

57
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,470
Go, Costa Verde! Stop, please!

58
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,030
I can't take it anymore.

59
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,030
Do you realize how agonizing it is

60
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,870
To watch you people?

61
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,970
It's a no on all three.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,370
Next! Are you crazy?

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,070
Claire was awesome.

64
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,770
I vote yes.

65
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Okay, that's one vote

66
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,200
For claire.

67
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,570
Anyone else?

68
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,330
Care to climb out on a limb with may?

69
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,270
Like i said,

70
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,070
Next!

71
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,170
Thanks for trying.

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,030
Claire, you were amazing.

73
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,130
Really.

74
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,670
I don't know what debbie's thinking.

75
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,070
What i'm thinking is that Costa Verde High

76
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,570
Deserves cheerleaders that are extra-ordinary.

77
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,700
And you, Claire, are simply not extra-ordinary.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,300
How was that?

79
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,870
Perfect yet again.

80
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,500
How much longer are we gonna do this?

81
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,700
It's been hours.

82
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,030
I want to go home.

83
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,300
Soon, I promise.

84
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,900
Let's take a break.

85
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,400
Are you ever gonna tell me what's going on here?

86
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,470
Where are we?

87
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,200
I mean, you just grabbed me off the street--

88
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,800
You're in hartsdale,new york,

89
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,200
At a privately funded company

90
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,170
Whose sole purpose is to help you

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,370
And others like you.

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,430
Others like me?

93
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,200
Not exactly like you.

94
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,300
Others have different gifts,

95
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,570
But you're the first we've met

96
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,070
With adoptive muscle memory.

97
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,000
So that's what it's called.

98
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,570
why is this happening to me?

99
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
we're not really sure.

100
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,070
there are certain genetic markers,

101
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,130
but where they come from is still a mystery.

102
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,600
you have been given an extraordinary gift.

103
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,370
I agree.

104
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,230
you are a very special person, miss dawson.

105
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,300
who are you?

106
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,330
my name is bob.

107
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,830
i'm in charge of operations.

108
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,830
doctor,

109
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,930
could i see you for a moment?

110
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,370
have you established a reliable baseline

111
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
for miss dawson's ability?

112
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,430
yes. she is able to replicate any action.

113
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,700
it's really quite extraordinary.

114
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,970
good.

115
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,600
now,

116
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,870
we could determine

117
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,800
if this stops all of that.

118
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,000
what is that?

119
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,670
a variant of the shanti virus.

120
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,930
you're experimenting with the virus?

121
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,730
manipulating a live virus

122
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,570
is essential for creating a vaccine, doctor.

123
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,970
we hope to use this virus

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,370
to take away monica's ability

125
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,570
without harming her.

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
you could create an incurable strain.

127
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,800
it could cross over to the general population.

128
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,300
think how many people were killed by gabriel gray.

129
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,470
there are some abilities in this world

130
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,530
that must be stopped at any cost.

131
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,170
monica is a sweet girl who loves her abilities.

132
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,730
we can't just take them away from her.

133
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,370
it's for the greater good.

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,900
so she's a lab rat.

135
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,130
you're just going to inject her without her consent.

136
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,030
no, dr. suresh, you are.

137
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,770
it's a mutated strain, manufactured.

138
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,170
if the biological structure of the virus has been altered,

139
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
i don't know if i can save her.

140
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,600
she could die.

141
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,700
you're just gonna have to take that chance.

142
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,070
i never agreed to experiment on people.

143
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,700
you brought them molly, didn't you?

144
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,570
i didn't know what else to do.

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,670
all right, look.

146
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,100
if you refuse to do this,

147
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,470
they're gonna get rid of you,

148
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,630
and then we're gonna lose

149
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,370
everything that we've been trying to do.

150
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,800
and worse yet, you're gonna lose molly.

151
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,100
now you've got principles, and that's fine.

152
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,930
but to bring down this company

153
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,970
sometimes we have to do bad things.

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,870
don't disappoint me, suresh.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:21,370

156
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,370
something wrong?

157
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,400
i lied to my dad.

158
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,700
the other night when i went home,

159
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,400
i told him i'd joined cheerleading.

160
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,800
cheerleading? that is bad.

161
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,000
you don't understand.

162
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,770
cheerleading tryouts were last period.

163
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,100
i didn't make it.

164
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,900
what am i supposed to tell him?

165
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,930
you met this awesome guy,

166
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,600
and you need some free time to make out.

167
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,400
i told you my dad's really overprotective

168
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,500
about the whole dating thing.

169
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,800
he told me i couldn't date until i was 21.

170
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,270
so? So i have to listen to my parents.

171
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,000
don't you?

172
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,870
claire, i can fly.

173
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,500
it kind of makes the whole parental guidance thing

174
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,330
a non-issue.

175
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,100
but if it's that important to you,

176
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,200
we'll figure out a way to get you on the team. it's impossible.

177
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,770
debbie marshall does not deem me extra-ordinary enough.

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,130
oh, that's ridiculous.

179
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,030
you're a total babe, and you have a power.

180
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,700
by definition, you're better than she is.

181
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,130
oh, you're sweet.

182
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,130
but it's not just her.

183
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,130
she's got that whole squad

184
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,970
wrapped around her evil little pinky.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,370
i knew girls just like her at my old school.

186
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,830
all it would take is one person to stand up to her.

187
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,070
well, be that person.

188
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,770
take her down a notch.

189
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,070
how?

190
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,600
you were a cheerleader.

191
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,830
what do they fear most?

192
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,770
public humiliation?

193
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,600
we could give her a taste of her own medicine

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,100
your ability is fascinating

195
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,200
a gift

196
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,970
what i do is terrible

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,300
i have taken many lives,

198
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,000
and i can't control it

199
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,970
i was like you

200
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,830
i could do things amazing things

201
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,670
you?

202
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,200
like what?

203
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,870
i could move objects with my mind

204
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,870
i could hear a pin drop from miles away

205
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,070
but then it all just

206
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,130
went away

207
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,670
that's why i need to see dr suresh,

208
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,670
to get them back

209
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,500
you want to be different?

210
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,430
i want to be special,

211
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,570
unique

212
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,430
an ability doesn't have to be a burden, maya

213
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,370
it can be wonderful

214
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,770
is there a problem?

215
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,230
my brother wants to hire a coyote,

216
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,100
to cross the border without you

217
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,100
why?

218
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,830
you can't trust them

219
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,070
it's okay

220
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,030
we'll cross the border together

221
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,370
i'm glad to have found you gabriel

222
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,070
isaac mendez

223
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,670
painted a series of eight paintings

224
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,500
beginning with kaito nakamura's death

225
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,930
and ending in mine

226
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,970
where are they?

227
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,730
sorry, i'm retired

228
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,900
i work in the textile factory now

229
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,030
regional manager of sales,

230
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,600
like you in the paper company

231
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,470
cut the crap

232
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,030
where are the paintings?

233
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,670
you think you intimidate me?

234
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,270
i trained you,

235
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,130
you and your invisible partner claude

236
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,970
i taught you everything!

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,870
then you know what i'm capable of

238
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,270
don't make me do this

239
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,470
what is this?

240
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,770
you want information?

241
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,170
the haitian can't help you

242
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,670
my friend has a new trick

243
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,800
he can reach inside that company-loving head of yours

244
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,830
and one by one blot out all the memories

245
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,400
you hold most dear

246
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,800
 think about it,

247
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,130
a man  treasured memories your give your life meaning

248
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,700
your wedding in capri

249
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,070
the births of andre and mikhail

250
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,400
it'd be a shame if they disappeared,

251
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,370
lost forever

252
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,200
start with the day he met his wife

253
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,130
a boat ride on the danube wasn't it?

254
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,930
tell me about katarina

255
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,500
 your honeymoon

256
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,300
her favorite flower

257
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,470
i can't remember

258
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,570
really?

259
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,700
after 35 years together such a shame

260
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,630
are you ready to talk,

261
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,130
or do we keep going?

262
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,730
hi, honey

263
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,970
is everything all right?

264
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,330
hey, dad, yeah

265
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,800
i was just wondering if i could borrow the car tonight

266
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,030
did you ask your mother?

267
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,830
i did, and she said to ask you

268
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,600
i'm gonna be with the cheerleaders later

269
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,300
just thought you should know

270
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,600
full disclosure and all

271
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,030
well, that's very responsible of you, claire

272
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,100
take the car

273
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,170
but do one thing for me

274
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,130
sure

275
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,430
lock the doors this time

276
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,930
i will thanks

277
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,230
is there something else?

278
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,600
where are you right now?

279
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,430
i told you management training in tulsa

280
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,630
and i'm late for a session

281
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,130
well, i thought you had to work there a year

282
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,100
before they'd send you.

283
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,270
i'm a quick learner.

284
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,830
i've gotta go.

285
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,500
i love you, claire-bear.

286
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,070
i love you too, dad.

287
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,900
what do you think?

288
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,130
okay.

289
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,630
i'm in.

290
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,900
your daughter claire?

291
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,530
it must be very difficult for her

292
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,000
the constant fear of discovery.

293
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,300
especially for a teenager.

294
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,700
aren't you tired of running?

295
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,400
i'm protecting her from animals like you.

296
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,300
you can't hide forever.

297
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,300
take all his memories of me, my family,

298
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,000
claire, everything i ever told him.

299
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,300
he remembers nothing!

300
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,300
wait!

301
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,200
i'm like you.

302
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,100
family comes first.

303
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,870
maybe we can make a deal.

304
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,430
what kind of deal?

305
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,230
you were my protege,

306
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,800
so dedicated to the company, you made me proud.

307
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,770
i miss that.

308
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,170
i want you back.

309
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,070
forget it.

310
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,370
the company has changed.

311
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,900
we have new directives.

312
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,030
come back to us and you'll be safe,

313
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,100
all of you.

314
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,600
you have my word.

315
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,230
what about the paintings?

316
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,370
you'll be told everything.

317
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,030
i can give you your life back.

318
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,070
trust me.

319
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
what is that?

320
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,270
a border fence,not finished yet.

321
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,600
that is america right there.

322
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,270
attention, you're in violation of u.s. immigration!

323
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,100
we have notified border patrol.

324
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,170
all right, boys,andale, andale.

325
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,170
let's see them hands.

326
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,600
who are they?

327
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,970
they're locals,not border patrol.

328
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,430
they're fake police.just drive around them.

329
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,700
what's--what's that for?

330
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,470
a cholinergic.

331
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,170
it's standard procedure

332
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,730
to see if your ability improves.

333
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,970
uh-uh, no way.i won't do needles.

334
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,230
it's the last phase of your testing.

335
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,370
one shot,you can go home.

336
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,370
fine.

337
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,000
just make it fast.

338
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,900
i can't do this.

339
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,900
dr. suresh?

340
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,170
i won't do it.

341
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,130
if you don't,someone else will.

342
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,230
and there's more where that came from.

343
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,430
stop!

344
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,000
what are you doing?!

345
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,800
get someone else to do your research.

346
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,230
i'm taking molly,and i'm leaving.

347
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,500
all right, boys,this is your last warning.

348
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,700
vamanos.

349
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,370
we have to go. they will shoot us.

350
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,230
just drive, now!

351
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,870
no, no, no, no, no.

352
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,130
let her alone.

353
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,430
we need to get past these men,

354
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,170
these guns.

355
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,430
you can use your gift.

356
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,600
no.

357
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,670
drive.

358
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
the next time you think

359
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,930
of that second helping of chunky monkey,

360
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,930
remember one thing.

361
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,200
the sharpie doesn't lie.

362
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,200
appearance matters, girls.

363
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,100
is this really necessary?

364
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,530
hell, yes.

365
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,700
i might have to basket catch one of these tubettes.

366
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,670
debbie, can i talk to you for a minute?

367
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,170
private function, butler.

368
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,170
cheerleaders only.

369
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,530
i'll do your biology homework for a week.

370
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,000
you have five minutes.

371
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,270
i want another chance,

372
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,700
another shot at tryouts.

373
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,930
i appreciate the effort,really.

374
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,800
attempting to better your social status at school

375
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,370
is very american dream of you.

376
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,670
but everyone has their place in this world.

377
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,030
deal with it.

378
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,970
so you're not gonna change your mind?

379
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,130
you are slow,aren't you?

380
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,600
Claire?

381
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,830
Claire?!

382
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,430
Claire?!

383
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,330
oh, my God.

384
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,370
she was right there.

385
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,600
her neck was twisted.

386
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,800
she was bleeding.

387
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,300
i went to see if i could help her,

388
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,900
and that's when he came after me.

389
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,930
the flying masked man?

390
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,900
yes!

391
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,530
i escaped, thank goodness,

392
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,530
but claire was dead,

393
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,030
right there on the steps.

394
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,000
i saw her. she's--

395
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,700
what's going on?

396
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,630
but i saw you.

397
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,270
that thing dropped you.

398
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,370
debbie, calm down. i'm fine.

399
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,130
i don't supposed you saw a...

400
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,270
flying masked man this evening?

401
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,870
me? no. no.

402
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,200
uh, i was just hanging out with debbie.

403
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,070
find anything, ray?

404
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,630
no dead bodies.

405
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,400
i did find this.

406
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:24,730
how much have you had to drink tonight, miss marshall?

407
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,070
we don't have much time.

408
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,470
the sun will rise soon.

409
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
yaeko's father is there.

410
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,530
you take out the guard, we will follow.

411
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,470
you've given me purpose, carp.

412
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,670
i'm really a hero.

413
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,870
and more, you've made me a better man.

414
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,770
well...

415
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,200
you wouldn't happen to have a swordsmith in there,

416
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,170
would you?

417
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,800
i know. it's really unfair.

418
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,830
that was easy enough.

419
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,870
you must stop them.

420
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,200
destroy all the guns!

421
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,500
that is how you save japan.

422
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,200
very well.

423
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,200
Can i speak with you for a moment?

424
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,130
i owe you an apology.

425
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,770
What i asked you to do was wrong.

426
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,600
i've been with the company for 30 years.

427
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,500
we've been through a lot of turmoil

428
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,600
and made a lot of difficult choices,

429
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,230
some i regret to this day.

430
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,400
but right now I'm dealing with someone

431
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,930
who is a real danger to us,

432
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,130
to everyone,

433
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,200
and i'm afraid that in my haste to deal with him,

434
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,830
i overstepped my bounds.

435
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,270
the file you were holding, adam monroe.

436
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,070
yes.

437
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,000
you're valuable to us, dr. suresh,

438
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,800
not just for your blood or your knowledge,

439
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,730
but to keep us in line.

440
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,630
molly still isn't well,

441
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,130
so i can't take her away from here.

442
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,030
but you've given me no reason to trust you.

443
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,500
i know, i know.

444
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,530
we both have a lot at stake.

445
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,070
i have someone at my disposal,

446
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,300
someone who can make sure

447
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,700
there's no further misunderstandings.

448
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,430
sound good?

449
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,100
i don't really have a choice, do i?

450
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,600
i will get something for your lip.

451
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,060
i know you don't understand me.

452
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,660
but i want to tell you why i'm helping you.

453
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,730
it's that delicious power.

454
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,500
you see, when i get my ability back,

455
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,900
i'm gonna kill you...

456
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,730
and your sister.

457
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,860
and i'm gonna take it all.

458
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,660
and if i don't get my ability back,

459
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,530
it's not a total loss.

460
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,160
maya's learning quickly.

461
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,900
she's a shiny new toy,

462
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,030
and she's all mine.

463
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,360
i can't believe you talked me into that.

464
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,560
what?

465
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,930
somebody could have seen us.

466
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,930
relax. no one saw.

467
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,430
and no one will ever believe Debbie.

468
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,500
did you see her face?

469
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,430
classic.

470
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,360
is she gonna be okay?

471
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,600
definitely.

472
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,400
she freaked,but just think of it

473
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,900
as a lesson in humility.

474
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,560
Claire.

475
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,700
oh.

476
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,800
hope i'm not interrupting.

477
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,630
no, it's okay.how's Debbie?

478
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,160
she blew a .13.

479
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,030
drinking on school grounds.

480
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,130
got suspended from the cheerleading squad

481
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,460
immediately.

482
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,900
which means we have an opening.

483
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,930
first practice is monday after school.

484
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,060
you mean it? i'm on the team?

485
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,400
sure. you were the best at try-outs.

486
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,230
i'll just let you two get back to...

487
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,400
whatever.

488
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,560
i'll see you monday.

489
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,730
tell me something, Ivan.

490
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,030
in all the years i've known you,

491
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,160
why have you never mentioned a daughter?

492
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,930
this daughter.

493
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,460
she died, didn't she?

494
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,030
leukemia.

495
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,730
i'm so sorry.

496
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,100
that must have been so painful.

497
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,300
i can't even imagine losing claire.

498
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,300
to think...

499
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:05,230
all you have left of her

500
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,960
are your memories.

501
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,160
it would be awful if they were taken.

502
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,800
almost as if she never existed.

503
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,900
please don't.

504
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,200
take the daughter.

505
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,430
don't leave anything.

506
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,560
wait!

507
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,360
it's in the warehouse near the train yard.

508
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,160
where we tagged the liquid man.

509
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,330
you'll find your paintings there.

510
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,460
thank you.

511
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,060
now what?

512
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,560
your haitian friend makes sure

513
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,400
that'll i'll forget that you were ever here?

514
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,860
i wish it were that easy.

515
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:50,100
once the company discovers your memory loss,

516
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,830
they're gonna trace it back to the haitian,

517
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,830
which leads to my family.

518
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,260
and i can't have it.

519
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,400
what are you doing?

520
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,000
you taught me well, my friend.

521
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,860
you said, "make it look as if you were never there."

522
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,630
so now we weren't.

523
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,130
instead, there was a simple home invasion,

524
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,460
a senseless murder.

525
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,630
i am offering you a way out.

526
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,660
you can stop running!

527
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,460
shoot me and there is no turning back.

528
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,030
you'll condemn yourself to hell.

529
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,160
i know.

530
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,710
kensei, i've been searching for hours.

531
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,240
come, my friend.

532
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,510
we must go back and destroy whitebeard's guns.

533
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,510
if you want to stop him, do it yourself.

534
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,240
something wrong?

535
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,110
i saw you, hiro.

536
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,470
after i saved the swordsmith,

537
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,470
i came after you,

538
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,710
afraid something had happened to Yaeko,

539
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,510
because i love her.

540
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,370
and you, friend, betrayed me.

541
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,940
no. yes. you kissed her.

542
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,810
it happened...

543
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,810
by accident.

544
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,110
you accidentally kissed her?

545
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,110
i accidentally

546
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,370
fell in love with her,

547
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,310
and she with me.

548
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,540
i'm so sorry.

549
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,370
so you've been lying to me all along.

550
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,110
first you show me that i can be harmed by no weapon,

551
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,670
and then you cut me deeper than any blade possibly could.

552
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,670
she's your princess, Kensei.

553
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,210
i know that.

554
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,840
and i swear i will not give in to love.

555
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,070
that kiss will be our last.

556
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,570
but the fate of the world still rests in our hands.

557
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,070
we must stop Whitebeard.

558
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,970
all right, carp.

559
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,210

but...i owe these people so much.

592
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,540
Bob told me that you two were having

593
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,270
some trust issues.

00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,610
he just wants me to make sure

595
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,970

00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,370
