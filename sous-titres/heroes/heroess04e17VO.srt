00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:05,463
Whatever happens in your world,
you can always come back to this one.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,464
I know.

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,174
I'll find my way.

5
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,927
- Nice to meet you.
- Mom, this is Emma.

6
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,264
She's gonna kill thousands of people.
It will be a bloodbath.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,474
Tell me exactly what you saw.

8
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,226
You cannot save her.

9
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,145
But someone else can.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,482
People think
that dreaming the future is a gift.

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,692
They're wrong.

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,030
I don't want to be alone.
And you're supposed to help me.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,490
I can only imagine
what having a bunch of...

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,785
excuses could do
to someone's humanity.

15
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:39,539
In order to become human again,
he has to get rid of all of his powers.

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,711
Was that so hard?

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,006
- I'm Gabriel, a friend of Matt's.
- He's not here right now.

18
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
Could you tell me where he is?
It's important that I speak with him.

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,262
This is your fantasy.
This isn't my life.

20
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,014
Something wrong, sir?

21
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,391
Yes, something is wrong.

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,019
Where is everyone?

23
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,439
The carnival is closed.

24
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,403
Everybody saw
what you did to that town.

25
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,281
- They're afraid of me.
- Can you blame them?

26
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,910
We finally have a home here...

27
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,247
A place to make a life.
It's what we wanted.

28
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,376
- What you told us that you wanted.
- You don't trust me anymore, do you?

29
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,380
- You haven't for a long time.
- So show me why I should.

30
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,887
Out of trust is faith.

31
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,765
It must be very hard for you
to come by...

32
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,602
when you can steal a look
into someone's soul with a touch.

33
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,148
After all I've done for you,
for all of them, I'm the villain.

34
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,775
And you...

35
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,362
you seem to have become the empath
to replace Joseph.

36
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,491
Everyone's looking to you now
for their voice, aren't they?

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,493
What are you telling them?

38
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,081
Nobody respects you anymore.

39
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,085
And I'm gonna win it back.

40
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,589
I love them.

41
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,174
I need them.

42
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,223
And I'll do whatever I have to do...

43
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,559
to prove my worth.

It's Peter Petrelli.
Is Emma Coolidge there?

48
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,540
Look, it's important.
Just...

49
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,252
I already went by her place.
She's not there.

50
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,381
If you see her,

51
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,383
call me, okay?

52
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,760
Thanks.

53
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,898
Ma?

54
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,488
Janice, honey, you home?

55
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,327
Haven't you ever heard
of making two trips?

56
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,038
Oh, God.
Are you back inside my head?

57
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:54,711
That's so two months ago.
Here, let me give you a hand.

58
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,675
Calm down, if I wanted you dead,
we wouldn't be talking.

59
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,051
What, then?

60
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,929
It's complicated.

61
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,765
My life's taken a turn
since last time.

62
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,101
You could say
I'm on a fact-finding mission.

63
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,062
Matt, honey.

64
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,690
I thought you'd be at work.

65
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,443
I took Matty to day care,
and my client canceled...

66
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,446
Lucky I was home, your friend Gabriel
was in the neighborhood.

67
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,614
He is full of stories.

68
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,283
Stories?

69
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,202
From when we were partners
on the force.

70
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,913
I figured you guys
would like to catch up,

71
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,041
so I put
a little late lunch together.

72
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,127
It looks so good, thank you.

73
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,840
Take a load off, have a nosh.

74
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,842
We really need to catch up.

75
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,225
This is probably not a good time.

76
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,395
In fact, it's not even a big deal.

77
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,482
- It's over. I don't need to tell him.
- You kind of do.

78
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,028
A superpowered serial killer
shape-shifted into a coed

79
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,197
and made a pie chart of your life.

80
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,867
It wasn't a pie chart.
It was more like a...

81
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,162
- Whatever. You have to tell your dad.
- Really?

82
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,416
When Sylar killed my real dad,
he didn't tell me.

83
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,796
I know.
You're right.

84
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,672
But you...

85
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,841
I know.

86
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,885
How long will you hold a grudge?

87
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,055
The whole silent treatment
is getting old.

88
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,642
We were in a good place
before all this.

89
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,689
Do you want me to come with?

90
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,868
I have to do this alone.

91
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,580
I could wait.

92
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,999
It's probably gonna be a while.

93
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,961
The list of things
we have to talk about... Sylar...

94
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,589
The cover-up of my dad's death.
Let's not forget about the carnival.

95
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,801
I'm sure there's plenty my dad
wants to say about that.

96
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,808
Good luck.

97
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,227
You'll feel better
when it's all over with.

98
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,896
Or if not,
at least you'll be caffeinated.

99
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,937
You gonna let me in?

100
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,523
Of course.

101
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,117
Where's my dad?

102
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,079
He just stepped out for a moment.

103
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,789
I brought some coffee.

104
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,461
Thought it was time
to talk things over with him.

105
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,885
I'm sorry...

106
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,471
but why are you here exactly?

107
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,103
- Your father and I are...
- No, that's not...

108
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,147
that's not what I was talking about.

109
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,401
You have Primatech files,

110
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,613
and satellite maps, and this is...

111
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,950
everything that my dad
said that he would put behind him.

112
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,330
- I'm just trying to help a friend.
- Friends do dinners and movies.

113
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,915
You want to help?

114
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:05,086
You tell my dad whatever it is
that he's doing, he needs to stop.

115
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,755
I wish it was that simple.

116
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,632
Why?
What's going on?

117
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:12,760
There was an incident.

118
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,221
It was Samuel Sullivan.

119
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,815
What did he do?

120
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,193
They're saying it was a landslide,
but we know it was Samuel.

121
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,113
Wait, you think he buried that town?

122
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,573
Can he do that?

123
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,577
He gains more power
the more specials he has around.

124
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,415
200 are dead,
they're still digging out the bodies.

125
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,167
What are you planning to do?

126
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,588
Your dad will be back any minute.
Why don't you just...

127
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,882
Actually, I have class.

128
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,804
Looks like you have this under control,
so just tell him I stopped by.

129
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,265
- Claire, wait.
- Enjoy the coffee.

130
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,317
I've always loved
the Black and Whites.

131
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,946
- Are they still Matty's favorite?
- How do you know that?

132
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,614
Like I said,

133
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,492
Parkman and I used to be pretty tight.
We went through...

134
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,953
addiction counseling together,

135
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,080
and faced our mutual demons.

136
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,667
You know what? I'll show Gabe
what I've been doing in the basement.

137
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,755
The world of Matt's projects.
You'll love it down there.

138
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,174
I'm sure I will.

139
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,977
You're on a fact-finding mission?

140
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,688
What the hell does that mean?

141
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,150
I had to make sure
I remembered it right.

142
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,028
Husband...

143
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,696
and father...

144
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,950
You figured out a way
to live with your ability.

145
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,539
You may not believe this,

146
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,084
but in some ways,
you're actually stronger than I am.

147
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,878
I'm not afraid of you, okay?
So if this is about revenge...

148
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,172
After what you did to me,
I was tempted.

149
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,842
I don't want to be
like that anymore.

150
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,389
I need you
to go inside my head again.

151
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,184
You're serious.

152
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,104
You are insane.

153
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,067
If I am, it's because
that's what my powers have made me.

154
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,821
I can't live with them anymore.

155
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,740
So you need to take them away.

156
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,247
You want me to...

157
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,290
How am I supposed to do that?

158
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:52,336
Create a mental block, repress them.
I don't really care, to be honest.

159
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,172
All I know...

160
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,092
is that once I'm free
from the temptation of my ability...

161
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,052
You're gonna be normal?

162
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,014
I'm sorry,
that ship sailed 50 murders ago.

163
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,766
I'm asking nicely.

164
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,603
The last time I was inside your head,
you turned my life into a living hell.

165
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,647
Why would I risk that?

166
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,400
Janice, and the kid.

167
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,903
I really do want to change.

168
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,740
But I'm insane.
Remember?

169
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,494
And all you have to do is point.

170
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,039
Fine, I will try.

171
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,418
But you have to let Janice go.

172
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,758
Consider it a gesture of good faith.

173
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:00,487
Hey, mom.

174
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,448
What's wrong?

175
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:05,743
It's Nathan.

176
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,703
The stonecutters called.

177
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,122
They needed a final wording
for his headstone,

178
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,625
and I didn't know what to say.

179
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,127
I guess it's the finality of it.

180
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,549
I mean, they're just words,
but when you write them down,

181
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,385
when you etch them in stone...

182
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,804
I know, mom.

183
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,559
Maybe it was selfish of me, Peter,
but I just needed to see you.

184
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,562
I needed to be sure you were okay.

185
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,189
Because of your vision.

186
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,276
I had the dream too, mom.

187
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,904
I saw all the people.

188
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,656
And Sylar...

189
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,867
I think he was trying to help Emma.

190
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,038
You saw that too?

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,169
Whatever this vision is, Peter,

192
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,671
remember this:

193
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,425
one isolated act does not make
Sylar your friend's savior.

194
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,815
I need you to help me find him, mom.

195
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,317
I know you know where he is.

196
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,987
Sylar's never been far
from my thoughts.

197
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,865
But I'm begging you, don't go.

198
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,995
He murdered Nathan, and the last time
you faced him, he almost killed you.

199
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,913
Mom, Emma's in trouble.

200
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,706
People's lives are at stake.

201
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,709
Nathan would never turn
his back on them.

202
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,628
And you know that I can't either.

203
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,976
This is gonna end badly.

204
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,354
Samuel is crazy.
My dad's gonna take him down,

205
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,940
and there is no way
this is gonna end well.

206
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,820
What?
What do you want me to say?

207
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,531
What do you think I should do?

208
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,494
I don't know. You've got
a humanities lecture in 20 minutes.

209
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,164
Here's a crazy idea,
maybe you should go to class for once.

210
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,500
Did you hear anything I just said?

211
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,210
I did.
Yeah, all of it.

212
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,796
But I mean, what are you
really gonna do, Claire?

213
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,924
Your dad was right about the carnival.
You never should have gone there.

214
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,553
Look, Samuel is a bad guy, yes.

215
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,181
But the rest of the carnival
is all family and children.

216
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,851
And they just want to live their lives
being open about their abilities.

217
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,063
I thought you said
they were giving Samuel his power.

218
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,647
But they don't know that.

219
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,610
You were only there for one day.
How can you know for sure?

220
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,155
I need to borrow your car.

221
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,785
I thought
you would back me up on this.

222
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,079
You say you want
a normal life, right?

223
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,706
Just let your dad handle it.

224
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,417
Come on, please.
Just come to class with me.

225
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:03,670
Or not.

226
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,423
Bring it back full.

227
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,977
- She's not answering.
- She said she had a class.

228
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,397
Claire,
call me as soon as you get this.

229
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,524
You shouldn't have let her go.

230
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:28,529
What was I supposed to do, drag her
by her hair and lock her in your closet?

231
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,908
What do you want to do?

232
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,578
We go.

233
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,580
If Samuel's escalating his attacks,
we can't sit around and wait to see

234
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,083
- what he's gonna do next.
- But you're also emotional.

235
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,793
Look, this Samuel is a threat

236
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,255
and not just to Claire.
You go in with less than 100% focus...

237
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,300
I can handle this.
You don't have to worry about me.

238
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,135
That's not an option anymore.

239
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,851
Let's go.

240
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,867
- We need to talk.
- What are you doing here?

241
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,121
Your father is coming for Samuel,

242
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,248
to kill him.

243
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,250
Claire, if Samuel finds out, he's...

244
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,377
I know.
That's why I came ahead.

245
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,546
I have seen things like this
go wrong before,

246
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,257
and I don't want my dad
or anyone else getting hurt.

247
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,842
But we don't much time.

248
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,606
Samuel will never go for it.
He'll never turn himself in.

249
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:47,816
We have to try.

250
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,402
He is not listening
to me, to anyone.

251
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,197
If your father is really on his way,
I should get Amanda.

252
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,073
And what, Lydia...

253
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,743
run away?
Has it come to that?

254
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,079
I can't say I blame you...

255
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,332
What I did to that town,
all those people.

256
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,628
I'd hoped you'd have
a better reason to come back.

257
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,046
How could you do that?

258
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,381
I don't know what I was thinking.

259
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,551
I wish I could take it all back...

260
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,554
And so many other things... Joseph.

261
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,395
Did I ever tell you
the first carnival act

262
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,232
that Joseph and I ever saw
was the trapeze?

263
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,026
The way they flung themselves
through the air,

264
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,070
we thought they had powers,
just like us.

265
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,907
But when we went backstage,
the man told us

266
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,076
the only power he had was gravity.

267
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,079
No matter how high he went,

268
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,581
it was always there to catch him.

269
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,505
I've come to realize that gravity
is different things to people.

270
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,009
For much of my life,
Joseph was mine.

271
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,222
I've been losing my way.

272
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,268
And now even my own family
is afraid of me.

273
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,730
- And the only strength I have left...
- You have to take responsibility.

274
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,399
You have to turn yourself over.

275
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,236
To your father?

276
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,614
He's not exactly known
for his mercy.

277
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:20,659
If you give yourself up,
he will not hurt you, I promise.

278
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,496
Please, Samuel,

279
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,248
listen to her.

280
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,127
If you care about this family,

281
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,420
then protect them.

282
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,640
There's Samuel on the midway.

283
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,812
Got him.

284
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,320
Wait a second.
Is that Claire?

285
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,405
At 2:00.

286
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,180
<i>Dad, where are you?</i>

287
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:24,639
<i>Close.</i>

288
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,768
<i>I heard you stopped by earlier.
Thanks for the coffee.</i>

289
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,853
What's the situation there?

290
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,230
<i>Samuel wants to surrender.</i>

291
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:33,481
Really?

292
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:36,110
- Why?
- <i>To protect his family.</i>

293
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,069
<i>He's willing to turn himself over</i>

294
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,573
<i>as long as the rest of the carnival
stays safe and under the grid.</i>

295
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,200
<i>And you trust him?</i>

296
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,952
If there's a chance

297
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,040
that we can do this without anyone
getting hurt, don't we have to try?

298
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,336
Dad, it's the best plan, all right?

299
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,922
You get Samuel,
and nobody gets hurt.

300
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,386
All right. Tell him to meet us
in the field outside of the carnival.

301
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,013
I'll see you soon.

302
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:12,354
He's surrendering.

303
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,941
And you think
he's just gonna give himself up?

304
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,403
I don't know, but Claire seems
to think so, and I have to trust her.

305
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,657
It's done.
He wants you to meet him in the field.

306
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,161
Are you sure this is a good idea?

307
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,871
I wouldn't worry.

308
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,582
If it's a setup,
you'll just get a better shot at him,

309
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,042
out in the open.

310
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,837
Wait a second.
I'll do down and walk him out.

311
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,340
Keep him in the crosshairs.

312
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,052
Be careful.

313
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,693
I know my recent actions
have caused some of you

314
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,237
to question
where it is my heart lies.

315
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,534
I regret

316
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,953
what I've done.

317
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,457
I acted impulsively,
and that has brought one of them...

318
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,125
An agent...

319
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,793
To our door.

320
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,130
It's okay.

321
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,882
It's okay.

322
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,760
They just want me.

323
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,929
Claire has helped arrange

324
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:11,390
a peaceful surrender.

325
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,893
I'll go with them.

326
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,104
No, no, please, listen.

327
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,566
I know everyone will not agree
with this decision.

328
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,902
But it's the only way.

329
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,905
The safety of each
and every one of you

330
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,075
and keeping this family together

331
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,660
is what matters most to me.

332
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,038
And if that means I have to leave,

333
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,456
so be it.

334
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,706
All right, Parkman,

335
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,667
I did my part.
I let Janice walk. Now it's your turn.

336
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,834
I know.

337
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,297
I know.
I said I would try.

338
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,985
Nothing's changed.

339
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,989
I know you can do this,
what's wrong?

340
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,991
I don't know.

341
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,285
I don't know.

342
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:12,427
- I can't.
- Try again.

343
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,471
Maybe it's not me.

344
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,931
Maybe it's you.
Maybe you're fighting it.

345
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,851
Maybe you really don't want
to let go of these powers.

346
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,103
- You're lying!
- I'm not!

347
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,439
- What's going on?
- Stop!

348
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,858
Oh, God.
Please let her go.

349
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,612
Look at me!
Come on, let her go.

350
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,198
She had nothing to do with this.
Come on, let her go.

351
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,617
- I'll try again.
- That's not good enough.

352
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,205
You see what you made me do?

353
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,792
I don't even know
if I can do this for you.

354
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,044
Maybe you need
a little more motivation.

355
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,464
You will purge me of these powers...

356
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,300
or I will use them...

357
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,053
I will use them all.

358
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,807
And trust me,

359
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,725
I can get creative.

360
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,893
Damn.

361
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,920
Come quickly!

362
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,188
Put pressure on the wound.
I need your help. Come on.

363
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:28,831
You wanted to know
what was in my heart.

364
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,393
You... did... this?

365
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:51,354
I'm sorry.

366
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,606
So sorry.

367
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,776
I'm so sorry.

368
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,155
They needed a villain...

369
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,700
someone worse than me.

370
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,746
You gave that to them.
Thank you.

371
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,846
I'll do it.

372
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,224
It's too late.

373
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,102
She's gone.

374
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,074
Come on, Dad.
Pick up, please.

375
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,384
Dad.

376
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,596
I found him on the hill...

377
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,017
with this!

378
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,275
- Are you okay?
- I didn't do it.

379
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,445
- I didn't shoot anything...
- Murderer!

380
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,115
He's the one.

381
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:10,660
You brought him here.
You're one of them.

382
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,079
Back off!

383
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,714
Don't hurt them.

384
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,757
We're better than this.

385
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,222
Take him to the house of mirrors.

386
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,933
Tie him up.

387
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:42,984
And her?

388
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,611
My trailer.

389
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,449
Get off!

390
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,993
Dad!

391
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:54,746
Let go!

392
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,790
He didn't do it!

393
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,917
Get off!

394
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,756
- If you hurt her, I swear to God...
- That's the problem, isn't it?

395
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,633
One cruel thought is all it takes.
These powers make it so easy.

396
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:11,387
I understand that, believe me.
You don't have to use them like this.

397
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,473
Except I do.

398
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,017
The powers are me, now.

399
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,604
You've been there, dealt with them,
the constant temptation.

400
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,647
How do you compartmentalize?

401
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,067
How do you keep them
from overwhelming your life?

402
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,987
You start by accepting the fact
that you're more than your abilities.

403
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:32,867
We're people first.

404
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,495
Please, let her go.

405
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,591
Look, I'll try to do what you want,
but let me make sure she's okay.

406
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,552
Last chance.

407
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,680
Come on.
It's okay.

408
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:58,059
- That's Sylar, isn't it?
- I'm so sorry.

409
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,019
This is crazy.

410
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,064
He wants me to take away
his powers and make him normal.

411
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,108
I looked inside his head long enough,
he's serious,

412
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,569
- but I can't give him what he wants.
- Forget about that.

413
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,614
I work with monsters like this.
He's broken inside.

414
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,452
We have to bury him
so that he cannot hurt anyone else.

415
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,291
Just go,
don't come back until I call you.

416
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,380
Get on with it.

417
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,925
You were right...
I was holding back.

418
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,344
It's all about motivation, right?

419
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
What if I told you
that I can be special,

420
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,272
but to do it, I'd have to hurt
a lot of people? Should I?

421
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,860
You? You could never hurt anyone.

422
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:51,279
Mommy.

423
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,373
I don't...

424
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,210
I don't feel any different.

425
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,881
Try something, go ahead, on me.
Come on.

426
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,015
You did it.

427
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,393
My powers are gone.

428
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,229
They're just buried... somewhere
that you can never get to them.

429
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,108
You've threatened my family
for the last time.

430
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,279
- What did you do?
- I know exactly what scares you.

431
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,448
And it's being alone
with your immortality.

432
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:39,410
- What did you do to me?
- I have trapped you inside your mind.

433
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,080
You're gonna be alone, Sylar.
Very much alone...

434
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,833
In this nightmare
that will last forever.

435
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,585
And the best part about it,

436
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,628
when I leave,
you won't remember what I did.

437
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:52,006
And you'll live
every empty day like it's real.

438
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,341
You said you would help me.

439
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:57,011
Yeah, I guess there's still
a little of you left inside me...

440
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,263
Because I lied.

441
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,643
Enjoy hell.

442
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,982
Samuel said you'd come.

443
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,026
Thank God you're here.
I need your help.

444
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,912
Finally,
there's a doctor in the house.

445
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,499
- What happened?
- We were attacked.

446
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,752
You were attacked?
By who?

447
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,631
People who don't understand us,
Emma...

448
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,842
People who fear us.

449
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,511
It doesn't matter.

450
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,766
What matters is that you're here.

451
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,604
You're not just gonna heal me.

452
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,067
You're gonna help us make
a new world for ourselves.

453
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,819


454
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,571
We'll show them, Emma.

455
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,700
We'll show them how great we can be.

456
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,178
Hey, man.
Sorry, I was working downstairs.

457
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,473
- That's okay, man. Been a long time.
- Yeah, how are you?

458
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,645
What?

459
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,939
- Sylar is here.
- What are you talking about?

460
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,233
About what you're thinking.

461
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,693
You're gonna take him.
You can't do that!

462
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,196
People die, Matt.
Sylar has to save them.

463
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,906
Peter, he's a murderer!

464
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,992
Come on, stop.
Listen.

465
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,494
He's trapped, Peter.

466
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,749
- What the hell did you do?
- I went inside his head,

467
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,876
and I trapped him
in his worst nightmare.

468
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,962
He'll never hurt anyone again.

469
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,173
- I have to bring him back.
- No, you can't do that.

470
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,342
You go into his head,
you might not come out.

471
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,172
Noah Bennet told me to call
if anything went wrong.

472
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,044
I went to Bennet.

473
00:40:23,545 --> 00:40:24,463
I thought...

474
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,298
Look what they've done...

475
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,301
These so-called normal people.

476
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,141
How could you let this happen?

477
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,462
What I did was wrong.
I know that.

478
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,926
But I was willing
to sacrifice myself to protect you...

479
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:15,514
To save this family
that we've all come to love.

480
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,142
The outside world
has proven once again

481
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:22,021
that people like us
will never be accepted.

482
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,315
We've all seen it...

483
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,737
In the eyes of those
who come to see our shows...

484
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,989
Dazzled by our abilities...

485
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,700
But filled with revulsion

486
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,161
of who we are.

487
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,165
I saw it again yesterday...

488
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,877
In that small town over the hill...

489
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,633
And today in the bullets that struck me
and murdered our dear Lydia.

490
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:57,347
It's time.

491
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,562
It's time we put fear behind us.

492
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:09,610
It's time we showed the world...

493
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,988
what we truly are.
