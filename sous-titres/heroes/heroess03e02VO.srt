1
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,300
Claire

2
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,700
when you are ready to talk about it.

3
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:24,460
You know I am here, right?

4
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,690
Yeah.

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,800
I am so angry.

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,440
to think that monster was in this house.

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,060
Maybe we should go to motel.

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,750
He is not coming back.

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,220
How do you know that?

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,950
I think he got what he came for.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,140
You don't have to give me any details, Claire.

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,380
But I need to know...

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,890
Did he...?

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,770
No.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,310
No, It wasn't that.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,960
Claire

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,650
I'll get you a towel.

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,020
I don't feel anything.

19
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,520
It's getting hurt, there is no pain.

20
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,150
But that's your power, isn't it?

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,180
No.

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,580
I heal, but I always feel everything.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,440
It hurts as same as anyone else, but...

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,510
not this time.

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,200
That pain...

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,180
I am always so grateful for.

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,430
Because it's the only time.

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,620
I know I am still human.

29
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,730
I had another dream.

30
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,790
One I'd rather not repeat.

31
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,290
And all because you're not where you're supposed to be.

32
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,420
So go back where you came from, Peter.

33
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,150
I'm a little too busy saving the world right now.

35
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,890
You never were as smart as you thought you were.

36
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,490
I see a few more years on this planet

37
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,650
Hasn't changed that.

38
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,040
There are things that I know.

39
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,930
Things that you can't see, mother.

40
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,480
Even in your dreams.

41
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,300
I've seen what you become.

42
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,970
I've seen what you do.

43
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,360
So don't think that I came back here for my health.

44
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,850
You have no idea the fire that you're playing with.

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,650
You don't screw with time.

46
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,220
It's called the butterfly effect.

47
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,270
You step on a butterfly today.

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,200
Three years from now,

49
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,770
A million people are wiped out.

50
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,390
Let's just hope it's nobody that I know.

51
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,260
Oh, but what if it is?

52
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,400
What if it turns out to be someone you do know?

53
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,220
Someone you care about?

54
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,340
Claire.

55
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,730
You talked to her today, didn't you?

56
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,090
What'd you tell her?

57
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,610
I told her not to go to Odessa.

58
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,160
I told her to stay home. Why?

59
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,710
She listened to you.

60
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,570
Ended up being where she wasn't supposed to be,

61
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,160
And had a pretty bad day because of it.

62
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,770
Don't believe me?

63
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,170
Go see for yourself.

64
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,960
Dr. Suresh.

65
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,720
Hello.

66
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,090
Dr. Suresh?

67
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,270
Up here!

68
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,240
How did you--

69
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,580
I-i came to apologize about last night.

70
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,460
I'm sorry I was...

71
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,950
So, uh...

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,160
How did you just do that?

73
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,760
That serum I Made?

74
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,200
You know how I said it would give abilities

75
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,270
To anyone instantaneously?

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,830
You didn't.

77
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,990
I sure did.

78
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,670
But you said it still needed to be perfected.

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,230
I was wrong.

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,870
And the results have been beyond my wildest dreams.

81
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,840
I woke up this morning

82
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,410
And I've never felt anything like it.

83
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,330
I've been cataloguing the whole experience,

84
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,740
Monitoring my vitals.

85
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,980
So...

86
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,270
It didn't give you my abilities.

87
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,190
Far from it.

88
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,400
My senses are heightened.

89
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,440
I'm stronger, faster, more agile.

90
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,830
I have boundless energy.

91
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm a new Man. Watch this.

92
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,400
I've run a blood sample, checked reflexes,

93
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,270
Hormone levels, blood pressure,

94
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,420
Balance.

95
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,550
They're all normal.

96
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,360
I am completely the same in every way.

97
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,040
My god.

98
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,570
It's unbelievable.

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,740
Just different.

100
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,970
Better.

101
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,510
And if I give powers to anyone,

102
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,840
Then it's only a Matter of time

103
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,320
Before I figure out a way to reverse the effects.

104
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,650
Take the powers away. Your powers.

105
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,070
And this all came from you, Maya.

106
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,530
From what's inside that...

107
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,600
Extraordinary body of yours.

108
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,910
You are different.

109
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,560
Karina and Cruz were two of our best agents.

110
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,450
Fine. I'll own it, daddy.

111
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,710
I screwed up. Sylar got away.

112
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,810
And he got to Claire Bennet,

113
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,100
Making him virtually unstoppable.

114
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,280
I can stop him.

115
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,400
You know, I can't help but think about you as a child.

116
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,410
When your mother died, your need for approval,

117
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,700
Affection... It was hard to bear.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,080
I will find him.

119
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,530
And I'll figure out where he's gonna strike next--

120
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,800
No, no, no, why should I keep putting you

121
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,740
Into a position where you're just going to be

122
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,160
Letting me or yourself down again, huh?

123
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,440
That's not fair to either of us, is it?

124
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,240
Hiro.

125
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,120
don't do that

126
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,020
Do what?

127
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,340
Sneak up on me

128
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,860
I wasn't sneaking up on you.

129
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,040
You were definitely sneaking up on me

130
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,750
Who are these guys?

131
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,910
Private Detectives. Very discrete. Expensive

132
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,490
They found a fingerprint. Checking A.F.I.S

133
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,820
Did you tell them it was from a woman

134
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,830
who moves at super speed?

135
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,780
Of course not.

136
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,060
Did you mention that she stole a piece of paper...

137
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,820
with a formula on it that could...

138
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,770
destroy the entire world?

139
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,240
At these prices they don't ask a lot of questions.

140
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,990
Her name is Daphne Millbrook.

141
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,420
14 Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris, France.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,260
I found her! Now all I have to do is track her down

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,670
You're not taking me with you?

144
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,810
What did I do?

145
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,310
Nothing. Let's go

146
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,180
Please tell me you're not getting cold feet.

147
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,150
I know we wanted to Make a bold move,

148
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,120
But Petrelli is a loaded gun.

149
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,380
The seat's been vacant for a month.

150
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,870
Now as governor, it's your job to fill it.

151
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,440
Doug Hargis is a safer choice.

152
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,620
Oh, Hargis is a stiff!

153
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,390
You'd be better off

154
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,970
Leaving Dickenson's dead carcass in there.

155
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,020
All right, if...

156
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,180
If we went with Petrelli,

157
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,960
Do we really know what we're buying?

158
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,610
Yeah. The future.

159
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,270
Someone who would owe you a real debt

160
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,950
In a very strategic place.

161
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,990
He's untested.

162
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,360
Some say unbalanced.

163
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,210
Well, he somehow got elected to congress

164
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,830
From the most populous district in the state.

165
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,730
And gave up his seat for personal reasons.

166
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,590
Do you really think the press is gonna look the other way?

167
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,370
If we point 'em in the other direction, yeah.

168
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,160
The Man was shot, died on the table,

169
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,150
And lived to talk about it.

170
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,230
Who does he credit with this little miracle?

171
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,080
God. God and politics.

172
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,180
Risky bedfellows.

173
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,470
Maybe so, but he is landing huge

174
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,600
On every Major media outlet in the country.

175
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,650
And the far right is loving him,

176
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,380
Which fits in nicely with your priorities.

177
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,700
Sure, they love him now.

178
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,110
You don't pay me for sex, governor.

179
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,520
I give that for free.

180
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,750
What you pay me for is my advice,

181
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,590
And my advice to you is to appoint Nathan Petrelli

182
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,420
The junior senator from the state of new york.

183
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,560
But then again, like I said,

184
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,030
It's your call.

185
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,200
We're ready, sir.

186
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,460
Reach out to him.

187
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,160
My flight leaves in an hour.

188
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,640
Ms. Strauss.

189
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,530
The governor hasn't Made his choice yet.

190
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,290
Oh, no, this isn't about filling the senate seat.

191
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,600
This is about you.

192
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,400
Me? There's no story with me.

193
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,600
Oh, I don't know.

194
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,190
Las vegas stripper becomes k street ice queen.

195
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,090
Big story.

196
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,790
You're kidding, right?

197
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,600
This isn't something

198
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,420
Some grammar school kid couldn't do with a laptop.

199
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,500
No, no, no, no, now I have my sources.

200
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,640
They tell me this is you.

201
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,930
Your sources are wrong.

202
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
Why would someone like me do something like that?

203
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,610
That's exactly what I want to know.

204
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,570
I'm running this story with or without your comment.

205
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,950
You run this story,

206
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,280
And I will hunt your ass down and destroy you.

207
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,510
A thief lives here?

208
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,510
So it would appear

209
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,640
It seemed to help last time I Made a tape.

210
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,550
But this time it's different,

211
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,210
Because I'm starting to wonder

212
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,030
If I'm even human anymore.

213
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,660
Because if you can't feel anything,

214
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,010
Do you still have a soul?

215
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,920
Will I live forever?

216
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,880
All of these questions, I just--

217
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,220
I need to prove that I'm still alive.

218
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,530
So I guess I should just start by saying

219
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,810
My name is Claire Bennet,

220
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,690
And this is attempt number seven.

221
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,640
What are you doing? What were you doing?

222
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,130
What does it look like? Trying to get hit by a train.

223
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,910
Just...

224
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,600
I just needed to feel something.

225
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,050
Hey, what happened to you?

226
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,670
Something awful.

227
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,760
And left me there.

228
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,240
He can heal now.

229
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,320
Yes. I saw it.

230
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,790
That wasn't supposed to happen.

231
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,990
What?

232
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,000
And what did he mean I was special?

233
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,650
Different.

234
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,280
What was he talking about?

235
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,730
What happened to you

236
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,760
Never should've happened, Claire.

237
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,760
It's my fault.

238
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,610
You can't save me all the time, Peter.

239
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,850
What happened was my fault.

240
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,170
I can't defend myself.

241
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,540
Yeah, I can heal,

242
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,920
But what kind of lame power is that?

243
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,830
I'm still just a victim.

244
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,870
You could teach me.

245
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,750
You learned how to use your power and you fought him.

246
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,510
Claire-- you could help me do that.

247
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,840
I can't! Not me, not now.

248
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
Why not? I don't understand.

249
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,090
Because something could go wrong

250
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,550
And it changes everything.

251
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,690
I need someone to help me.

252
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,540
It can't be me, Claire.

253
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,140
I have to be very careful what I say to you.

254
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,490
Why?

255
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,850
I'm sorry. I have to go.

256
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,540
For the salvation of my soul,

257
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,220
Give me true contrition

258
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,520
That I May day and night

259
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,660
By penance Make satisfaction for my Many sins.

260
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,550
Speaking of sin.

261
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,120
I'm sorry, the nurse said

262
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,710
That it would be okay if I stopped by.

263
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,220
Yeah, no, it's fine. I was just--

264
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm sorry, I'm a little bit surprised.

265
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,120
What are you doing here?

266
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,880
You're right. I should've phoned.

267
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,540
But I have quite a proposition

268
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,800
For you, congressman.

269
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,200
A proposition for me?

270
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,270
No, thanks.

271
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,760
I'm here on behalf of governor Malden.

272
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,160
You work for Malden.

273
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,620
I'm an advisor to the governor,

274
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,270
And we both agree that you would Make

275
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,810
An excellent choice to fill the seat

276
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,040
Left by Gerald Dickenson's untimely death.

277
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,520
Niki, it's me.

278
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,740
What the hell are you talking about?

279
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,030
Did you just call me Niki?

280
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,950
Yeah, Niki.

281
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,720
Come on, cut the crap.

282
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,920
Wait, do you think that you know me?

283
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,080
The word "biblically" comes to mind.

284
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,460
Niki, Niki Sanders. We met in vegas.

285
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,370
Had a pretty good time, if I recall.

286
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,750
I think you have me mistaken

287
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,430
For another woman, congressman.

288
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,460
My name is Tracy Strauss.

289
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,470
You're not Niki Sanders?

290
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,900
Not in the slightest.

291
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,840
And you're an advisor for the governor's office.

292
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,310
You can check me out if you'd like.

293
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,030
Okay.

294
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,080
And the offer.

295
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,060
The governor wants you, mr. Petrelli.

296
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,510
United states senator.

297
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,410
Think about it.

298
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,690
My cell number's on the back.

299
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,000
Interesting Meeting?

300
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,310
You.

301
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,770
You put Niki up to this?

302
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,980
That woman is not Niki Sanders.

303
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,330
That's Tracy Strauss, just like she said.

304
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,550
And the offer that she Made was quite legitiMate.

305
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,710
That's impossible.

306
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,640
That woman was Niki Sanders.

307
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,340
Perhaps there's a reason for that.

308
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,560
Someone so familiar-looking

309
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,080
Offering you the chance of a lifetime.

310
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,950
You should think about that, Nathan.

311
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,880
This is god's plan.

312
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,370
You don't know the first thing about god's plan.

313
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,620
Get out.

314
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,850
Nathan, i--

315
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,140
I need my sleep.

316
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,200
Dad, I've been thinking about it.

317
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
We don't need to look for Sylar.

318
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,590
He's on the hunt for powers.

319
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,230
On level five, he'd have an all-you-can-eat buffet.

320
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,560
Are you even listening to me?

321
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,920
Do you know, you are so sure

322
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,460
That I'm gonna disappoint you,

323
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,050
But when I prove you wrong--

324
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,150
Hey, you come to see me, baby, or what?

325
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,110
Screw you!

326
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,540
Elle, it's me!

327
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,540
Peter Petrelli! You've gotta let me out.

328
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,720
Please! Let me out of here.

329
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,950
Sylar's in the building. Let's go.

330
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,960
Daddy doesn't want me to leave my cell.

331
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,390
My dad's dead. Sylar killed him.

332
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,670
Hello, Noah.

333
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,260
Did you miss me?

334
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,570
I got that from your Claire.

335
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,960
You son of bitch!

336
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,900
Sylar! You bastard!

337
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,500
Leave her alone!

338
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,570
Sylar!

339
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,920
Look what your daddy used to be able to do.

340
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,740
You killed him.

341
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,170
I've killed a lot of people, Elle.

342
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,200
You're as much to blame for that as anyone.

343
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,160
Maybe even more so.

344
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,520
Elle, it's me, Peter. You okay?

345
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,930
Jesse, come on.

346
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,480
We gotta go before they lock us back up.

347
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,290
Where we going, Man? What's the plan?

348
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,440
All this stuff...

349
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,080
With super-speed, she is the world's greatest thief.

350
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,400
But where's the formula?

351
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,260
Huh, figures.

352
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,690
I've never been to France before. I wanted a souvenir.

353
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,880
And what's that supposed to mean? "figures."

354
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,190
You're treating me like some kind of criminal.

355
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,240
Tell me.

356
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,810
When I went to the future, I saw you.

357
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,160
You saw me?

358
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,910
The Future You.

359
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
And?

360
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,710
And you were a villain.

361
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,460
You killed me.

362
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,360
Killed you?

363
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,610
But... I am not a villain. I am your best friend.

364
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,300
Today Maybe. What about tomorrow?

365
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,140
It wasn't me.

366
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,770
It was a robot or something.

367
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,530
someone who could change their appearance to look like me.

368
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,060
Hey, you asked, I told you.

369
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,570
We need to set a trap.

370
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,260
That's what Batman always does with Catwoman.

371
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,700
A ransom.

372
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,130
Catwoman?

373
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,440
Now, what treasure...

374
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,430
does the world's fastest thief hold most dear?

375
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,080
"First place, hundred yard dash, twelfth grade."

376
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,020
How are you feeling?

377
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,880
Conflicted.

378
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,620
I've been asked to fill the seat

379
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,070
Left by senator Dickenson.

380
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,190
That's incredible.

381
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,580
Last time I was in a position of authority,

382
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,830
I nearly let Manhattan

383
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,500
Get wiped off the face of the Map.

384
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,040
I'm not really sure what that says

385
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,330
About my basic nature.

386
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,870
You're different now.

387
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,680
Everything's...Different.

388
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,760
Which is what I came here to talk to you about.

389
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,670
I need to show you something.

390
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,120
I'm from the future, Nathan.

391
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,630
I came back to kill you.

392
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,250
I was the one who shot you.

393
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,930
I've lived for years

394
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,610
In a world where people like us have been hunted,

395
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,650
Slaughtered, used,

396
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,510
All because of what you told the world

397
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,090
At that press conference.

398
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,720
I had to stop that from happening.

399
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,290
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to respond to this.

400
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,030
I came here to save the world,

401
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,630
But I don't think that I have.

402
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,110
You sure as hell stopped me from telling everyone.

403
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,850
I know, but the future is different now.

404
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,520
I've changed everything.

405
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,810
That's what I'm trying to say.

406
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,650
Why are you telling me this?

407
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,210
I need your forgiveness.

408
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,660
If you're from the future, then...

409
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,140
What do I do next?

410
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,150
Do I take the offer?

411
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,080
Do I become a senator?

412
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,080
You had a different future where I came from,

413
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,450
But I stopped that.

414
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,090
Now you're on the path to being the brother

415
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,620
That I always looked up to.

416
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,510
You're gonna Make the right choices.

417
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,840
Where are you going?

418
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,620
To set things right.

419
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,340
Tracy Strauss.

420
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,740
Hi, it's Nathan Petrelli.

421
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,350
Listen, I've, uh, I've given it a lot of thought,

422
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,590
And I've decided.

423
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,420
I'd be honored to serve

424
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,110
As junior senator from new york.

425
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,660
The governor will be very pleased.

426
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,300
But it's on one condition.

427
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,180
I want you on my staff.

428
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,080
I'm not going into this without an ally.

429
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,680
If that's what it takes.

430
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,260
We'll Make an announcement

431
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,500
At the press conference tomorrow.

432
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,700
The whole dog and pony.

433
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,890
I assume you're well enough.

434
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,110
I'll be fine.

435
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,090
Gotta run. Expect a call shortly.

436
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,940
Congratulations, senator Petrelli.

437
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,640
Hey, story runs tomorrow.

438
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,270
Sure you don't want to Make a comment?

439
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,490
I turn it in in 15 minutes.

440
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,260
That would be a serious mistake.

441
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,340
This woman in las vegas, Niki Sanders,

442
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,860
Looks like me.

443
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,890
She's not me.

444
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,030
Is that all you've got?

445
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,710
You want to tell me that's not you, huh?

446
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,170
I got this from a friend of mine

447
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,330
Who works in security

448
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,700
At the corinthian hotel in las vegas.

449
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,240
Now that is you.

450
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,770
And if I'm not mistaken,

451
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,170
That's congressman Nathan Petrelli,

452
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,720
Rumored to be governor Malden's choice

453
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,930
For Dickenson's senate seat.

454
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,490
Comment?

455
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,810
It's not me.

456
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,180
You know, I was thinking about running with something like

457
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,270
"k street ice queen heats up las vegas

458
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,460
Sleeping with a senator and a congressman."

459
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,100
You can't run this story.

460
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,920
Hey. No!

461
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,290
Quite a little mess you've Made here.

462
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,570
Mrs. Petrelli?

463
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,320
What are you doing here?

464
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,580
With your father's death,

465
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,170
The chain of command falls to me.

466
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,090
My father's body isn't even cold yet.

467
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,800
This is how things work around here, Elle.

468
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,290
You should know that.

469
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:32,050
And I'm starting by Making a few changes.

470
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,870
I--we caught Sylar.

471
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,160
Good for you!

472
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,510
Your electrical outburst also shut down the grid,

473
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,970
Letting out a dozen inmates

474
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,600
Who are just as bad or worse.

475
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,400
And Noah Bennet is gone too.

476
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,240
I know.

477
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,800
And I'm gonna get right on that.

478
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,950
No, actually, you won't.

479
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,030
I'm sorry?

480
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,960
We only kept you around this long

481
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,430
At your father's insistence.

482
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,590
He's been protecting you for a long time.

483
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,800
And circumstances have obviously changed,

484
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,600
And we won't be needing your services anymore.

485
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,430
But...

486
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,470
I have worked for this company my entire life.

487
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,450
What am I supposed to do now?

488
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,980
I suppose you'll have to get yourself another life.

489
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,300
You understand your part of the plan,right?

490
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,410
It sounds dangerous. Does Batman put Robin in danger...

491
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,840
when he sets a trap for catwoman?

492
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,120
Sometimes. To teach him a lesson.

493
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,240
Stop punishing me for something I haven't done yet

494
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,750
Don't kill me and I won't punish you.

495
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,940
I'm not going to kill you!

496
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,390
What are you doing here?

497
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,490
You have something of mine,

498
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,340
And now I have something of yours.

499
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,950
All right, time warp, give it back.

500
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,730
You are not faster than me, nemesis.

501
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,110
Oh, yeah?

502
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,820
Here, kitty-kitty!

503
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,510
I am offering you a trade.

504
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,520
All right.

505
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,480
But my boss isn't gonna be very happy about this.

506
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,380
Your boss?

507
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,000
You didn't look behind the Mona Lisa?

508
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,500
You know, I was just heading out

509
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,920
To get the other half of this.

510
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,500
Good luck.

511
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,210
But what if she hurts me?

512
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,230
She is not going to.

513
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,740
This is a trade

514
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,100
Between two honorable people.

515
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,610
Wrong.

516
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,410
You can't stop me. I'm taking them both.

517
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,650
I can't let you do that.

518
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,550
That formula could destroy the whole world.

519
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,650
Is it worth the sacrifice of your friend?

520
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,810
No, stop!

521
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,510
Did you do this?

522
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,830
Did you cut me?

523
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,600
No! It was her! She's the villain. She cut you.

524
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,090
And you let her!

525
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,200
Don't worry, the plan is solid.

526
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,580
You mean the one that just failed?

527
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,440
I put a tracking device under the ribbon of the medallion.

528
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,120
When?

529
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,700
I didn't see you do that?

530
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,630
I stop time and teleport.

531
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,880
I do Many things that you don't see.

532
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,350
Why didn't you tell me the whole plan?

533
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,380
Because I didn't trust you.

534
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,640
Enough,Hiro! I'm just Ando.

535
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,150
I've got her!

536
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,960
We'll get the other half of the formula before she does.

537
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,320
Come on, Ando. The game is afoot!

538
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,590
What's happening to me?

539
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,580
Oh, god, I'm going insane.

540
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,890
That plant there.

541
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,750
It will give you water.

542
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,860
Oh! Thank you, turtle!

543
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,060
You saved my life.

544
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,870
Why are you talking to a turtle?

545
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,810
Thank you.

546
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,550
You come from america.

547
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,330
Yes. How did you--

548
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,860
You know britney spears?

549
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:14,590
No.

550
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,090
She's from america.

551
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,510
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,980
America's a big place.

553
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,850
Yes.

554
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,890
Africa is too.

555
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,840
Africa.

556
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,190
Come.

557
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,860
We walk.

558
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,840
Walk? Walk?

559
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,840
Yeah, hmm.

560
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,460
Your cell. I gotta use your cell.

561
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,410
I gotta call home.

562
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,860
No service here.

563
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,160
Should've gone with Sprint.

564
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,140
Listen to me.

565
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,790
It's very important that I get back to america.

566
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,900
You gotta help me get back.

567
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,270
No, you will stay.

568
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,280
You must spirit walk for Many miles.

569
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,050
Spirit walk? No, no, no, no!

570
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,820
No, I was sent here against my will.

571
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,120
I have to find out why.

572
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,720
Be patient, Park-man.

573
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,540
How do you know my name?

574
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,500
It's not right that you're here.

575
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,970
Not right at all.

576
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,530
Tells me the future is not as I have painted it.

577
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,440
The future?

578
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,730
Wait, are you the one

579
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,030
That painted that rock back there?

580
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,750
How do you know the future?

581
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,150
Keep walking, Park-man.

582
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,460
Walking.

583
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,200
Dad?

584
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,520
Thank god you're home.

585
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,690
I was so worried about you.

586
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,650
You all right?

587
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,840
No.

588
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,410
But I'm better now.

589
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,620
You're not staying, are you?

590
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,520
Something's happened.

591
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,310
Something that I can't ignore.

592
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,450
You Made the right choice, my boy.

593
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,690
Taking your rook?

594
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,960
Taking the senate seat.

595
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,420
It's gonna be different this time.

596
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,500
I'm not gonna let you Manipulate me.

597
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,370
I'm the one Making the decisions.

598
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,340
I'm the one in control.

599
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,270
Of course you are.

600
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,560
Mr. Petrelli, it's late. You need your rest.

601
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,460
Can't you see I'm in the middle

602
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,700
Of a heated game?

603
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,280
You're playing yourself?

604
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,460
I'm obviously playing mister--

605
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,000
She can't see me, Nathan. No one can.

606
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,510
Except you.

607
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,950
Did I not mention that?

608
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,050
Now, whose turn was it again?

609
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,680
Some people are just evil.

610
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,420
That's their nature. His name is Knox.

611
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,190
He can absorb a person's fear

612
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,680
And turn it into his own strength,

613
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,320
Incredible strength.

614
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,650
This guy is a flame thrower.

615
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,490
We call this guy the German.

616
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,230
He can control Magnetic energy.

617
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,940
And this guy, Jesse.

618
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,900
You don't want to know.

619
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,180
Let's just say they could destroy us all.

620
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,500
You know, even before you were ever born,

621
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,550
I've been finding these people

622
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,520
And locking them away so they can't do any harm.

623
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,210
And now a dozen of them have escaped.

624
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,010
They're out there.

625
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,440
And they will kill, and they will terrorize,

626
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,080
And they will conspire,

627
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,150
And they will cause unimaginable destruction

628
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,040
To the world.

629
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,550
They're villains, Claire.

630
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,880
And right now I'm one of the only people

631
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,180
On the planet that knows enough to stop them.

632
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,690
That's why I can't stay.

633
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,380
Then let me come with you.

634
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,630
I can be your partner.

635
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,410
Claire-- I can help.

636
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,070
I helped save new york city!

637
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,850
You were there. You saw it.

638
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,860
I was willing to shoot Peter with your gun

639
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,360
When you couldn't do it.

640
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,650
That's exactly the kind of situation

641
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,020
I can't put you in again.

642
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,680
I am doing this so you don't have to.

643
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,700
And what if somebody comes here?

644
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,320
What if somebody comes after me and mom and Lyle?

645
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,920
I've thought about that.

646
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,930
And I've called someone to help out while I'm gone.

647
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,350
What's going on?

648
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,850
You have a lot of questions, Claire.

649
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,550
As adoptive parents there's only so Many we can answer.

650
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,390
Mom?

651
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,060
She's here to Make sure you all stay safe.

652
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,800
You're in good hands.

653
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,240
Sylar.

654
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,120
What are you doing here?

655
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,890
Where is he? Where'd they go?

656
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,960
Escaped.

657
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,550
That's not possible. That never happened.

658
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,510
It's the butterfly effect, Peter.

659
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,680
Just like I told you.

660
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,700
I put him here to keep him safe.

661
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,290
I put him in the body of the guy in that cell

662
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,540
Right there!

663
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,470
Jesse?!

664
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,460
You're gonna figure out where my son is

665
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,990
And you're gonna bring him back here.

666
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,100
You understand me?

667
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,430
And then go the hell back where you came from!

668
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,670
This is Nathan Petrelli. Leave a message.

669
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,090
Nathan, I don't even know if you're alive or not.

670
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,990
But if you get this, you need to look out

671
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,770
For someone who looks just like me.

672
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,740
He's got a scar on his face,

673
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,930
And I think it's me from the fut--

674
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,570
Come on. Our ride is here.

675
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,840
What are you doing?

676
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,730
Just having a little fun, that's all.

677
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,220
You coming?

678
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,980
It's now or never.

679
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,130
My sons have been such a disappointment.

680
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,080
But you, I can give you

681
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,200
What all boys crave from their mothers.

682
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,970
Inspiration

683
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,930
And guidance.

684
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,030
Comfort.

685
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,230
Isn't that right, Gabriel?

686
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,080
My name is Sylar.

687
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,260
And you are not my mother.

688
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,740
But I am, dear.
