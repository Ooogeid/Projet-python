00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,720
<i>Previously on</i> Heroes...

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:07,678
<i>Ordinary people accross the globe
discover extraordinary habilities.</i>

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,379
<i>And their destiny
is bringing them together.</i>

4
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:11,826
- Dad
- Hiro!

5
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:17,368
<i>The cop who hear thought,<i>

6
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:20,301
<i>uncovers a mystery
he didn't want to solve.<i>

7
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:22,988
There's something
we need to talk about.

8
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,550
<i>I thought I'd been so careful.</i>

9
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:27,608
<i>God, he knows about the affair...
the affair...</i>

10
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,987
<i>And an extraordinary new hero
is discovered.</i>

11
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:34,321
- Let her go.
- You let her go or I shoot you.

12
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:37,784
Do you have any idea what would happen
if you did that? Because I don't.

13
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:40,802
<i>As an artist paints the impossible...</i>

14
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,674
Look around you all of these paintings!

15
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:44,622
Everyone of them has come true.

16
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,822
<i>The face of evil is after him.</i>

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,214
- Bring him in.
- Isaac Mendez?

18
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:51,741
<i>And a son turns his back</i>

19
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:53,680
<i>on his father's search for heroes.</i>

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,088
My father's ashes.

21
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,470
No closer to undestanding
my father's research.

22
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:00,846
<i>And now,</i> Heroes <i>continues...</i>

23
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:04,331
<i>The earth is large.</i>

24
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,431
<i>Large enough that you think
you can hide from anything.</i>

25
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:09,881
<i>From fate. From God.</i>

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,112
<i>If only you found a place
far enough away.</i>

27
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,041
<i>So, you run...</i>

28
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,025
<i>...to the edge of the earth.</i>

29
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:33,039
<i>Where all is safe again,
quiet and warm.</i>

30
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:36,637
<i>The solace of salt air.</i>

31
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,671
<i>The peace of danger left behind.</i>

32
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,264
<i>The luxury of grief.</i>

33
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:58,027
<i>And maybe for a moment...</i>

34
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:01,870
<i>you believe you have escaped.</i>

35
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,507
Mohinder.

36
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,797
You mustn't look back, Mohinder.

37
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:15,498
Your father's moved on to the next life.

38
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:33,321
Welcome back.

39
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:36,673
I thought I'd clean you up a little bit.

40
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,272
You've had a rough couple of days,

41
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,259
but you're doing great.

42
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:48,627
You'll be completely clean in no time.

43
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,465
And you're sure I'll still be able to...

44
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,104
paint?

45
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,783
After I teach you, yes.

46
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:57,458
The drugs were just a facilitator.

47
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:58,760
We're gonna help you.

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,567
That mural on the floor?

49
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:04,462
We're not gonna let that happen.

50
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,469
You seem pretty sure.

51
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,691
I am pretty sure.

52
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:14,637
Because?

53
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:17,132
Because I went
through the same thing myself.

54
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:02,862
All right.

55
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,609
You need anything else, sheriff?

56
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,066
Lloyd?

57
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:11,129
Gun to shoot Will Shortz.

58
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:13,599
Let me see.

59
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:15,734
Ghandi burial ground, 11 letters.

60
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:17,490
Something...

61
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:19,014
Ganges, maybe?

62
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:21,017
Kanyakumari.

63
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:24,258
K-a-n-y-a,

64
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,320
and then you got the rest right there.

65
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,963
How the hell did you know that, Charlie?

66
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:30,939
That one of the stops on your trip?

67
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:32,953
Oh, trip around the world's pricey.

68
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:35,981
Right now, I can only make it
as far as Oklahoma city.

69
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:39,323
Who won the academy award
for best actor in 1981?

70
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:40,994
She's not Google, Lloyd.

71
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:43,085
Henry Fonda. "On Golden Pond".

72
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:45,189
You know, I preferred
Dudley Moore in "Arthur",

73
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:46,694
but if you really wanna test me,

74
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:49,522
you oughta ask me if I remember
your credit card numbers.

75
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,062
Hey, anything looking good, guys?

76
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,697
Everyseeng good o-looking.

77
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:29,498
You two are a long way from home.

78
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,750
We don't get a lot of tourists out here.

79
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:32,947
Turisto?

80
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:34,374
How you know we turisto?

81
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:36,296
It's just a guess.

82
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:38,698
What's that on your jacket?

83
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:40,473
Bachigai.

84
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,809
That means,
I don't belong here," right?

85
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,005
You know Japanese?

86
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:47,634
Well, I got this Japanese phrase book
for my birthday about six months ago,

87
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,585
and I started
poking through it last week.

88
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,497
You learned all that
from a book in just one week?

89
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,059
Very good memory!

90
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,853
Yeah, I remember lots and lots.

91
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:13,777
It's just something that my brain
started doing lately.

92
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:15,494
Whether I want it to or not.

93
00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:17,878
So what'll it be?

94
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:19,171
You pick!

95
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:22,064
Someseeng delicious for me.

96
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,118
And for my friend,

97
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,886
he needs food for fatto, fatto.

98
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,075
Well, I got just the thing.

99
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,271
One chilaquiles,

100
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,679
and one cottage cheese plate

101
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:34,895
coming right up.

102
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:53,730
Subtitles by www.sub-way.fr

103
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:19,414
Please tell me you're not
going back there again.

104
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,087
There are no answers for me there.

105
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:23,360
I belong here.

106
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,532
I'm glad to hear you say that.

107
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,504
You think I was a fool to go.

108
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:29,665
I think you had to.

109
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:33,005
It's an odd country, America.

110
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,574
Everyone there seems so lonely.

111
00:07:36,094 --> 00:07:37,252
Including me.

112
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,820
I'm not sure what I accomplished
by going there.

113
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,061
Only seeing things I wish I'd never had.

114
00:07:48,537 --> 00:07:51,760
Mira came to pay her respects
to your father, Mohinder.

115
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,075
Maybe there's more waiting here for you

116
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:57,120
than just your professorship.

117
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,588
The new semester begins...

118
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,672
on Monday.

119
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,426
I didn't cancel your classes.

120
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:11,252
You can move into
your father's old office.

121
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:13,471
Thank you.

122
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:18,829
Mira.

123
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:21,396
I wasn't sure you'd speak to me
at the funeral.

124
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:25,235
I didn't want to take that chance,
so I left.

125
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:27,280
I won't lie to you.

126
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:29,096
I was surprised to see you there.

127
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:30,929
Or anywhere, for that matter.

128
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:32,916
I said some terrible things to you.

129
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:35,731
About your father, about his theories.

130
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:38,141
But now that he's dead, I feel...

131
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,074
What's done is done.

132
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:42,690
Is it?

133
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,457
Your mother tells me
you're not returning to New York.

134
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,261
New semester starts next week.

135
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:49,689
My life is here.

136
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:55,297
I've been promoted at the company.

137
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,966
Head of all genetic research.
Can you imagine?

138
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:01,550
Good for you.

139
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:02,939
No, good for you.

140
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:05,369
It's the sort of cutting-edge science

141
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,686
we used to talk about
late into the night.

142
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:11,502
The world's worst pillow talk,

143
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:12,780
I'd say.

144
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:16,569
I was hoping
I could convince you to come in

145
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:18,508
for an interview with the partners.

146
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,795
Only I'd have to know
that your father's work,

147
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,955
all of his theories,

148
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,559
would stay right where they are.

149
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,218
Packed away in that box.

150
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:30,289
I don't expect an answer right now.

151
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,004
But you will think about it, won't you?

152
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:43,598
We didn't say hello.

153
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:46,839
Hello, Mira.

154
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:48,401
Hello, Mohinder.

155
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:57,956
I need you to handle this.

156
00:10:58,592 --> 00:10:59,924
I'll give you one hour.

157
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:04,767
You're an idiot, Parkman,
do you know that?

158
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:05,830
Good morning to you, too.

159
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:08,615
You think I wouldn't find out
about you assaulting a fellow officer?

160
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:10,536
I didn't assault him. I just hit him.

161
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:12,215
This is why I don't like needing people.

162
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:13,758
9 times out of 10, they let you down.

163
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,087
How optimistic you are!

164
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,373
- Just an observation.
- And how is it of your concern?

165
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:18,859
Because it was a stupid rookie move,

166
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,788
and you could've jeopardized
my investigation.

167
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,188
How serious is this?

168
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:24,925
Are you getting suspended?

169
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:26,526
I'll work it out.

170
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:28,512
Did he deserve it?

171
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,772
Yeah, he deserved it.

172
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,224
- Is he talking?
- Nope.

173
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:44,632
And he's got one hour

174
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:46,974
before homeland security
sends him down the rabbit hole

175
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:48,363
as a suspected terrorist.

176
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,395
Terrorist?
We both know he's not a terrorist.

177
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:53,157
- His wife was dying. He lost control.
- Of what?

178
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:56,058
This guy puts out
1,800 curies of radiation

179
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,695
without ever coming in contact
with nuclear material.

180
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:00,939
We still don't know how that's possible.

181
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:04,197
You know, three months ago,
my job made perfect sense to me.

182
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:05,949
And then I pulled the Sylar case.

183
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,470
Crime scenes with no fingerprints.

184
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,678
Bodies frozen, brains removed.

185
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,376
And now this guy.

186
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,038
That's two people...

187
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,276
make that three people

188
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,265
who can do things I just can't explain.

189
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,315
What're you saying,
you think I'm like them?

190
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:21,878
I don't know what I think.

191
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,546
But if we're gonna find Sylar,
I need answers.

192
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,791
I have no idea how this happened.

193
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,208
Well, then,
I guess that just leaves Ted here.

194
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,140
What's this?

195
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:33,701
Detects radiation levels.

196
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:35,820
As long as that's dark green,
we're good.

197
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,695
Okay, what's the bad color?

198
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:39,784
Not green.

199
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,346
Perfecto!

200
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:48,716
You ready for disco.

201
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:50,973
I got it right?

202
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,455
Almost.

203
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,995
Don't let me off easy, now.

204
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,150
You learn very fast.

205
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:19,227
Yeah, lately,
I sorta remember everything I read.

206
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,522
It's kind of a skill, I guess.

207
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,809
My skill much more complicate.

208
00:13:23,924 --> 00:13:25,236
Oh, yeah?

209
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:26,625
What can you do?

210
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,305
I can teach japanese to anyone.

211
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:50,422
Sweet...

212
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,756
means nice.

213
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:54,683
Cute.

214
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,827
That's not in book.

215
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:09,300
I like the way your cheeks wobble
when you concentrate.

216
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:15,849
Sorry. Someone's Denver omelet's up.

217
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:19,188
Yep?

218
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:37,730
They won't even let me go
to my wife's funeral.

219
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,653
All I wanted was to be left alone.

220
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,521
We need you to answer
a few more questions.

221
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:46,479
You can't get your partner here
to look inside my head?

222
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,367
We need to have it on the record.

223
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,454
You burnt that doctor to the bone.

224
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,537
Probably gave your wife cancer.

225
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:54,013
How'd you do it?

226
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,274
If you don't let us help you,

227
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:59,628
they're gonna take you away,
and nobody'll listen to you.

228
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,862
It doesn't matter.

229
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:03,425
Nothing matters.

230
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:05,817
I killed my wife!

231
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:10,156
Audrey.

232
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,760
You know, just lock me up.

233
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,321
Execute me.

234
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,284
- Leave me the hell alone!
- I wish we could, Ted.

235
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:19,990
Look, I don't know anything
about any nuclear material!

236
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:21,557
You know what? Just relax.

237
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,056
Do you want me to be the terrorist ?

238
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:26,080
Do you want me to be the bad guy?
Fine, I'll blow this place apart.

239
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:32,297
Just stop!

240
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,528
Do it.

241
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,686
Do it!

242
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,390
- I know what you're going through.
- Yeah, sure, you do.

243
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:41,106
- Yeah, like hell you do.
- Come on, Ted!

244
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:42,650
You've seen what I can do.

245
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,696
Something is happening to me, too.

246
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:49,134
Ted, I was able to read
your wife's dying thoughts.

247
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:52,125
We're just trying
to understand what it is.

248
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:53,754
Come on, Ted. Relax.

249
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,581
Come on. Just take me back.

250
00:15:57,642 --> 00:15:58,665
Take me back to...

251
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,531
To when this all started, okay?

252
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:01,631
Just...

253
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,078
start from the beginning.

254
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:04,398
Good.

255
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:07,349
<i>Blacked out and when I woke up,</i>

256
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:09,606
<i>everything started dying.</i>

257
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,171
You blacked out.

258
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:16,440
How long were you out for?
Were you drinking?

259
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:19,152
When you came to,

260
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:22,410
did you have bruises on your arms?

261
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,439
<i>I'll do you one better.</i>

262
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:34,951
What's the matter, Parkman?

263
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:26,616
- I'm going.
- Don't walk away!

264
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:29,384
It doesn't matter what you think.
I'm not asking your opinion.

265
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,477
How could I have forgotten!
You never have before.

266
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,907
- Why should now be any different?
- It is my life!

267
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:35,987
I'm going, and that's final.

268
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,963
Has it never occurred to you that
your actions could affect anyone else?

269
00:17:38,998 --> 00:17:40,815
I don't have time
for anyone else's feelings.

270
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,719
Clearly!

271
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,494
The world needs to know
about my findings.

272
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,877
- That's all that's important.
- The world doesn't care.

273
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,541
No one at the university cares.

274
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,333
You're becoming a laughing stock.
I can't cover for you any longer.

275
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,690
I'm not asking you to.

276
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:56,107
How will you support yourself?
What will you do for money?

277
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,531
- Oh, I'll get by.
- How?

278
00:17:57,628 --> 00:17:59,656
Do you know what doctors do
in the United States?

279
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,084
They drive taxi cabs.

280
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:04,258
It is one thing to publish a book
in the comfort of the university.

281
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,145
It is another
to leave everything behind,

282
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,831
your wife, your family, your job,

283
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:10,156
chasing a theory that is pure fantasy.

284
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,738
It's a fool's errand.

285
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:18,286
We'll see who will be the fool,
won't we?

286
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,803
Yes, I guess we will.

287
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:39,668
Mohinder is right.

288
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:42,678
I am abandoning my family, my job.

289
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:44,414
You are.

290
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,630
But I know you, Chandra,

291
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:48,234
better than you know yourself.

292
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:50,684
You will not stop thinking of this
if you don't go.

293
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:53,621
It will consume you and, eventually,

294
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,035
all of us with it.

295
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,507
He'll hate me for it.

296
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,726
I'm not sure that he doesn't already.

297
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,596
I should try to stay for his sake.

298
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:06,850
Why?

299
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,566
He will never take her place
in your eyes.

300
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:12,264
That has always been the case.

301
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,110
Who are you?

302
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,263
What do you want?

303
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:05,938
I was in, Kansas a couple months back.

304
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,812
I'd just made a big sale
to the university hospital.

305
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,413
Dialysis machines.

306
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:16,746
Commission was gonna give Karen and me
enough money to...

307
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:23,162
I went to the...

308
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,038
the hotel bar.

309
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:26,776
Buy everybody a few rounds.

310
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:28,639
There weren't many people there.

311
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,298
A couple from Wyoming.

312
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,040
Some professors.

313
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,463
A student from, Haiti.

314
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:37,883
The next thing I-I know,

315
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,582
I'm waking up in my car.

316
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:41,660
It's two days later,

317
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:44,021
and I'm in Tempe, Arizona.

318
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:47,694
These weird cuts and bruises
all over me.

319
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,962
A couple of days later,
I start to notice things.

320
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:53,487
I'd buy my wife flowers,
and they'd wilt.

321
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,934
Okay, what about your health?

322
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,662
Were you sick? Do you have headaches?

323
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:00,039
Headaches.

324
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:01,467
But...

325
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:04,740
Karen.

326
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:08,522
The doctor said
she had radiation poisoning.

327
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:10,413
From you?

328
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,841
I was killing her.

329
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:14,522
Are there any other bodies out there
we don't know about?

330
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,721
I'm just saying.

331
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,576
This is not his fault.
He's just trying to figure this out.

332
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:23,917
Look, the same thing happened to me.

333
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,412
Okay, I blacked out. I lost two days.

334
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,286
- You should've told me about this.
- I should've done a lot of things.

335
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:32,133
Up until now, I haven't told anyone.
Not even my wife.

336
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:34,626
And now
I can't stop hearing people's thoughts.

337
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:35,860
It's painful.

338
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:38,054
I'm hearing things
that I should not be hearing.

339
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:39,251
Like what?

340
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:41,668
Things that could ruin lives.
Things that...

341
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,340
could end marriages.

342
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,110
The guy that you described, the student.

343
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:54,078
He was, uh, Haitian.

344
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:55,931
Big guy? Bald?

345
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,663
I'm telling you,
I think I saw this guy right...

346
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:02,779
- right before I blacked out, too.
- What are you guys talking about?

347
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,381
A Haitian guy?

348
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,656
These things that we can do,
they're not normal.

349
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:08,598
We were cut. We were injected.

350
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:10,507
Blacked out,
who knows what they did to us?

351
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:12,050
Or how they changed us.

352
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,389
- Time's up.
- What?

353
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:18,020
- Just 2 more minutes.
- And you, you shouldn't even be here.

354
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:19,463
Your badge has been suspended.

355
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,648
Did he tell you
where the nuclear material is?

356
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:23,845
- Move it.
- He's coming with me.

357
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:26,460
- No, you can't take him right now.
- Yeah, they can.

358
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:28,968
Find the Haitian.

359
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,775
Find him!

360
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:37,884
- Get him back in here.
- I can't.

361
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:39,513
What do you mean?
You heard him.

362
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:41,598
He's gonna help me find out
what happened to me.

363
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:43,431
Why did you lie to me
about being suspended?

364
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:44,665
Okay, so I left that part out.

365
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:46,498
But you came to me
and asked for my help.

366
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,545
And I come running to you
every single time.

367
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,850
So now I'm asking for your help.

368
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:51,183
All right, get him back in here,

369
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:53,898
- so I can talk to him!
- I'm sorry. It's out of my hands.

370
00:23:12,387 --> 00:23:14,485
- That's good.
- Mr. Bennet.

371
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:16,002
Rufus.

372
00:23:16,735 --> 00:23:18,741
I've got next month parking sticker.

373
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,196
Just need to sign for it.

374
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:22,289
I'll take care of that later, Rufus.

375
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:26,726
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

376
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:08,989
How is he doing?

377
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,411
Heroin's out of his system.

378
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:11,838
His body doesn't want it anymore,

379
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,247
but his mind still does.

380
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:14,925
- Coherent?
- Very.

381
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,028
You ready to meet him?

382
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:34,875
This is Mr. Bennet,
the man I told you about.

383
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,537
Hello, Isaac.

384
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:41,667
Drawing anything interesting?

385
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:48,581
- It's nothing.
- Oh, you know that's not true.

386
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:52,273
You have the hability
to paint the future. That's something.

387
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,214
Something very important.

388
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,484
Feels like a curse.

389
00:24:57,523 --> 00:25:00,205
No, it's a blessing.
Don't let anybody tell you differently.

390
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:05,580
We're gonna help you understand that.

391
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:09,829
I'm grateful you're helping me.
I'm just not sure why...

392
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:11,266
you're doing it.

393
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:13,236
To be 100% honest with you...

394
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:16,792
I need your help.

395
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:22,869
How we doin'?

396
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,031
Oh, my god!

397
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:36,980
Charlie...

398
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,420
She's dead.

399
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:57,052
I know you miss him.

400
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,903
And I know you feel guilty, too.

401
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:01,714
Don't.

402
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:03,219
I had a dream last night.

403
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:05,403
You and father
were talking before he left.

404
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:07,249
In it, you persuaded him to go.

405
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:10,675
- It was just a dream, Mohinder.
- No, I need to know if it was true.

406
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:18,415
Your father and I
were married for 33 years.

407
00:27:18,494 --> 00:27:20,055
- That is not an answer.
- Yes, it is.

408
00:27:20,104 --> 00:27:21,521
A marriage doesn't last that long

409
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:24,336
without allowing the other person
to be who he has to be.

410
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:27,144
But how could you allow him
to abandon everything?

411
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:28,440
Just like that.

412
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,499
I'm afraid that answer is not as easy.

413
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,758
In the dream, you said

414
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,274
that I could never take
the place of her.

415
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,735
Who did you mean?

416
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,312
I suppose it's time that you knew,
now that your father's gone.

417
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,206
You had a sister.

418
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:58,804
A sister?

419
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:02,381
Her name was Shanti.

420
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:05,950
And, she was five years old
when she died,

421
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:07,802
two years after you were born.

422
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:09,573
Well, why didn't I know this?

423
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:13,083
Because it was too painful
to talk about,

424
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,263
especially for your father.

425
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:17,904
He loved her so much,

426
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:20,427
he was afraid
that you would compare his love.

427
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:24,075
From the moment she was born,

428
00:28:24,433 --> 00:28:26,690
he was convinced that she was special.

429
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:32,359
And she was special.

430
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:39,188
These dates...

431
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,784
Suicide bomber, 15 people dead.

432
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,719
Train derailment, 9 dead.

433
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:45,147
Earthquake, 81.

434
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:49,575
This girl, the one you've painted here,

435
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:51,547
and here,

436
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:52,821
and there...

437
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:56,023
she's my daughter.

438
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:58,485
My Claire.

439
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:01,668
This man here...

440
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:03,699
goes by the name of Sylar.

441
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,829
He's gonna kill her tomorrow night
at her homecoming game.

442
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,026
- Why?
- Because she's special.

443
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:10,327
Like you.

444
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:13,018
- And that makes her a target.
- Like me.

445
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:15,261
You're not the only one
with special abilities, Isaac.

446
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,657
There are others. Sylar is killing them.

447
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:19,528
One at a time.

448
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:24,176
If you know who he is,
then why can't you stop him?

449
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:25,841
Because nobody knows where he is.

450
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,462
I need your help!

451
00:29:27,847 --> 00:29:30,126
I need you to paint this painting.

452
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:33,197
I'm sorry. I've been trying. I can't.

453
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:35,840
Not without the drugs.

454
00:29:37,895 --> 00:29:38,937
Fine.

455
00:29:47,962 --> 00:29:52,403
I promise we will help you
use your abilities without this,

456
00:29:52,461 --> 00:29:55,116
but right now, there just isn't time.

457
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:57,036
I'm fighting to get my life back,

458
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:59,080
and you want me to just throw it away.

459
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:05,349
You know...

460
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,258
For many years now,
a number of us have been

461
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:12,721
tracking, locating, monitoring

462
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,129
people like you.

463
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:16,802
Sometimes the process goes smoothly,
as in your case,

464
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:17,960
and other times...

465
00:30:18,376 --> 00:30:20,518
Let's just say
some people misinterpret our motives,

466
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:21,676
and then it can go...

467
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,110
very wrong.

468
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:25,910
14 years ago,

469
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:27,974
there was just such a case,

470
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:30,633
which, sadly, ended in a death.

471
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:36,066
The woman left behind a baby girl
who had no one to take care of her.

472
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:39,067
My wife and I
had been having a hard time...

473
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:42,863
conceiving a child
of our own at the time.

474
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:46,937
And it was like...

475
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:51,027
god had reached down
and given us a miracle.

476
00:30:57,886 --> 00:31:00,317
This is my daughter we're talking about.

477
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:03,956
I'm begging you.

478
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:12,753
Let me try one more time.

479
00:31:13,177 --> 00:31:14,410
Without it.

480
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,848
Who are you?

481
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:38,532
What are you doing here?

482
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:44,201
Hey, wait!

483
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,802
Stop! Come back here.

484
00:31:53,315 --> 00:31:56,619
<i>I got a pickup
at 59th and Broadway to JFK.</i>

485
00:32:04,044 --> 00:32:05,279
Father!

486
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,181
Father!

487
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:27,485
Dad!

488
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:32,782
- Honey, is everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

489
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,788
Can't a girl just visit her dad at work?

490
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,503
You never visit me at work.

491
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:39,011
Okay. I'm busted. I have an emergency.

492
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:41,986
- A paper emergency.
- A paper emergency?

493
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,692
Ms. Roberts says we need a banner

494
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:45,817
over the trophy case,
and Jackie was all,

495
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:49,164
"we don't have paper that big.
They don't make paper that big."

496
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:52,000
So I thought
I'd stop by and try to be a hero.

497
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:55,735
Well, if it'll make you a hero

498
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:57,496
and maybe
knock Jackie down a few notches,

499
00:33:57,543 --> 00:33:59,674
we might be able
to find something that'll work.

500
00:33:59,731 --> 00:34:01,120
Best dad ever.

501
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,399
I'm sorry, Mr. Bennet.

502
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,627
We just have a little situation.

503
00:34:11,273 --> 00:34:13,561
You know what?
The sample room is right down there.

504
00:34:13,562 --> 00:34:14,793
You take anything you need.

505
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,099
Thanks, dad.

506
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,422
First door on your left.

507
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:22,727
I'm sorry. I didn't know she'd be here.

508
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,192
So what's the problem?

509
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,257
It's not working. He can't do it.

510
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:31,222
He tried. He's just not there yet.

511
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,241
We tried his way. Now we do it mine.

512
00:34:33,297 --> 00:34:36,438
He has worked so hard to get clean.
You can't ask him to do this.

513
00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:38,043
I'm not going to ask him.

514
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,253
You are.

515
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:46,551
- No, you can't make me do that.
- You knew this was a possibility.

516
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:49,982
You said when we started
that I would never have to do it again.

517
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,905
- You promised me.
- I know what you think.

518
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:53,567
Who do you think taught you?

519
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:56,976
Do you even remember
what you were when I found you?

520
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:04,075
You're the easy way.

521
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:07,639
I think we both know the hard way.

522
00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:07,619
She say anything?
Sounded like she was scared?

523
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,574
- She seemed very nice.
- She was.

524
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,007
Too nice... to die like that.

525
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:18,307
Head ripped open.

526
00:36:20,818 --> 00:36:22,820
I ain't never seen anything like it.

527
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:27,586
We're very sorry.

528
00:36:28,377 --> 00:36:29,780
You all stick around.

529
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:31,929
Need to take your statements.

530
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:36,567
What is that? Ensenada?

531
00:38:42,298 --> 00:38:43,822
Pam Auden called...

532
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:47,137
to ask me why you punched Tom McHenry.

533
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,196
I told her you didn't.

534
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:51,790
Did you?

535
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,323
Yeah, I punched him.

536
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,693
<i>He knows.</i>

537
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:01,717
<i>Damn it, I knew it.</i>

538
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:03,863
You punched a superior officer?

539
00:39:03,902 --> 00:39:05,889
That has to have
some kind of repercussions.

540
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:06,984
He may outrank me,

541
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:09,150
but "superior's"
taking it a little too far.

542
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,248
I got one month's suspension.

543
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,158
- No pay.
- Jesus, Matt.

544
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,894
Something happened...

545
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,727
between me and Tom.

546
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,658
You slept with him.

547
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:39,147
Yes.

548
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:53,271
Is it over?

549
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:54,824
Yes.

550
00:39:58,316 --> 00:39:59,565
Are we?

551
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:03,629
I don't know.

552
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:16,067
Yeah, it's Matt.

553
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,225
He's gone.

554
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,382
What?

555
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:19,675
<i>Ted.</i> He escaped.

556
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:20,814
Watch out!

557
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,281
Do you hear me?

558
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:25,516
Yeah.

559
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:27,156
Yeah, I heard you.

560
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:37,587
<i>You can run far.</i>

561
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,927
<i>You can take your small precautions.</i>

562
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:42,349
<i>But have you really gotten away?</i>

563
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,891
<i>Can you ever escape?</i>

564
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:57,960
<i>Or is the truth</i>

565
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:01,634
<i>that you do not have the strength
or cunning to hide from destiny?</i>

566
00:42:04,804 --> 00:42:05,961
What?

567
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,640
Nothing.

568
00:42:13,402 --> 00:42:14,965
<i>But the world is not small.</i>

569
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:16,801
<i>You are.</i>

570
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:37,827
<i>And fate, can find you anywhere.</i>
