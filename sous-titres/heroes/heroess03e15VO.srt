1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:02,336 
We're gonna make an
unexpected landing.

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:02,794 
Claire?

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,473 
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,724 
Den Mother 31 going down!

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,476 
Bearing 2-4-5 at 9-8

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,060 
off Walnut Ridge Vortac.

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,561 
{y:i}We have lost pressure.
{y:i}Mayday, may--!

8
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:26,777 
Did I wake you?

9
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,820 
No, not yet.

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,696 
Well, it's not good.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,448 
Claire got on board somehow,
and all hell broke loose.

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,407 
No, the pilot managed
an emergency landing,

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,075 
but...

14
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,534 
the plane broke apart
when it hit the ground.

15
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,118 
Some of the prisoners escaped.

16
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:47,130 
Wait!

17
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:47,881 
Shh! Quiet.
- Parkman?

18
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,262 
Hiro, how did you get here?

19
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:53,679 
Did you get
your powers back?

20
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,471 
No, I am powerless.

21
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,138 
The hero's path
is never easy.

22
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,473 
If we stay here,
we're dead.

23
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,140 
We have to keep moving.
- Yes! Save the others.

24
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:57,766 
{y:i}Where are they?

25
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,600 
I saw them running.
Peter Petrelli, the cheerleader.

26
00:00:58,684 --> 00:00:59,017 
It is our duty
to save them!

27
00:00:59,101 --> 00:00:59,476 
Don't you get it?

28
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,185 
Powers alone aren't gonna cut it
with these guys.

29
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:00,686 
They were ready for us.

30
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,353 
All of us.
- Then what do we do?

31
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,813 
The sun will be up soon.

32
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,313 
{y:i}It seems like there's
{y:i}more trees and cover that way.

33
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,606 
Come on.

34
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,274 
{y:i}Matt?

35
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:05,899 
Matt!

36
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,150 
Where are you going?

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,780 
I can't believe
this is happening.

38
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,281 
My father, your brother.

39
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:12,781 
It's not just Nathan.

40
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:13,198 
He's got the whole government.
We need to hide.

41
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:13,699 
Come on.

42
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,074 
I can't let you do that,
sweetheart!

43
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:14,700 
You both need to come
with me.

44
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,117 
{y:i}Oh, let me go!

45
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,867 
Let me go.
This is insane!

46
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:16,785 
What happened to you?

47
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,327 
How could you be
a part of this?

48
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,453 
It's much more complicated
than you know.

49
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,162 
You gonna shoot me,
Bennet?

50
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:19,871 
In front of your daughter?

51
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,042 
Dad.

52
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:24,668 
What are you doing?

53
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,169 
{y:i}I got three on the hill.

54
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:27,254 
Run, Peter.

55
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,300 
You're never gonna get away
with this.

56
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:31,967 
The crash--
people are gonna ask questions.

57
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,926 
You're wrong.

58
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,635 
Nobody's gonna know a thing.

59
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,386 
What did you do?

60
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,610 
I got to the site
as soon as I heard.

61
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,653 
It was a nightmare.

62
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:52,404 
It's totally out of control.

63
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,530 
It wasn't just the crash.

64
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,157 
Danko, he was in my face from
the second I hit the ground.

65
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:57,868 
Why the hell did you authorize
an air strike?

66
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,535 
It's the standing protocol,
Senator.

67
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,036 
I don't need
your permission.

68
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,578 
Permission?

69
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,037 
This is my operation.

70
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,495 
Not out here it isn't.

71
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,079 
I've got civilians at risk.

72
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:01,580 
The second that crash happened,

73
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,456 
your prisoners
were redesignated "terrorists."

74
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,290 
You mean targets?

75
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:03,749 
Shoot to kill?

76
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,458 
That's your tactical,
elegant solution?

77
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,167 
These people of yours
are dangerous.

78
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,959 
These people are going
into custody.

79
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:06,501 
We're not assassins.

80
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,377 
You have a rabid dog,
you don't put a chain

81
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:07,919 
around its neck
and pray for miracles.

82
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:08,420 
You put it down.

83
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,212 
When did the rules
of engagement change?

84
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,547 
This isn't some exercise
in tactics, Senator.

85
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,340 
Your daughter turned
a simple transport flight

86
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,049 
into a national security
emergency.

87
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,133 
I'll deal with Claire.

88
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,134 
You do that.

89
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,010 
And I'll do my job.

90
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:22,476 
Peter!

91
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,061 
Tracy, come on.

92
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:24,853 
We gotta keep moving.
- I can't do this.

93
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,896 
What are you talking about?
- I'm not some thing.

94
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,688 
My life was finally getting back
to normal.

95
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,314 
Okay, stop, stop.

96
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,106 
You stay here,
and they will catch you.

97
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,523 
Now come on.

98
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:28,940 
Why?

99
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,399 
Why would Nathan do this to us?

100
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:29,816 
I don't know.

101
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,400 
But I'm gonna find
a way to stop him.

102
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,109 
This is a nightmare.

103
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,152 
Okay, you stay here,
and he wins.

104
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:32,944 
You come with me,
and you can fight.

105
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:33,987 
Come on.

106
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,283 
Maybe these people
can help us.

107
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,835 
What is he doing?
We're not thieves.

108
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,378 
The trance is compelling him.

109
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,128 
Let's just let him go.

110
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:54,841 
What should we do?

111
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:55,759 
Come on.

112
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,805 
Focus, Parkman.

113
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,390 
Put these on.

114
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,557 
We need to blend in.

115
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,392 
I'll take their address.
Send money later.

116
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,652 
Nemesis.
- It's me.

117
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,194 
How did you find me?

118
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,278 
Hiro told me about
your "super secret" hideout.

119
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:15,779 
Of course.

120
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,822 
Best way to keep a secret:
Tell everyone.

121
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,239 
Is something wrong?

122
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:17,906 
It's Matt.

123
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,615 
He didn't come home
last night.

124
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,324 
He didn't call.

125
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,659 
He always calls.

126
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,952 
I didn't know who else
to turn to.

127
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:22,452 
Wait.
Hiro's missing also.

128
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:22,953 
He's kidnapped.

129
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:23,370 
Maybe same thing happen to Matt.

130
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:23,954 
I've got to find him.

131
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,830 
I think he was taken
to Arkansas.

132
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,288 
How do you know that?

133
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,164 
Because Hiro and I have
GPS trackers.

134
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:26,706 
Of course you do.

135
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,374 
He's near Russellville,
Arkansas.

136
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,166 
I was trying to buy
a ticket to fly there.

137
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,167 
Why fly when you can run?

138
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,252 
Huh?
Whoa!

139
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:31,920 
You lost your ability?
How?

140
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,213 
It is complicated.

141
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:33,630 
And unfortunate.

142
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,089 
From what I've heard,

143
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:34,714 
it would have been
quite useful today.

144
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,298 
It wasn't my fault.

145
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:35,966 
Now even Ando has a power.

146
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:36,550 
He has no idea how to be a hero.

147
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,426 
Well, then your friend Ando
should stay

148
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,176 
as far away
from here as possible.

149
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,802 
And so should you.

150
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,178 
You think I should leave?

151
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:40,804 
Find a policeman
and turn yourself in.

152
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,471 
No.

153
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,097 
I must help my friends.

154
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,556 
It is my duty.

155
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,098 
Not anymore.

156
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,765 
If you tell them
your powers are gone,

157
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,182 
they may let you go.

158
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:44,599 
Surrender?

159
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,642 
Never.
I am a warrior.

160
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,435 
This is not your fight
anymore, Hiro.

161
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,018 
Save yourself.

162
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,270 
While you still can.

163
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,273 
Hey.

164
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:51,815 
{y:i}When did you learn to draw?

165
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,232 
I didn't.

166
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:52,816 
It just happened.

167
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,525 
Well, do you have any idea
what they mean?

168
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,025 
Nemesis?

169
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,152 
No...

170
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:55,986 
That's Daphne at the crash site.

171
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,611 
{y:i}Matt, that's not possible.

172
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,112 
She wasn't even on the plane.

173
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,196 
This is India?

174
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:58,613 
{y:i}You're right.
{y:i}Right, this is nuts.

175
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,156 
I don't want this.

176
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,073 
Matt, they will find us here.

177
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:00,490 
We have to go.

178
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,408 
If these visions are real,

179
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,200 
{y:i}and Daphne's in trouble.

180
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:02,993 
I gotta get back.

181
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:03,869 
That's insane.
Those men'll kill you!

182
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,744 
I'm not gonna leave her!

183
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:09,833 
Taxidermy.

184
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,917 
Never really liked that old man.

185
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:11,376 
That's right.

186
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,751 
Take a good look.

187
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:12,252 
'Cause that's your future

188
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,253 
if you keep getting
into fights at school.

189
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,379 
I just hope a night
in juvy taught you something.

190
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,297 
Yup.
Food's great.

191
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,964 
Don't push it, Luke.

192
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:16,882 
Not after yesterday.

193
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,340 
Just tell me why.

194
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,467 
Why'd you have to hit that kid?

195
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,010 
What's that mean?

196
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:20,635 
What the hell's wrong with you?

197
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,428 
A shrug.

198
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,137 
Is that your answer for everything?

199
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,096 
He called you a whore.

200
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:24,973 
Get inside.

201
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,765 
{y:i}Authorities are still
not confirming reports

202
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,766 
{y:i}that an aircraft came down
{y:i}last night in rural Arkansas.

203
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,350 
I can't believe
I left that on.

204
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,310 
...Military aircraft
or cargo jet

205
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,102 
{y:i}plummet rapidly across the sky...

206
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,020 
Call the police.

207
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:30,479 
{y:i}... saying that there were

208
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,313 
no scheduled flights
in the area.

209
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,065 
Several eyewitnesses claim
to have seen...

210
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:34,816 
Mm! Mm!

211
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,901 
{y:i}National Guard training
{y:i}exercise in the area...

212
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,070 
You're either Mary Campbell

213
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:39,779 
or "current occupant."

214
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,743 
We've been waiting for you.

215
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,452 
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

216
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,620 
Special Agent Simmons says hello.

217
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,579 
Oh!

218
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,246 
{y:i}His people trained him very well.

219
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:48,955 
{y:i}He hardly flinched at all

220
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:49,873 
when he lost a finger or two.

221
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:50,916 
{y:i}Trouble is he has information
{y:i}that I need,

222
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,292 
so you are gonna help me
loosen his tongue.

223
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,418 
{y:i}Sick freak.

224
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,461 
You're gonna torture me
in front of them?

225
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,505 
No.

226
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,714 
I'm gonna torture them

227
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,673 
in front of you.

228
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,466 
Oh! Oh...

229
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,763 
Oh.
Arkansas.

230
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,764 
Hey, thank you for doing this.

231
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,473 
Don't thank me yet.

232
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,015 
Soldiers.

233
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,016 
{y:i}Hey, is that

234
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:08,558 
the cheerleader?

235
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:10,810 
Hiro.

236
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:11,978 
Hang on.

237
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,354 
You're supposed to kill Hiro
in the future, right?

238
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:12,979 
Yeah.

239
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,522 
Well, then he can't be dead.

240
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,189 
{y:i}And if he's okay,

241
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:14,981 
maybe Matt's okay too.

242
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:15,690 
Yeah, we must be sneaky
when we look for them.

243
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,233 
Yeah.

244
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:16,983 
That's why you're staying here.

245
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:17,776 
Right.
Wait, what?

246
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,652 
Wait!

247
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:19,819 
So Hiro's alive because I kill him?

248
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:20,904 
That's right. I kill him.

249
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,696 
Yes, he's alive.

250
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,449 
{y:i}Roger that, base.

251
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,617 
Lost Agent Marquette...

252
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,493 
Wait, wait,
I got a man down.

253
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,327 
Man down.

254
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:33,917 
Nice.

255
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,501 
What are you doing?

256
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,126 
I'm gonna go back.
Find Nathan.

257
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:35,627 
Disguised as a guard?

258
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,253 
Where'd you see that?
An old movie?

259
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:36,670 
They saw you on the plane.

260
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,128 
{y:i}I don't care
{y:i}how many powers you had.

261
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:37,587 
One.

262
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,046 
I don't know why.

263
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:38,755 
I can only hang on
to one at a time.

264
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,339 
If I pick up a new one,
I lose the old one.

265
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,423 
You're gonna go up
against all of 'em?

266
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,007 
You don't even know
if Nathan's here.

267
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:41,424 
Oh, Nathan's here.

268
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:41,967 
He's probably sweating bullets.

269
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,634 
Trying not to show it.

270
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,510 
This whole program was his idea.

271
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,135 
It means that his ass is on the line.

272
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:44,970 
You go back, they'll kill you.

273
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:45,762 
You got a better idea?

274
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,471 
Maybe.

275
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,430 
I know Nathan too,
and not like a brother.

276
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,098 
I know the way he thinks.

277
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:48,890 
It's 'cause you slept with him.

278
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:49,808 
And I think the same way.

279
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:51,434 
What are you doing here, Dad?

280
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:51,977 
Doing my job.

281
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,394 
You still haven't told me

282
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,061 
how you were on that plane,
Claire.

283
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,145 
I was grabbed by your goon squad.

284
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:54,771 
Dad number two tried
to send me home,

285
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,647 
but I don't walk out
on my friends.

286
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,523 
Or help people sick enough
to do something like this.

287
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,566 
You have no idea
how big this mission is

288
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,400 
and what these people will do
once you're on their radar.

289
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:58,900 
Don't.

290
00:05:58,984 --> 00:05:59,734 
I'm not gonna be
your excuse anymore.

291
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:00,360 
{y:i}You know these guys.

292
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:00,777 
{y:i}Peter,

293
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,611 
Matt,
Hiro Nakamura.

294
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:01,987 
Of all people,

295
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,487 
you chain them up like animals.

296
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,321 
I have made
certain arrangements,

297
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,406 
arrangements which will
guarantee your safety

298
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:04,906 
and the safety of this family,

299
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,366 
but these abilities have got
to be controlled.

300
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,534 
I have an ability.

301
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,118 
Does that mean
that I have to be controlled?

302
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:08,577 
No, Claire, you're missing--

303
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,452 
I'm one of them.

304
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,328 
And so is he.

305
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,288 
Transportation's set.

306
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,372 
Young lady, you're headed
back to Costa Verde.

307
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:12,872 
So that's it?

308
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:13,373 
I just dance away to college,

309
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,165 
pretend everything's
all hunky-dory?

310
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,333 
Something like that, yeah.

311
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:16,918 
So I get a pass.

312
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,044 
And everyone I know just disappears.

313
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:18,962 
Except for Senator Skyboy,
of course,

314
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,963 
because he's got everything
under control.

315
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,715 
I'm walking a fine line here.

316
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,465 
Balancing the security
of this country

317
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,300 
against a serious threat.
- Stop.

318
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,718 
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

319
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,302 
Either one of you.

320
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,263 
Stay put for just a minute.

321
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,140 
We talked about this
when I came on board.

322
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:30,640 
And I will take orders,

323
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,433 
and I will do
what has to be done,

324
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,142 
but you gotta put
a leash on your hunter.

325
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,268 
I haven't forgotten
what we've discussed.

326
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:33,685 
Don't worry about him.

327
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,603 
He's useful.

328
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,103 
Until he's not.

329
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:36,646 
Hi.
- Claire!

330
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:37,897 
Damn it!

331
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,273 
I want her found.

332
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:38,690 
Don't forget our arrangement.

333
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,107 
Keep her out of this.

334
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,233 
You keep her out of this.

335
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,359 
Daughter or not,
she is running out of favors.

336
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,527 
I wouldn't let anything
happen to her.

337
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:42,902 
What would your hunter do

338
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,029 
if he knew you were one of them too?

339
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,656 
My mistake?

340
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,408 
That I expected
my people to act responsibly?

341
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,327 
Nobody could have anticipated
what happened on that hillside.

342
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,039 
Wait, Matt!
We can't go down there.

343
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:54,664 
This is the place
from the drawing, I know it.

344
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,041 
This is where she gets shot.

345
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:56,583 
Matt.
- Ando!

346
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,042 
How'd you get here?

347
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,500 
The speedster brought me.

348
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,209 
We're looking for you and Hiro.

349
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:58,918 
She was here.

350
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,045 
Hey.

351
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:02,631 
Oh, good.

352
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,423 
Ando.
- Hiro.

353
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,050 
Something brought them together
at the crash site.

354
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:05,759 
I mean, I imagine some of them
had the misguided idea

355
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,509 
that they could still stop
this whole thing.

356
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,010 
Guys.

357
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,636 
We really gotta get outta here.

358
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,470 
She's right.

359
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:08,970 
We gotta move.

360
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:09,596 
I can't carry all these
people at once.

361
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:10,430 
{y:i}You don't worry.

362
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:10,930 
I'm just gonna do
a quick recon.

363
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:11,556 
Find the safest way--
- Daphne!

364
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,099 
Daphne!
Matt!

365
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,100 
Danko's men totally overreacted.

366
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:14,893 
Run! Go!

367
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,769 
Once they opened fire,
they were all out for blood.

368
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,353 
When they went after Claire,

369
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,145 
that's when I knew
Danko had lost control.

370
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:17,854 
No!

371
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,688 
Parkman must have got
inside the shooter's head.

372
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,565 
Forced him to turn
on his own men.

373
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,024 
It became a bloodbath.

374
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:31,660 
Agent Simmons.

375
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,828 
Seems fatigued.

376
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,832 
You really need
to pay attention.

377
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,917 
Your father's in custody,
you sick piece of crap.

378
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,293 
Another lie.

379
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,044 
Well, it's time to get started.

380
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,796 
Where to begin?

381
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,758 
Mommy.

382
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,134 
Why are you doing this?

383
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:48,927 
What did we ever do to you?

384
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:50,428 
Nothing.

385
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:50,929 
Wrong place, wrong time.

386
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,888 
I could have been a flood
or a tornado.

387
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,681 
There's really no difference,
actually.

388
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,640 
How about you, Luke?
Any thoughts?

389
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,476 
Oh, I sense some dysfunction

390
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:56,893 
in the Campbell household.

391
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,894 
You bastard,
you better leave him--

392
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,063 
But I understand.

393
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,814 
Single mom,
troubled teenage son,

394
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,940 
and judging from that pathetic
alimony check I found,

395
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:02,941 
I'd say dad took off
quite some time ago.

396
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,608 
Mm!

397
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,234 
What are you doing to her?

398
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,068 
{y:i}Only what you wished
{y:i}you could have done years ago.

399
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,944 
No--stop.

400
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,778 
You're lying.

401
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:07,946 
Agent Simmons,
Mary is losing

402
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,738 
her Patience.

403
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,572 
Isn't it your job to protect her
from monsters like me?

404
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,365 
He's not going to talk.
Let her go.

405
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:10,865 
You said that
'cause you care, kid?

406
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:11,574 
Or is that just
a preconditioned response

407
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,158 
'cause mommy drew
the short straw?

408
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,160 
What do you know about me?

409
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:17,956 
Mom's a drone,
and dad abandoned you.

410
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:18,540 
I know that rage, Luke.

411
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,332 
And I know that deep down,

412
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,417 
You'd like nothing more
than to see her blood

413
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,000 
all over the living room floor.

414
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,044 
Go to hell!

415
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,924 
Well, well.

416
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,633 
It's a small world.

417
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,427 
You and I really need to talk.

418
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,097 
So many good men,
devoted soldiers, all dead.

419
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,514 
I don't care who your daddy is.

420
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,140 
This is your fault.

421
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:35,932 
My fault?

422
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,433 
You're the ones who started it.

423
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:36,975 
You hunted us.

424
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,017 
I read your file, cheerleader.

425
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,685 
I know how you heal.

426
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,394 
Like that Sylar.

427
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,019 
I'm nothing like him.

428
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:40,979 
One shot
to the back of the head.

429
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,813 
That's all it takes.

430
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,939 
I told you to stay away
from my daughter.

431
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:43,398 
{y:i}Claire!

432
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:45,734 
Get her outta here.

433
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,110 
I'll take her home.

434
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,073 
Bennet.

435
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:52,949 
He would have done it.

436
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:53,408 
He would have pulled
the trigger.

437
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:53,867 
In a heartbeat.

438
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,659 
Once they target you,
they won't stop.

439
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,785 
They'll go after me,
your mom, Lyle,

440
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,203 
whatever it takes
to bring you down.

441
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,496 
What are we gonna do?

442
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,497 
Right now...

443
00:08:59,581 --> 00:08:59,873 
Nothing.

444
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,790 
Go home.

445
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:01,791 
Live that normal life
you always said you wanted.

446
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,292 
What about Peter?

447
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,460 
The others?

448
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,963 
I'll do what I can.

449
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,465 
Come on.

450
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,262 
How many more casualties
are we gonna take

451
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:14,804 
before you get it?

452
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,014 
I thought I told you
to stand down.

453
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,098 
You've been giving a lot
of orders today, Senator.

454
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,099 
Is there something
you'd like to talk to me about?

455
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:18,975 
How'd you think
this was gonna go?

456
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,642 
That these people of yours
would lie down?

457
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,059 
Give up?

458
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,144 
Treat us as liberators?

459
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,103 
Right now, you're
the President's golden boy.

460
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,062 
You pull this off,
you can write your own ticket.

461
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:23,938 
The downside is, it goes south,

462
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,190 
you can kiss
your political career good-bye.

463
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,316 
Go back to playing house
in your mama's mansion.

464
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,734 
We're all replaceable.

465
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,693 
Some of us more than others.

466
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,028 
Excuse me.

467
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,445 
Petrelli.

468
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,237 
Nathan, it's me.

469
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,407 
One second.

470
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,784 
You're calling the shots.
For now.

471
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:36,493 
And I'll clean up your mess
this time,

472
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,535 
{y:i}But if your affection
{y:i}for these animals

473
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,620 
{y:i}costs me any more men.
{y:i}- They're not animals.

474
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,120 
People.

475
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:39,913 
Say it with me.

476
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,580 
I don't want to have
to tell you again.

477
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,332 
Tracy.
{y:i}- I heard.

478
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:42,957 
So that's the kind of killer
that you're working with now?

479
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:43,374 
{y:i}You need to give yourself up
{y:i}now.

480
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,209 
I can promise
you won't get hurt.

481
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:44,626 
{y:i}Your promises haven't been
{y:i}worth much lately.

482
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,502 
You'll have to do better.

483
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,127 
{y:i}This isn't a negotiation.

484
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,003 
You don't have anything
I want.

485
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,922 
I have Peter.

486
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,340 
Okay, I'm listening.

487
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,132 
I want my old life back.

488
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:51,633 
I give you Peter,

489
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,592 
my part in this gets written off
as never happened.

490
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,093 
I go back to my apple martinis
and overpaid lobbyists.

491
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,136 
How do you want to do this?

492
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,678 
{y:i}Mile marker 47.

493
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,304 
{y:i}There's an old historical site
{y:i}near the road.

494
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:56,721 
{y:i}Three hours.

495
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,263 
And come alone.

496
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:57,931 
If I even see
one pair of boots...

497
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,765 
no tricks.

498
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,183 
You can trust me, Tracy.

499
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,436 
He's on his way.

500
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:08,733 
Show me.

501
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,077 
Some stuff melts.
Some burns.

502
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,744 
Water boils.
Kinda like a microwave.

503
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,537 
That's very impressive.

504
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,288 
You should see what happens
around pacemakers.

505
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,292 
You know, I heard you
at the door.

506
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,001 
That kid you hit at school,
he didn't call your mother

507
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:27,460 
a whore; you lied.

508
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,253 
{y:i}You do that a lot.

509
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,379 
Why do you care?

510
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:29,838 
Because you live a half a block
down from my father.

511
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:30,338 
If that's a coincidence,

512
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:30,755 
God's improved
his sense of humor.

513
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,506 
You're wrong.

514
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,215 
I'm no one.

515
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,758 
I'm not.
I don't have any friends.

516
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,300 
Shoplift crap I don't even want.

517
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:34,926 
Sell my Ritalin to meth mouths
at school.

518
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,760 
{y:i}Luke, stop--

519
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,719 
No, no, don't worry.

520
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,637 
He's lying.
At least, about the drugs.

521
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,429 
She hates me, you know.

522
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,222 
No.

523
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:39,806 
{y:i}I don't.

524
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,390 
Well, I don't even need
an ability

525
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,099 
to know that that's a lie.

526
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,018 
{y:i}She can see it in you,
{y:i}Luke.

527
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,477 
{y:i}What you can do.

528
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,353 
{y:i}No, she doesn't know about it.

529
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,020 
{y:i}I'm not talking about the power.

530
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:46,688 
{y:i}I'm talking about you.

531
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,273 
This is what scares them,
what's in here.

532
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:48,773 
The will.

533
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,233 
{y:i}I love my son.

534
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:50,775 
I just want him to be happy.

535
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,818 
Well, he's not.

536
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:53,987 
You lie, Luke,
because you'd rather be

537
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,529 
anyone else other than yourself.

538
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,238 
{y:i}That's why you got
{y:i}into that fight.

539
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:55,864 
That kid could be dead
with your ability,

540
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,447 
{y:i}and the only reason he's alive
{y:i}is cause of your kindness,

541
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,282 
{y:i}and that scares you.

542
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,074 
{y:i}I want you to tell me
{y:i}about this power

543
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:58,741 
{y:i}and everything you know
{y:i}about the man down the street.

544
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,326 
Wait.

545
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,244 
Stop.
Aah!

546
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:01,995 
No, Luke, stop!

547
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:03,329 
{y:i}Stop it!

548
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,038 
Luke, stop!

549
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:04,831 
You killed him!

550
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,124 
He was gonna--

551
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:06,749 
He was gonna save us!

552
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,419 
What are you?

553
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,799 
Hey.

554
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:15,675 
Hey, take me with you.

555
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,010 
What, did you hear me?

556
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,052 
Yes.
- And so what?

557
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:18,845 
So you just killed the one shot
I had at finding my old man.

558
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,304 
He was gonna shoot you
in the head.

559
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:19,721 
I mean,
I coulda just let him.

560
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,847 
And I let you live.

561
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,639 
Which is kind of a big deal
for me.

562
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,057 
I could tell you more
about your father.

563
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:23,641 
Yeah, so could a milk carton.

564
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,350 
I'm not that interested.
- Look, I can't stay here.

565
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,226 
With her.
With this.

566
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,144 
I mean, you're the only one
who understands what it's like.

567
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,562 
I know where he is.

568
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:29,856 
Well, you're not lying.

569
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,607 
Which only means
you think you can find him.

570
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691 
And I know
why you're looking for him.

571
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,361 
Tell me.

572
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,613 
Because you're just like me.

573
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,405 
Trying to figure out
why you are the way you are,

574
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:37,864 
and in this whole hellish world,

575
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,198 
Your dad might be the only answer.

576
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:40,950 
You take me with you, I'll walk
you right up his driveway.

577
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:42,952 
Does your mother have a car?

578
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,914 
Not anymore.

579
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,380 
What do I do
if something goes wrong?

580
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:54,839 
I'll be right here.

581
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,423 
Get close to him, okay?

582
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:55,882 
Use your powers.

583
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,424 
God, what if I kill him?
- You're not going to.

584
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,008 
{y:i}Just disable him.

585
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:57,592 
{y:i}We get him,
{y:i}we use him as leverage

586
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,134 
{y:i}against the government.

587
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,135 
Look, he's not my brother
anymore, Tracy,

588
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,011 
and he's not your boyfriend.

589
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,720 
You understand?

590
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,387 
Yeah.
- Go.

591
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,097 
Tracy.

592
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:03,473 
Nathan.

593
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:03,973 
I came alone.

594
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,308 
Just like you asked.

595
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,059 
Where's Peter?

596
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,060 
I've got him.

597
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,394 
I told him
that you offered us amnesty.

598
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,228 
He'll come out
when he knows he's safe.

599
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,313 
It's like I told you.

600
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,689 
You deliver me Peter,
I give you your life back.

601
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,190 
{y:i}You'll be surrounded
{y:i}by your friends,

602
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:12,774 
{y:i}You can play house
{y:i}with the Governor,

603
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,483 
and nobody gets hurt.

604
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,235 
You must know
I'd assume this was a trap.

605
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,695 
{y:i}But I came anyway, Tracy,
{y:i}for you.

606
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,363 
And the offer still stands.

607
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:18,821 
You deliver me Peter,

608
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,281 
you get to go free.

609
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:20,907 
You're serious?

610
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,659 
Tracy, I am not the devil
you think I am.

611
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,284 
Someone like you I can trust.

612
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:23,868 
You and I, we think alike.

613
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:24,744 
Peter's...

614
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,411 
he's unpredictable.

615
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,371 
{y:i}He's got it in his head
{y:i}he's gonna save the world,

616
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,038 
{y:i}And that is not
{y:i}how it's gonna end.

617
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:27,455 
{y:i}He is gonna end up

618
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,957 
getting all of you killed.

619
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,457 
All of you.

620
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:32,752 
What are you saying
to her, Nathan?

621
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,461 
{y:i}What, are you telling her
{y:i}that I'm unstable?

622
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,337 
Crazed?

623
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,213 
You lock me up,
you fix everything,

624
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,673 
You call off your dogs.

625
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,799 
I got Peter.
You take the girl.

626
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,967 
You said you were alone.

627
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:39,676 
I know.

628
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:42,720 
How many times are we gonna do this?

629
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,137 
As many times as it takes.

630
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:43,721 
Do it.
Take the shot.

631
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,305 
I don't have it.
{y:i} Back 'em off.

632
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,098 
I can't do that.
Back them off.

633
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:45,515 
It's over, Pete.
Give up.

634
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:45,932 
Take the shot.

635
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,516 
No, this is the beginning.

636
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,141 
Take the damn shot.

637
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,019 
Take her.

638
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,021 
Nathan, don't do this!

639
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:52,438 
{y:i}Get your hands
{y:i}off of me!

640
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,231 
No!

641
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,148 
Nathan!

642
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:54,816 
{y:i}Look at me!

643
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,650 
Don't do this!

644
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,192 
What the hell was that?

645
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:56,859 
I told you I didn't have it.

646
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,237 
I saw it.

647
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,946 
You had Peter cold.

648
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:00,697 
Yes, I did.

649
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,489 
Thank you.

650
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,747 
You know me.

651
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,581 
You know
I didn't want any of this.

652
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:11,624 
Containment,
protecting them from themselves,

653
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,250 
that was always my goal.

654
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,042 
Now Peter's loose,
Parkman, the others.

655
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:13,626 
Both sides have tasted blood.

656
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,210 
The next move is theirs.

657
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,010 
Thank you.
I will send money for gas.

658
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,430 
Toss your cell phones.

659
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:25,847 
This is the last time
we get together

660
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,264 
using these things.

661
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:26,681 
We find each other,
so can they.

662
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,098 
I figure we have 15 minutes.

663
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,598 
Understood.

664
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,141 
You need to see these.
Where'd you get these?

665
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,058 
{y:i}Matt.

666
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,018 
{y:i}He drew them
{y:i}right after the crash.

667
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:30,393 
He has Isaac's gift.

668
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,352 
{y:i}I recognize this building.

669
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,103 
It's the Divya Velukkai
in New Delhi.

670
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,146 
India?

671
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,188 
The warrior must have
his sword.

672
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:34,939 
I must regain my powers.

673
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:35,982 
Help defeat this menace.

674
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:36,899 
It is my destiny to go there.

675
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,567 
It is?

676
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,028 
Then perhaps it's ours
to seek justice.

677
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:40,778 
I don't want it.

678
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,280 
What they're doing to us
isn't justice.

679
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:42,989 
It's just stupid.
It's blind fear.

680
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,781 
Well, if you don't want to see
them punished, what do you want?

681
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,490 
I want 'em to pay.

682
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,116 
{y:i}For Daphne.

683
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:45,783 
Matt, that's not us.
That's not you.

684
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:46,868 
Let's get one thing straight.

685
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,869 
Our lives as we knew them
are over.

686
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,536 
We can't go back
to anything that we knew.

687
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,245 
Then what do we do?

688
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:49,996 
We bring the fight to them,

689
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,580 
With everything we got.

690
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,330 
{y:i}It won't be easy.

691
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,081 
Credit cards,
bank accounts, they're gone.

692
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:52,957 
Homes are gonna be watched.
Can't trust the phones.

693
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,083 
We gotta find a way
to defend ourselves.

694
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:54,709 
{y:i}We leave everything.

695
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,376 
{y:i}we do what it takes
{y:i}to survive.

696
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,169 
Things we can't even imagine.

697
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:56,794 
Remember,

698
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,378 
{y:i}they're gonna come
{y:i}for us.

699
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,005 
And when that day comes,
we have to be ready.

700
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,268 
You've been awfully quiet
since you got back.

701
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,562 
Just tired.

702
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,021 
It was a hard trip.

703
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:15,980 
{y:i}I bet.

704
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:16,731 
Two days of scouting colleges,

705
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,940 
{y:i}all those sorority mixers.

706
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,734 
Your dad said you begged him
to stay another day.

707
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,402 
{y:i}So, any decisions?

708
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,781 
I just, um...

709
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,699 
I was thinking of maybe staying
close to home for a while.

710
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,533 
Getting a part-time job.

711
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,409 
Oh, my God.

712
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,202 
I would love that.

713
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,203 
I really missed you.

714
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,037 
The house would be empty
without you.

715
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,221 
Claire's home. She's safe.

716
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:48,596 
We both know Peter.

717
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,222 
Sooner or later,
he's gonna come to you.

718
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,807 
When he does...

719
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,100 
can I count on you
to do the right thing?

720
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,601 
That's not why you called,
Nathan.

721
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,852 
I can hear it in your voice.

722
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:55,937 
You suddenly see
how this could all end badly,

723
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,938 
and you're looking for reassurance.

724
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,648 
Maybe even absolution.

725
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,565 
But I'm not giving it.

726
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,608 
You pushed me aside
and went to the President

727
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,818 
because you thought
your team could handle this.

728
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,736 
And I suggest
you do exactly that.

729
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:08,825 
They're ready for you,
sir.

730
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:18,876 
Tracy.

731
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,460 
Nathan.

732
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,545 
God.

733
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,379 
Get me out of this.

734
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,338 
Can't do that.

735
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,713 
Why?

736
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:23,881 
It's too late.

737
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:24,757 
Why are you doing this?

738
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,716 
What I have come to realize
is that these powers

739
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,134 
just lead to chaos.

740
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:26,926 
Good people,
through no fault of their own,

741
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,385 
cannot control it.

742
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,302 
It just leads to disaster.

743
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,054 
You son of a bitch.

744
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,097 
Maybe that's what you tell yourself

745
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,223 
So that you can sleep at night.

746
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:32,807 
But this is about you.

747
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,641 
Your ambition.

748
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,600 
It's all you are,
Nathan.

749
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,518 
It's all you ever were.

750
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:37,687 
Try not to fight it.
It'll be easier.

751
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,563 
You're one of us.

752
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,106 
You're one of us, Nathan!
{y:i} Hold her down.

753
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,357 
You're one of us, Nathan!
You're one of us!
