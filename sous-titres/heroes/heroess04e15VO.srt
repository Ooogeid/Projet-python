00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,085
Previously on <i>Heroes</i>...

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,963
My name is Samuel.
I'm the one who sent you the cello.

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,506
It's found its home.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,301
It can bring people to you,
like a siren's song.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,595
- Compass?
- The key component in the mystery,

6
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,222
enough for them to kill for.

7
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,392
He'll tell me everything he knows
about the carnival.

8
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,227
We could isolate Samuel here.

9
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,646
The problem, of course,
is finding it.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,733
But our primary focus
must be stopping Samuel.

11
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,027
You have to disappear
for eight more weeks.

12
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,237
We'll have to agree to disagree.

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,492


14
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,078


15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,041


16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,127


17
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:48,089


18
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,051
The craziness over the last few weeks
is finally over.

19
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,262
Sylar's gone.

20
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,891
- Who is she?
- Vanessa. The love of my life.

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,435
- Haven't seen her around here.
- She's out there.

22
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:03,688
I'm afraid she'll reject me
for who I am, for what I've done.

23
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,690
You're still her father.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,818
You're the only one she has left
and she needs you.

25
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,780
The thing about burnt bridges
is they can be rebuilt.

26
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,533
<i>Look at her.</i>

27
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>How do I explain the world to her
without dampening her spirits?</i>

28
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,500
<i>Now she sees it filled
with promise and hope,</i>

29
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,503
<i>as bright as the light in her eyes.</i>

30
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:31,090
<i>But I've lived long enough to know
that everything is not as it appears.</i>

31
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,301
<i>Evil does exist.</i>

32
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,223
<i>People do terrible
things to one another.</i>

33
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,184
Oh, God.

34
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,269
Oh, my God!

35
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,816
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,069
I'm still your brother.

37
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,950
<i>How do I protect her
without losing her?</i>

38
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:01,204
Hasn't your father lied, cheated,

39
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,290
even killed, to protect you?

40
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,376
<i>How do I build a bridge
between us...</i>

41
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,670
- You lied to me.
- We shouldn't have.

42
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>When the distance seems so vast?</i>

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,883
I need time to grieve
without being reminded why.

44
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,143
So much for his eighth grade class.
Who's next?

45
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,022
We're getting down
to childhood playmates.

46
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,191
- If that's what it takes.
- I'm just saying,

47
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,652
is this a productive use
of our time?

48
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,114
- I've got to find this guy.
- And I want to help you.

49
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:39,826
But we've been shooting in the dark
for six hours now.

50
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,661
You got a better idea, I'm all ears.

51
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,582
It's just that you're starting
to sound a little...

52
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,125
Obsessed?

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,837
- You could call Claire.
- Not an option.

54
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,339
She has a compass.
She can lead us right to...

55
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,092
I am not calling Claire.
She's angry at me,

56
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,845
and she has every reason to be.
In no mood to help her old man.

57
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,181
- Maybe it's time to patch things up.
- Or to find a useful lead.

58
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,892
You don't have to help me.

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,021
I'm...

60
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,655
We got a hit on Vanessa Wheeler.

61
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,408
- Who?
- I told you about her.

62
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,785
She grew up in the estate
where his parents worked.

63
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,746
The house that became a sinkhole.

64
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,708
Looks like we have some still photos
off a security camera.

65
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,504
- Is that your man?
- That's him.

66
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,215
- You got a phone number?
- California area code.

67
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,935
- Vanessa Wheeler?
- <i>Yes? Who's calling?</i>

68
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,355
My name is Bennet.
Noah Bennet.

69
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,232
I wanted to talk to you
about Samuel Sullivan.

70
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,570
- <i>What's this about?</i>
- Just looking for him,

71
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,864
and wondering
if you've heard from him lately.

72
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,076
<i>I'm sorry.
I don't know anybody by that name.</i>

73
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Really?

74
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,330
He grew up on the estate
that your family owned.

75
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,545
Looks like I'm going to California.

76
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,090
Good luck with that.

77
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,886
Good night.

78
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,747
- Just writing a letter.
- Anybody I know?

79
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,501
I'm running low on ink supplies.

80
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,964
If you're going into town tomorrow,
I need you to pick some things up.

81
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,424
Of course.

82
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,931
I know much has happened lately
that's difficult.

83
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,643
Edgar. Hiro.

84
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,188
Claire Bennet.
Joseph.

85
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,064
Not to mention Sylar.

86
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,358
I'm asking for your patience.

87
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,903
I need you on my side.

88
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,118
We're so close now
to realizing all our dreams.

89
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,622
Our dreams, Samuel?
Or are they yours?

90
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,043
I made a list.

91
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,171
Indigo. Umber. Linseed oil.

92
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,631
- She's beautiful.
- Don't worry.

93
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,884
You'll meet her soon enough.

94
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,429
I've waited a long, long time
to bring her.

95
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,477
The day has finally come.

96
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,709
You don't trust him, do you?

97
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,003
He's planning something big,
and I don't like it.

98
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,713
He's always been good to me.

99
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,132
Why would you cause trouble?

100
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,677
If this family is going to survive,

101
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,637
we are going to need a new leader.

102
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,703
- Like who?
- There is someone.

103
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,267
A man of compassion.

104
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,187
Samuel himself said
that he may be the next Joseph.

105
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,731
He's just so far away.

106
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,484
Maybe you can call him.

107
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,074
Maybe I can.

108
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,532

109
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,630
- Is Matty still asleep?
- He was up late watching <i>Ratatouille</i>.

110
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,176
Speaking of which...
Tonight, for dinner... ratatouille.

111
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,846
- Really?
- I'm looking at it. It's not hard.

112
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,557
My brother called yesterday.

113
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,322
He's still looking to hire someone.
You don't know of anyone, do you?

114
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,480
I told you before,
I don't know any software salesmen.

115
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,274
He doesn't need a computer guy.

116
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,970
Just someone who's smart, focused,
looking to get ahead.

117
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,864
- You don't like my cooking?
- I love it.

118
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,241
You want me to work for your brother.
Seriously?

119
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,702
- Your brother?
- I'm just worried about you.

120
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,704
Since you got back,
you hardly go out.

121
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,790
I'm a stay-at-home dad guy.

122
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,500
That's what I do.
What's wrong?

123
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,003
Nothing.
I just want you to be happy.

124
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,548
There's "stay because you want to",
and "because you're scare not to".

125
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,467
I don't know which one you are.

126
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,955
I'm the one who is really excited
about this ratatouille recipe,

127
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:36,509
which, by the way,
will be ready at 6:30 p.m. sharp.

128
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,184
I'm really happy.

129
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,269
Being here,
taking care of you and Matty.

130
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,272
Have a good day.

131
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,858
Go make some money, will you?

132
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,042
I checked your security system.
Seems you're not as safe as you think.

133
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,796
I've left you five messages.

134
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:09,215
What do you want?

135
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,970
I need your help.
Do you know Samuel Sullivan?

136
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,974
No, but even if I have,
the last time I helped you,

137
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,392
I got Sylar stuck in my head
and I almost died.

138
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,769
It's nasty out there,

139
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,021
but ignoring the world
doesn't make it go away.

140
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,856
You never know until you try.

141
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,900
I'm sorry
about what you've been through.

142
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:31,320
The Sylar thing was a terrible idea.
We all admit that.

143
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,617
I stay home and lock my doors.
I don't see why that has to change.

144
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,327
Because this Sullivan guy,

145
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,163
he's a bad man.

146
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,749
Well, so is Bin Laden.

147
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,752
- You'll have to do better.
- He's trying to recruit my daughter.

148
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,551
Okay, what's your plan?

149
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,054
Kick him in the teeth
instead of talk to your daughter?

150
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,517
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,396
Today it's Claire.
Tomorrow, it could be your son.

152
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,191


153
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,069


154
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,531


155
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,243


156
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,038


157
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,624
All right, time to kiss bye bye.
Patients only past the double doors.

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,879


159
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,257
Can't I at least see him to his room,
make sure he's comfortable?

160
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,842
Comfortable.

161
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,845
Come on, pal.
Let's get you strapped in.

162
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,722
- What?
- Just an expression.

163
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,954


164
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,650
Ahmadi?

165
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,784


166
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,498
- How long are these rehearsals?
- I have no idea.

167
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,500
Okay, so she plays the cello,

168
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,962
she's in the L.A. chamber orchestra,
and she's first chair.

169
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,215
- What is she, Samuel's girlfriend?
- That's what you're here for.

170
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,979
That's her, right there.

171
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:03,180
Rehearsal's over.
Jump in anytime.

172
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,766
What?
No, I never...

173
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,352
Vanessa Wheeler?

174
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,187
- Do I know you?
- Noah Bennet.

175
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,065
We spoke on the phone.
I called you about Samuel Sullivan.

176
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,861
I thought I was clear.
I told you, I don't know him.

177
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,263
We know that you do.
We have pictures of the two of you.

178
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,461
- Are you with the police?
- No. It's more complicated than that.

179
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:27,622
Is there somewhere that we could go
and sit down and talk for a minute?

180
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,888
Whoever you are,
please leave me alone.

181
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:32,460
Hang on a second.
Have you met my friend Matt Parkman?

182
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,337
No!
And I don't want to.

183
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,547
You want to share
any thoughts here, please?

184
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:37,882
I told you...

185
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,324
<i>You can trust us, Vanessa.</i>

186
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,015
<i>You want to talk to us.</i>

187
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,956
Come to think of it,
I'm glad you called.

188
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,365
I need to talk to someone.

189
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:04,185
I'm worried about him.

190
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:09,997
Noah, it's Peter.

191
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,500
That tattoo on my arm,
it showed up again.

192
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,377
Give me a call, all right?
Bye.

193
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:11,141
It worked!

194
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,061
I'm sorry.
What worked?

195
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,398
I brought you here with music.

196
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,359
I just had to think of you,
and it worked.

197
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,153
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,612
Come in.

199
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,783
I met an unusual man,
and he showed me

200
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,196
a new side to my ability,
using this.

201
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:48,661
- Where did you get this cello?
- That same man.

202
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:51,307
- He's the one who sent it to me.
- Who? What's his name?

203
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:53,726
Samuel. Why?

204
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:03,777
I woke up this morning with this.

205
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,745
They were good years, growing up.

206
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,523
He used to write me these poems,

207
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,731
these little love poems.

208
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,352
We were close.

209
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:22,079
Neither of us cared that his family

210
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,438
lived in the carriage house
on my family's property

211
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,998
or that his father
called my father "sir."

212
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,833
One day I came home
and they were gone.

213
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,349
I moved on with my life.

214
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,106
- I assumed he moved on with his.
- But he hadn't.

215
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:39,472
He showed up in my room one night,

216
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:42,489
all swagger and rock and roll.

217
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,791
I was just in the right place
for the bad boyfriend.

218
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,219
We had a wild couple of weeks,
till he asked me to marry him

219
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,828
and run off to his carnival.

220
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:58,791
I mean, a carnival?
I was getting a music degree at Yale.

221
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,384
He's not
that 20-year-old kid anymore.

222
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,721
Samuel Sullivan
is a very dangerous man.

223
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:18,060
Lately he has been showing up
more and more often.

224
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,107
Since his brother died,
it's gotten even worse.

225
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:24,476
He just shows up,
spouting all kinds of crazy things.

226
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:27,945
- So he's stalking you?
- That's not the word I would choose,

227
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,046
but he does seem...

228
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:31,911
Obsessed?

229
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:36,984
A week ago, he was waiting for me

230
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:39,164
in the lobby
of my apartment building.

231
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,947
Going on and on
about how much he misses me,

232
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:45,303
how we'll be together
once I see how powerful he's become.

233
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,297
It was 2:00 in the morning.

234
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,844
So he knows where you live
and you know how to reach him?

235
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,975
I've been banging my head,
trying to find the carnival.

236
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,394
Maybe we bring the carnival to us.

237
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:02,771
How do you move a carnival?

238
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,859
Do us a favor.

239
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:09,820
Call him.

240
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,743
Is this the guy that gave you the cello?
Who said his name was Samuel?

241
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,703
Yes.
You know him?

242
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,820
He told me
his name was William Hooper.

243
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,439
- What did he want from you?
- He didn't want anything.

244
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,714
- Just to find a homeless man.
- That's it?

245
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:31,576
He gave me something.

246
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,637
This.

247
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:44,021
The last time I saw a compass like this,
my friend got stabbed.

248
00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:47,816
- You think Samuel...
- If there's any connection to that,

249
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,860
I'd keep my distance from him.

250
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:51,922
He's a good man.

251
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,032
My friend almost died
because of a compass just like that.

252
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,159
He wasn't the first to get attacked.

253
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:01,523
<i>Delmonico's</i> for lunch.

254
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:05,469
Or maybe it'll be too crowded.
How about <i>Moxie</i>?

255
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,420
Hi, Mom.

256
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:10,802
Emma, this is my mother, Angela.

257
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,717
- Nice to meet you.
- Mom, this is Emma.

258
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,385
How do you know this woman?

259
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,888
Emma is my friend.

260
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,561
I need to get to work.

261
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,814
Bye, Peter.

262
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,777
I'll call you later.

263
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,948
What the hell was that?

264
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,703


265
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,040


266
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,960


267
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,005


268
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,466


269
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,802


270
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,721


271
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,600


272
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,353


273
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,773


274
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,196


275
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,365


276
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:34,882
- How's it going?
- All good.

277
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,355
Messing with my meds?

278
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:54,026
I was just admiring your cart.

279
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,986
Very nice.
I work in a cart factory.

280
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,171
You're the Japanese guy's friend.

281
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:00,949
I'm Buck.

282
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:08,165
Excuse me.

283
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,332
I'm Chuck.

284
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,797
Take it easy.

285
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,469


286
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:27,904
He's late.

287
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,145
We're pretty exposed.

288
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,898
- When he shows, we've got to hustle.
- <i>Taser and duct tape</i>

289
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,901
and we're out in 60 seconds.
Getting a hit on the chip in her pocket?

290
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,311
Yeah, it's all good.

291
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:42,032
- We have our target.
- What?

292
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,410
He didn't come past me.
He came around the back.

293
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,996
- And let's go.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

294
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,442
Can I ask you a question?

295
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,723
- What was that?
- The alley. Get the car!

296
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,891
Got it.

297
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:30,414
Where is she?

298
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,249
Stay away from her.

299
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,168
- Where is she?
- She's already gone.

300
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,744
What the hell happened to you?

301
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,957
She's headed south on Normandie.

302
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:15,476
Let's go.

303
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:23,967
You had a dream.

304
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:26,344
There's nothing you can do
to save her.

305
00:22:26,703 --> 00:22:28,764
You need to save yourself.

306
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,146
I'm sorry.

307
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:34,234
Half this family is dead.

308
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:37,216
Their bodies are surrounded
with lies.

309
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:41,276
It's down to you and me.
Are we ever gonna get this right?

310
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,571
Please, just tell me the truth.

311
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:48,785
For once in your life, Mom, please.

312
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:57,167
The dream was foggy.

313
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,211
The message was not.

314
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,563
She's gonna help kill people.

315
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,175
That's wrong. That's not possible.
She's a good person.

316
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,241
She's gonna kill thousands of people.
It will be a bloodbath.

317
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,538
Something to do with a cello.

318
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:15,143
Tell me exactly what you saw.

319
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,399
It doesn't matter.

320
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:19,678
The important thing is
that you cannot save her.

321
00:23:20,745 --> 00:23:22,658
But someone else can.

322
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:25,198
Is that it?

323
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:32,215
I'm sorry.

324
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:34,535
I need to know.

325
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,428
People think that dreaming
the future is a gift.

326
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:43,739
They're wrong.

327
00:23:54,744 --> 00:23:55,811
Dr. Watson!

328
00:23:58,763 --> 00:23:59,811
Dr. Watson!

329
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,787
Hulk!

330
00:24:34,377 --> 00:24:36,808
Dr. Watson, I have traveled
over great oceans to free you!

331
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:38,755
Where am I?

332
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:45,550
- You put me here!
- To be continued.

333
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:49,886
Beware the Stormtroopers!

334
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,393
Why are you talking like that?

335
00:24:53,413 --> 00:24:54,891
Warp speed, Dr. Watson.

336
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:57,425
We must rescue Sancho and escape.

337
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,762
The prisoners
have all gone to dinner.

338
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,146
I've hidden Sancho for his safety.

339
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,050
Ando?
What's happened to him?

340
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:13,178
He partook of the absinthe
intended for you.

341
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:15,157
Perfect.

342
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:17,326
One who can't walk,
one who can't talk.

343
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,770
They must have searched my cell.
Let's go.

344
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,563
We shall ride to freedom.

345
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,106
What's happening?

346
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,577
- It's like swimming but inside out.
- <i>Silencio</i>!

347
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,533
I'm swimming!

348
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:44,459
Warp speed, Captain!

349
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:51,800
Get back in your cages!

350
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:55,137
- Stormtroopers!
- There they are!

351
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,139
It's okay.
I've got this.

352
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,352
What the...

353
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:34,768
She's here.
She's right here.

354
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:50,692
The carnival was here.

355
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:54,112
It isn't here now.

356
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:58,324
They had a two-minute lead on us.
A carnival doesn't just disappear.

357
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,896
This one does.

358
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:02,954
- How did Claire find it?
- Gotta have a compass.

359
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,665
She got that from the Samuel guy?

360
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,545
- She got it from me.
- Great.

361
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,214
- Let's go back to Claire.
- It's not gonna work that way.

362
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,674
You're burning bridges.

363
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,385
You can't talk to Claire anymore,
so tell me,

364
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,054
- how is it gonna work then?
- I don't know!

365
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,140
I don't know.

366
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,560
But we're gonna find it.

367
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,980
Somehow.

368
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,524
We have to.

369
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,284
Lauren, it's me.
Just call me.

370
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,328
- I'm running out of ideas.
- Well,

371
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,913
I would love to sit
and brainstorm with you.

372
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,624
But I've got to make dinner.

373
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,710
- Yeah. Ratatouille.
- What?

374
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,754
Ratatouille. It's French.

375
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,423
I know what ratatouille is.
This woman's been kidnapped.

376
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,425
- It's a missing person.
- We must find her.

377
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,926
Let the cops handle it.

378
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:01,429
Send cops up against specials?
They'll be flayed alive.

379
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,349
I dragged her into this.
I pulled her into the sunlight.

380
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,518
Maybe she's crossed state lines.
Look, I mean, admit it.

381
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,604
- This is bigger than us.
- What will you do?

382
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,607
Are you just gonna lock your doors
and crawl back into your shell?

383
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,693
You're one of the good guys.
You have a responsibility.

384
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,404
You're not a coward.

385
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,033
You know, some days...

386
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,285
maybe you can't save
the whole world.

387
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,829
Some days, it's better
to just get your house in order.

388
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,333
Which means what?

389
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,585
Which means...

390
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,004
Go home.

391
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,549
Hug your little girl.

392
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,978
Don't worry.

393
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,231
I've come to save you.

394
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:18,191
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

395
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,860
- What is wrong with you?
- Let me explain. I have these...

396
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,738
dreams that come true,
and I had one about you and that cello.

397
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,490
You broke my cello

398
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,201
- because of a dream?
- Because people are gonna die.

399
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,619
Your friend, Samuel.

400
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,205
That compass that you have.
My tattoo.

401
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,582
- They're connected to this cello.
- I loved it!

402
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,043
We have to stop
that dream from happening.

403
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,672
That's why I broke the cello.
Something bad is going to happen.

404
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,841
I want you out.

405
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:46,552
Now!

406
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,395
I'm sorry...

407
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,067
Goodbye, Peter.

408
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,049
I think that way is West.

409
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,928
We must away,
before the Stormtroopers are upon us.

410
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,222
I have had about enough
of your nonsense.

411
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,975
After what you did,
I want to leave you lost in this swamp.

412
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,310
Hey, don't talk to him like that.

413
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,814
He has very little time left,
and he chose to spend it rescuing you.

414
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,692
- Be thankful. He's a hero.
- What do you mean, "little time?"

415
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,571
- The reaper waits for no man.
- He's dying.

416
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,575
The Stormtroopers and their Ewoks!
Hurry!

417
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,353
Are you sure he can't teleport?

418
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,564
Not unless we unscramble his brain.

419
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,610
- What would they have done?
- Probably electroshock therapy.

420
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,532
- Why are we stopping?
- Electroshock therapy.

421
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,701
- You want me to...
- Even if we evade,

422
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,036
we'd wander for days.

423
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,788
- We need to teleport out of here.
- How?

424
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,999
You can use your red lightning.

425
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,711
Hiro saw a future where I killed him
with my red lightning.

426
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,256
- Was it in Florida?
- Japan.

427
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:47,965
Then we're good to go.

428
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,179
Make it so, Sancho.

429
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,282
- We must stop Samuel Sullivan!
- You're back!

430
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,575
Yes. And now,

431
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,494
we must get going.

432
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,055
Dad?

433
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:39,558
Sorry to bother you.
I was in the neighborhood.

434
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,810
Really?

435
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,230
I was in California.

436
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,524
I just landed.
Bags are still in the car.

437
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,819
I know you're mad at me
and I'm okay with that.

438
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:53,280
And, I want to just let you
be mad at me.

439
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:56,200
I don't want to talk you out
or convince you of anything.

440
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,120
Dad, what are you doing here?

441
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,500
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

442
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,460
I'm great, actually.

443
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,962
I'm just...

444
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:10,590
I'm thinking about bridges.

445
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,258
Bridges?

446
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:16,512
Bridges that connect us
to the people and things

447
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,682
that we love and need in our lives.

448
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,809
They're built on trust, and I've...

449
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,937
I've torched most of them.

450
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:28,482
And I'm just hoping that the...

451
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,694
that the one that connects me to you

452
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,156
can still be repaired.

453
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:42,497
I'm sorry, but I do have
something that I'm late for.

454
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,962
- Can we talk about this later?
- Yeah. We'll talk about it later.

455
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,674
This thing that you're late for,
do you need a lift?

456
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,134
No, I'm good.

457
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,269
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

458
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,198
I didn't think a law office
could be such a soap opera.

459
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,201
The human drama of it all.
Remember my boss, Pressman?

460
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,703
He's totally gay,
he's totally in denial,

461
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,330
and he's totally married.

462
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,004
This is delicious.

463
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,636
So how about you?

464
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,305
Did you leave the house
at all today?

465
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,558
Do you think I'm a coward?

466
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,186
What?

467
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,856
I think I'm a coward.

468
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,525
What are you talking about?
Why?

469
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,610
I had the worst guy
living inside my head.

470
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,322
When I finally got rid of him,
I didn't do a thing to go after him.

471
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:02,118
Because you came home to us,
where you belong.

472
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,997
I've let so many people down.

473
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,542
Who?

474
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,796
Friends, people that I care about.

475
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,466
I mean, I'm sitting here,
eating ratatouille,

476
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,468
instead of facing the world,

477
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,887
doing something
about the problems that I've caused.

478
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,931
You have a family.

479
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,893
You're a simple guy.
You care about us. That's your world.

480
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,772
You have to let the rest of it be.

481
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,949
There is nothing cowardly
about looking after your family.

482
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,036
You belong here with us.

483
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,335
Come here.

484
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,452
Not exactly
five-star accommodations,

485
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,038
but if there's anything you need...

486
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,542
What I need is to go home, Samuel.

487
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,377
What are you doing?
You can't just take me.

488
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,718
I've thought about this day for so long.
The day you would arrive.

489
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,682
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
It was supposed to be perfect.

490
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,851
I don't know
what you're talking about.

491
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:52,728
Noah Bennet.

492
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,440
He did a real number on you.
He got into your head.

493
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,401
I had to protect you,
to get you away from him.

494
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,945
By kidnapping me?

495
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,822
I wouldn't say that.

496
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,202
You won't let me leave.
You've got me against my will.

497
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,246
What would you call it?

498
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,458
You know what?
I'm just...

499
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,566
You're upset.

500
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,985
And I understand why.

501
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,072
But there is a reason
for all of this.

502
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,533
There's something I want you to see.

503
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,077
It's so magical, so beautiful.

504
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,830
Let me show you, that's all.

505
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,875
If you're still unhappy,
I'll take you back to California.

506
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,046
What do you mean,
"back to California?"

507
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,339
Where are we?

508
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,593
It's so beautiful, Vanessa.
Wait till you see it.

509
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:08,053
It's perfect.

510
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,541
I was driving by.
I saw the light on.

511
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,252
Come on in.

512
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,298
How was California?

513
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,887
Not as fruitful
as I would have liked.

514
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,640
- You got my messages?
- Yeah.

515
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,100
I'm sorry.

516
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,186
I know.

517
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,605
And I think I...

518
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,445
I care for you more
than I want to admit.

519
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,409
And it's complicated.

520
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,995
I know.

521
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,374
Just don't do it again.

522
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,892
You have company.

523
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,436
Sorry to pop in like this.
