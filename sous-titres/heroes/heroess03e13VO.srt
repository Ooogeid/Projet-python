1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,310
Previously on heroes...

5
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,460
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,310
You should be in the kitchen.

7
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,600
Aren't you the new chef?

8
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,370
Give me the catalyst, Mohter.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,650
I'll take the catalyst and your powers too, hiro.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,930
It's very important that we find our friend

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,440
Hiro nakamura--look.

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,190
See...this may not make any sense,

13
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,810
But we can't find him

14
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,490
Unless we get that package.

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,850
I can't believe this--hiro's stuck in time 16 years ago.

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,500
And no powers.

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,820
The catalyst is within me.

18
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,500
Place your hands on the vat and focus your energy.

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,780
In theory, you should cause a chemical reaction

20
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,920
At the molecular level.

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,040
Sergeant, I want you to know

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,790
Exactly what it is you've signed up for.

23
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,420
This drug is gonna change your life

24
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,510
In ways you can't possibly imagine.

25
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,420
Are you really my mother?

26
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,520
They're not your parents.

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,300
I'm your father.

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,190
No, you're not.

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,940
You're not a killer, peter. I am.

30
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,120
On the sixth day,

31
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,950
God created man in his own image.

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,040
And now it's up to us to figure it all out.

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,330
Right...wrong...

34
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,050
Good...

35
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,660
Evil...

36
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,960
In each of us is the capacity

37
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,670
To decide what drives our actions.

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,470
So what is it, then, that makes some choose selflessness,

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,840
The need to devote themselves to something greater,

40
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,170
While others know only self-interest?

41
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,180
Isolating themselves in a world of their own making?

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,390
Some seek only love, even if unrequited,

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,940
While others are driven by fear and betrayal.

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,930
There are those who see their choices

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,280
As dark proof of god's absence,

46
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,420
While others follow a path of noble destiny.

47
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,700
But in the end, good, evil, right, or wrong...

48
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,450
What we choose is never what we really need.

49
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,460
For that is the ultimate cosmic joke,

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,010
The real gift that god has left behind.

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,260
Oh, peter.

52
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,680
Ya did it.

53
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,270
I tried. it was sylar.

54
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,890
Sylar, huh?

55
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,610
There was no other way for this to end, nathan.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,950
And that formula has to be destroyed.

57
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,290
It's too late, pete.

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,910
There's a dozen marines being injected right now.

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,400
The formula works.

60
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,630
Look, I know that you think

61
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,750
You're doing something good here, but you're not.

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,420
Are you sure of that?

63
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,410
Following dad's insane plan?

64
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm gonna stop it.

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,170
It's not dad's plan anymore, pete.

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,170
It's ours.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,260
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,150
The plan.

69
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,930
It's ours.

70
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,520
All of us.

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,490
Making the world a better place.

72
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,910
Don't tell me you're gonna try and get in the way of that.

73
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,410
You sound just like him.

74
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,850
I know.

75
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,740
I can't help but wonder

76
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,670
How long it's gonna be before it's me lying here.

77
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,460
Remember what happened

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,750
The last time you had a gun in your hand?

79
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,050
I am gonna finish what he started.

80
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,350
I'm not gonna let you do that.

81
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,850
Eventually, you're gonna have to choose a side.

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Now, either you're with me...

83
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,310
Pete.

84
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,370
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,820
But you're wrong.

86
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,890
The formula's complete.

87
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,160
Peter's gonna need help at pinehearst.

88
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,170
It's up to us to finish this.

89
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,870
Arthur petrelli is dead.

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,260
No need to go to pinehearst now.

91
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,540
Sylar?

92
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,880
Don't worry, claire.

93
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,790
Peter couldn't do it, so I did.

94
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,520
Just like mommy wanted.

95
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,300
I know I repulse you...

96
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,800
Terrify you.

97
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,560
You see me as a monster...

98
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,060
And yet... you did this to me.

99
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,460
And before the night is over,

100
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,570
I'm going to prove to you

101
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,740
One by one...

102
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,250
That you're all monsters...

103
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,920
Exactly like me.

104
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,280
I know where he has to be

105
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,690
Broadcasting from.

106
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,190
Claire, you get six shots.

107
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,440
Pump after each one. keep angela safe at all costs.

108
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,900
Think about it--, manipulative grandmother.

109
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,630
Neglectful father,

110
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,290
A mother who abandons her own daughter?

111
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,670
All villains, really.

112
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
Meredith, you're with me.

113
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,430
You really don't think you can stop sylar.

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,270
Yeah. I do.

115
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,270
Sylar's got my healing ability.

116
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,890
There's a spot back here.

117
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,440
Jab something in, it cuts off my brain,

118
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,190
Shuts me down.

119
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,320
And claire...

120
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,830
You and i, we're more alike than any of them.

121
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,210
We can't be damaged.

122
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
I mean...

123
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,750
Except for a broken heart.

124
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,410
And that's what parents give us, isn't it?

125
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,430
We're nothing alike, you sick bastard!

126
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,670
I'm going to enjoy proving to you

127
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,730
Just how wrong you are.

128
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,370
You're not hunting me, noah.

129
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm hunting you.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Pigeon

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Help me.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I lost the formula.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I failed my father.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I lost my destiny.

135
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
And now I'm talking to a pigeon.

136
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,640
Hiro's stuck in time. it's up to me to rescue him.

137
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,050
Hiro doesn't even have his abilities.

138
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,060
How much trouble can he get into?

139
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,060
Well, anything he does in the past

140
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,060
Could change the present,

141
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,530
Like if he died...

142
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,570
What?

143
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,560
Mohinder!

144
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,570
Wow. they really cleaned this place up.

145
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,290
Dr. suresh!

146
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,070
Where is he?

147
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
You said he'd be here and we could get the formula.

148
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,070
No, I said I thought he'd be here.

149
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,290
The only way to save hiro

150
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,920
Is for me to become a time traveler.

151
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,920
You can only read minds. she can only run fast.

152
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,170
Really, really fast.

153
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,420
If suresh isn't here,

154
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,970
He's probably in his lab.

155
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,680
At pinehearst? too dangerous.

156
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,590
Someone has to get him.

157
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,680
No.


159
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,590
She is really, really fast.

160
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Yeah.

161
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,100
I've run out of time.

162
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,730
The infection has spread to my lungs.

163
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,250
By giving myself abilities,

164
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,440
I've signed my own death certificate.

165
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,860
My hope is that by injecting myself with the formula,

166
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,200
It'll be the cure.

167
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,380
Suresh, put it down. it's a weapon.

168
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,960
We need to get rid of all of it.

169
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,970
My life depends on this!

170
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,220
Do you remember when we first met...

171
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,630
How you tried to convince me

172
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,650
That people with abilities actually existed?

173
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,360
And you didn't believe me.

174
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,370
Exactly.

175
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,650
But once I saw for myself...

176
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,900
What it means to be special, powerful...

177
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,650
I coveted what you had.

178
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
So much so that I tried to recreate it.

179
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,490
So was it worth it?

180
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,000
It's turned you into a monster.

181
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,660
That's why I need this formula.

182
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,250
This inject--

183
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,000
What did you do? where the hell is it?

184
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,390
Time for a little payback, doc!

185
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,510
You move, I'll burn your face off.

186
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,810
Stop...stop!

187
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,190
Hold up. wanna trash this place?

188
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,900
So do we.

189
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,900
Why would you help me?

190
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,160
They make this formula stuff...

191
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,520
And we ain't so special no more.

192
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,840
If you're looking to allying yourself with peter,

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
With your brother in charge,

194
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,760
Think of all the good we can do.

195
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,710
Nathan's not in charge anymore.

196
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,960
Sir.

197
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,960
How many marines have been injected?

198
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,050
Just me.

199
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,720
When you didn't return to the lab,

200
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,310
Miss strauss became concerned.

201
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,050
Peter...is gonna ruin everything.

202
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,560
He's gotta be stopped.

203
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,860
Consider it done, sir.

204
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,030
I'll bring him to--

205
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,620
I'm gonna wait until your brother's

206
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,570
Gotten rid of all the formula.

207
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,230
You're working for peter?

208
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,490
Yeah.

209
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,410
He's one of the good guys now.


211
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,220
Did you find suresh?

212
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,090
Yep. took this right out of his hand.

213
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,260
One dose.

214
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,590
Formula!

215
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,730
No, no, no, no!

216
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,890
You guys realize how insane this is, right?

217
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,890
Look, just because you wanna be a time traveler

218
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,850
Does not mean that's the ability you're gonna get.

219
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,760
Think about it-- what if that thing makes you

220
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,150
Glow in the dark or grow a second head?

221
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,610
Matt. what?

222
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,280
You were always worried about what people thought about you,

223
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,610
And now you can read minds.

224
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,110
I wanted to run.

225
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,020
Look what happened.

226
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,780
Okay, but it also turned suresh into a freak.

227
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,120
Haven't you ever had faith in something

228
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,120
Even though everyone else said not to?

229
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Yeah, I have.

230
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,160
Ya-ta!

231
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,510
Hello?

232
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
Are you alright, Hiro?

233
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
I miss my mommy,chef.

234
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,510
Why are you so sad?

235
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,110
My father gave me a simple task and I could not do it.

236
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,730
My mom would say if you can fix it today,

237
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,320
you won't have to worry about it tomorrow.

238
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,570
Today.

239
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,590
Hiro, I need your help.

240
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
Your father has a...

241
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,570
a piece of paper with numbers and figures.

242
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,460
I must find it.

243
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,370
You're going to get me in trouble.

244
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,540
Think about what your mother would say.

245
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,170
Hiro,

246
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,350
you can save tomorrow.

247
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,460
It's dead.

248
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,580
Doesn't surprise you, does it?

249
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,460
He's put us all on lockdown.

250
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,750
You're only giving him what he wants.

251
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,260
A child starved for attention

252
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,730
Throws a temper tantrum.

253
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,260
Well, I'd like to give him a good spanking.

254
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,570
There is a way to stop this, claire.

255
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,610
You wanna be a company agent, hunt down bad guys,

256
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,500
That means making hard choices just like your daddy.

257
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,950
And let's face it--

258
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,790
You are just like your daddy.

259
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,620
Okay, I will allow dad, you,

260
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,930
And biomom to walk out of here right now,

261
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,130
Alive, to live happily ever after.

262
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,630
All you've gotta do is take your shotgun,

263
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,930
Hold it up to angela's head,

264
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,720
And pull the trigger.

265
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,630
Is she even worth protecting?

266
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,310
She wanted to blow up new york city,

267
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,560
Murdered her husband. oh, okay...tried.

268
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,560
And most importantly, lied to me,

269
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,450
Made me believe I had a mother and a family,

270
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,370
And then took it all away.

271
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,480
But if you're dead set on keeping her alive,

272
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,870
You could always just give me daddy.

273
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,490
Why are you doing this?

274
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,240
You should ask your dad sometime

275
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,500
About what he and elle did to me.

276
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,250
I could have been a nobody...

277
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,500
Instead of the monster I became.

278
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,010
And now elle's dead...

279
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,680
And very soon your father may be too.

280
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,980
It's your choice or fault.

281
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,930
All you gotta do is get rid of angela.

282
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,150
You hurt him...

283
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,850
And I swear I'll hunt you down and kill you!

284
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,410
From cheerleader to stone cold killer.

285
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,740
Who's the monster now?

286
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,480
You are.

287
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,130
Are you crazy?

288
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,370
We need help.

289
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,550
Yeah, but these guys,

290
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,800
They wanna kill us as much as sylar does.

291
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,650
Hello, meredith.

292
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,260
I knew we'd be together again.

293
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,930
I just...didn't think it would be so soon.

294
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,560
Make this quick.

295
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,950
Sylar's in the building.

296
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,280
One of you guys brings me his head,

297
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,530
You get your freedom.

298
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,810
And...what's to keep us from escaping

299
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,780
The second you turn around?

300
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,910
Sylar. we're all locked in here with him.

301
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,750
Now get moving.

302
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,090
They don't stand a chance.

303
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,170
Think about it, meredith.

304
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,550
What do you need to catch a shark?

305
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,640
They're bait?

306
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,770
You do know that the formula's highly combustible?

307
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,400
So what? I can't be burned.

308
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,270
What about peter?

309
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,530
Are you willing to sacrifice him as well?

310
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,660
These are your accomplices, peter--

311
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,170
Thugs, killers!

312
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,200
What does that make you?

313
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,300
You didn't have to do that!

314
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,460
What? now this'll go twice as fast.

315
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,270
What--what happened?

316
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,050
Do I have abilities?

317
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,440
So far all we know

318
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,860
Is that you can pass out really well.

319
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,570
Was it all for nothing?

320
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,030
Give it a try. come on.

321
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm the master of time and space.

322
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,310
That's good.

323
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,660
I am the master...

324
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,710
Of time and space.

325
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,320
I'm the master of--

326
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,820
Do like hiro does

327
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,570
When he scrunches his eyes together.

328
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,040
Right. good idea.

329
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,460
Yeah, but scrunch gently.

330
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,160
You don't wanna jump back to the stone age.

331
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,220
-Gentle. -yeah.

332
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,470
Gentle scrunch.

333
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,230
Ah, maybe too gently.

334
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,150
Kick it up a notch.

335
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,500
We're never going to save hiro!

336
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,700
What was that?

337
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,580
I...don't know.

338
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,430
But...that sure wasn't time travel.

339
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,590
They say adrenaline can kick-start a dead heart.

340
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,350
Meredith's mine.

341
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,770
Mine to love.

342
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,030
Mine to kill.

343
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,870
You really think you...

344
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,170
Can control me?

345
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,370
One more thing to do...

346
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,630
What the hell?

347
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,830
What happened?

348
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,470
Get away! oh!

349
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,390
I can't control my fire.

350
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,720
Did sylar do this?

351
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,220
Yeah. he pumped me with adrenaline.

352
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,140
I can't hold it back. you gotta go!

353
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,570
It's bulletproof. Remember, noah?

354
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,860
At the rate she's going,

355
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,580
You're gonna need that one bullet I left you.

356
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,340
Shouldn't be too hard for you.

357
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,210
Hey, let me ask you one thing.

358
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,210
When this is all over,

359
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,710
And meredith's dead

360
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,380
With a bullet right between her eyes,

361
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,770
What lie are you gonna tell claire?

362
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,470
Your life or hers, noah.

363
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,560
You helped make me into who I am.

364
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,070
I just wanted to return the favor.

365
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,300
You know you've backed the wrong horse.

366
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,830
Everybody roots for peter,

367
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,420
But in the end, he always winds up losing.

368
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,310
Uh-huh, that's why you're up here

369
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,580
And he's down there winning.

370
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,330
Define winning.

371
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,980
All my brother ever does

372
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,840
Is disappoint the people who believe in him.

373
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,850
You really hate the guy.

374
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,820
Feel sorry for him, actually.

375
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,350
Then why are you so afraid?

376
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,410
You worried he's gonna stop you?

377
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,660
I'm not afraid of anybody.

378
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,510
Miss me?

379
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,640
Oh! watch it, watch it!

380
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,640
-Could you stop doing that? -no, i-i can't!

381
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,850
Try!

382
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,140
-I can't control it! -calm down--

383
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,990
It's o--it's okay.

384
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,070
What happened?

385
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,770
It was like an explosion in my head.

386
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,380
I could hear every... thought

387
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,800
From every person in the entire city.

388
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,310
What did you do--

389
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,990
-I didn't do any -daphne!

390
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,330
Aah! matt!

391
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,050
Matt!

392
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,510
It's okay.

393
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,010
It's over.

394
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,600
What happened?

395
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,850
It was like an explosion in my head.

396
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,350
I could hear every... thought

397
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,100
From every person in the entire city.

398
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,020
What did you do--

399
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,350
I didn't do any--

400
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,730
Daphne.

401
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,240
Daphne!

402
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,330
Where'd you just go?

403
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,330
I don't know.

404
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,540
I-i was out there,

405
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,540
But I was watching myself in here.

406
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,620
And--and you were there...

407
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,630
And you were there and...

408
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,120
Matt, I think I traveled back in time.

409
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,800
Back in time?

410
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,890
We have to save them!

411
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,470
He only showed us that

412
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,820
Because he wants us to go down there.

413
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,570
I don't care.

414
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,590
Now, come on.

415
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,400
Where's angela?

416
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,110
Well, you wouldn't pick before so...

417
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,660
I had to up the stakes.

418
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,520
Save daddy...

419
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,600
Or is it granny?

420
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,120
Let me go!

421
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,370
Why are you even pretending?

422
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,370
We both know you're going after your dad.

423
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,460
Even after all the lies he's told you,

424
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,790
How he's neglected you.

425
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,380
What does that say about you, claire?

426
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,300
That's the thing about the truth, claire.

427
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,300
Stings like a bitch.

428
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,200
Dad!

429
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,990
Go to the keypad. punch in 29297.

430
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,490
29...

431
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,240
Sylar ripped it out.

432
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,830
There's gotta be another way.

433
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,800
I don't know how much longer I can hold on, noah.

434
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,130
All right, meredith...

435
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,830
I need you to take

436
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,720
As much heat as you can in your hands.

437
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,150
Press your palms to the glass.

438
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,360
Okay, good, now back away from the glass!

439
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,530
Claire, you do the same. move back.

440
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,500
Oh, god! it didn't work.

441
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,510
Stay back, both of you!

442
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Come with me.

443
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,200
Just give me a minute.

444
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,740
Go now. stop sylar.

445
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm coming back for you.

446
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,190
I gotta get you outta here.

447
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,030
We gotta stop peter before he ruins everything.

448
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,810
Nathan, this situation is still deniable.

449
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,560
Deniable? are you kidding me?

450
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,290
I can spin anything.

451
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,240
But this is a disaster that you cannot be associated with.

452
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,290
Look, the document with the formula's all we need.

453
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,830
We find it... we can start over.

454
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,630
New game...our rules.

455
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,080
I can't run away, tracy.

456
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,920
It's not running away. I'm being a realist.

457
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,510
That's why you hired me.

458
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,230
Then you're fired.

459
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,280
I don't understand. how can I travel through time?

460
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,500
Because...he zapped me,

461
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,860
And I was able to hear thoughts

462
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,020
a thousand times louder, right?

463
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,280
And then you zapped daphne,

464
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,500
And she could travel a thousand times faster.

465
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,840
Your power is like a super-charger.

466
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,760
Going faster wouldn't mean I can time travel.

467
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,500
I mean...would it?

468
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,620
According to einstein, yeah.

469
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,120
- The space-time continuum! - Theory of relativity.

470
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,020
If you can travel faster than the speed of light,

471
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,550
Then you can actually move through time.

472
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,300
How do you know so much about einstein, einstein?

473
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,020
I actually paid attention in high school...mostly.

474
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,550
So if I can super-charge other people's powers,

475
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,020
That means I have an ability!

476
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,150
Yes! ya-ta!

477
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,280
If you keep zapping me with super-charge

478
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,640
And I keep running,

479
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,640
Maybe we can go back 16 years.

480
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,900
Okay, no, wait, wait, wait.

481
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,460
Come on, what if you can't control your speed?

482
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,820
Or--or you end up in the dark ages?

483
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,450
What if this guy runs out of juice?

484
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,800
We'll be back before you know it.

485
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,000
what are you two doing here

486
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,000
your son and i were just playing

487
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,450
you are done for this evening

488
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,920
it is late get into your pajiamas

489
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,410
daddy

490
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,350
hiro

491
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,720
go to bed

492
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,700
may i speak with you for a moment

493
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,530
thief

494
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,280
wait

495
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,340
i can explain

496
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,820
sort of

497
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,830
who are you

498
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,780
how did you open my safe

499
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,850
i looked over your shoulder once

500
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,880
i saw the combination

501
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,180
give me that piece of paper

502
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,680
before you die i will give you

503
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,230
one last chance to explain yourself

504
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,450
if this is destroyed tonight

505
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,860
it can never be used again

506
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,220
anywhere  anytime

507
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,010
give it to me

508
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,400
i am the guardian of the formula

509
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,440
You found him!

510
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,620
yeah.It worked!







517
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,250
The formula must be destroyed.

518
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,460
And I know where it is.

519
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,510
I'm the one who stole it for arthur petrelli, remember?

520
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,370
Nemesis, you have a chance to make up for your past.

521
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,960
And for me to make up mine.

522
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,520
Take me to it, please.

523
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,390
He's right.

524
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,970
Go, go!

525
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,950
Be the, uh, be the good guy--gal.

526
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,310
Back in a flash.

527
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,480
Stop! we have come for the formula.

528
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,740
It doesn't belong to you.

529
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,630
And you are...

530
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,830
Hiro nakamura.

531
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,710
It is my sacred duty to see that it is destroyed.

532
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,080
Sorry, I've got plans

533
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,490
For this little piece of paper, pikachu.

534
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,000
Pikachu--

535
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,750
Excuse me.

536
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,230
Time to go.

537
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,230
Hey, gimme a hand with this.

538
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,600
Ready?

539
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,540
That's the last of it. finally.

540
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,180
And now we can blow this place to hell.

541
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,520
No, wait, flint! we gotta get the people out.

542
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,550
My brother's still here.

543
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,140
I don't give a rat's ass about your brother.

544
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,360
Or you.

545
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,330
You broke my heart, peter.

546
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,590
Stop!

547
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,310
Son of a bitch!

548
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,510
Don't--

549
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,250
So...you killed arthur.

550
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,160
I certainly did.

551
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,640
Then you saved the world.

552
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,180
I was right about you all along.

553
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,590
You are a hero.

554
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,340
I don't think so.

555
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,070
You're wrong.

556
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,630
I always wanted this for you.

557
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,310
I dreamed about it.

558
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,920
And now that arthur's dead, there's no one to hold you back,

559
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,100
No one to take advantage of you.

560
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,920
Except...you.

561
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,200
Gabriel, I cared for you.

562
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,670
I gave you love, I gave you guidance--

563
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,210
Everything a mother could--

564
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,510
You...are not...my mother.

565
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,050
Are you?

566
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,190
And I can tell if you're lying.

567
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,060
No, I'm not.

568
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,070
For a brief moment, I wish you were.

569
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,580
Why did you do it?

570
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,910
I told you.

571
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,740
My sons have been such a disappointment to me,

572
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,300
And I wanted another chance...

573
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,970
A chance to give the love

574
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,340
That only a mother can.

575
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,810
That's a lie.

576
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,740
I told you I could tell.

577
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,860
I wanted you to work for the company.

578
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,940
You had a skill that I needed.

579
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,110
You saw me as a hero?

580
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,750
No.

581
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,610
As a killer...

582
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,290
A monster.

583
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,300
You were flawed, weak, malleable.

584
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,120
Someone I could manipulate.

585
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,520
Because that's what I do, because you're right...

586
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,640
I'm a monster too.

587
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,640
Is there any good in this world?

588
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,050
Tell me something, anything.

589
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,390
Just make me believe that you're not the same as me!

590
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,030
I know who your real parents are.

591
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,320
You're telling the truth.

592
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,210
You're not the son of a watchmaker

593
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,150
And a woman who collected snow globes.

594
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,830
Who am I then?

595
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,580
If you kill me... you will never find out.

596
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,140
Tell me.

597
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,090
Tell me!

598
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,640
I want the truth!

599
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,520
Claire.

600
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,530
We need to leave. now.

601
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,420
Get angela out of here.

602
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,530
-Mom!  -Claire!

603
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,380
No, what are you doing here?

604
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,260
I told you I'd come back for you, come on!

605
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,260
I can't. it's too late.

606
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,790
Claire, let's go.

607
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,880
This whole building's gonna come down in flames.

608
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,640
You'll be buried alive. come on.

609
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,550
No, I can save you. no, get away!

610
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,770
We have to get out of here.

611
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,390
You gotta go! oh!

612
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,280
I love you, mom.

613
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,780
Go!

614
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,420
You flew!

615
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,410
That wasn't me-- that was you!

616
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,430
You took the formula!

617
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
I had to.

618
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,420
Everything you're against!

619
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,840
I had no other choice.

620
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,100
Why'd you save me? why'd you do it?

621
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,440
Because you're my brother, and I love you.

622
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,360
That's not what I would have done.

623
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,920
Natahn...nathan!

624
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,620
There is good, and there is evil...

625
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,590
Right and wrong...

626
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,960
Heroes and villains.

627
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,600
And if we're blessed with wisdom,

628
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Then there are glimpses between the cracks of each

629
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,270
Where light streams through...

630
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,350
We wait in silence for these times

631
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,150
When sense can be made...

632
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,390
When meaningless existence comes into focus,

633
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,650
And our purpose presents itself.

634
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,660
And if we have the strength to be honest,

635
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,130
Then what we find there staring back at us

636
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,630
Is our own reflection...

637
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,500
Bearing witness to the duality of life...

638
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,760
That each one of us

639
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,640
Is capable of both the dark

640
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,140
And the light...

641
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,510
Of good and evil...

642
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,180
Of either...of all.

643
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,770
And destiny, while marching ever in our direction,

644
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,690
Can be rerouted by the choices we make...

645
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,950
By the love we hold onto

646
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,080
And the promises we keep.

647
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,710
I think our only real option at this point

648
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,100
Is to get the united states government involved.

649
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,390
And you're saying all of these people have abilities.

650
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,780
Them and more.

651
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,050
A lot more.

652
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,770
The important thing to remember

653
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,310
Is how dangerous these people can become

654
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,310
If left unchecked.

655
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,400
I had a solution.

656
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,400
It proved unsuccessful.

657
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:49,570
It's all there.

658
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,910
All the evidence you need.

659
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,800
What, exactly, is it that you're asking to do?

660
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,420
I wanna round them up and put them in a facility

661
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,590
Where they won't be a danger to anyone.

662
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,750
All right, senator.

663
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,510
Let's get you whatever you need.

664
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,850
Thank you, mr. president.
