1
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:35,786
Front door open.

2
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:43,794
Front door open.

3
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,405
Front door open.

4
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,510
Perfect timing.
Cloud just burst.

5
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:09,413
Coming down
in all sorts of ways.

6
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,515
This should be
our last conversation.

7
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:14,184
It's not safe for you
to be seen with me.

8
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,852
I'm touched.

9
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,754
Or I would be,

10
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:20,490
if I could imagine that you
really care about my safety.

11
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:22,426
What I care about
is having an awful lot

12
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:24,127
depending on a man
too distracted

13
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:26,797
to pack an umbrella
on a cloudy day.

14
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:29,433
Or use a proper razor.

15
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,438
Family is
a horrible price to pay

16
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:36,073
for what
we're trying to do.

17
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,909
and the irony
of sacrificing my relationship

18
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,477
to my sons to save my sons

19
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:42,145
isn't lost on me.

20
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:44,247
Well, I'm sure
that Nathan will find

21
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:45,949
that it serves his agenda
to forgive you.

22
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:47,818
Of course he will.

23
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:50,654
But Peter,
Peter I'm afraid won't.

24
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:52,823
He's said his goodbyes.

25
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,561
Now that Danko has thrown
Nathan from a building

26
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,097
and watched him fly away,

27
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,766
it all comes down to you, Noah.

28
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,168
Hate to be dramatic,
but there it is.

29
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:07,504
Danko doesn't trust me.

30
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:09,673
Then make him trust you.

31
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:11,708
Get his mind off Nathan,

32
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,910
give him some kind
of Feather to put in his cap.

33
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:18,081
Give him one of us.

34
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:19,216
If I were a better woman,

35
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,517
I'd suggest
you'd turn me over.

36
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:22,419
That would show him
whose side you're on.

37
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:25,255
What makes you so sure I haven't?

38
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:29,393
You need a bigger Feather.

39
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:31,211
Give him Rebel,

40
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,030
and Danko
will be your best friend.

41
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,332
You do realize

42
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:38,235
you may be needing
Rebel's services very soon.

43
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,236
I'm resourceful.

44
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,470
I'll find ways to survive

45
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:43,673
that don't involve Rebel.

46
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:45,709
I'm going to leave
the city tonight

47
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:48,879
before something
unfortunate happens.

48
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:50,013
You've got 15 minutes

49
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:53,784
to catch the next rail to DC.

50
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,852
Take my umbrella.

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,388
Don't say I never
did anything for ya.

52
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:01,224
Thanks.

53
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:04,694
I wouldn't go home
if I were you.

54
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:08,632
Don't say I never
did anything for you.

55
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,457
What is this?

56
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,893
An effective way
of stopping any of you

57
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:39,262
from hurting any of us.

58
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,097
Neat, huh?

59
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,033
Why didn't you just do it
the old fashioned way

60
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,435
and dig a ditch?

61
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:48,638
This is gun control.

62
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:52,375
Everyone in this room
is armed and dangerous,

63
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:54,077
yourself included.

64
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,912
Where's Daphne?

65
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,948
She's right over there.

66
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,150
I'm afraid
she's not doing very well.

67
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,686
Why was she moved
from the medical facility?

68
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:05,455
Well, there was the American
tax payer to consider.

69
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:07,991
I wanna speak to Nathan.

70
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:12,929
Nathan Petrelli flew away.

71
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:15,265
Look, this woman is dying.

72
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,733
I need to get her
to an emergency room.

73
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:18,168
I can't do anything
to help her here.

74
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,470
I don't want you
to help her.

75
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:22,973
Then why did you
bring me here?

76
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,609
I figure it'd be a whole lot
easier than carrying you.

77
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:37,020
Hook him up.

78
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:40,390
And let's make up a bed
for Ms. Strauss. 

79
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:51,323
Heroes SO3E20
"Cold Snap"

80
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,195
I brought you a present.
<i>New trop 50.</i>

81
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:15,264
Is that the same line
you used on Suresh

82
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,432
to get him in here?

83
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,636
No, he needed
a little more convincing.

84
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:22,638
In light of recent
management changes,

85
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:26,342
it's important
that you and I get along.

86
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,510
I couldn't agree more.

87
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:32,681
So... happy whatever.

88
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:34,483
Since the puppet man

89
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,786
menaced your wife
and fugitive daughter,

90
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:38,554
I thought you'd get
some satisfaction

91
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:42,258
out of seeing him strung up.

92
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,527
It's my gift to you.

93
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:46,362
How'd you catch him?

94
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,331
I'm smarter
than the average bear.

95
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,435
Well, since you're
in such a giving mood,

96
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:54,003
allow me
to return the favor.

97
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,440
How would you like to see
Rebel lying here?

98
00:06:57,507 --> 00:07:00,843
I would like that.
Very much.

99
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:02,311
He's hacked
into our system twice

100
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,579
in the last three days.

101
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:04,980
We've tracked two messages,

102
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:06,582
both to Tracy Strauss.

103
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,351
He's gonna try to rescue her,

104
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,954
and I think
we should let him.

105
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:13,989
Hmm... Bad idea.

106
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:15,491
Strauss is a killer.

107
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,293
We're not setting her loose.

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,794
You open the cage
and let the rabbit run,

109
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:19,995
she could lead us
right to Rebel.

110
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,730
We both know it's a trap.

111
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm not suggesting
we make it easy.

112
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:32,308
And if you
don't catch Rebel?

113
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,744
Then I put a bullet
in Tracy Strauss myself,

114
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,013
and chalk it up
to self defense.

115
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:43,085
Fine.

116
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:45,621
Let the rabbit run.

117
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,357
Don't worry,
baby Matt Parkman!

118
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:50,493
We will make you big again!

119
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,030
* How could Matt Parkman be a baby?

120
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,316
* On the Next Generation,

121
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:01,932
* it was a transporter accident.

122
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,174
Baby Matt Parkman,
we will save you.

123
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,675
If you understand,

124
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:09,011
shake rattle once for yes,

125
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,914
twice for no.

126
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,829
* Maybe it's not baby Matt Parkman.

127
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,089
* Maybe it's Matt Parkman's baby.

128
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:21,640
* I didn't know Matt Parkman had a baby.

129
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,420
* Does Matt Parkman know he had a baby?

130
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:28,094
* This is the wrong Matt Parkman.

131
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,781
* We're supposed to save <i>the</i>
Matt Parkman.

132
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,516
* Big guy. Not little guy.

133
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,140
* Rebel said to save <i>a</i> Matt
Parkman at this address.

134
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:42,796
* This is the only Matt
Parkman at this address.

135
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:48,709
* You're afraid of the baby.

136
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:52,421
* Now that's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

137
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,580
* Is it because of their little
baby razor-like fingernails?

138
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,605
* Heroes change the world. Not diapers.

139
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:06,869
Bad baby.

140
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,071
No television for you.

141
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:11,734
* Suit yourself.

142
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:13,945
* You be cold daddy.

143
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:15,497
* I'll be warm mommy.

144
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,714
Hello, baby.

145
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:20,983
You I love!

146
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:22,931
* See? All there is to it.

147
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,290
* Alright, warm mommy.

148
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,468
* What are we saving the baby from?

149
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:27,873
* Lead-based toys?

150
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:38,946
* The baby has a power.

151
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,770
* They're coming for Matt
Parkman's baby.

152
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,556
Why have we stopped?

153
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,868
Don't stop the car.

154
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:13,869
But the traffic's stopped.

155
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,571
There's construction-oh!

156
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:26,348
What do we got?

157
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,318
Where is she?

158
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:31,253
We lost the target!

159
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,888
Excuse me,

160
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,758
I foolishly gave my umbrella
to a friend.

161
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:38,027
I hope you don't mind
if I get close.

162
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:41,864
Not at all.

163
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:46,335
Cover all points of interest.

164
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,005
They lost Angela Petrelli.

165
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:53,309
I guess someone tipped her.

166
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,277
Or she saw them coming.

167
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:57,046
She does that, you know?

168
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:58,347
She's on the island of Manhattan.

169
00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,348
She has a cell phone.

170
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,050
We'll track her signal.

171
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,593
It won't read my Code.

172
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:16,799
Rebel, Rebel.

173
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:51,033
Rebel.

174
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:04,413
Doctor.

175
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,414
Oh, God. Wake up.

176
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:07,683
Come on.

177
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,320
Come on,
you need to wake up!

178
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:12,454
Where's Daphne?

179
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:13,922
Come on. Get up.
You gotta wake up.

180
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,957
We're getting out of here.

181
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,258
Come on. Wake up.

182
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:17,826
Daphne!

183
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:18,961
Are you okay?

184
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,063
We have to get her
to the hospital.

185
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,298
She's gonna slow us down.

186
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,883
Yeah, then she'll
slow us down. Come on.

187
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,267
She'll slow you down.
I'm leaving.

188
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:27,169
No, Tracy, wait!
We all go together!

189
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,540
Open the door!

190
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:43,819
All clear.

191
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,228
So we just
walk out the front door?

192
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:55,664
Yeah. Aren't you glad
you waited for us?

193
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,499
When we get out,
I'm not waiting for anyone.

194
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,135
This won't happen again.

195
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:04,640
If Strauss does
lead you to Rebel,

196
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,876
kill them both.

197
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,345
Chalk it up
to self defense.

198
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:36,312
Do you want me
to check any sizes, miss?

199
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,014
No, thank you.

200
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,260
Actually, could you get me
a smaller size in this?

201
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:54,197
Hello, Tracy.

202
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:56,833
This is one instance
where being out for yourself

203
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,501
didn't serve you.

204
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,336
You should've stuck
with Matt Parkman.

205
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,371
You could have walked
right past me,

206
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,506
and I never
would have known.

207
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:06,876
We did walk right past you.

208
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:08,244
Then you went on your own,

209
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,680
and now here we are.

210
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,348
I think
I can pull this trigger

211
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,783
faster than you can
turn me to ice,

212
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,218
But I don't
wanna take that bet.

213
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:16,385
I'll take it.

214
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:17,753
While you were playing
Abu Ghraib,

215
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,055
I was trying
to make ice in an oven.

216
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:21,290
This is a breezy 68 degrees,

217
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:22,725
and I've worked up
a hell of a cold snap.

218
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,794
Well, like I said,
it's a bet I'd rather not take.

219
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,630
Is everything all right
in there, Miss?

220
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:33,736
Oh.

221
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,371
Yeah, I know.
No boys allowed.

222
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:40,243
But my fiancee
is very self conscious.

223
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,080
Would you mind getting this
in the size down please?

224
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:46,749
Thank you.

225
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:50,586
Thanks.

226
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:54,790
Who is Rebel?

227
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:56,425
I don't know who Rebel is.

228
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:57,727
Rebel knows who you are.

229
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:59,896
He went to a lot of trouble
to break you out.

230
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:02,098
I think he has something
in store for you.

231
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:05,535
I suppose you do, too?

232
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,470
Here's how
being out for yourself

233
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:11,007
can serve you better
than it has in the past-

234
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:12,942
Lead me to Rebel.

235
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:17,547
How will that
serve me better?

236
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,482
Lead me to Rebel,
and I'll let you go.

237
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,183
You won't have
your old life back.

238
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:22,184
That's gone forever.

239
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,654
But you'll be on the outside.

240
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:27,757
And you'll have a chance.

241
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:31,994
And if I run?

242
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,663
If you run,

243
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,131
or if you kill me
and then run,

244
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:36,699
there won't be
another conversation.

245
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:40,303
It'll be a big, fat cut to black,

246
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,772
and that'll be it for you.

247
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:49,478
Help. Help!

248
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:50,513
I need some help!

249
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:51,514
Orderly,
I need a gurney now!

250
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,215
Matt, where are we?

251
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:54,884
Honey, it's fine.
You're gonna be okay.

252
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:56,152
Honey, you're gonna be okay.

253
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:57,720
Matt, you have to be
ready to move.

254
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:00,423
Chest wound septic.
Prep for surgery!

255
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,824
Ma'am, can you
tell me your name?

256
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,326
Her name's Janice.
I'm her husband Matt.

257
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:04,527
This woman's been shot.
What the hell happened?

258
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,062
It was a duck hunting trip upstate,

259
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,597
Her family's idea.
Then she shoots herself.

260
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:09,231
Just stupid, a clumsy accident.

261
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,100
Her dad's a doctor.
He patched her up.

262
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,868
He said she's gonna be fine,
but she's clearly-

263
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:14,737
She is not fine.
Okay.

264
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:17,673
We have to report all
gunshot wounds to the police.

265
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:19,642
This was clearly an accident.

266
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,744
But this clearly
was an accident.

267
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:24,180
I should stick close,
make sure she's okay.

268
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,082
You should stick around,
make sure she's okay.

269
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,317
- She is gonna be okay-
- We'll do our best.

270
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:29,919
Excuse me.

271
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:39,545
* He's Toddler Touch and Go.

272
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:42,735
* He touches and makes things go.

273
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:44,836
* Like a Baby Genesis device.

274
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,305
Life from lifelessness.

275
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:51,991
* We can't just take the Baby
Genesis Device.

276
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,450
* That's kidnapping.

277
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,220
* What about his mother?

278
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,095
* We'll leave her a note.

279
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:11,227
No, baby. Bad baby.

280
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,543
* I've seen this all on Dr. Phil.

281
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,337
* Seen what on Dr. Phil?

282
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,312
* Cold daddy.

283
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,691
* You have childhood issues which
means you have child issues.

284
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,579
* That's why you are afraid of the baby.

285
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,650
* Thank you, prestigious Dr. Ando.

286
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,230
* You have called out my childhood demons.

287
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,406
* Distant Father... Departed Mother...

288
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:37,041
* You are being insensitive about my mother.

289
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:39,145
* Your mother died 16 years ago.

290
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:46,215
* No. She didn't. Not for me.

291
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:54,266
* When I time traveled to
when I was 12 years old...

292
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:59,063
* I met little me and saw my mother...

293
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,010
* and she...

294
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:06,746
* she died...

295
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:11,072
* in my arms.

296
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:16,284
* Why didn't you tell me?

297
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:19,622
* I was afraid I would cry if I did.

298
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:23,725
* I'm about to cry right now.

299
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,699
* Don't cry because then I'll cry.

300
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:30,697
* Is that why you're afraid of the baby?

301
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,980
* I'm not afraid of the baby.

302
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,896
* I'm just trying to be brave for the baby.

303
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,633
* Someone's here.

304
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,140
* Hide.

305
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,353
* Where?

306
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:43,879
* In the closet.

307
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:02,304
You're not from
the baby sitting service.

308

Thank you.

317

Taxi!

318
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:44,847
Union station, please.

319
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:53,656
Taxi.

320
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:00,676
Oh, I thought you said
you were gonna be late.

321
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:02,911
Oh, my God.

322
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:04,379
Hello, Millie.

323
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:06,214
You look like
you've been mugged,

324
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:08,083
and the first thing they stole
was your dignity.

325
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,584
Havin' a bad day.

326
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:11,152
Let me tell you
about my day.

327
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,887
It's been exceptional.

328
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,656
I was detained

329
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:16,558
by people with badges

330
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,059
for three hours.

331
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:19,260
Came pounding on my door

332
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:20,829
right in the middle
of my pilates session,

333
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:22,163
10:00 a. m.,

334
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:25,467
had all sorts of questions
about the company I keep,

335
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:27,669
or kept.

336
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:29,270
So, you can understand
why I'm not

337
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:31,306
in the mood to be ambushed.

338
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,675
I'm in trouble, Millie.

339
00:20:33,743 --> 00:20:35,410
I know we haven't spoken
in some time,

340
00:20:35,478 --> 00:20:37,345
and I'm sure
after this morning

341
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:39,381
you can and are
wondering why.

342
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:42,183
You were never the same
after Arthur died.

343
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:43,318
We all saw it.

344
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:46,321
I chalked the moodiness
and the shoplifting

345
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:49,991
up to grief,
but good lord, Angela.

346
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,960
What did you do?

347
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:54,529
Is it pills?

348
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:58,333
I have dug my sons
a very deep hole,

349
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:00,935
and I'm just trying
to dig them out again.

350
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:03,438
Then you're here
looking for a shovel?

351
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:05,774
Looking perhaps
for a change of clothes,

352
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:08,943
maybe a car, whatever cash
you have on you.

353
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,311
I need to disappear.

354
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:13,681
- You want my advice?
- No.

355
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:15,316
Turn yourself in.

356
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:17,318
Whatever it is you're doing,

357
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,621
just stop.

358
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:20,822
I mean, just because

359
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,391
there's a road
unfurling in front of you,

360
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:27,495
doesn't mean
you have to take it.

361
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:31,166
Well,
sorry to have bothered you.

362
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:34,436
For what it's worth,

363
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,870
it was good to see you.

364
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,343
Wait.

365
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,919
It's, uh, everything
I have in my wallet.

366
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:54,122
It's... I don't know.
A couple hundred dollars.

367
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,257
Thank you, Millie.

368
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:58,660
Enjoy your lunch.

369
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:00,495
Watercress soup
was always a favorite.

370
00:22:05,134 --> 00:22:06,668
I've called the police.
They'll be here any minute.

371
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:07,769
Get going.

372
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:09,137
Mother of
Matt Parkman's child,

373
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:10,138
let us explain.

374
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:13,641
Your baby is in danger.

375
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,176
Who are you?

376
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:17,745
Do you know
that your baby is special?

377
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,325
It started
during the eclipse,

378
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,927
just like it did
with his dad.

379
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:34,762
Are you here
about what Matt did?

380
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,699
Yes, we are heroes
like Matt Parkman.

381
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:40,301
He's not a hero.

382
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:43,805
He's a... terrorist.

383
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:45,940
Honey,
can you turn on the TV?

384
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,810
Good.

385
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,144
...A suicide attack
on the capitol building

386
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:52,280
by former Los Angeles
police officer Matt Parkman

387
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:54,983
was thwarted by federal
authorities Tuesday night.

388
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,085
Senator Nathan Petrelli
was present...

389
00:22:57,152 --> 00:22:59,687
I came straight home
when I saw this on the news.

390
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,155
Matt Parkman wouldn't.

391
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:02,390
Someone made him do that.

392
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,925
Yes, they want everyone
to think

393
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:05,126
that we are the terrorists

394
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:06,728
so they can justify
what they're doing.

395
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:07,729
Diabolical.

396
00:23:07,796 --> 00:23:09,063
"We are the terrorists"?

397
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:11,299
You mean like the people
that can read minds or whatever?

398
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:13,835
I am currently powerless,
but Ando...

399
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:19,607
People like us
are being arrested.

400
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:21,342
By who? The government?

401
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,278
Yes.
They're rounding us up.

402
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:24,812
And they're coming
for little Matt.

403
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,247
We were sent to help.

404
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:28,182
The government
is coming for my son?

405
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,817
He's just a baby.
He's no threat.

406
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:34,355
That must be the police.

407
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,991
I never called the police.

408
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:38,593
Janice Parkman?

409
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:40,128
Yes.

410
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:41,796
We have a warrant to bring
you and your child in

411
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:43,631
for questioning.

412
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:46,334
Uh, I assume
this is about my ex-husband.

413
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:47,936
Yes, ma'am.

414
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:49,771
Why do you need
to question my son?

415
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,940
He's never met his father,
and he can't talk.

416
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:55,109
The warrant is for you
and your child, ma'am.

417
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:57,512
Is the child home?

418
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,980
He's at the baby sitter's.

419
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:00,682
I could take you there
if you like.

420
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,150
That would be appreciated,
ma'am.

421
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:03,985
Okay,
I'll just get my things.

422
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,964
Search the house.

423
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,532
What? W-

424
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:31,709
* We're trapped.

425
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:33,706
* Hold him.

426
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,586
I'm sorry we couldn't
save you, baby Matt Parkman.

427
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:12,562
* Toddler Touch and Go.

428
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:15,776
* You touched me and made my power go.

429
00:25:16,143 --> 00:25:17,253
* Good, baby!

430
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:18,726
<i>Yatta!</i>

431
00:25:18,794 --> 00:25:22,463
Can you say <i>"yatta"?</i>

432
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:24,766
No? Oh, it's okay.

433
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,659
* Okay.

434
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:33,874
* Now to teleport to safety.

435
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:41,242
* Now to teleport to safety.

436
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:47,481
* Huh.

437
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:45,481
<i>You convinced them</i>
<i>I was Gwen Stefani?</i>

438
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:48,618
Uh, yeah.

439
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:51,821
It got you a good room, didn't it?

440
00:26:51,888 --> 00:26:53,322
How long have I been out?

441
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,624
Two days.

442
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,692
The doctors have been
pumping you full of antibiotics

443
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,827
to kill the infection,

444
00:26:57,894 --> 00:27:00,696
but nothin' but the best for Gwen.

445
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:03,299
I thought I was
duck-hunting Janice,

446
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,835
the "I'm an idiot with a gun" story.

447
00:27:05,902 --> 00:27:07,470
And who is duck-hunting Janice?

448
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:10,006
Um, Janice is, uh,

449
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:11,907
uh, Janice is my wife.

450
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,176
Well, she was.
She's my ex-wife.

451
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:17,079
So the idiot
with a gun story is true?

452
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:18,981
Uh, yeah,
except no one got shot.

453
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,951
Anyway, I needed
a believable back-story, so I-

454
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:23,719
You slotted me
into your ex-wife's life.

455
00:27:23,787 --> 00:27:26,856
Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

456
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:28,791
Why? Was that wrong?

457
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:32,928
No, I mean-
It's just enlightening.

458
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:35,164
You know, you needed
a believable back-story,

459
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:36,866
'cause you and me,
we don't really have one.

460
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:39,669
Yes, we do.

461
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:40,670
Do I have clothes?

462
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:42,004
Yeah, they're-

463
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:46,208
Matt, you had a dream
that we were married,

464
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:49,979
So you think that's a reason
for us to be together.

465
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:53,849
Turn around.

466
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,551
We are supposed
to be together,

467
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:56,619
and I didn't dream it.

468
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:57,987
I went on a...

469
00:27:58,055 --> 00:28:00,222
spirit... Walk.

470
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,757
You got baked in the desert.

471
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:04,827
That's not a lot to hang
a relationship on.

472
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:07,563
I'm hanging our relationship
on the fact that I love you.

473
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,632
Whatever we had or have,

474
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,801
it's all in your head.

475
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:13,369
I don't wanna be
your surrogate Janice.

476
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:14,437
No, no, you're not.

477
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:17,239
You're...

478
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:18,407
You're not.

479
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:20,509
It was nice meeting you, Matt,

480
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:23,579
and... that's the first time
I've ever said that to anybody

481
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,815
and actually meant it, so...

482
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:26,816
It was nice meeting you.

483
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:27,950
No, you have to stay.

484
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:29,685
You gotta stay here with me.

485
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:31,087
I mean,
what if they catch you?

486
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:32,955
I'm not gonna slow down
long enough

487
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:34,623
for anyone to catch me.

488
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:36,492
Not even you.

489
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:46,902
Westbound metroline
now boarding.

490
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,406
Departs in ten minutes.
Track eleven.

491
00:29:10,026 --> 00:29:12,328
We're sitting
next to each other.

492
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:14,029
Hope you don't mind.

493
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,332
Micah?

494
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,067
What are you doing here?

495
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,735
I'm Rebel.

496
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:24,607
Get over here.

497
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:26,308
What have you
gotten yourself into?

498
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:27,576
I'm helpin' people.

499
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:28,577
People like us.

500
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:29,712
I thought
we could help together.

501
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,147
- Micah-
- Listen.

502
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:32,314
I know you're not my mom,

503
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:34,951
but you don't have
anybody else.

504
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:39,321
Is something wrong?

505
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:42,591
I didn't know that it was you.

506
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,594
I led them right to you.

507
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:49,398
Who-you led who?

508
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:52,234
Wait, you're bait?

509
00:29:52,302 --> 00:29:54,303
I didn't know
that it was you.

510
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:56,372
Doesn't matter
who you thought it was.

511
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:58,908
How could you do that
to anybody?

512
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:01,477
I thought there was
a good chance they'd follow you.

513
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:04,814
I just didn't think
that you'd be in on it.

514
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:08,417
Attention, union station
passengers.

515
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:10,219
This way.
A gas leak has been detected

516
00:30:10,287 --> 00:30:12,354
in our basement
food court area.

517
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:15,624
A station-wide evacuation
is in progress.

518
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:30,828
Excuse me. Ma'am?

519
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:32,408
Can I help you?

520
00:30:32,475 --> 00:30:33,642
Ma'am?

521
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:46,297
You must have been
a boy scout.

522
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,665
What's the boy scout motto?

523
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:49,000
Be prepared?

524
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:50,735
Yeah, clearly you weren't
a boy scout.

525
00:31:50,802 --> 00:31:51,836
'Cause I'm a girl?

526
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:53,204
'Cause the first rule
of scout law

527
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:54,438
is to be trustworthy,

528
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:55,673
and, uh, you suck at that.

529
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:58,142
I know.

530
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,977
I'm not proud of myself.

531
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,345
I don't understand you.

532
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:03,547
You got into politics
to protect the civil liberties

533
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:04,982
of the everyday American.

534
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,117
God, you read my bio?

535
00:32:06,184 --> 00:32:08,052
I read everything
on you, okay?

536
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,654
I thought that meant
I knew you.

537
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,455
I thought that because
you looked like my mom-

538
00:32:11,523 --> 00:32:13,758
that I knew you.

539
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:16,594
If I met you
earlier in my political career,

540
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:19,263
maybe I'd be more
like my bio,

541
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:21,966
but I'm not that person.

542
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,234
I'm not your mom.

543
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:25,303
I know.

544
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,571
You're nothing like her.

545
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:29,573
My mom, who was
the everyday American,

546
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:30,574
was a hero.

547
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:32,610
You're just a politician.

548
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:33,744
Who are you? Che Guevara?

549
00:32:33,812 --> 00:32:35,379
Che Guevara
led a revolution.

550
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:36,380
This is a rebellion.

551
00:32:36,448 --> 00:32:37,548
So whose side are you on?

552
00:32:37,616 --> 00:32:39,383
And "mine" is not an answer.

553
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:56,534
Can you tell
the sprinklers what to do?

554
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:57,835
I can tell the fire alarm

555
00:32:57,903 --> 00:33:00,838
to tell the sprinklers
what to do.

556
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:04,141
Then tell them
to make it rain in here.

557
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,789
Find a way out.

558
00:33:18,857 --> 00:33:19,890
Come with me.

559
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,259
I can't.

560
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:24,128
Keep doing
what you're doing, Rebel.

561
00:33:24,196 --> 00:33:26,197
Go.

562
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:28,099
And Micah!

563
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,734
Stay ahead of the ice.

564
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:13,604
She said she had
a hell of a cold snap.

565
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:17,241
Any sign of Rebel?

566
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:18,409
No.

567
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,778
Don't worry,
baby Matt Parkman.

568
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:12,549
You will see your mother again
when it's all safe.

569
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:14,784
She'll be very proud of you.

570
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:15,952
You've been very brave.

571
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,921
You didn't cry even once.

572
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:23,860
But if you want to cry,
it's okay.

573
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:27,197
If you feel like crying,
you can.

574
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,432
But when time starts again,

575
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,701
you have to be brave.

576
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,837
Yes.

577
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:44,767
* Hiro! Run! Hiro?

578
00:36:44,907 --> 00:36:45,849
Your attention, please.

579
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:49,052
Bus 352 to San Bernardino
and Las Vegas is now departing.

580
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,420
Hiro?

581
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:52,445
* I stopped time.

582
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,578
* Toddler Touch and Go touched me...

583
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:56,208
* and made my power go.

584
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,733
* Great, you did it.

585
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:00,194
* Did you teleport us?

586
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:02,199
* No. I pushed you in that.

587
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,235
* 12 miles.

588
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,512
* Why didn't you just teleport us?

589
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,910
* Toddler Touch and Go...

590
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,613
* didn't touch and go all my powers.

591
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:13,812
* We saved Little Matt Parkman.

592
00:37:14,616 --> 00:37:16,976
* Now we have to save
Big Matt Parkman.

593
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,236
* We don't know where he is.

594
00:37:19,316 --> 00:37:20,996
* Then we will find him.

595
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:23,371
* Time is once again on our side.

596
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:46,676
Penny for your thoughts.

597
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:48,812
Since when did you start
paying people

598
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:50,815
for their thoughts?

599
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:53,983
And, more importantly,
how'd you find me?

600
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:56,252
You love Paris
like I love y-

601
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,088
Don't.

602
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:02,225
You got here awfully fast.

603
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:04,260
How'd you get here?

604
00:38:04,328 --> 00:38:05,595
I flew.

605
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,464
How'd you get here?

606
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,631
I ran on water.

607
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:15,672
So, you're
Mr. Concord now?

608
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,640
You read minds. You don't...

609
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,813
fly.

610
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:25,114
All right.

611
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:27,584
You... are flying.

612
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:34,591
I didn't know
you could fly.

613
00:38:34,658 --> 00:38:37,527
I didn't know
you could run on water.

614
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:39,195
I can run on anything.

615
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:42,765
Except air
and the vacuum of space.

616
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,767
Otherwise I'd be living
on the moon.

617
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:46,336
Oh, you see that?

618
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:48,471
We're learning new
and intriguing things

619
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:50,406
about each other.

620
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:53,977
That's the kinda thing
you can hang a relationship on.

621
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:56,312
Wanna go for a ride?

622
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,516
I'll show you Paris
like you've never seen it.

623
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,451
Once around the tower.

624
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:24,774
How high can we go?

625
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:25,842
As high as you wanna go.

626
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,143
You just have
to hold on to me.

627
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:37,453
You really would do anything
for me, wouldn't you?

628
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:39,622
Just say the word.

629
00:39:42,393 --> 00:39:45,895
Then let me go.

630
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,666
What?

631
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:54,203
We're still
in the hospital, aren't we?

632
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:55,371
And this is
all you in my head,

633
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:57,340
Trying to give me
a storybook ending.

634
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:03,948
I'm sorry.

635
00:40:05,015 --> 00:40:08,017
Don't be.

636
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:09,419
I'm not.

637
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:15,058
But... Matt,
you deserve the real thing,

638
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,695
not a fantasy.

639
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:21,998
I just wanted
to make you happy.

640
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:23,066
You did.

641
00:40:27,004 --> 00:40:28,605
Do one more thing for me?

642
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:33,244
Anything.

643
00:40:35,112 --> 00:40:36,646
Fly me to the moon.

644
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,756
so, what do you
wanna do now?

645
00:41:27,231 --> 00:41:29,999
