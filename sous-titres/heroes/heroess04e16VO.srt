2
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,878
You see what people want.

3
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:06,715
Their desires, their hopes.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,551
- Got your power.
- Isn't that interesting?

5
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,219
I know why you can't kill.

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,723
Hiro said you're going to die alone,
and it's haunting you.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,017
We all need people
who understand us, care for us.

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,852
- Who's she?
- The love of my life.

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,771
- He just shows up.
- He's stalking you?

10
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,024
- He does seem...
- Obsessed?

11
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,819
I had to protect you,
to get you away from him.

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,154
By kidnapping me?

13
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,241
You can never change the past.
It's bad, always!

14
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,951
Everything is connected.

15
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,245
If you wanna change one thing,
it's all you do.

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,915


17
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,084
I've come back in time
to save Charlie.

18
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,587
And this time,
I will defeat the brain man.

19
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,088


20
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,799


21
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,553
There's something I want you to see.
It's so magical, so beautiful.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,887
Let me show you.

23
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,473
If you're still unhappy,
I'll take you back to California.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,976
Did they really think
they were gonna get away with it?

25
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,146
- That we would just never find out?
- We shouldn't have done it.

26
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,691
I need time to grieve
without being reminded why.

27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,161
You wanna talk about it?

28
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,705
About what?

29
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,250
Life among the carnies,
the death of your father...

30
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,128
Either one of those
would be enough to mess me up.

31
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,631
I don't think
I'd know where to start...

32
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,427
Think it's one of those things
I have to figure out by myself.

33
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,351
Listen.

34
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,521
I'm not gonna pretend to know
what you're going through right now.

35
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,397
But I want you to know

36
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,191
that I'm here for you.

37
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,194
If you need anything.
Anything at all.

38
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,745
I have this review lesson thing.

39
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,208
I moved it to Bapst hall,
I have no idea where that is.

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,752
East quad.
Clear across campus.

41
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,630
Of course it is.

42
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,346
Excuse me.

43
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,306
Is this seat taken?

00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,209


46
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,838


47
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,174


48
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,014
How's it coming?

49
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,933
It's ready.

50
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,896
Remember, it'll only work
in the hands of one of us.

51
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,190
Luckily, you have Hiro and Ando now.

52
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,651
You sure I can't change your mind?

53
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,737
I broke a promise to a girl.

54
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,447
I need to make amends.

55
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,949
Then I guess this is it.

56
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,577
In our lives, when is it ever?

57
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,370
Thanks, Mohinder.

58
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,166
- Good luck.
- You too, Noah.

59
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,268
Gentlemen, I guess it's up to us.

60
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,285
Hello, carp.

61
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,954
Adam Monroe?

62
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,332
But you are dead.

63
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,003
- Am I dead?
- That's for the judge to decide.

64
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,047
- Judge?
- All rise.

65
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,301
The honorable judge
Kaito Nakamura presiding.

66
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,178


67
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,346
Be seated.

68
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,057


69
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,519
The world versus Hiro Nakamura,
Your Honor.

70
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,979
The what versus what?

71
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,441


72
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,694


73
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,279


74
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,240


75
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,201


76
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,120


77
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,597
Excuse me, is this
professor Yanno's review session?

78
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,891
Study group.

79
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,230
Ready to brainstorm?

80
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,277
What the hell are you doing here?

81
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,988
I came to learn.

82
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,198
How'd you sleep?

83
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,326
The dress is a gift.

84
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,203
- If you wanna change into something...
- A gift?

85
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,830
You kidnapped me,

86
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,499
brought me to...

87
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,961
I don't even know where we are
because you won't tell me.

88
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,337
You're right.

89
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,215
I never meant to upset you.
I'll take you back home.

90
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,591
Straight away.

91
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,304
What?
What are you smiling about?

92
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,348
Your face.
Just now...

93
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,143
It brought me back to
when I broke your record player.

94
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,273
You had this one song
you played over, and over.

95
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,654
I was just kidding around,
but I broke the arm.

96
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,365
- Remember?
- Yes.

97
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,493
- I remember.
- Good.

98
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,704
'cause there's something
I still want you to see.

99
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,374
The only thing
I'm interested in seeing

100
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,919
- is my own front door.
- Let me get you something to eat.

101
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,296
Then you'll be rid of me for good,
I promise.

102
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,969
This is how it always starts.
Breakfast becomes lunch,

103
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,470
lunch becomes dinner,

104
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,682
dinner turns into drinks,
and then...

105
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,184
I fixed your record player.

106
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,400
I broke it and then I fixed it.

107
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,862
I know what I've done wrong,
and I know how to make it good.

108
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,613
Scotch tape,

109
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,448
and wire hangers,

110
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,618
and loads of good intentions.

111
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,003
Fine.

112
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,005
Something to eat.

113
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,424
Then you take me home.

114
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,885
Good. Great.

115
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,890
He has a brain tumor.
In the parietal lobe.

116
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,308
The doctors in Japan
said it's inoperable, but...

117
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,019
We may not have a choice.

118
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,730
- He's my best friend. I can't just...
- Wait here.

119
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,442
- We'll find out what's happening.
- Please help him.

120
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,195
It is our intent to prove
that the defendant abused his power

121
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,697
to bend space and time selfishly

122
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,742
and repeatedly
for his own personal gain.

123
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,869
And with a blatant disregard

124
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,580
for the consequences
on the space-time continuum.

125
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,916


126
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,167


127
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,421


128
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,632


129
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,634
This is some bad dream
or tumor hallucination.

130
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,971
Let the record show the defendant
won't recognize this court.

131
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,765
This isn't a court, it's a diner.

132
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,477
Perhaps your honor could enter
a plea for the defendant if he refuses?

133
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,145


134
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,190


135
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,984


136
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,611


137
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,662


138
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,833
Mr. Monroe,
please call your first witness.

139
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,585


140
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,879
The prosecution calls
Kimiko Nakamura.

141
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,840


142
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,467
And Ando Masahashi.

143
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,355
Do you know how much
I would love to kill you?

144
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,315
Listen...

145
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:30,611
- I know you must hate me.
- You killed my father!

146
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,701
It seems like a lifetime ago.

147
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,537
But I'm a little off my game.

148
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,416
- You're gonna help me get it back.
- Says who?

149
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,711
Says this.

150
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,047
Your face showing up in ink
wasn't my choice.

151
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,882
It's destiny

152
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,343
showing me my desire.

153
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,888
- You actually thought that I would...
- Relax.

154
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,225
They told me I needed connection.

155
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,145
A friend.

156
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,732
I don't want to be alone.

157
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,153
And somehow
you're supposed to help me.

158
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,156
I wouldn't help you
if my life depended on it.

159
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,284
It's not your life
you should be concerned about.

160
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,507
Let's get this over with.

161
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,802
- You don't have to hurt Gretchen.
- I promise

162
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,972
you will see her again
just as soon as you help me

163
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,392
answer my question.
Here is what I've been thinking.

164
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,686
You and me.

165
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,857
We got a lot in common.
We're both adopted...

166
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,362
Abandoned
by parents who didn't want us.

167
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,698
And raised by parents

168
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,325
who didn't understand us.

169
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,995
- My parents understand me just fine.
- Stop lying to yourself.

170
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,206
Both of our dads
were cold-blooded killers.

171
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,167
Which is ironic,
because you and I...

172
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,921
cannot...

173
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,091
be killed.

174
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,052
I get it.
Okay, we have a few

175
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:21,305
arbitrary things in common.
What is your point?

176
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,684
My point is they're not arbitrary.

177
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,479
They're formative.

178
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,024
The basic building blocks
of our lives,

179
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,318
and we have the same

180
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,153
blocks.

181
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,905
Yet, here we are...

182
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,825
Content college co-ed,

183
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,119
and me.

184
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,580
How did we end up so different?

185
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,753
You want to know
what the difference is?

186
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,382
You're a psychopath.

187
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,928
Mystery solved.

188
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,519
You think this is a game?

189
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,107
This is my life.

190
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,609
You're supposed to help me.

191
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,322
Or don't you care
how many filets I slice your...

192
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,035
roommate into?

193
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:28,747
If you won't contribute,

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,209
I'll just have to take the answers
from your head.

195
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,129
You're gonna slice
my head open again?

196
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,798
I've evolved way beyond that.
My friend Lydia

197
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,426
gave me a much more
precise instrument.

198
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,469
She could read someone

199
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,930
just by touching them.

200
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,642
See into the very depths
of their soul.

201
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,644
Of course,

202
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,439
her methods
were a little hyper-erotic, but...

203
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,774
What the hell.

204
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,820
It is college, isn't it?

205
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,790
The dress suits you.

206
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,175
What's that?

207
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,219
A strawberry milkshake.

208
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,263
Your favorite.

209
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,562
That was a long time ago.

210
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,859
How about this one?

211
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,612
The last time
I crashed in your dorm room,

212
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,364
we talked all night.

213
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,449
Among other things.

214
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,167
We talked about your dream home.

215
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,461
That was the tequila talking.

216
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,258
"A peaceful cottage surrounded
by nature and happiness."

217
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,303
You're such a romantic.

218
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,475
Actually, that's something
I've admired about you.

219
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,647
But there comes a time
when you have to realize

220
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,733
that you're never gonna have
that cottage.

221
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,694
Says who?

222
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,453
Don't you look back at our time
together with a hint of fondness?

223
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,118
- What's your prognosis?
- Not good.

224
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,377


225
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,215


226
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,510


227
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,513


228
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,392


229
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,062
The witness has identified
Hiro Nakamura,

230
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,940
who's clearly and selfishly
interfered with the timeline.

231
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:42,900


232
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,651


233
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:47,404


234
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,325


235
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,952


236
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,830


237
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,375


238
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,919


239
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,504


240
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,963
Just so I'm clear...

241
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,382
On your personal scale
of temporal justice,

242
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,052
it's okay,
so long as no one gets hurt?

243
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:16,016
That is my definition.

244
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,352
That's good to know.

245
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,896
Because I believe
my next witness is here.

246
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,904
Just tell me where she is.

247
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,950
You've been holding out on me.

248
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,369
What are you talking about?

249
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,164
Why I was supposed to find you,
you and I are the same.

250
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,958
I am nothing like you.

251
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,085
You do exactly what I do.

252
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,254
You use this...

253
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,466
gift, this curse,
whatever it is, to build walls.

254
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,054
Make it impossible to actually connect
with another person.

255
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,182
Like Gretchen.

256
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,187
Those memory hits from your stuff
while I was tying her up...

257
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,816
have such a different context now.
Everything in that room is so full of...

258
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,403
Pauses.

259
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:11,196
What did you say?

260
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,032
Pauses.
All these moments

261
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,868
so ripe with

262
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,911
subtext.

263
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,123
"Can I borrow your book?"

264
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,335
"Cut my hand with these scissors."

265
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,214
All these interactions,

266
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:30,882
and you still

267
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,928
can't say the one thing
you really want to say to this girl.

268
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,096
Heck...

269
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,516
You keep this up,
you might end up alone forever too.

270
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,102
You don't know
what you're talking about.

271
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:43,896
I think I do.

272
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,648
The indestructible girl

273
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,360
who can't put herself
out there to get hurt.

274
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,491
What?
No angry retort?

275
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,039
You're right, you are off your game.

276
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,750
You just told me
exactly where she is.

277
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,301
How many people have I killed?

278
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,096
Hundreds, I suppose.

279
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,016
All of this because of an agreement
you made with the defendant?

280
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,727
He told me if I saved the waitress

281
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,605
I could have the cheerleader,
and anybody else I wanted to kill.

282
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,817
As long as you saved his girlfriend,
you could kill some more.

283
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,819
- Willy-nilly.
- Willy-nilly.

284
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,905
Seems to me that a lot of people

285
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,242
were hurt as a result
of Mr. Nakamura's time tampering.

286
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,619


287
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,121


288
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:46,083


289
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,251


290
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,837


291
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,340
Really?
Does this look right to you?

292
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,636


293
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,805


294
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,223


295
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,810
Tell me again,
who else met their death by your hand

296
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,645
after Hiro made this deal?

297
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,606
There was her.
And Eden... ish.

298
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,859
Two Primatech guards.

299
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,028
The melty guy, the mechanic,

300
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,280
Isaac Mendez, my mother,

301
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,949
some guy named Ted something...

302
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,867
And so on, and so on.

303
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,787
If Hiro was acting
out of an ability,

304
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,749
Perhaps he should have stopped
this vicious killer

305
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:29,793
- Before these countless murders...
- Sprague!

306
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,253
Ted Sprague.

307
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,756
So saving Charlie
wasn't for the heroic good.

308
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,134
It was for the good of Hiro.

309
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,929
Romantic or not,
Charlie was a good person!

310
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,849


311
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,184


312
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,772


313
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,692


314
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,734
Fair enough.

315
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,571
Then the prosecution
would like to call its final witness.

316
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,990
Charlie Andrews.

317
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,332
That's right.
I forgot we can't bring Charlie in,

318
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,210
because this world-improving person
is lost in time.

319
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,379
Now tell me,
how did that happen again?

320
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,506
I made a deal with a...

321
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,301
I'm sorry.
You'll have to speak up.

322
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,347
I made a deal with a villain,
and he double-crossed me.

323
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,475
Right.

324
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:30,312
Prosecution rests.

325
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,155
"A shake roof, wraparound porch,

326
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,117
"and a stone path leading to a lake

327
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,702
where the sun glistens
over the water."

328
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,914
- How'd you remember all of that?
- I have my ways.

329
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,583
I know all the details.

330
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,878
- By heart, it would seem.
- Hard to forget.

331
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,968
I was holding you close to me,
and the way you painted it,

332
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,432
It made it so real,
like it came from your soul.

333
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,309
Like it was you.

334
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:12,646
You always know
the right thing to say.

335
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,775
You have the perfect scrap
of poetry in your pocket to...

336
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,026
To what?

337
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:30,163
"With a big oak tree in the yard,
surrounded by wildflowers."

338
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,708
"And rocking chairs
on the deck to watch the sun set."

339
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,797
You remember.

340
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,485
"With a fireplace to keep us warm."

341
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,239
"And a summer breeze
to keep us cool."

342
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:09,035
How do you do it?

343
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,497
Every...

344
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,918
single... time.

345
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,936
This is so beautiful.

346
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,395
How did you do it?

347
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,189
My friends and I can do
the most amazing things.

348
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,150
Look.
There's your dream cottage.

349
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,527
No more traveling.
We'll make it a real home.

350
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:44,488
For me, for you.
If you'll have me.

351
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,495
You said you couldn't join a carnival.
And now you don't have to.

352
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,916
There's no more carriage homes,
no more main homes...

353
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,251
Just that.

354
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,504
Away from everything.
It's what you talked about.

355
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,964
It could be our life.

356
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:10,639
I can't live here.

357
00:23:12,487 --> 00:23:14,768
- But you said...
- I know, I know what I said.

358
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,206
It's just...

359
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:18,839
- I didn't think you'd actually...
- Actually do it?

360
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,192
But...

361
00:23:21,678 --> 00:23:22,678
I mean...

362
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:25,551
This dress, and the...

363
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:27,068
milkshake, and...

364
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,831
All of this, this is a...

365
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:33,477
- fantasy.
- And I made it come true.

366
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:35,075
For you.

367
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:37,708
For you.

368
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:40,464
This is your fantasy.

369
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,137
And it's...

370
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:46,519
it's beautiful.
And I'm happy for you.

371
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,731
But it isn't me.

372
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:55,444
My life isn't here.

373
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:59,896
- But I changed everything for...
- Don't tell me you did all this for me.

374
00:24:00,146 --> 00:24:01,398
Please, don't...

375
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,735
Don't tell me this was all for me.

376
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:13,327
Of course not.

377
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,246
Listen,

378
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,910
I should get you back home.

379
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,222
Thank you for indulging me.

380
00:24:22,236 --> 00:24:23,628
No, it was really...

381
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,328
It was really nice to see you again.

382
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,202
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

383
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:56,912
All things considered.

384
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,262
I'm so sorry, this is all my fault.

385
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:01,769
You never should've gotten
caught up in it.

386
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:04,674
I'm just...
I'm happy you're here.

387
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,037
And that it's over.

388
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,294
It is over, isn't it?

389
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,855
He's not done...

390
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:24,214
Somewhere out in the open?

391
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:26,639
He'll be expecting that,
he's trying to flush us out.

392
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:28,106
How do you know?

393
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:30,831
'cause apparently
I get the way he thinks.

394
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,408
- Someone's coming!
- In here.

395
00:25:41,768 --> 00:25:43,343
Sylar? The Sylar?

396
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,554
Yes. Well, no.

397
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,921
Kind of the emo-apologist version.

398
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,217
He's had me trying to figure out
what his issues are.

399
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,935
Seriously?
How'd that go?

400
00:25:56,444 --> 00:25:57,844
Pencil in the eye.

401
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:04,229
Listen, I'm sorry.

402
00:26:05,114 --> 00:26:06,114
It's okay.

403
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:08,471
Getting used
to being all perils of Pauline.

404
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:09,776
Not about that.

405
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
Well, yes, about that.
But...

406
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:16,605
About breakfast.

407
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:21,663
About sometimes keeping you
at arm's length.

408
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:24,546
It's cool.
Are you kidding?

409
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,585
- If you don't want to...
- I do want to.

410
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:29,079
I just... I'm scared.

411
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:30,793
And I get afraid

412
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:33,107
that I'm gonna get hurt,

413
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:35,943
and so I use my specialness to...

414
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:40,551
build these walls, instead of,
you know, jumping off bridges.

415
00:26:42,463 --> 00:26:44,083
I suck at metaphors, but

416
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,101
what I'm trying to say is that...

417
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:48,677
It's okay, really.

418
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,942
No, it's not.

419
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:55,203
This guy, Sylar,

420
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,498
he sat there and told me
that we're...

421
00:27:00,258 --> 00:27:02,608
very much alike, and he's not wrong.

422
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,250
And I'm afraid that I'm gonna end up
alone for the rest of my life like him.

423
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:10,003
And I don't know how to fix it.

424
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:14,841
Do you want to talk about it?

425
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:19,870
I like to think of myself as
Just a girl who...

426
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:21,389
happens to have powers.

427
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:25,335
And it's just one thing
in a list of attributes...

428
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:28,774
Loyal, friendly, regenerative,

429
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:30,713
good skin, you know?

430
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
You do have good skin.

431
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,812
But when you put the chips
down and life gets tough,

432
00:27:39,978 --> 00:27:43,394
I hide behind that one label,
that one...

433
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:45,098
attribute.

434
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,342
And I close myself off.

435
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:51,337
Man,

436
00:27:52,492 --> 00:27:54,172
no wonder Sylar's so messed up.

437
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:58,537
I can only imagine
what having a bunch of...

438
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,617
excuses could do
to someone's humanity.

439
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:04,669
Maybe that's his answer.

440
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:09,104
In order to become human again,
he has to get rid of all of his powers.

441
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:12,176
Yeah, maybe.

442
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:20,211
Now was that so hard?

443
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,022
You son of a bitch.

444
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:24,077
Where is she?

445
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,299
It's dinnertime.

446
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,417
I imagine
she's right where you left her.

447
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:33,211
You never took her?

448
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,565
Like I said,

449
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:40,885
I've been having
a little trouble being myself.

450
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:07,579
- You're okay!
- Yeah!

451
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,997
Of course I'm okay.

452
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:12,401
Well,
some guy stole my backpack, but...

453
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:14,174
- But what's with you?
- Nothing,

454
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm fine and then you're here.

455
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,547
And you're all right.

456
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,186
- You're acting really weird.
- I'm sorry.

457
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,213
I'm really lucky to have you.

458
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,763
And I'm sorry about this morning.

459
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,756
Forget it.
You know me,

460
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:30,864
impulsive Gretchen wants to
hold hands so she does it.

461
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:35,217
I know. I love that.
I wanna be more like that, and not be

462
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:36,441
beholden to

463
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:40,862
any label, or definition,
or who I'm supposed to be.

464
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:42,482
I just...

465
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:46,179
I wanna hold your hand.

466
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:56,202
- People are gonna start to talk.
- Let them talk.

467
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:58,004
Talking's good.

468
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,425
In fact, I could use some talking
if you still have a sympathetic ear.

469
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:06,417
I, in fact,

470
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,139
have two ears.

471
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:11,992
Come on.

472
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,460


473
00:30:58,338 --> 00:30:59,399


474
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,818


475
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:02,902


476
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:04,920


477
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,781


478
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:10,827


479
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,299


480
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,466


481
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:28,511


482
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:32,598


483
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,557


484
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:38,228


485
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:40,629


486
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:43,317


487
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,446


488
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:49,547


489
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:50,908


490
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:55,580


491
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,928


492
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:02,920


493
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,882


494
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:07,676


495
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:12,305


496
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:15,725


497
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,935


498
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,237


499
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:25,660


500
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,447
Objection, your honor! He's reciting
the opening to quantum leap.

501
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,077


502
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,650


503
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,712


504
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:51,045


505
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:52,887


506
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,942


507
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:58,584


508
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:04,230


509
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:10,633


510
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:14,596


511
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,326
We need to shock him.
Give him 200 joules.

512
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:18,996


513
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,206


514
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:23,167
No response.

515
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,017
- 240.
- Bring it up.

516
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:27,714
Charging. Clear!

517
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:30,508
Still nothing. Start compression.

518
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:32,760
We're losing him.

519
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:42,061
- Still no pulse, we're losing him.
- Let's shock him again.

520
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,929


521
00:34:50,852 --> 00:34:53,216


522
00:34:56,795 --> 00:35:01,113


523
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:08,971


524
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:14,112


525
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:24,995


526
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:33,881
Not so fast, carp.

527
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:43,556


528
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,876


529
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:51,347


530
00:35:58,106 --> 00:35:59,357


531
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,855


532
00:36:08,116 --> 00:36:10,208


533
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,839


534
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:46,556


535
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:52,278


536
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:54,817


537
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,330


538
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,431


539
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,146


540
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:18,149


541
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:29,490


542
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:32,233


543
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:40,299


544
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,678


545
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,426
- We got a pulse.
- He's coming back.

546
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,178
He's rising.

547
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:49,753
Is something wrong, sir?

548
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:53,039
Yes, something is wrong.

549
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:01,657
Am I scaring you?

550
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:07,350
Do I look scary?

551
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:09,096
Sir, I just...

552
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:12,293
You don't think I can see
how you're looking at me right now?

553
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,910
That I'm different?

554
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:19,345
Looking down your nose at me?
Like I'm not good enough!

555
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:24,862
I'm done trying
to change myself for you,

556
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Trying to fit into your world,

557
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:31,619
Play by your rules.

558
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,873
From now on,
