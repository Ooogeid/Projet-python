00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,901
What did you just call me?

364
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:02,534
[Slurp]

365
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,000
Have you killed
many people?

366
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:11,000
How is that
any of your business?

367
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,300
I guess it's not.

368
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,133
Bennet.

369
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,934
Let me talk to him first.

370
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,634
Alone.

371
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,667
You sure?

372
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:25,801
I am.

373
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,167
He trusts me.

374
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,133
What are you doing here?

375
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,434
I'm sorry i lied to you.

376
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:40,167
I only have a second.
You have to listen to me.

377
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,901
Are they forcing you
to do this?

378
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:42,901
Do they have molly?

379
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:44,968
Nobody is forcing me
to do anything.

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,567
I'm here to ask you
to give us claire.

381
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:50,567
<i>We need her blood.</i>

382
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,467
You've gone native.

383
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,167
Are you kidding me?

384
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,934
She'll be returned to you
safe, unharmed.

385
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:59,100
You have my word.

386
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,868
No offense, mohinder,

387
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,801
But your word
isn't what it used to be.

388
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,267
Claire is very important
to the work we're doing.

389
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,701
She can save lives.

390
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:09,033
"The work we're doing."
You sound like me ten years ago.

391
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,567
This is what they do:
they indoctrinate you.

392
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:13,834
I couldn't have been
more clear about this

393
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:15,300
When you agreed to go in.

394
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,400
They're not who
you think they are.

395
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,501
They are not
getting claire.

396
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:22,701
I have to do
what i think is right.

397
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:24,167
Start driving.

398
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,667
Please.

399
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:29,701
Dad!

400
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:32,267
Mom?!

401
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,434
Lyle!

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,868
Aah!

403
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,834
Claire?
Mom!

404
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,267
This guy showed up
at my school.

405
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,767
He knew our real name.
What?

406
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,100
Dad was right.

407
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,234
I messed up,
and they found us.

408
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:50,400
We gotta go.
Go where?

409
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:51,601
What is this?

410
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:53,234
<i>That's why your father's</i>

411
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:55,467
Been acting so strangely--
He thinks that's gonna happen.

412
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:56,968
<i>Isaac mendez...</i>

413
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,167
He was a very
talented artist,

414
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,901
And incredibly accurate.

415
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,167
Good to see you again,
sandra.

416
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,868
You know him?

417
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:07,334
Yeah.

418
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,267
He was the regional
sales manager

419
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,234
Of primatech paper.

420
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:21,667
So who's your partner?

421
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:22,868
Excuse me?

422
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,300
Company policy.

423
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:26,834
One of them, one of us.

424
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,767
Who's yours?

425
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,234
Elle, huh?

426
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:38,634
You know her?

427
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:41,701
Oh, yeah.

428
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,501
Hey, you.

429
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,601
Uhh!

430
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:10,801
Ohh!

431
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:12,267
Uhh! Ohh...

432
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,934
You lie to me,
betray me.

433
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,334
You come after my daughter.

434
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:25,234
How did you think
it was gonna end?

435
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,000
<i>Mr. Butler...</i>

436
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,934
What are you doing?

437
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:45,167
No one's taking
my little girl.

438
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,434
Uhh!

439
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,300
Sandra! Claire!

440
00:22:58,534 --> 00:22:59,501
Uhh! He took claire.

441
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:01,067
Your old boss bob.

442
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,133
What the hell is going on?

443
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:03,300
It's okay.

444
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,467
We're gonna get her back.

445
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:05,667
How, noah?

446
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,534
I've got collateral.

447
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,601
What do you mean,
collateral?

448
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:10,734
Hi, mrs. Butler.

449
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:15,200
It's good to, uh...
see you again.

450
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:19,767
Did you pack mr. Muggles'
doggy bath?

451
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,667
I need to speak
to your father.

452
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:42,400
What do you think--
This is my first day?

453
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:46,601
Aah!

454
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,634
Stings like a bitch,
doesn't it?

455
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,668
I know all about
your ability, elle.

456
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:05,768
You don't know
anything about me.

457
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,601
I was there.

458
00:24:07,634 --> 00:24:09,634
When your father
first brought you in.

459
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:12,000
<i>You were a normal girl.</i>

460
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,467
<i>Unicorns and rainbows.</i>

461
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:16,800
<i>And then they started
the testing.</i>

462
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:20,701
<i>The human brain isn't built
to take that much electricity.</i>

463
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:22,601
You poor girl.

464
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:25,100
My father would never
let that happen.

465
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,301
Your father
was leading the charge.

466
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,301
I don't remember
any of that.

467
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:36,501
<i>No memories, huh?</i>

468
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:39,067
Kind of like someone
took them away?

469
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,768
<i>Why do you think</i>

470
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,234
I never let the company
anywhere near claire?

471
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,200
<i>I didn't want her</i>

472
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:49,567
To become you.

473
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:52,234
<i>Now i need
to talk to your father</i>

474
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:54,067
<i>To arrange a trade.</i>

475
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,467
<i>Claire for you.</i>

476
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,867
What if he doesn't
wanna make a deal?

477
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,833
You'd be surprised what a father
would do for his daughter.

478
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:13,167
Elle, where are you?

479
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,334
<i>(Noah)
you touch my daughter
and i'll kill yours.</i>

480
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,267
And then i'll kill you.

481
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:18,467
<i>(Bob)
noah?</i>

482
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,768
We'll be at the imperial
beach parking lot

483
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,067
<i>In two hours.</i>

484
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,567
Well, looks like
you and i

485
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,867
Are going to the beach.

486
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,867
<i>I'll do whatever
you want, okay?</i>

487
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,534
Just promise me
you'll leave my dad alone.

488
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,734
I wish it were that easy.

489
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,833
Unfortunately,
he's got my daughter.

490
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,933
Let me talk to him.
He'll listen to me.

491
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:42,867
He's not big
on the listening.

492
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,867
And once he sets his mind,
it's stuck.

493
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,367
Which is why we gave you
to him in the first place.

494
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:50,200
We thought he would
be loyal to the end.

495
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:52,967
Turns out we were right.

496
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:58,234
It's too bad, really.

497
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:01,467
You'd be an excellent
addition to the team, claire.

498
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:04,067
You, your blood.

499
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,134
You can help
a lot of people.

500
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,701
Good.
Take my blood.

501
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,800
Take as much as you want,
but leave my dad alone.

502
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,401
No one has to die.

503
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:26,734
Thanks for your help,
west.

504
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:28,167
Now go on home
to your family.

505
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,634
No way!

506
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,067
I'm going with you.

507
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,134
No, it's too dangerous.

508
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,833
Exactly, and i'm the quickest way
To get claire out of there.

509
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:40,668
All right.

510
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:42,501
You can wait for me
in the car, okay?

511
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,434
<i>(Sandra)
they say girls
tend to find boys</i>

512
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:51,200
Just like their dads.

513
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:52,668
Because he can fly?

514
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:55,200
No, her real dad.

515
00:29:55,234 --> 00:29:58,200
<i>You.</i>

516
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:00,967
All he cares about
is protecting her.

517
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,034
If anything happens...

518
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:15,434
<i>Nothin' is gonna happen,</i>

519
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:18,334
Except you
bringing Claire back.

520
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:43,067
<i>Of all of them...</i>

521
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,100
I never expected
it would be you.

522
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,768
Hey!

523
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,833
Kaito! Kaito!

524
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,833
Kaito!

525
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:20,834
Ando...

526
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,067
If you visit me one more time,
detective parkman,

527
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,334
I'll expect you to make
an honest woman out of me.

528
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:10,467
That is the plan
actually.

529
00:33:10,501 --> 00:33:12,933
[Thinking]
are you going to try
to read my mind again?

530
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:17,601
I knew your father
when he could do it.

531
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:19,334
I'm even less impressed
with you.

532
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:21,467
<i>Those marks that you have
all over you,</i>

533
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,867
My father made you do that
to yourself, didn't he?

534
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,434
<i>Did you know him</i>

535
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,334
When his mind reading
became something more?

536
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:31,100
When pull became push,
and then he realized

537
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,634
He could put a thought
into anyone's head?

538
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:36,833
Don't do this.

539
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:42,734
[Thinking]
you are gonna answer
Every question
i have truthfully.

540
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:44,534
For once.

541
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:51,367
Who really killed
kaito nakamura?

542
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:56,501
<i>It was adam.
Adam?
Monroe?</i>

543
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,967
<i>Your son told me
that you and your friends</i>

544
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,234
Locked him up 30 years ago.

545
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:01,000
Why?
He was dangerous.

546
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:03,034
Dangerous how?
Like a bomb?
No, worse.

547
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,534
We thought he was just
able to heal.

548
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,000
Cellular regeneration.

549
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:08,301
Like claire,
your granddaughter.

550
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:10,933
<i>What we didn't know
is that if your cells</i>

551
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,301
Continually regenerate,

552
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,434
After a while,
you stop growing old.

553
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,501
What's old?

554
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:19,067
400 years.

555
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:24,134
Do you know
where adam is now?

556
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,434
All i know is
that he wants revenge

557
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:26,800
For locking him up,
and he's not gonna rest

558
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,134
Until all of us are dead.

559
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,668
All of you are,
except for you, bob,

560
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:30,967
<i>My dad,
and this woman in the photo.</i>

561
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,534
<i>Who is this woman?</i>

562
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:35,100
Please...don't do this.

563
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:36,501
I need you to tell me
the truth.

564
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,501
The truth...

565
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,800
The truth...
is that our generation

566
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:43,167
Mortgaged our souls
to protect yours.

567
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,833
Show a little respect
for that.

568
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:49,234
Get over your daddy issues
and leave us be!

569
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:53,367
That's all i want.
Believe me.

570
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:55,933
But adam is still out there,
and this woman is on his list.

571
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:01,734
[Thinking]
tell me the truth.

572
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:04,301
Who is she?

573
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,601
All she wants
is to be left alone.

574
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,768
I made her a promise.

575
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:17,534
If you take
this secret from me,

576
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,334
You're not just
like your father...

577
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,768
You are him.

578
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,768
What kind of car
do you drive?

579
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,367
Excuse me?

580
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:43,167
I know you can fly,
but you're still a teenager.

581
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,234
<i>You do have a car, right?</i>

582
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,467
<i>Yeah, it's a piece
of crap suv.</i>

583
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,800
I drove a '52 citroen
when i was your age.

584
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,267
Oh, those things
are awesome.

585
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,167
Now once we get Claire,

586
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,634
<i>You fly her out
immediately.</i>

587
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,200
No matter what else happens.

588
00:36:11,234 --> 00:36:12,634
You understand me?

589
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:14,267
Yes, sir.

590
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:22,833
It doesn't have to be
this way, noah.

591
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:53,601
Dad, the painting!

592
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:03,734
Aah!
Claire!

593
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:12,534
Elle!

594
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:16,701
No matter what i do...

595
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,768
<i>We'll always be running.</i>

596
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,301
But if you die, bob...

597
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:26,534
The company dies with you.

598
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:29,267
<i>(Mohinder)
please, don't do this.</i>

599
00:38:30,368 --> 00:38:35,301
The last thing
i really said to my dad...

600
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:38,467
Was "i hate you."

601
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,234
You didn't mean it.

602
00:38:42,268 --> 00:38:43,867
No, i did.

603
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:49,034
I keep playing it
over and over.

604
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:54,700
How i'll never get a chance
to take it back.

605
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,067
Holy--

606
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:03,018
To be continued...
