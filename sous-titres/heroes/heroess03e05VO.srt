from a higher power.

543
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:38,300
We heard
about what you are doing.

544
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:39,634
Sign us up.

545
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:41,567
I'm not convinced.

546
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:43,401
We have changed.
We are badasses now.

547
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,367
Yes, we are very badass.

548
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,933
When do we start?

549
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,467
Not so fast.

550
00:33:49,534 --> 00:33:52,267
You have to prove
yourself worthy.

551
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:53,701
How do we do that?

552
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,134
You're the one
with the powers?

553
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Yes.

554
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,567
I control time and space.

555
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,434
Cool.

556
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:10,234
Kill the other one.

557
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,434
(Hiro & daphne)
kill ando?

558
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:14,467
Yeah, he has no powers.

559
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:16,567
What good is he to us?

560
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:20,567
You kill him,
you are badass.

561
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:30,067
I'm sorry, my friend.

562
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,067
I must make
some sacrifices...

563
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:34,501
To save the world.

564
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:42,067
[Gasps]

565
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:45,367
Hiro.

566
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:07,701
We'll talk more
when i come home, okay?

567
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:11,434
Claire, wait.

568
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,601
I know you're--
You're disappointed,

569
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:19,767
But i did
what i had to do...for us.

570
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:24,300
She doesn't believe
a word you're saying.

571
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,167
She knows exactly
what you did back there,

572
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:27,467
Why didn't take down
stephen canfield

573
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:28,500
When you had the chance.

574
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,233
Nobody's talking to you.

575
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,901
<i>Claire finally sees you
for what you are--A user.</i>

576
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:36,534
<i>Isn't that right, claire?</i>

577
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,434
You used her to try to find
that poor man.

578
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,834
Then you used him
to try to kill me

579
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:42,167
Because to you...

580
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:45,267
I'm nothing but a monster.

581
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:48,601
He doesn't see
our humanity, claire.

582
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:51,434
<i>He never will.</i>

583
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,001
Claire, wait.

584
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,767
You're not gonna listen
to him, are you?

585
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,801
The man is
a deranged sociopath.

586
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:00,200
He's a killer.
He's a monster.

587
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:01,968
Yes.

588
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,467
And you are
my daughter.

589
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:06,634
And everything i do

590
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,901
Is to protect you.

591
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,034
To protect this family.

592
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,133
Tell me
you understand that.

593
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,968
I understand.

594
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:29,233
It's all gonna be okay.

595
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:33,867
I promise.

596
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:36,400
Mom.

597
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:38,267
<i>(Sandra)
claire!</i>

598
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:40,934
Thank god.
I was so worried.

599
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:42,734
Are you okay?

600
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,100
'Cause if you are,
you are so grounded.

601
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm sorry.

602
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:48,267
I'm just glad
meredith found you.

603
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:52,267
Meredith?

604
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:56,934
<i>(Man)
enjoying your dinner,
my dear?</i>

605
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,001
<i>Eat.</i>

606
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:11,100
Hmm!

607
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:19,200
Now...
give me a sweet kiss.

608
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:20,667
Go to hell, you filthy--
Ah!

609
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,200
Mmm.

610
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:36,300
Oh.

611
00:37:58,701 --> 00:38:00,767
[Woman screams]

612
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,267
My god.

613
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,767
[Gasps]

614
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:37,167
Peter, tell me
you didn't do this, please.

615
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:42,567
Oh!

616
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,901
Ohh!

617
00:38:44,968 --> 00:38:46,300
<i>(Man)
hello, angela.</i>

618
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:49,901
No...it can't be.

619
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:52,068
You can see the future.

620
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,534
I can't have that.

621
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:55,701
It's too dangerous.

622
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,434
No, you won't succeed.
I'll stop you.

623
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,634
Don't be ridiculous.

624
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:04,367
You won't even
be able to move.

625
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:12,968
[Heartbeat]

626
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:16,200
(Man)
you won't even
be able to move.

627
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:32,534
You're late.
Have you completed your task?

628
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:37,300
They're onboard.
Even the japanese guy.

629
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:40,100
Look, i'm not happy
about what happened.

630
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,300
That's not
what i signed up for.

631
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:43,767
I'm not a killer.

632
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:45,434
It's all part
of making the world

633
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,267
A better place, daphne.

634
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:50,834
No pain, no gain.

635
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:51,968
There's another one

636
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:53,767
You're going
to have to recruit.

637
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:57,001
I'm afraid he's going to be
the most difficult.

638
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,734
<i>Matt parkman?</i>

639
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:06,934
What's his thing?

640
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:10,400
He has the ability
to alter your mind.

641
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:13,200
Put thoughts
into your head.

642
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:16,834
Make you see things
that aren't there.

643
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:19,034
Speaking of which,

644
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,400
I finally figured out what's
been bugging me about you.

645
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:27,068
I'm fast.
Real fast.

646
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,534
I can sneak up
on everybody.

647
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:33,100
I can't sneak up on you.

648
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,167
I knew it!

649
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,100
You're not really there.

650
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:48,167
It's not
your concern, daphne.

651
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:49,968
Just bring me parkman.

652
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:56,034
Guess i don't really have
a choice, do i?

653
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,300
[Monitor beeping]

654
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:34,300
The team
is coming together nicely.

655
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:40,968
Everything went fine.
Perfect with nathan.

656
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:42,534
I messed with his head.

657
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,034
I gave him
visions of linderman,

658
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,601
Just like you asked.

659
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:48,901
Now he thinks
he's doing god's work.

660
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:51,567
Yes.

661
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,701
<i>Very real.</i>

662
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:58,734
Daphne is spreading
the word.

663
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,567
We're building an army,
just like you--

664
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:04,934
Sorry.

665
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:08,467
Knox called
just a few minutes ago.

666
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:13,334
He'll have adam monroe here
by tomorrow.

667
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Right.

668
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,767
Absolutely.

669
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:21,001
Whatever you say goes,
mr. Petrelli.
