1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,509
I think I found someone
to fill Joseph's shoes.

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,965
- How do I look?
- Like everybody else.

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,009
- I've never met you before.
- You pulled me from the 424 bus

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,430
after it crashed at Lexington and 53rd.
What made you become a paramedic?

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,932
I wanted to save lives
instead of watching them pass.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,101
You're exactly
who I'd hoped you'd be.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,195
Hi, I need a file.

8
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:22,097
Who are you listening to?

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,108
I'm talking to myself.

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,801
Seriously, what are you?
A vampire? An alien?

11
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,078
Some kind of
freakish government experiment?

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,251
I saw this girl on YouTube.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,999
She was born with this gene that
doesn't let her feel any pain.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,126
I didn't tell her,
she just found out.

15
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,584
She's not the enemy.

16
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,130
She's just a girl,
the only friend that I've made.

17
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,299
This is my mess,
and I'm gonna clean it up.

18
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,761
I'm tired of keeping
this secret to myself.

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,766
Do you wanna be my roommate?

20
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,850
To closure.

21
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,103
To closure.

22
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,864
Have a little too much to drink?

23
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,104
On the ground!
Hands behind your head.

24
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:50,558
Down! Now!

25
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,293

26
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:20,729
Mind your backs.

27
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:22,915
Watch your back, Lydia.

28
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:37,224
Mrs. Comey's unparalleled
blueberry waffles.

29
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,826
This is my favorite part of the day.

30
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:42,918
It's full of possibility.

31
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:46,447
Before the inevitable monkey wrenches
come looking for us.

32
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:48,756
But more than anything...

33
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,258
it's about being with all of you.

34
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:53,366
I know grace is a supper thing,

35
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:57,084
but every morning
I thank heaven and earth

36
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,186
for our family.

37
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,652
Sadly, Joseph's death
has left us an empty seat,

38
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,336
a broken circle,

39
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:07,684
but I feel like we're
on the way to mend it.

40
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,483
There are lost lambs out there.

41
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,487
They're like us, but they're hiding.

42
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,738
Alone.

43
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:19,181
Pretending to be
that which they are not.

44
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:20,728
It's sad, pathetic.

45
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:24,120
These people, they desperately
need what we have.

46
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:28,586
Understanding, unconditional love,
family, trust...

47
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:31,116
who are we to deny anyone that?

48
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:34,658
Today's an important day
for us... our family.

49
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,438
And for one of them too.

50
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,731
Because by day's end,

51
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,520
we will have a full table again.

52
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:48,688
Eat.

53
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:58,474
Okay, I gotta ask, what's
with the ear-to-ear, smiley?

54
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,258
This...

55
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:03,741
this is cool.

56
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:06,549
- Drinking chocolate milk?
- No. Me.

57
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:07,762
In college.

58
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:10,929
In a dining hall with my
new college roommate.

59
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:13,881
No snipers shooting at me,
no serial killers hunting me...

60
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:16,136
it's a refreshing change of pace.

61
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:18,282
Yeah, tedium can be such a thrill.

62
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,388
I have been chasing
normal life forever,

63
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:23,069
and I've finally caught it.

64
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:26,269
I mean, don't get me wrong,
the chocolate milk is awesome.

65
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:28,767
But right here, right now...

66
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,105
is full of possibilities.

67
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,896
I can be anyone.

68
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,366
Claire Bennet.

69
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:36,985
You can't escape your destiny.

70
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:38,777
I am Becky Taylor.

71
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,700
Psi Alpha Rush Chair.
Your mom, Sandra's sorority.

72
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,584
Your mom was in a sorority?

73
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,156
She totally was.

74
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,328
- Hi, Becky.
- Hi.

75
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,768
National has you
on a list of legacies,

76
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:51,850
but we haven't heard
from you about rush.

77
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:54,599
Oh, I'm not really sure
I'm a sorority girl.

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,304
Neither was I at first.

79
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,042
Open rush starts today at the house.

80
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,633
Why don't you come by.


81
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:04,261
- No strings. Why not?
- She's gonna have to pass.

82
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:06,751
Well, great.

83
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:08,133
I'll see you there.

84
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Thanks.

85
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:14,856
Isn't this what we've been talking
about possibilities?

86
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,833
I think my mom is still friends
with her sorority sisters.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,821
It's just a social crutch for people
who can't make their own friends.

88
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,486
She said "no strings attached."

89
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:28,595
What's the harm?

90
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:32,916
The harm is they get you alone
and replace you with Stepford-Claire.

91
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:37,337
Well, OK,
how about I don't go alone?

92
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,339
Yeah!
No.

93
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:40,807
No, no way.

94
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:44,260
Please? Pretty please?
I'll be your best friend.

95
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,971
I'll throw in a chocolate milk.

96
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,854
What would Stepford-Gretchen
wear to one of these things?

97
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:04,781
Captain Lubbock?

98
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:07,196
I'm Dr Gibson. Madeline.

99
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,098
Where's Doctor Verheiden?

100
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,412
Retired.

101
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:12,959
You're new?

102
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:15,923
I've been interning with Dr. Verheiden
at A.U. for three years.

103
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,448
Specializing in psychopathy,
malignant narcissism disorder...

104
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:21,130
How many actual real-life criminal
psych consults have you done?

105
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,814
Including this one?

106
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:29,931
So, who is he?

107
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,156
We have no idea.
And neither does he.

108
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:35,881
Found him last night
covered in dirt, blood.

109
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,633
Bullet holes in his jacket.

110
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,162
The guy doesn't know his name,
what day it is, nothing.

111
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:43,987
- Amnesia can be very complicated.
- Let me simplify it for you.

112
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,531
Take out your rubber stamp
and mark this guy "insane."

113
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,367
They don't give us stamps.

114
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,617
I'm gonna need to talk to him.

115
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:13,302
My name's Dr Gibson.

116
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,018
I'm here to help you.

117
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,644
Can you tell me your name?

118
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
- I...
- There's been a lot of that.

119
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,163
Starts and stops.

120
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,788
Mostly stops.

121
00:07:36,473 --> 00:07:38,073
What are you thinking?

122
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:40,839
- Could be an aphasia.
- Could be a what?

123
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,796
Any trauma to the head
could result in brain damage.

124
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,631
He was like this when we found him.

125
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:48,601
Can you tell me
what happened to you?

126
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,930
It was... I was... in...

127
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:57,060
the forest.

128
00:07:58,915 --> 00:07:59,915
Lost.

129
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:03,813
And then I was...

130
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:12,825
Take your time.

131
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:16,894
Walking...

132
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,884
and now I'm here...

133
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:21,466
in this room.

134
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,469
In this tiny room...

135
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:25,834
I...

136
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:30,017
Captain, can you do me
a favor and unlock these cuffs?

137
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:34,121
I don't make a habit of locking myself
in with unrestrained lunatics.

138
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:36,349
Then can you leave me
your keys on the way out?

139
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:52,406
Let's clean you up.
Get you some clothes.

140
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:54,556
Maybe something to drink.

141
00:08:56,706 --> 00:08:59,413
I'm gonna help you as best I can.

142
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,096
Help you figure out who you are.
Put the pieces together.

143
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:04,877
Promise.

144
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:18,593
Emma.

145
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,477
I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

146
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:25,164
Are you still seeing things...
the colors?

147
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:29,613
I was thinking more about it.

148
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,957
I have another theory...

149
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:40,286
Conversion disorder.
They used to call it...

150
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:48,588
I think this whole filing girl act
is finally getting to you.

151
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:58,097
Only the ones who
happen to be my daughter.

152
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:02,094
I think this whole focusing
on work thing is getting to me.

153
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:04,745
I've been told by more
than one person

154
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:07,558
that I've closed myself off
from human connection.

155
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:08,917
Here, mom. Mom.

156
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:10,617
Careful, it's hot.

157
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:15,192
So this is me
trying to connect again.

158
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,557
Starting with you, my family.

159
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,161
I have to bother
to show up at least.

160
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:22,362
You did call Nathan, right?

161
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,056
Yeah, a couple times, mom.

162
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,663
- So I'm thinking if...
- You didn't just talk to the aide?

163
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,470
That Elizabeth woman is a
phone message black hole.

164
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:35,580
Can we just focus on me,

165
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:37,357
for a second, mom?

166
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,351
Yes, you hide in here.

167
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,020
You're filing things,

168
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,821
it's the waste of a brilliant mind.

169
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:54,111
Be serious.

170
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,819
I thought being a paramedic,
saving the most people possible...

171
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:10,074
That would fill that hole, but I...

172
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:14,555
Mom?

173
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,751
Yes.

174
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,535
Yes, you're right.

175
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:22,439
Nathan will be fine.

176
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:23,885
Let's just, um...

177
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,311
Go on with what you were saying.
Start over.

178
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:29,448
I'm not starting over.

179
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:31,479
I thought you said it was important.

180
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:34,103
I ran into Chief Kaufman.

181
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,802
And he said that you could

182
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,602
restart your residency if you want.

183
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,675
He always thought you'd
make a wonderful doctor.

184
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:50,223
It's been six years.

185
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,378
It's time to stop blaming yourself

186
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,080
for Christopher's death.

187
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,259
You have to stop grieving and
take your life back, Emma.

188
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:07,770
I'm not grieving, I'm...

189
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,105
Emma.

190
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,219
I've got to go.

191
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,936
Got to get to work.

192
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:27,402
- I think I'll stay for a while.
- Okay.

193
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:29,332
Maybe Nathan's just running late.

194
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:37,298
It's good seeing you.

195
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,512
- Yes?
- You work too much.

196
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,305
- You know that.
- I do.

197
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:45,765
Bye.

198
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,390
<i>And since 1924 it has been our
charge to populate this house...</i>

199
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:01,470
We're late.

200
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:04,545
With girls of the utmost
quality and integrity.

201
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:07,217
This is of course
where you all come in.

202
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,969
We can't wait to get to know
each and every one of you.

203
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:20,010
Which brings us to my absolute
favorite part of rush...

204
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,101
G-t-k-p-p-s-d.

205
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:26,095
Get-to-know-perspective-pledges
speed dating.

206
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:27,626
Yay!
Okay.

207
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,340
All the girls on my right
to the chairs on the right.

208
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:34,835
And all the girls
on my left to the left.

209
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:40,126
- Should we make a break for it?
- This is what normal girls do, right?

210
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:41,419
Really?

211
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:44,240
Scariest thing ever happened to me?
Does this count?

212
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,827
My mom raises
professional show dogs... show dog.

213
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,495
No boyfriend to speak of.

214
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,539
My dad works in paper.
Government paper.

215
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,199
I mean,
it's more like a series of...

216
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,336
no boyfriends.

217
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,464
Hobbies? Um...

218
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,308
- You used to be a cheerleader, right?
- How'd you know?

219
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,703
Gretchen told me.

220
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:06,584
Really? 

221
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:09,932
So you and Gretchen
both lived in Texas?

222
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:12,685
Last round, ladies! Make it count!

223
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:16,832
So Claire, I feel like
I know you already.

224
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,559
Let me guess, Gretchen?

225
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,016
She's really cool.

226
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:21,468
She's very...

227
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:23,529
edgy.

228
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:24,943
Yeah.

229
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:30,763
I mean, you almost...
Are you all right?

230
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:41,719
Wait up a second.

231
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,192
Wait, wait.

232
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:44,725
Are you OK?

233
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,911
You almost got hit by a...

234
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:51,638
I mean that was...
you almost got hit.

235
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,481
You're welcome.

236
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,982
Come on!

237
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,445
Hand me that, will you?

238
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,110
Who is it?

239
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:01,877
The new family member?

240
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,612
Why are you so interested?

241
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,736
You used my body to find them.
I am understandably vested.

242
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:10,877
Is it Petrelli?

243
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,697
Nakamura?

244
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,951
The Strauss woman?
The college co-ed?

245
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:18,954
- Claire Bennet.
- Is it her?

246
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:25,919
You don't know, do you?

247
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:28,229
I do not.

248
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,928
But I felt something.

249
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,181
In my bones, in the earth.

250
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:40,142
But the dust hasn't settled yet.

251
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,161
It's a gamble.

252
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:46,357
Making promises and proclamations
to all of us, based on a feeling.

253
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:48,456
I understand the risks.

254
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,738
But the rewards of growing
our family are worth it.

255
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,988
We've got lots of cousins out there.

256
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,424
Plenty of candidates.

257
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:58,764
Many seeds planted.

258
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:01,163
But who will break ground first?

259
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:10,234
I guess we'll just have to wait
and see.

260
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,805
Have you seen my white
sweater, it's frilly and...

261
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:30,693
looks kind of exactly like that.

262
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:34,697
Can I borrow this?

263
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,386
No... yeah.

264
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,201
Go ahead.

265
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:42,200
Are you sure, cause that "go ahead"
sounded a little bit annoyed?

266
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,857
- And I can just take it off.
- No, don't be silly.

267
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,208
It looks good on you.

268
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,973
Cool. Thanks.

269
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:53,490
So I'm just gonna use the restroom
and then we gotta go.

270
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:36,842
<i>Yeah, we're heading back
that way now.</i>

271
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:43,927
Ready?

272
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,396
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

273
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:52,566
Why don't you go on
without me and I'll catch up?

274
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,668
No, I can just wait.

275
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:57,154
No, don't worry about it.
I mean, it's a mixer, right?

276
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:59,964
Feel like we should be mixing
with people we don't know.

277
00:20:00,397 --> 00:20:01,837
I know you already.

278
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:03,135
You know?

279
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,234
Right. Oh.

280
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,739
Mix master me. Okay.

281
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:10,172
I'll see you.

282
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:22,846
It's amazing.

283
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,640
What is this?

284
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:26,176
Tea.

285
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,577
You never had tea before?

286
00:20:30,802 --> 00:20:33,273
I've never had anything.

287
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:35,322
It all feels...

288
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:37,141
it feels so new.

289
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:42,093
Like I'm feeling everything
for the first time.

290
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:44,624
Hot.

291
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,203
And this...

292
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:51,314
is cold.

293
00:20:51,824 --> 00:20:52,970
It's like...

294
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:55,856
I know these things, these words,

295
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:57,801
these feelings.
But they're...

296
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,796
I can't put them together.
They're not... in my head they're there.

297
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:03,762
They're gone.
And it's...

298
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,847
Scary?

299
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:08,561
It's very scary.

300
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:14,183
But also...

301
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,424
somehow beautiful.

302
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:19,653
All of it is...

303
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:22,182
overwhelmingly beautiful.

304
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:23,991
"Jamais vu."

305
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:28,267
It's the opposite of "deja vu",
it's quite common in cases

306
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,563
of seizures
and disassociate amnesia.

307
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:32,852
That's good news.

308
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:34,369
How is that good news?

309
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,567
I think something
traumatic happened to you

310
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,130
and you've blocked it out.

311
00:21:38,502 --> 00:21:41,919
It means that the "you"
in you is still in there.

312
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:43,468
Somewhere.

313
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:46,003
I'd like to try a memory exercise.

314
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:49,705
I want you to close your eyes
and tell me the first thing you see.

315
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:57,617
Nothing, it's just black.

316
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,064
Just relax and be yourself.

317
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:17,471
The ticking is distracting.

318
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:20,259
What do you mean?

319
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:23,148
That clock and your watch...

320
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:25,706
they're off.

321
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:29,469
Somehow the different ticks,
different timing.

322
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,036
One is faster, much faster.

323
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:33,127
This watch has been
running fast for years.

324
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:35,662
I keep meaning to fix it.
But wha...

325
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:37,898
You heard that?

326
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,393
So, this ticking thing...

327
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,994
It's good. It's your subconscious.

328
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,539
It's probably a clue to your past.
Let's... let's try again.

329
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:57,137
Can I see you in the hall, doc?

330
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,314
I'll just be a sec.

331
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:04,716
Okay?

332
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:13,161
AFIS just kicked back
a fingerprint match.

333
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:14,643
We got an ID.

334
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:50,778
Colors.

335
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:52,976
You saw them too?

336
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:00,969
You can't...

337
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:02,814
You're deaf.

338
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,170
So you read lips?

339
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,347
All right, I must've gotten
your ability on the street.

340
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,550
Ability?

341
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,261
This is new to you?

342
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,809
There are people like us
who have abilities.

343
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,269
They can fly,

344
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,482
and teleport, and read minds.

345
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,609
Sometimes I misunderstand.

346
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,819
So can you...?

347
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:41,289
That's crazy.

348
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,126
Is it?

349
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,720
Pretty amazing, huh?

350
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,390
Why me? Why now?

351
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,809
That I don't know.

352
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,771
Maybe we could get lunch tomorrow.

353
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:29,968
Figure it out.

354
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:32,275
Out of the file room.

355
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,927
I'm fine with the file room.

356
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,908
- No, I didn't mean...
- It's fine.

357
00:28:11,105 --> 00:28:14,234
I'm so glad you came back.
I was worried you'd get cold feet.

358
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,778
My feet are actually
very toasty in here.

359
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:19,636
It was nice to meet the girls.

360
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,992
Good to expand
my social Venn diagram...

361
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,245
into more circles.

362
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,955
Then why stop now, right?

363
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,916
Kara!

364
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,669
Claire Bennet, Kara Hayback.

365
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:36,297
I think we met at the G-P-P.

366
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,092
Did you know
you're both ex-cheerleaders?

367
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,137
- You too?
- I had spirit, yes I did.

368
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,764
What made you quit?

369
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,810
Sounds stupid, but I kind of hated
the cheerleading part of cheerleading.

370
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,269
Not stupid at all.

371
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,981
I liked the bus rides
and the bake sales,

372
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,816
and I rocked a mean poster.

373
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,861
- But football's kind of...
- Pointless and boring.

374
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:01,239
- Exactly.
- Is that why you got out?

375
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,742
No, I just...
Watch out!

376
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,436
Hands on the table, palms down.

377
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,856
- Where's Dr. Gibson?
- I sent her home.

378
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,441
What, no. She...

379
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,693
She was here.
She came here to...

380
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,820
She was here to tell us who you are.

381
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,697
But now we know that.

382
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,783
You're a watchmaker from Queens
who murdered your own mother.

383
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,662
- You said watchmaker?
- I also said "murder" and "mother."

384
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,709
Now hands on the table.

385
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

386
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,420
I wouldn't kill my mother.
I would never...

387
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,094
What are you doing?

388
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:07,234
I'm gonna use
this interrogation room

389
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:09,355
for interrogation.

390
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:12,671
I'm gonna get a confession from you

391
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:15,647
- about how you killed your mother.
- No, I didn't kill anybody.

392
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,793
And then they're gonna
throw you down a hole forever.

393
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,904
- What are you doing?
- You said you'd help me.

394
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,114
You promised.

395
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,450
You promised.

396
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:11,411
You said you'd help me.
You promised.

397
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:19,917
I didn't do it.

398
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:22,380
I didn't say you did.

399
00:31:23,784 --> 00:31:25,049
But you're thinking it.

400
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:27,010
You were the only one there.

401
00:31:27,446 --> 00:31:31,009
- Why would I do something like that?
- Because I was making new friends,

402
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:33,725
or you wanted to expose
my freakiness to everyone.

403
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:37,131
Do you actually realize
how ridiculous that sounds?

404
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:40,273
I saw what you've been looking at
on your computer, the stuff about me.

405
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,962
What were you doing
snooping on my computer?

406
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:48,790
I wasn't snooping. A book fell,
the computer turned on, and I saw it.

407
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:51,924
A book jumped off my shelf
and begged you to invade my privacy?

408
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:53,146
Yes, it did!

409
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,824
So I googled you.
So what's the big deal?

410
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:01,878
I saw the stuff about Annie too.

411
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:05,673
Can you honestly tell me
you had nothing to do with it?

412
00:32:07,768 --> 00:32:10,359
That stuff that happened
to you really messed you up.

413
00:32:10,526 --> 00:32:13,187
- You're a crazy kind of paranoid.
- Paranoid?

414
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:16,772
No, paranoid is...
this is a pattern.

415
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:20,110
The Annie thing, the accident
tonight, the computer...

416
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:23,149
The speed dating?
I mean, talk about me much?

417
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:26,870
I get nervous talking about myself.

418
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:29,203
You're just more interesting.

419
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:31,812
All I wanted was a normal life.

420
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:33,931
And I trusted you!

421
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:39,454
I didn't kill Annie.

422
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:43,067
And I'm not stalking you.

423
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:47,090
OK, I'm a little bit stalking you.
But it's not...

424
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,290
what you think.
It's just...

425
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:00,761
I have a crush.

426
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,960
I'm crushing...

427
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:04,295
on you.

428
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:09,955
Say something.

429
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:16,777
Claire Bennet.
Gretchen Berg.

430
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:20,849
Please accept this bid to join
the Psi Alpha Chi sisterhood.

431
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:39,517
It's getting a little late
for Hail Mary passes.

432
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:42,687
Says you.

433
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,113
Nothing.

434
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:54,955
Nothing.

435
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,528
Hello, Rebecca.

436
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:08,004
I'm missing "Bid night,"
Uncle Samuel.

437
00:34:11,063 --> 00:34:13,558
I'm sure they can carry on
without you one night.

438
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:18,097
I wanted to check
on your work with Claire.

439
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:20,532
Well, we're sisters now.

440
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,232
So, there's that.

441
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:24,974
You're doing everything
you can to isolate her?

442
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,607
Push other people away,
push her in our direction?

443
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:29,091
Honestly?

444
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,486
I feel like all I do is push.

445
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:33,282
What made you quit?

446
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:37,067
Sounds stupid, but I kind of hated
the cheerleading part of cheerleading.

447
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:38,916
That does not sound stupid.

448
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,798
I like the bus rides
and the bake sales,

449
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:45,041
and I rocked a mean poster,
but football's kind of...

450
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,841
Pointless and boring.

451
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,010
Exactly.

452
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:50,313
Is that why you got out
of the business?

453
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,808
No, I just...

454
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:52,966
Watch out!

455
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,396
I didn't see you leave the party.

456
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,822
I guess you're still there.

457
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:41,889
And you left the windows open.

458
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:10,126
I don't suppose
she's on her way here to us now?

459
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:13,705
It isn't her, not yet.

460
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,356
But I think your dust
has finally settled.

461
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,651
Get back to campus, Rebecca.

462
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,520
Looks like we're pulling up stakes.

463
00:36:40,084 --> 00:36:42,740
- I'm not a killer.
- You're a kidnapper and a carjacker,

464
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:46,078
and you beat up
an entire city precinct somehow.

465
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,171
He was gonna throw me in a hole.

466
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:51,429
Hurt me...
Nobody believes me except for you.

467
00:36:51,596 --> 00:36:52,960
I don't even know you.

468
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:56,736
That isn't my name.

469
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:59,151
I close my eyes,
but it doesn't feel like me.

470
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,401
It's not me.

471
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,509
It sounds an awful lot like you.

472
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,642
- A watchmaker?
- I know.

473
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:07,260
Your watch, I heard the ticking,
but it can't be.

474
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,779
I know I'm not a killer.

475
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,189
You know that.

476
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:19,003
You're right.

477
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,662
What are you doing?

478
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,290
If you're not a killer,
by definition you won't kill me.

479
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,042
Take my car wherever you need to.

480
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,795
- I need your help.
- You don't even know me.

481
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:39,465
- I don't even know myself.
- Turn yourself in.

482
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:43,010
They'll figure out about your mother.
I'll figure out about you.

483
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:56,232
I wanna see your hands.
Now!

484
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:00,922
Do what he says.

485
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:06,659
He's turning himself in.
Put the guns down, please.

486
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:09,720
Please put the guns down.

487
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:45,204
What was that?

488
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:47,264
I don't know.

489
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,119
Go.

490
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:57,669
Run!

491
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:00,048
Run!

492
00:40:02,056 --> 00:40:03,800
So much for human connection.

493
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:01,519
It's okay, brother.

494
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:03,893
You're safe here.

495
00:42:04,553 --> 00:42:06,110
Where exactly is here?

496
00:42:07,813 --> 00:42:08,813
Home.
