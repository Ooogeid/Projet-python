1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,647
I can hear rain coming
from 40 miles away.

2
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:08,454
I can even hear someone's moods.

3
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:10,216
There are others out there, like you.

4
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:11,464
I can feel them.

5
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:13,650
We'll find them, Mohinder. All of them.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,976
It's our destiny.

7
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:24,243
I was surprised to learn
that Linderman Group,

8
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,715
recently invested in your campaign.

9
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:28,684
How would I be surprise? Mr. Linderman
was a good friend of my father's.

10
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,345
What Mr. Linderman wants,
Mr. Linderman gets.

11
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:34,932
- Has he been located?
- The Haitian? Naw.

12
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,036
How long was he hiding Claire?

13
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:38,323
I take it it's been months.

14
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:41,222
Just one more thing.
When should we be expecting Claire?

15
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:42,716
I'll bring her in now.

16
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:43,908
I wanted to protect you.

17
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:45,492
I tried to be the best dad.

18
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:46,924
I couldn't.

19
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,485
This is good-bye.

20
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:51,173
You don't... have to do this.

21
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,593
There can't be any doubt
cast on your father.

22
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:55,321
Claire, turn around. Cover your ears.

23
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,853
I love you dad.

24
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:02,655
I love you Claire-Bear.

25
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:04,573
Go deep.

26
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:06,402
Take anything
that would lead them to her.

27
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:08,409
Just on bullet, I can be a hero.

28
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:10,929
Show yourself.

29
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,012
I thought she was you.

30
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:38,814
It was supposed to be you.

31
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:40,653
Can't you do something?

32
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,079
She's dead.

33
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,390
It can't be.

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
It's your fault.

35
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:05,765
You did this.

36
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,427
You stop right there.

37
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:32,199
What is the problem?
I am here with tour from Osaka.

38
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:34,631
Security just flagged you.
You must be some kind of cheat.

39
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:36,419
- What?
- You already got a warning.

40
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:38,347
And most people don't even get that.

41
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:41,037
It is okay.

42
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:42,878
I am invited now by Mr. Linderman.

43
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,262
Well, in that case...

44
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,983
It's all gone.

45
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,707
So you honestly don't remember anything?

46
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:14,998
I told you, I'm trying.

47
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:18,412
The last thing I remember is driving
home from the hospital with my wife.

48
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:22,979
And after that, it's just--
it's... gray.

49
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:24,852
Blank.

50
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:30,582
So Sprague and Parkman
taking your family hostage.

51
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,867
Shooting your daughter.

52
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,679
A bullet clean through your side.

53
00:03:37,548 --> 00:03:40,203
You'd think something there
might have made an impression.

54
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,729
My daughter is missing.

55
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:44,957
So right now,
I don't care if you believe me,

56
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,388
or what you do to me.

57
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,263
I just want her home, safe.

58
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:51,773
You can kill me if you want.
I'm gonna find her!

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,973
Settle down.

60
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:55,162
You'll tear your new stitches
if you're not careful.

61
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:01,158
Well, clearly,
your partner's gone rogue,

62
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,575
taken a pie slice
of your memory with him.

63
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:06,558
He did the same thing
to your wife and son.

64
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,060
They remember even less.

65
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:11,035
- When can I go after them?
- Sorry.

66
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:13,151
I can't let that be your errand.

67
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,589
- She's my daughter.
- She's an assignment.

68
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,584
Or have you forgotten?

69
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:19,066
We gave her to you.

70
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:21,061
Took her out of a bassinet,

71
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,363
put her in your hands,
and told you to take her home.

72
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,752
And that's after you said,
"No, thank you."

73
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,246
Now, I appreciate you
taking an interest in her

74
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:31,188
beyond the needs
of the assignment, but...

75
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:34,723
that indulgence ends now.

76
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:37,540
You expect me to do nothing?

77
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,797
I expect you to do
whatever we ask of you.

78
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:55,643
Well, what do we think?

79
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:58,464
He's telling the truth.
He doesn't know anything.

80
00:04:58,553 --> 00:04:59,623
Cool.

81
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,655
You owe me five bucks.

82
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:04,832
- Come on.
- Wait.

83
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,042
We had a deal.

84
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:07,759
I help you out, you let me go.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,222
Take it easy, Parkman.

86
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,812
- We'll get there.
- What?

87
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,505
You have not said anything all day.

88
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:22,908
I thought you'd prefer it.

89
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,771
It's not like you'd tell me
where we're going anyway.

90
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,327
As soon as I know where we're going,
I will tell you.

91
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:31,468
When can I go back to my family?

92
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:34,611
Should I lie to you,
and say it will be soon?

93
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,210
You know what to run from.

94
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,146
Yeah, the people
you and my dad work for.

95
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:40,817
What they will do,

96
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:43,538
not even you can recover from.

97
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,417
Great. Thanks, Dad.

98
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:51,839
You cannot understand
the level of sacrifice he made

99
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:53,027
so you might live.

100
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:57,415
You must honor that.

101
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:28,306
Is it safe to go back?

102
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:31,954
We leave the country, tonight.

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,004
Subtitles: swsub.com
(V.1.00)

104
00:06:57,506 --> 00:07:00,026
Sorry, Mr. Petrelli,
these men wanted to see you.

105
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,512
- They're from the--
- FBI.

106
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:03,833
I'm federal Agent Quesada.

107
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:05,107
This is Agent Alonzo.

108
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:08,651
We'd like to speak with you concerning
illegal campaign contributions

109
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,050
you may have received
from the Linderman group.

110
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,184
The FBI is curious

111
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:20,875
why the Las Vegas-based Linderman group

112
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:23,358
would be so interested
in helping a New York candidate.

113
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:27,040
My father served as an in-house attorney
for the group before he passed away.

114
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:31,950
It's all right.

115
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:33,622
We're clear-- no one's listening.

116
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,626
You agreed there'd be no face to face.

117
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,468
And you agreed to deliver Linderman.

118
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:39,982
I'm the one who brought you in here,
remember?

119
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:42,568
I'd appreciate a little discretion,

120
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,563
as opposed to a surprise office visit.

121
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:46,937
No one outside this office
knows you're working with us.

122
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:49,630
Linderman's requested a meeting with you
at his casino tonight.

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,818
Any guesses why?

124
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:52,490
I'm still four points behind.

125
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:54,622
He's gonna tell me
how he plans to put me ahead,

126
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,317
and what's expected of me after I win.

127
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,326
Yeah, we were thinking the same thing.

128
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:00,587
And we want you to record it.

129
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,101
You want me to wear a wire?

130
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:06,094
You're the only one on our side who can
get enough incriminating evidence

131
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,410
to put him behind bars.

132
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,267
We need this, Mr. Petrelli.

133
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:10,911
And so do you.

134
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,766
Otherwise, he walks.

135
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:17,200
We'll contact you
when you land in Vegas.

136
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,595
How long have you been
working with the FBI?

137
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,525
Since Heidi's accident.

138
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:39,670
I'm gonna take Linderman down
for a long time, Peter.

139
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,440
I thought I could be a hero
and save the world.

140
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,939
Instead, I just killed--

141
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,331
What's that?

142
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,362
That's not your blood, is it?

143
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,462
Simone.

144
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:53,495
Isaac shot her.
She's dead.

145
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,820
She's dead.

146
00:08:58,729 --> 00:08:59,912
Did you call the police?

147
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,855
Here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna make an anonymous phone call.

148
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,225
You'll have had absolutely nothing
to do with it.

149
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,426
But I did.

150
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:11,391
She's dead because of me.

151
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,440
I don't--
I don't know what to do.

152
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:17,823
That's just it, you don't do anything.

153
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:19,894
Do you understand?

154
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,252
This is not the time
for you to get noble.

155
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:25,409
Okay? Just stay with me.

156
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,208
I ne can't.

157
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:32,761
As long as I'm alive,
everyone around me is in danger.

158
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,505
We can call Suresh, okay?

159
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:45,528
He can study you.
He can--

160
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:46,917
He's working on a cure.

161
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:48,861
Isn't it too late for that?

162
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:51,964
Wait.

163
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,881
Sir, you have your flight to Vegas.

164
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:57,584
Just tell the driver to wait.

165
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:11,511
Oh, there you are.

166
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,696
Lyle's watching pay-per-view
in the other room.

167
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:17,591
I'm gonna run to the gym
before there's an elipto line.

168
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:21,699
I tell you, that flood in our basement
has turned into a right vacation

169
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,826
for this family.

170
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,142
Too bad Claire's missing it all
with that cheerleading retreat.

171
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:34,011
Oh, I'm not gonna answer that.

172
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,399
I've got the dog hotel giving me
hourly updates

173
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:38,066
on Mr. Muggles--
they hate me.

174
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,791
Sorry, I have to take a trip.

175
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:42,658
Now?

176
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:43,850
What else?

177
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:46,786
You stay here and take care of Lyle.

178
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,864
I'll be back as soon as I can.

179
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,419
If anyone comes looking for me--

180
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:53,520
Stop, you can't go.

181
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:55,240
Why are you whispering?

182
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:57,321
Because you told me to yesterday.

183
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:00,665
I thought you didn't remember yesterday.

184
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,728
You told me to pretend
that that man took my memory.

185
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:06,567
You took me in the shower,
you told me everything.

186
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,075
I told you?

187
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:14,447
What you really do,

188
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,229
who you work for,

189
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,319
and what happened to Claire.

190
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:24,847
Do you know where she is?

191
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,477
You know I can't remember.

192
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,902
But you told me you were protecting her.

193
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:34,060
You said you sent her away
so she'd be safe.

194
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,174
And that if you went after her,

195
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:37,780
I should give you this.

196
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:43,236
"Claire's with friends.
Don't go after her." This is my writing.

197
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:48,437
All right, look,

198
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,082
we can't let anybody know about this.

199
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:53,021
Don't worry, I know how to play dumb.

200
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,735
I could never love you enough.

201
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:00,384
You do fine.

202
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:05,596
Puccini?

203
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,065
I thought of you more
as a John Denver type.

204
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:10,301
That your wife?

205
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:14,771
Your painter friend from New York
tried to reach you.

206
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,251
I chatted with him for you.

207
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:20,708
Apparently, he's got himself
a dead girlfriend. Nice guy.

208
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:22,475
Thompson doesn't need me on this one.

209
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,128
I need to be here with my family.

210
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,495
This isn't a request.
This is an assignment.

211
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,361
You do remember assignments, don't you?

212
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:33,990
I'll get my things.

213
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,420
Let me guess.

214
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,055
Another paper emergency.

215
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:49,971
Huge order mix-up in Fresno.

216
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,126
Sorry for stealing your husband,
Mrs. Bennet.

217
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:56,777
It's just the he's the best guy
we've got in a pinch.

218
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:02,184
I like your hair.

219
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,606
So this is the list?

220
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:11,228
Yes. What's left of it.

221
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:13,637
Most of the people are missing, or dead.

222
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:17,011
I want to run your DNA sample
against my father's formula,

223
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:19,048
and then take you someplace safe.

224
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:21,468
But this is your father's formula.

225
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,432
This is how he made the list,
how he found me.

226
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,023
Yes, although I haven't figured out
what it is looking for.

227
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:27,895
I mean, a specific gene, codons?

228
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,488
There are three billion base pairs
in human DNA.

229
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,149
It's a proverbial needle.

230
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,137
Did my DNA help?

231
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,293
You've been driving all night.

232
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:41,005
- Why don't you take a break?
- I can't.

233
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:43,049
These people are in danger.
We have to warn them.

234
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,908
- If Sylar gets to them first--
- Exactly.

235
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:46,345
So let me help.

236
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,752
I mean, here...

237
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:52,125
This one is in New York.

238
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,222
Isaac Mendez--
I'll call him.

239
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:56,487
And you just relax.

240
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:57,870
Just take a minute.

241
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:01,229
You're very kind.

242
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:03,079
Zane, thank you.

243
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:07,036
You have no idea
how alone I used to feel.

244
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:09,222
How insignificant.

245
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:12,508
You've given me hope.

246
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,603
Hope is great.

247
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,255
We need caffeine.

248
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:19,266
So this formula, if you figure it out,

249
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:20,731
how many of us will you find?

250
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:21,859
Who knows?

251
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,121
Hundreds, thousands, maybe more.

252
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
It's busy.

253
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:30,438
I'll get him later.

254
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,087
To new friends.

255
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,653
This is good. What is it?

256
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:40,895
Chai.

257
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,056
It's a special blend
my father brought from India.

258
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:49,104
Who are we going to call next?

259
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:51,762
No one.

260
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,137
I already have you...

261
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,270
Mr. Sylar.

262
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:28,102
Flying man!

263
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:30,788
Not here.

264
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:39,647
Flying man!

265
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,040
Let me guess,

266
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,461
you're still trying to steal that sword
from Mr. Linderman?

267
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:46,561
- Where's your friend?
- Ando?

268
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,508
I sent him back to Japan.

269
00:15:49,935 --> 00:15:52,021
This mission getting too dangerous
for him.

270
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,027
I think I know what you mean.

271
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,452
You can't protect everyone, right?

272
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,183
Sometimes it's better to go it alone.

273
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:00,700
The more people you try and help--

274
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,172
The more people get hurt.

275
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,393
Please, you must help me.

276
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:09,099
I can't get past casino security giant.

277
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,834
When I first met you,
I thought you were nuts.

278
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:12,953
It's okay.

279
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,205
I thought you were mean.

280
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,281
But now I know

281
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:19,545
you pretend
you do not care about anyone.

282
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:21,708
But you care too much.

283
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,577
It's really important
you get your powers back, huh?

284
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,238
It is important for everyone.

285
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,453
Follow me.

286
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:38,014
- You know who I am?
- Of course, Mr. Petrelli.

287
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:40,942
My friend here is making a delivery
from me to Mr. Linderman.

288
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:42,460
Something he's expecting.

289
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:44,456
I didn't realize--

290
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:46,615
You've been around long enough
to know what happens

291
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,483
when Mr. Linderman doesn't get
something he's expecting?

292
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:51,866
Or do I have to paint you a picture?

293
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:54,496
He can take it to the curator.

294
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:56,443
Does that work for you?

295
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:58,545
Vivian Lewis?

296
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:01,966
My name is Vivian, and I'm from Canada?!

297
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,002
Are you kidding me?

298
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:05,876
I do not need you happy.

299
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:07,252
Only safe.

300
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,906
There's nothing left of me.

301
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,993
Everything I am is gonna disappear
the second I get on that plane.

302
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:14,733
My friends, my family...

303
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:16,413
me.

304
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,368
I can make you forget it all,
if that's what you would prefer.

305
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:20,994
There's nothing left for you here.

306
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,124
No one to trust.

307
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,254
No, you cannot see him again.

308
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:29,863
Peter Petrelli is the only person
I know I can trust.

309
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:31,435
More than you.

310
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:33,245
He cares about me.

311
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:36,483
Why can't I hide in New York with him?

312
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:38,630
He's not in a position
to be responsible,

313
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:39,827
for you or himself.

314
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:41,953
Come.

315
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:45,155
Boarding pass and I. D.

316
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:49,922
Boarding pass, I. D.

317
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:54,801
Boarding pass and I. D.

318
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:01,339
Sorry, sir, only ticketed passengers
are allowed beyond this point.

319
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,973
Isaac Mendez, NYPD.

320
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:18,833
We have a few questions for you.

321
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:29,063
Detective Jeff Tracy, NYPD.

322
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,812
Do you know this woman--
Simone Deveaux?

323
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:33,727
She and I,

324
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:35,993
we broke up recently.

325
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,144
We received an anonymous phone call
that she might be hurt.

326
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,929
Some of your neighbors said
they heard an argument,

327
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:44,108
and gunshots.

328
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,274
Mind if we take a look around?

329
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:52,029
What's going on?

330
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:57,423
Something wrong?

331
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:02,585
No, ma'am, apparently not.

332
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,484
Sorry for taking your time.

333
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:09,611
You're alive.

334
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:12,390
Lucky you.

335
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:15,222
My...

336
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:18,156
You're very useful.

337
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:28,821
Candice is special, just like you.

338
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:30,845
Then Simone's--

339
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,203
She's traveling Europe, indefinitely,

340
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:36,017
as far as the rest of the world
is concerned.

341
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:38,473
There's a crew coming
to clean up this mess.

342
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,537
How am I supposed
to pretend this didn't happen?

343
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,783
Maybe you should have thought about that
before you shot her...

344
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:45,099
twice.

345
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:49,006
What's the matter, sweetie?

346
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,733
You want to shoot me again?

347
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,354
Enough.

348
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:01,211
I can't stay here.

349
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,833
- Take me with you.
- That's not our assignment.

350
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:06,096
Please.

351
00:20:07,844 --> 00:20:09,840
- I don't know what to do.
- Of course you do.

352
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:12,427
You keep painting.

353
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:17,944
My condolences.

354
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:34,141
Here we go.

355
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,021
When did you get so good?

356
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:40,185
I'm unemployed.

357
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:42,866
What do you think I do all day
when you're at school?

358
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:46,810
One more?

359
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,818
I can't. I'm gonna be late for the bus.

360
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:49,907
So be late.

361
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:52,882
You're not gonna learn anything
at school that you don't already know.

362
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:56,584
Love you.

363
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,523
You know, you have to admit it, Niki.

364
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:07,145
I do a better you than you.

365
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,474
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

366
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,010
About what?

367
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:21,031
Where'd you get that?

368
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:22,376
It was on my pillow.

369
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:27,626
Well, I didn't put it there.

370
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:32,655
- Were you digging through my stuff?
- Don't turn this around on me, Niki.

371
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:34,272
You said no more secrets.

372
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:37,144
Now I find out you're going
to Linderman's casino. For what?

373
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,596
- What's he got you doing with this guy?
- It's nothing.

374
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:41,679
Linderman called,
and he asked me to be a dealer.

375
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:42,745
That's it.

376
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:44,729
You know it's not about
dealing cards here.

377
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:46,051
That's all this is.

378
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,708
Baby, trust me.

379
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:49,618
I promise you

380
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:52,548
I won't do anything
that I don't want to.

381
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,192
You left that for him, didn't you?

382
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,359
Cute.

383
00:22:24,568 --> 00:22:25,901
I can't feel my fingers.

384
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:27,573
It's the curare.

385
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,841
It induces paralysis of the brain.

386
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:32,936
Which means
you can't control your abilities.

387
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:36,845
Whoever you think I am, I'm not.

388
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,116
You are the man who murdered my father.

389
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:42,276
Do you still expect me to believe
you're Zane Taylor?

390
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,494
Zane was killed three days ago.

391
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:49,424
The same day I met you.

392
00:22:51,722 --> 00:22:54,774
And you thought you were so clever
giving me his DNA.

393
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:57,482
You're a parasite.

394
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,476
You killed my father
and fed off his work.

395
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:05,658
Let me hear you say it.
Tell me your name!

396
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:07,232
Say it!

397
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:08,766
I want to hear you say it!

398
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:10,734
Sylar!

399
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:17,467
There's only
one thing to do with a parasite.

400
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,862
Kill it before it kills again.

401
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:24,937
You're just like your father--
murders, the both of you.

402
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,112
I'm a scientist.

403
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,650
Your father said that,
but he kept leading me to them.

404
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:32,278
He had no idea what you were.

405
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:33,401
He knew.

406
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:34,831
He might not have admitted it,

407
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:37,649
but we were making so much progress
together, why would he stop?

408
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:39,489
You know nothing about my father!

409
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:42,055
I know everything.

410
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:45,100
He confided in me.

411
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:47,618
He told me things
he felt he could never tell you.

412
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,996
Things about your sister...

413
00:23:49,116 --> 00:23:50,116
Shanti.

414
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:52,608
He thought you were too--

415
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:56,926
what's the word--
fragile to know the truth.

416
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,364
That's why he liked me.

417
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:02,205
You were always seeking his approval,

418
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,811
while I provided stimulation.

419
00:24:03,948 --> 00:24:04,948
He gave up on you,

420
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:06,394
but he adored me.

421
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:08,345
Now who's the real parasite here?!

422
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:18,324
You're right.

423
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,630
My father did want answers.

424
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:25,034
He called you Patient Zero.

425
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:29,352
You're the template
he used to create this formula.

426
00:24:30,091 --> 00:24:32,111
You're the key to unlocking his secret.

427
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:34,779
As much as I'd like to,

428
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,968
killing you
will not give me what I need.

429
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:40,506
So what are you gonna do?

430
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:44,008
I'm going to take a sample
of your spinal fluid.

431
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:46,781
And it's going to hurt.

432
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:51,628
You might actually
do some good before you die.

433
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:31,579
There are so few
Dead Sea fragments left in the world.

434
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,677
It would be a pity
if you crushed this one.

435
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,063
So many things.

436
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:38,309
You brought the new Mendez?

437
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,691
This one is very special.

438
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:49,869
This painting is ripped...

439
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,301
and repaired with Scotch tape.

440
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,813
Yes, very special.

441
00:25:58,501 --> 00:25:59,834
Is there something else?

442
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,574
I need receipt-o for delivery.

443
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,582
There are 754 members
of the security team in this hotel.

444
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:52,464
All of them with the instructions

445
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:53,965
to drop what they're doing,

446
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,854
and come running I push this button.

447
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,043
<i>Security code orange activated.</i>

448
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:07,084
That sword you thought you'd steal,

449
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,024
do you even realize who it belonged to?

450
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Takezo Kensei.

451
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:11,705
He was a hero.

452
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,050
Security, sir.

453
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:18,937
This man tried to steal
from Mr. Linderman.

454
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:46,958
The big guy says Linderman's gonna be...

455
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:48,520
asking for me in about an hour.

456
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:51,400
<i>I'm not in the mood for craps,
so I'm gonna go straight to my room.</i>

457
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:54,205
I guess it's hard to look natural
when you're going after the whale.

458
00:27:54,618 --> 00:27:56,844
Maybe he'll chat up
a few more Japanese tourists.

459
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,149
Where the hell is that pizza?

460
00:28:00,735 --> 00:28:01,735
Hi.

461
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:02,982
Hi, Agent Alonzo.

462
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:04,786
Quesada.

463
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:07,615
Mr. Linderman sends his regards.

464
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:08,745
And a suggestion.

465
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,200
Don't run surveillance on a man
from inside his own hotel.

466
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:13,949
It's really tacky.

467
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:16,377
Kick over your guns.

468
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:21,555
Down.

469
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:27,170
It's so much easier
working with professionals.

470
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,941
I finally found it.

471
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:38,305
That's it, these four simple genes,
they answer everything.

472
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,893
Now, I-- I can make a new list.

473
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:41,492
I can find them, save them.

474
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:44,702
And what about me?

475
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:48,016
Don't I deserve to be saved?

476
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:53,794
Aren't I just... a victim too?

477
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:55,041
I didn't ask for this.

478
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,651
And what would you have me do?

479
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:01,069
Help find a way.

480
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,821
Give me salvation.

481
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,904
Give me that damn list
so I can sink my teeth in!

482
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,866
I'm a natural progression
of the species.

483
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,360
Evolution is a part of nature,
and nature kills.

484
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:27,764
Simple, right?

485
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:30,380
What you've done
is not evolution, it's murder.

486
00:29:30,683 --> 00:29:33,663
What I am doing is revenge.

487
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:36,375
Now I can fulfill my duty as a son.

488
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,654
I wasn't begging for my life.

489
00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:04,376
I was offering you yours.

490
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,193
You are your father's son.

491
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:14,855
So determined, you didn't even notice
I stopped the IV.

492
00:30:19,973 --> 00:30:21,075
Don't worry,

493
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:25,631
you might actually do some good
before you die.

494
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,804
Starting with that list.

495
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:40,122
I'm back in my room.
I'll be on the floor in an hour.

496
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,864
Wearing this
could get a person killed.

497
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:57,079
Okay, it's all right.

498
00:31:57,612 --> 00:31:58,741
- Easy.
- Listen to me.

499
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,058
I don't know how much time we have
before she comes back.

500
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:02,463
- Who?
- Jessica.

501
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:04,343
The woman that they sent after you.

502
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,334
You picked the wrong day
to screw with me.

503
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:10,238
Linderman knows about the wire,
and the FBI--

504
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,335
You know the FBI can hear
everything we're saying.

505
00:32:12,402 --> 00:32:13,904
No, they can't-- they're dead.

506
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:18,955
Linderman knows that you turned on him.

507
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,259
Did you come here to kill me...

508
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:24,011
or warn me?

509
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:25,916
Just trust me.

510
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:31,902
Well, you're back early.

511
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,077
Hey, good news.

512
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,493
I convinced the hotel to let us
keep Mr. Muggles in the room.

513
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,538
That is good news.

514
00:32:43,656 --> 00:32:45,329
I've been going out of my head

515
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:48,119
thinking everybody's watching me,
waiting for me to make a mistake.

516
00:32:48,196 --> 00:32:50,226
- Did you find her?
- No, I can't do that.

517
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,117
If I know where she is,
they can extract it from me.

518
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,213
But I need you to be strong
a little while longer.

519
00:32:55,282 --> 00:32:56,722
We both have to pretend

520
00:32:57,384 --> 00:33:00,046
that we have no idea what happened
so Claire will be safe.

521
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:02,184
- But the company--
- Has to be stopped.

522
00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:03,735
For good.

523
00:33:04,438 --> 00:33:07,261
That's the only way to make sure
that Claire will stay safe.

524
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:15,633
I didn't know
that I could talk to you like this.

525
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:19,233
I always just thought
that you'd be so furious at me

526
00:33:19,317 --> 00:33:20,964
for all the lies and deceit.

527
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:24,340
Right now,
we just have to take care of Claire.

528
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,239
We'll talk about us later.

529
00:33:28,344 --> 00:33:29,399
Must be the kennel.

530
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:37,455
Yes, it is.

531
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:41,130
Yes, he is going to be a problem.

532
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,978
Why don't we do it right now?

533
00:33:58,699 --> 00:33:59,699
Sorry.

534
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:38,089
I'm sorry,
I hope I have the right address.

535
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:40,270
I'm looking for Peter Petrelli.

536
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,112
You picked a terrible time to do that.

537
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:44,689
Peter's not here just now.

538
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:48,852
You may as well come inside, Claire.

539
00:36:13,243 --> 00:36:14,345
Who are you?

540
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,007
I'm your grandmother.

541
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:19,697
And I've been trying to protect you,
but you haven't made that very easy.

542
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:21,901
Quite stubborn, aren't you?

543
00:36:23,104 --> 00:36:24,326
Just like your father.

544
00:36:30,162 --> 00:36:32,800
Linderman hired her to kill the FBI
and keep you in line.

545
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:34,321
Who?

546
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,515
Let's just say I owe her.

547
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,142
He's gonna offer you a deal.

548
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:42,884
If you go in there, you have to take it.

549
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,003
Spend the rest of my life
with his boot on my neck?

550
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,384
- No, thank you.
- Then run.

551
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,648
Get your family, and run.

552
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,162
You said that you had kids.

553
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:52,259
- Two boys?
- I can't do that.

554
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:56,604
You don't have any other option.

555
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:58,099
Yeah, I do.

556
00:36:59,224 --> 00:37:00,224
I could kill him.

557
00:37:03,332 --> 00:37:04,332
Knock me out.

558
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:05,833
Why?

559
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:08,585
So that Jessica knows
she's not in control anymore.

560
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:09,940
Who is Jessica?

561
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,745
You want this gun?

562
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:16,551
Do it.

563
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,912
Not up there.

564
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:30,395
Mr. Linderman
won't be meeting you in his office.

565
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,961
Do you enjoy vegetables, Mr. Petrelli?

566
00:38:08,442 --> 00:38:10,818
I've been known to eat zucchini
when the mood strikes,

567
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:11,982
but not as a rule.

568
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,743
You know, you can probably
hire someone to do that for you.

569
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,212
I like to cook-- it's my meditation.

570
00:38:19,011 --> 00:38:21,264
One aims for perfection in one's life,

571
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,762
but one doesn't find it very often.

572
00:38:24,426 --> 00:38:26,704
For me, this is about

573
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,080
as close as it gets.

574
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:30,508
Voila!

575
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:31,809
A pot pie.

576
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:34,438
Wholesome, warm, healthy.

577
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:36,944
That's, of course
if you can live without cream sauce.

578
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:38,185
Personally, I can't.

579
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:39,668
I mean, what's the point?

580
00:38:41,742 --> 00:38:44,529
You know, people can sleep,
or they can gamble.

581
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:47,355
Or they can even make love

582
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:48,831
when they're miserable.

583
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:53,749
But I think that most people eat
when they're happy.

584
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:55,582
I like to see people happy.

585
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:57,983
Are you happy, Nathan?

586
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:00,754
Not especially.

587
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:04,044
I guess I have a few issues
that plague me.

588
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,797
Oh, dear, I'm sorry to hear that.

589
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:10,880
You see, I think there comes a time
when a man has to ask himself

590
00:39:11,136 --> 00:39:12,792
whether he wants a life of happiness

591
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,295
or a life of meaning.

592
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,411
I'd like to have both.

593
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:20,096
It can't be done.

594
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:21,932
Two very different paths.

595
00:39:22,951 --> 00:39:25,512
I mean,
to be truly happy a man must live

596
00:39:26,362 --> 00:39:28,021
absolutely in the present,

597
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:31,164
and with no thought
of what's gone before,

598
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,105
and no thought of what lies ahead.

599
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,381
But a life of meaning,

600
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,751
a man is condemned
to wallow in the past,

601
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,637
and obsess about the future.

602
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:43,076
My guess is that

603
00:39:44,287 --> 00:39:46,693
you've done quite a bit
of obsessing about yours

604
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:48,074
these last few days.

605
00:39:58,057 --> 00:40:00,333
Now you can't have any of my pot pie.

606
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,325
I won't hold it against you.

607
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:12,009
Lots of men have tried to kill me.

608
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:15,601
Then I'll be the last.

609
00:40:16,576 --> 00:40:19,076
Of course,
you can pull that trigger, Nathan.

610
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,955
You'd be taking both of our lives.

611
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,293
You'll be dead within moments.

612
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:27,976
Or I could offer you something.

613
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:30,761
I'm not interested
in anything you have to offer me.

614
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:32,668
I think you are.

615
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:36,116
I think there are things
you need to hear.

616
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:38,083
Things that I know about.

617
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
Too late for that.

618
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:42,169
That you can fly, for instance?

619
00:40:44,098 --> 00:40:45,834
Or about your brother Peter.

620
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:48,917
And his small problem.

621
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,570
Your daughter, even.

622
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:55,509
And all those others out there like you.

623
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,987
I can offer you more
than just information, Nathan.

624
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,685
You're gonna win your election.
I'll see to that.

625
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:12,918
And two years from now,

626
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,999
through a series of fluke circumstances,

627
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:18,412
you will find yourself
in the White House.

628
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:20,818
A heartbeat away from the presidency.

629
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,422
A life of meaning, Nathan.

630
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:28,379
Think about it.

631
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:30,698
The choice is yours.

632
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:02,805
It's Peter Petrelli.

633
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:33,584
I remember you.

634
00:42:36,203 --> 00:42:37,703
You're like me, aren't you?

635
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:42,518
I'd like to see how that works.
