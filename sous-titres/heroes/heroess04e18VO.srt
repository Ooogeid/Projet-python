<i>Previously on </i>Heroes...

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,004
Wait a second.
Is that Claire?

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,968
- <i>Samuel wants to surrender.</i>
- Really?

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,345
- Why?
- <i>To protect his family.</i>

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,515
<i>He'll turn himself over
as long as the rest of the carnival</i>

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,642
<i>stays safe and under the grid.</i>

7
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,531
I found him on the hill...
with this!

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,660
She's gonna kill thousands of people.
It will be a bloodbath.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,913
Tell me exactly what you saw.

10
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,957
- You cannot save her.
- But someone else can.

11
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,253
<i>Don't worry.</i>

12
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>I'm here to save you.</i>

13
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,217
He's trapped.

14
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,096
- What did you do?
- I trapped him in his worst nightmare.

15
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,515
He'll never hurt anyone again.

16
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:00,476
- I have to bring him back.
- You can't do that.

17
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,437
You might not come out.
Peter, don't!

18
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,998
Is that really you?

19
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,422
Came to get you out.

20
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,679
It is you, isn't it?

21
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,142
I thought I was alone,
that everyone was dead.

22
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,396
- What are you doing here?
- To drag your sorry ass out of here.

23
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,480
Let's go.

24
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,150
There is no getting out.

25
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,402
I've tried...

26
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,946
for three years.

27
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,283
What are you talking about?
It's been three hours.

28
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,745
Wait a minute.

29
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,622
You're not...

30
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,791
you're not real.

31
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,919
This is my mind, isn't it?

32
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,715
This is my mind playing tricks on me,
as part of my punishment, isn't it?

33
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,176
You think I'll let you taunt me?

34
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,553
Stay away.

35
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,223
If you follow me, I'll kill you!
Do you understand?

36
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,905
I swear I'll kill you.
Get out of my head.

37
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,866
Calm down.
I'm telling you the truth.

38
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,078
I came to take you out of here.

39
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,413
Why do you keep saying that?

40
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,209
I went to Parkman's house.
He put you here.

41
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,003
- This is a dream.
- It's not a dream!

42
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,464
This is real.

43
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,926
You don't understand
this is a nightmare?

44
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,053
Hell, yes, it's a nightmare.

45
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,390
Three years, completely alone.

46
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,767
Not years, hours.

47
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,270
All right?
Parkman trapped you here.

48
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,148
- Parkman? Impossible.
- Is it?

49
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,278
What's the last thing you remember
before coming here?

50
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,031
I remember...

51
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,534
wanting my life to change,

52
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,329
thinking I was gonna spend
all of eternity alone.

53
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,914
Exactly.
And here you are.

54
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,334
I've got Parkman's ability.
I can take you out of here.

55
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,921
Why would you want to do that?

56
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,049
The brother of the man I murdered
coming to my aid?

57
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,927
Because I need you to help me.

58
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,600
I could leave you here to rot,

59
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,935
but I need you to save her,

60
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,812
my friend Emma.

61
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,191
In the dream, you save her
before she kills thousands of people.

62
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,406
Wrong guy. I'm not the savior kind,
and you should know that.

63
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,451
It's gonna happen,
and you're gonna save her.

64
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,542
Fine.

65
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,503
You really think
you can get us out of here?

66
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,089
Let me see you try.

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,591
Go ahead.

68
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,810
See?

69
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,521
We won't go anywhere.

70
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,191
We're trapped here, forever.

71
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,367

72
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,427
- We got to do something with her.
- We will.

73
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,181
Excuse me.

74
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,975
I wanna see my father.

75
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,773
He's safe, unharmed,

76
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,402
which is more than he deserves
after shooting innocent people.

77
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,529
My dad didn't shoot anyone.
If he had, you would be dead.

78
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,490
You're not that naive, are you?

79
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,911
He came to this carnival with a gun,
intent on using it.

80
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,455
Isn't that why you tried
to negotiate my surrender?

81
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,792
- You were afraid he'd do this.
- I want to see my father now!

82
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,338
Your devotion to your father
is touching,

83
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,465
but you're blinded by it.

84
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,219
It's time for you to open your eyes
and see your father for who he is.

85
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,347
I know who he is.
Nothing you say will change that.

86
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,935
Of course not.
That's why I'll show you.

87
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,493
- Dad!
- Thank God you're all right.

88
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,164
Untie him.

89
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,456
Not quite yet.

90
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,337
Damien has the ability
to reveal a person's memories.

91
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,589
It's fairly painless
if you don't fight it.

92
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,592
You think showing my dad's memories
is gonna enlighten me?

93
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,344
You deserve the truth.

94
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,848
Let her go.
You don't need her anymore.

95
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,310
You afraid she'll see the real you?

96
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,228
Don't do this.

97
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,648
Take a peek.

98
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,278
See where it all began.

99
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,326
This one has it all.

100
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,704
White walls, wire wheel covers,

101
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,332
- wood grain, everything.
- The kids'll love it.

102
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,503
- What's the payment look like?
- $150 a month.

103
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,759
I know, that's kind of steep.

104
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,927
Look...

105
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,930
You didn't hear this from me,

106
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,933
but go to <i>Val's Discount Motors</i>
on La Cienega.

107
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,646
The same model, maybe a year older,
probably half of what you'll pay here.

108
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,690
Thanks.
Really appreciate that.

109
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,742
Guess who?

110
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,039
Let me see.
Soft, lovely hands,

111
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,874
long, supple fingers.

112
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,542
I don't know. Candy?

113
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,629
- Candy?
- I'm in trouble.

114
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,297
It's my wife.

115
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,467
What are you doing here?

116
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,304
I came by to see how
the most handsome salesman's doing.

117
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,598
If I see him, I'll ask him.

118
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,768
Me... not so good.
I stink at this job.

119
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,188
- I have no killer instinct.
- You don't belong here.

120
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,525
- You should be home writing plays.
- Somebody has to pay the rent.

121
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,986
Who needs money?
We can live on love.

122
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,238
Wouldn't that be nice?

123
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,576
What's going on?
Is something wrong?

124
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,495
I hope not.

125
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,332
It's just I have
some unexpected news.

126
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,420
- And promise me you won't get mad.
- Kate, what is it?

127
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,256
I'm pregnant.

128
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,426
I know we didn't plan this,

129
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:57,346
and you always want to be
the man with the plan, but...

130
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,562
You're happy?

131
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,566
Of course, I'm happy.
I'm gonna be a father!

132
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,198
You had another wife and family?

133
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,701
I'm sorry I never told you.

134
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,416
It doesn't matter.

135
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,755
Let him go.

136
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,719
You're not curious
about what happened to his first wife?

137
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,849
It's his business...

138
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,935
There are reasons he kept it secret.
Isn't that right?

139
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,103
Let her go.

140
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,064
You got what you wanted,
someone to blame, me.

141
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,400
Look at the fear in his eyes.

142
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,569
He knows what's coming.

143
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,031
I'll leave you with Damien.

144
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,325
You'll find it very informative.

145
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,577
Don't do this, you son of a bitch!

146
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,377
Did you order pot stickers?

147
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,130
Double order.
You're eating for two now.

148
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,132
Can you believe this?

149
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,511
You and me, parents.
What's it gonna be like?

150
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:20,679
I have no idea.

151
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,057
But I can't wait to find out.

152
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,814
The moo shu has arrived.

153
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,565
Go.

154
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,574
Delivery.

155
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,951
What happened to Mr. Yin?
He usually delivers.

156
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,452
He couldn't make it.

157
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,246
Okay, so... how much do I owe you?

158
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,414
All of it.

159
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,587
I can't move.
What did you do?

160
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,130
Where's the money?

161
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,341
- How did you do that?
- Kate, give him your purse.

162
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,603
- This is it?
- That's all. Take it and go.

163
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:11,397
What are you?

164
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,241
Kate... My God.

165
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,574
Give it up.

166
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,787
Can't go forever
without talking to me.

167
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,790
I mean, you've gone a month.
That's impressive.

168
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,043
There isn't anybody out there.
There never will be.

169
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,839
I won't spend the rest of my life here,
alone, with you.

170
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,927
It isn't exactly heaven
for me either.

171
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,387
Here.

172
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,724
I know you like comics.
I couldn't find <i>Doc Savage</i> or <i>Flash</i>.

173
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,892
What's wrong?

174
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,853
You need to stop messing around
and focus.

175
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,400
Focus, right? 'cause we got to get out
of here so we can go rescue...

176
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,361
What's her name again?

177
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,989
Emma.

178
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,783
Her name's Emma.

179
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:50,579
It's time to face reality.
That girl is gone.

180
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,582
If she was meant to kill thousands,
they're dead too.

181
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,626
Everybody's dead except us.

182
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,712
The only thing that's real is us.

183
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,145
You think you've been here for years,
but this is all just a dream.

184
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,898
If this is all a dream,
how are there books, huh?

185
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,276
- How did Parkman make books?
- Because it's your dream.

186
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,321
How could I know all the words
to <i>Pillars of the Earth</i> or <i>Catch-22?</i>

187
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,157
Maybe you read it somewhere,

188
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,784
- it's in your subconscious.
- I didn't read <i>9th wonders!</i>

189
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,786
- I did.
- So now we're in your head?

190
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,290
I don't know! I don't know
how this all works!

191
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,085
- Don't you want to get out of here?
- Yeah, of course!

192
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,922
You don't, do you?

193
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,886
- You don't want to get out of here.
- Maybe I deserve all this aloneness...

194
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,639
This nothing, maybe I earned it.

195
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,059
Yeah, maybe you have,
but I can't do this on my own.

196
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,936
I need you to help me...

197
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,324
All right, Peter.

198
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,995
You want me to help you?

199
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,917
I want to help.

200
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,049
Where did that come from?

201
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,765
That's the wall from...
Parkman's basement.

202
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,726
What's it doing here?

203
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,066
- This is our way out.
- What?

204
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,110
Don't you get it?
We have to break through.

205
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,649
Can I help you?

206
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,819
I was just leaving.

207
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,197
You're hurt. Let me see.

208
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,326
I'm a doctor. Please.

209
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,045
You don't have to do this.
I don't want you to get in trouble.

210
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,923
I have a hearing loss.
Say that again?

211
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,719
My name is Lauren.
I came here to stop Samuel Sullivan.

212
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,931
You were with the man
who shot everyone. Bennet?

213
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,142
Bennet never fired his gun.

214
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,687
Your leader, Samuel,
is not what he appears to be.

215
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,522
He's the one responsible.

216
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,899
He wouldn't shoot his own people.

217
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,235
You're wrong.
He's done terrible things.

218
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,738
And now he's trying to galvanize
his people around a common enemy.

219
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,532
I got to check in with the doc.

220
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,411
Samuel's coming.
Don't tell him I'm here!

221
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,130
Everything all right?

222
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,930


223
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:43,979


224
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,985


225
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,990


226
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,453


227
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,543


228
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,343


229
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,938
It's all right.

230
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,232
I just want to talk.

231
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,863
Well, look what we have here.

232
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,912
Your first wife
was murdered by a special?

233
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,585
That was a long time ago.

234
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,340
And the person I was
then died that night with Kate.

235
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,931
I'm sorry I never told you.

236
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,433
That's okay.

237
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,853
Some things you just can't...

238
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,313
say out loud.

239
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,735
But that's the reason why
you joined the company.

240
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,489
That's how you became
Mr. Bag and tag.

241
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,161
I don't need to see any more.

242
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,170


243
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,976
Don't move.

244
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,898
- You want my wallet? Take it.
- Don't move!

245
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,985
I'm not after your money.

246
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,654
What, then?

247
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:42,116
Information. I know what you are.

248
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,409
I know what you can do.

249
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,996
- How?
- It doesn't matter.

250
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,624
I'm looking for somebody,
one of you.

251
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,752
One of me?

252
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,921
What are you talking about?

253
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,799
- There's someone else like me?
- Don't give me that.

254
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,261
What you do isn't normal.
You have to know each other.

255
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,222
The guy I'm looking for
is named Richard.

256
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,933
He's about 6 feet tall,
got dark hair.

257
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,476
Maybe 23 years old.

258
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,895
He can move things with his mind.

259
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,773
He killed my wife.

260
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,319
I don't know anyone else like me.

261
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,487
I swear.

262
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,157
I don't believe you.

263
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,287
- It was an accident.
- You brought a gun.

264
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,456
I didn't know what I would find.

265
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,832
I was scared.

266
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,043
The first time you killed anyone.

267
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,634
What happens next?

268
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,019
One owner, low miles,

269
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,854
hottest car I got on the lot.

270
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,897
It's the best I can do,
take it or leave it.

271
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:40,150
- You said...
- You know, I got another buyer

272
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,693
who's chomping at the bit.

273
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:43,320
What's it gonna be?

274
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,782
I guess we'll take it.

275
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,701
Excellent choice.

276
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,370
I'll have my manager draw up
the papers. Excuse me.

277
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,082
Hey, there.

278
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,793
- Can I interest you in a car?
- Not really.

279
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,670
I'm here to offer you a job.

280
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,966
- Do I know you?
- We've been watching you.

281
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,301
The way you killed that special...

282
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,761
The repairman.

283
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,805
We'd been tracking him too,
only you got there first.

284
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:11,973
Relax.

285
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,434
Your secret is safe with us.

286
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,103
We're impressed,

287
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,981
so impressed, in fact,
we'd like you to come work for us.

288
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,400
Who are you?

289
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,236
My name is Thompson.

290
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,864
My associates and I can help you
Find the man who killed your wife.

291
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,617
And then you can help us...

292
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,952
find the rest.

293
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,834
How's it working out for you, the...

294
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:42,295
"one of us, one of them?"

295
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,048
To tell you the truth,
it's been quite an adjustment.

296
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,342
I mean, Claude can go invisible
anytime he wants.

297
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,512
- It gives him a distinct advantage.
- Advantage?

298
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,681
You're supposed to be partners.

299
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,934
What is it, trust issues?

300
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,103
I mean, how could it not be?

301
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,771
He's abnormal.

302
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,607
I mean, sometimes when I'm alone,
I get...

303
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,527
this feeling in my gut
that he's watching me.

304
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,322
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I do.

305
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,325
You know, your case
is highly unusual, Bennet.

306
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,661
How you came to our attention,

307
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,122
what happened to your wife.

308
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,166
It would be only natural
that you would harbor a grudge.

309
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,797
- What are you getting at?
- 17 cases,

310
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,800
three deaths, all attributed to you.

311
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,803
They were all accidents.
That's been verified.

312
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,055
Two corned beefs.
Need anything else?

313
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,391
No, we're all set.
Thanks.

314
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,107
At this point, the company
has too much invested in you

315
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,358
to cut ties.

316
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,236
But we do need you to make a change.

317
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,657
Take a wife, start a family.

318
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,576
Is that a joke?

319
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,247
It'll put your life in balance,
calm you down...

320
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:01,541
so there will be fewer incidents.

321
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,627
A wife?

322
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,048
- I can't do that again.
- Sure, you can.

323
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,676
That cute number who brought
the sandwiches will do fine.

324
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,274
And if I refuse?

325
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,901
You won't.

326
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,080
 The company arranged your marriage.

327
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,917
They encouraged me but I chose
your mother because I loved her.

328
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,543
You know that.

329
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,046
The company seems to make
a lot of decisions for you.

330
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,340
They made many decisions.
That's all over with.

331
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,468
All the memories you're seeing now,
that's all they are.

332
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,345
It's just the past.

333
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,193


334
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,904
Hey, Mr. Bennet.

335
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,948
What are you doing here?

336
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,784
Came to see Claire.
Would you know where she is?.

337
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:20,703
No idea.

338
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,751
You don't have to lie for her.

339
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,257
I know that Claire stole the compass,
and I would bet good money

340
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,592
the two of you drove out
to the carnival together.

341
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,512
My question is,
why didn't she come back with you?

342
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,643
She wanted to stay.
She said she'd be back on Monday.

343
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,604
You left her there?

344
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,855
Do you not see what's happening?

345
00:26:48,022 --> 00:26:49,899
That she is getting
involved in something

346
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,735
that she clearly doesn't understand.

347
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,153
Maybe she wants to understand it.

348
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,738
This isn't a game.

349
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,699
These carnival people are killers.

350
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,828
You don't think I know that?
She needs to be with people like her.

351
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,539
If they're not good for her,
trust her to know the difference.

352
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,667
You have to stop encouraging her.
You need to work with me on this.

353
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,253
- I want her to be happy.
- She is happy,

354
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,298
with you here in college,
Living a normal life.

355
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,176
What if that's not enough for her?

356
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,844
It has to be.

357
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,560
What's he doing here?

358
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:29,063
Are you gonna erase my memory?

359
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,406
Not if you do what I ask.

360
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,538
You were missing. I didn't know
how to find you, if I would find you.

361
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,458
- You don't trust me.
- I don't trust Samuel.

362
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,127
- Gretchen is fine.
- You threatened her!

363
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,672
And this was not some distant past.
This was now.

364
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,281
- You should eat.
- Don't need to eat.

365
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,784
Don't need to sleep.

366
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,536
Don't need anything.

367
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,500
Any progress today?

368
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,339
It's just like yesterday...

369
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,300
- And the day before that.
- And...

370
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:41,928
the day before that.

371
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,638
Now it's been...

372
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,765
I don't even know
how long it's been.

373
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,352
- Don't tell me how long it's been.
- You can't even dent it, Peter.

374
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,729
I don't know how much longer
you can keep this up.

375
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,440
As long as it takes.

376
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,110
I know that look.

377
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:00,196
You have it all the time.

378
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,698
What look?

379
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,953
Like when Kaplan beat you at the dash
and we ran to school every morning

380
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,289
and kept training
and kept it up, right?

381
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,000
That is Nathan's memory.
That's not yours.

382
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,171
I told you to stop doing that.

383
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,757
You're not him.

384
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,926
You're nothing like him.

385
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,471
So you've told me.

386
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,483
Look, I know that I've said it before,
but...

387
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,156
I'm sorry.

388
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,870
I'm sorry that I killed him.
I'm sorry that I took him from you.

389
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,413
Sorry!

390
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,916
You keep saying that
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

391
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,585
That's not gonna bring
my brother back.

392
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,713
- It doesn't change anything.
- You're right!

393
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,423
Nothing changes!

394
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,386
We're stuck here forever,
you and me!

395
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,689
I can't take it anymore.

396
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,743
You're with that company,

397
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,663
- cut from the same cloth as Bennet.
- This doesn't have to end badly.

398
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,291
You can turn yourself in,
release Bennet and his daughter.

399
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,794
- Why would I do that?
- You love your family,

400
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,671
and you don't want them to get hurt,
and they will get hurt.

401
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,341
You people are always
so sure of yourselves.

402
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,427
I know what's best
for my own family.

403
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,471
- And what is that?
- Change.

404
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,933
We're strong enough
to show ourselves, take what's ours.

405
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,310
You don't have the right
to take anything.

406
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,812
Of course we do.

407
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,523
We deserve admiration, respect.

408
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,485
And you intend
to hurt people to get it?

409
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,487
What would you have me do?

410
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,991
Continue with this life?

411
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,285
Live in a carnival?

412
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,456
Why not? You've lived here
happily for years.

413
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,333
Wasted years, unfulfilled years.

414
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,586
I could've been so much more.

415
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,338
You know about me?

416
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,257
About the film?

417
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,388
Do you know how powerful
I can really be...

418
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,641
if I brought them all here?

419
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,895
My brother said
I could move mountains, cities.

420
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:40,148
I wonder. Is it true?

421
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,568
Can I change the world?

422
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,071
I hope to God we never find out.

423
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,912
What did the world ever do to you?

424
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,290
Should've treated me better.

425
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,460
Don't do this, please.

426
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,345
The Bennet girl left
the house of mirrors.

427
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:14,265
Well, I'll just have
to have a word with her.

428
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,686
It's time to gather the family.

429
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,481
Tell them to pack up.
We're moving on to biggerthings.

430
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:25,318
Tell them it's gonna be
the greatest show we've ever done.

431
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,696
You've been quite helpful, Lauren.

432
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,492
You and your friends
take care of her, would you? Thanks.

433
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,382
What are you gonna do?

434
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,220
I'm gonna end this.

435
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,686
I can't bring Nathan back, Peter.

436
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:03,314
But I can sure as hell
swing a sledgehammer.

437
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,413
I'm sorry to put you through that.

438
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,751
I hope through this painful experience
you can finally see the truth.

439
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,799
You were right, Samuel.

440
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,467
My dad is a bad guy.

441
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,346
I belong with you.

442
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,850
You're my hero.

443
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,104
That's what you want to hear,
what this is all about.

444
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,818
Why didn't you show me the memory
my dad has of shooting Lydia?

445
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,947
That wasn't on the program?

446
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,241
Maybe he didn't pull the trigger
last night.

447
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,493
But does that negate
all the times that he has?

448
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,329
To this day, he lies to you,

449
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,041
deceives you, his darling daughter,
because he can't trust any of us.

450
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,501
You actually thought
that I would turn on him?

451
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,046
You just don't understand, do you?

452
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,259
Maybe it was
'cause no one ever really loved you.

453
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,970
You call these people your family,
but they're not.

454
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,221
They fear you.

455
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,558
Give me my dad, and we're leaving.

456
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:21,976
No, sorry.

457
00:34:22,768 --> 00:34:23,978
You're too important.

458
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,897
Especially
when everything's ready to change.

459
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:28,899
What's going on?
Where's everyone going?

460
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:31,903
I was talking to a new friend
about who I am, what I can be.

461
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,406
The way she looked at me,
She was so afraid.

462
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,159
I want to see that look again
a thousand times over.

463
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,952
Meaning what?

464
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,497
It's time for our biggest show ever.

465
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,461
No more hiding in the shadows.
It's time to show ourselves, be strong.

466
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,507
We're going to New York City,
bring the whole place to Central Park.

467
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,967
We'll show them how powerful we are.

468
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,803
You can't do that.

469
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,764
Some lives will unfortunately be lost,
but they'll fear us, respect us.

470
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:04,394
- It's what we've always wanted.
- I have never wanted that.

471
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,898
You will inherit this new world.
It's your legacy.

472
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,442
You will remind them what I've done
long after I've gone.

473
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,695
That's why
you must be a part of our family.

474
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,073
You are desperate.

475
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,200
And you're small.

476
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,371
I will never be
a part of your family.

477
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,916
You sound just like your father.
I had so hoped to convince you.

478
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,001
In time, you can change your mind.

479
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,629
Don't hold your breath.

480
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,714
Right.

481
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,801
Your father's
in the souvenir trailer.

482
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,309
I had a little trouble
with the government lady,

483
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,604
playing some cat and mouse,
but the mouse got away.

484
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,981
- Do you want me to go find her?
- Not worth it.

485
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:52,858
- Everything okay?
- It will be.

486
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,362
Claire Bennet needs some time
to think about my offer.

487
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,699
I'll give her that opportunity.

488
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,132
I want to explain what you saw.

489
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,050
We'll talk about it later.

490
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:24,598
What is that?

491
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,789
Now I'm ready to go.

492
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,543
- New York City.
- Sounds fun.

493
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,295
It will be.

494
00:36:55,337 --> 00:36:57,339
I'm afraid
you'll have to join us later.

495
00:36:58,048 --> 00:36:59,592
There's loose ends to attend to.

496
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,345
Before Lydia died,
she spoke of people

497
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,389
who want to interfere
with our plans.

498
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,976
I'll need you to stop them,
permanently.

499
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,424
Happy birthday.

500
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,760
It's not my birthday.

501
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,345
I know.

502
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,889
You just wore out your other copy...

503
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,392
and I saw that one, digging around.

504
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,688
I appreciate you...

505
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,857
being patient with me,

506
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,652
keeping me sane.

507
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,530
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

508
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,246
You want to know something weird?

509
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,169
Every time you pick that thing up,
I think you'll hit me really hard.

510
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,796
That is weird,

511
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,299
every time I pick it up,
I feel like I'll hit you too.

512
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,009
- Really hard.
- Why?

513
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,389
Because you are who you are.

514
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,895
I wish I could accept your apologies,
but if I forgive you,

515
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,189
I'm not doing right by him.

516
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,946
If you let go of your anger,
you're afraid you'll lose him forever?

517
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,743
So you've held on to it
this entire time?

518
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,204
I feel it slipping away, but...

519
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,790
then I look at you,

520
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,084
and I see you killing him.

521
00:38:58,043 --> 00:38:59,921
You took my brother away from me.

522
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,925
We've been here
for I don't know how many years.

523
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,719
Together.

524
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,723
I've changed. I've repented.
I'll never hurt anyone ever again.

525
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:15,227
And all this time,
you were afraid to let me out.

526
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,155
I'm not that guy anymore.
You know that.

527
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,118
I know.

528
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,831
I know you're not.

529
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,568
How long has it been, really?

530
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,863
Half a day, maybe.

531
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,991
It feels like
we were in there for years.

532
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,038
Does that make it any less real?

533
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,292
Let's save Emma.

534
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:13,137
Sorry to break up the love fest,
but I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

535
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,506
No signal.

536
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:53,677
- You all right?
- Yeah, you?

537
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:55,971
Here, help me get these ropes off.

538
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,187
Is that a lantern over there?

539
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,033
- We're buried.
- How far down do you think we are?

540
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,201
I don't know.

541
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,620
It felt like we dropped
40 or 50 feet.

542
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,500
Can anybody hear us?

543
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:27,670
Help!
Can anybody hear us?
