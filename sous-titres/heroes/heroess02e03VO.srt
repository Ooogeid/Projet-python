1
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,100
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOURSELF.

2
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

3
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,700
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
LAS VEGAS.

4
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER WAY,
MICAH...

5
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,300
WE'RE A FAMILY.

6
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,100
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO STAY TOGETHER.

7
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,500
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
AT A FRESH START.

8
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
WITHOUT DAD?

9
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,000
HEY.

10
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,100
I PROMISE YOU,

11
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,700
WHENEVER YOU WANT
TO SEE YOUR FATHER,

12
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,600
I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT HAPPENS.

13
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,200
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

14
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
HEY.

15
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,400
NO, HE'S STILL SLEEPING.

16
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,900
WHAT CAN I SAY?
THE GUY'S TIRED.

17
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,900
YOU--HE'S WAKING UP.
I'LL HAVE TO CALL YOU LATER.

18
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,400
YEAH.

19
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,100
GOOD MORNING,
SLEEPYHEAD.

20
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
YOU WANNA GO
FOR A DIP?

21
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,200
WHERE AM I?

22
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,900
WE'RE IN MAUI.

23
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,200
NICE, HUH?

24
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,300
FEEL THOSE TRADE WINDS.

25
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,900
WHO ARE YOU?

26
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,600
I'M MICHELLE.

27
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,900
I USED TO GO BY CANDICE,

28
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,200
BUT EVER SINCE I PULLED YOU
OFF OF KIRBY PLAZA...

29
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,300
THE POLICE HAVE KIND OF BEEN
LOOKING FOR MY OLD SELF.

30
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,300
I'M GOING FOR A NEW LOOK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31
00:31:58,800 --> 00:05:36,200
I'M GOING FOR A NEW LOOK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

32
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,300
YOU DRAGGED ME OFF
KIRBY PLAZA?

33
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,900
AFTER YOU GOT STABBED
THROUGH THE CHEST

34
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,800
WITH A SAMURAI SWORD.

35
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,200
EIGHT SURGERIES LATER
AND HERE WE ARE.

36
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,500
WHICH REMINDS ME,

37
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,600
DON'T TRY TO MOVE
OR YOU'LL RIP YOUR STITCHES.

38
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,700
DAIQUIRI?

39
00:31:58,800 --> 00:05:54,800
STITCHES?

40
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

41
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,100
I COVERED 'EM UP.

42
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,700
I MAKE ILLUSIONS.

43
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,100
IT'S KINDA MY THING.

44
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,000
SO NONE OF THIS
IS REAL?

45
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,900
SHOW ME WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE.

46
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,800
HONEY, YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

47
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,100
SHOW ME.

48
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,200
AH! AAH!

49
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
HEY.

50
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,700
YOUR MOM MADE WAFFLES.

51
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,000
UH, OKAY. I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

52
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,600
YOU WERE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY.

53
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,300
YOU TRIED TO TALK TO ME,
AND I LOST MY TEMPER.

54
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,700
I'M SORRY.

55
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,300
NO, IT'S FINE.

56
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
I SHOULDN'T HAVE AMBUSHED YOU
WITH ALL THOSE QUESTIONS.

57
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,800
OF COURSE YOU SHOULD, CLAIRE.

58
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,500
I'VE ASKED YOU TO CARRY AROUND
A HECK OF A SECRET.

59
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,600
AND I THINK SOMETIMES
I DON'T APPRECIATE

60
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,100
HOW DIFFICULT THAT MUST BE.

61
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,000
SO IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO ASK ME,

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,800
AS LONG AS WE'RE IN THE PRIVACY
OF OUR OWN HOME,

63
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,500
PLEASE, ASK AWAY.

64
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,100
IF SOMEONE HERE
FOUND OUT ABOUT ME,

65
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,200
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

66
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,100
WE'D HAVE TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA
IMMEDIATELY.

67
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
GO DEEPER INTO HIDING.

68
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,000
MAYBE FORGO SCHOOLS
AND JOBS ALTOGETHER.

69
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,100
THAT'S WORST CASE SCENARIO.

70
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
IT WAS A PEDICURE.

71
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,500
I'M SORRY.

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
THE OTHER NIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING.

73
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,900
I WAS GIVING MYSELF A PEDICURE.

74
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,100
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

75
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,900
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU CREEPING AROUND MY HOUSE

76
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
AT NIGHT ANYWAY?

77
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,100
JUST TRYIN' TO LEND YOU A BOOK.

78
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,100
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,

79
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,600
IF I WANT TO START A BOOK CLUB WITH YOU,

80
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,300
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

81
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,900
UNTIL THEN,
JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME.

82
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
WILL DO. JUST WALK ME
THROUGH THIS ONE LAST TIME.

83
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,000
I DIDN'T SEE YOU CUT OFF YOUR TOE,

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,700
IS THAT RIGHT?

85
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,400
THE BOTTLE OF NAIL POLISH FELL OVER

86
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,800
AND IT JUST LOOKED LIKE IT WAS BLEEDING.

87
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,400
IMPROVISING IS REALLY NOT YOUR FORTE.

88
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
WHY ARE YOU SUCH A SMART-ASS?

89
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,600
WHY ARE YOU SO BAD AT LYING?

90
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,700
I'M NOT LYING.

91
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,700
FINE THEN.
YOU GAVE YOURSELF A PEDICURE.

92
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
AND YOUR TOE CAME OFF
AND THEN CAME BACK ON.

93
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,300
WORKS FOR ME.

94
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,600
I'M GOING TO CLASS.

95
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,100
DON'T DO YOUR NAILS ON THE WAY.

96
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,500
FREEZE!

97
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,100
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

98
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,800
MOHINDER.

99
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,400
QUIET DOWN. YOU'LL WAKE MOLLY.

100
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN CAIRO.

101
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,200
HAITI, ACTUALLY.

102
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,700
MY PLANE GOT IN
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.

103
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,300
I'LL BE WORKING HERE
IN THE CITY FROM NOW ON.

104
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,500
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN THE FIELD.

105
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,600
THEY'RE SETTING ME UP
IN A PLACE DOWNTOWN.

106
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
WHICH MEANS I'LL BE AROUND
TO HELP WITH MOLLY.

107
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,000
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DOING YOUR SPY WORK

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
IN OUR OWN BACK YARD--GREAT.

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
SOMEONE'S GROUCHY
WHEN THEY DON'T GET THEIR SLEEP.

110
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,200
MOLLY'S STRUGGLING.

111
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,600
NIGHTMARES, PROBLEMS AT SCHOOL.

112
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,800
I CAN'T BABYSIT
HER AND YOU AT THE SAME TIME.

113
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,400
AND WHY WOULD I NEED BABYSITTING?

114
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,600
YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD.

115
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,400
THANK YOU, BUT--

116
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,300
THEY ABDUCTED ME.
KEPT ME PRISONER.

117
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,700
I KNOW YOU THINK YOU CAN
BEAT THEM AT THEIR OWN GAME,

118
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,500
BUT, MOHINDER, NO OFFENSE,

119
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,300
YOU'RE A PROFESSOR.

120
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
YOU'RE NOT 007.

121
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,200
I TOLD MYSELF I WOULD DO 
WHATEVER IT TOOK

122
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
TO TAKE DOWN THE COMPANY.

123
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
THAT'S HOW I CAN HELP MOLLY.

124
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,900
YOU WANT TO HELP MOLLY?
DON'T DIE ON HER.

125
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,700
MOHINDER, YOU'RE HOME!

126
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

127
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,300
AND I'M NEVER LEAVING AGAIN.

128
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,600
WHAT IN HEAVEN?

129
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,800
ALL THIS BLOOD AND NO WOUND.

130
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,100
YOU HAVE A POWER!

131
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,100
AN AMAZING POWER!

132
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,200
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?

133
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,200
THIS IS HOW YOU BECOME A HERO!

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,100
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

135
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,700
THIS MUST BE SOME SORT OF TRICK.

136
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,600
NO. LOOK.

137
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,500
AH!

138
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,200
LAZARUS RISEN.

139
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,900
YOU'VE CURSED ME.

140
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,200
NO. THIS IS NOT A CURSE.
IT'S A GIFT.

141
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
THIS GIFT WILL HELP YOU
THROUGH THE TRIALS.

142
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,300
TO HELP FIND THE FIRE SCROLL,

143
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
UH, THE 90 HUNGRY RONINS,

144
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,400
HELP RESCUE YAEKO'S FATHER.

145
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,000
GET AWAY FROM ME!
YOU'RE A DEVIL.

146
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,700
NO, NO.

147
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,000
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

148
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,000
KENSEI, WAIT!

149
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
WE HAVE TO WRITE HISTORY!

150
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
LIGHTNING.

151
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,500
LIGHTNING! SPARKS!

152
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,500
LIGHTNING!

153
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,100
SO YOU JUST YELL IT OUT.

154
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,300
WELL, I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS.

155
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,500
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

156
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
SO FAR, I GOT NOTHIN'.

157
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,100
WELL, IT'S A SHAME YOU CAN'T 

158
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,100
ORDER LIGHTNING UP
LIKE A PLATE OF CHIPS.

159
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,600
SURE WOULD COME IN HANDY TONIGHT.

160
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,800
GOD, YOU KNOW, I CAN
DO ALL THESE THINGS.

161
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,800
IT'S JUST--I FEEL POWERLESS.

162
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
IT'S TOUGH NOT KNOWING WHO YOU ARE.

163
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,900
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE I MIGHT JUST DIE

164
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,300
BEFORE I EVER FIGURE IT OUT.

165
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,100
MAYBE YOU'RE AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL,

166
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
ESCAPED FROM A GOVERNMENT FACILITY.

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,900
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

168
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,600
I'M PRETTY EXCITED TO SEE YOU OPEN THAT BOX.

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT TONIGHT.

170
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,300
I'LL BE THERE TO WATCH YOUR BACK.

171
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
HOW DO I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU?

172
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,100
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE
ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO,

173
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,000
NOW HAVE I?

174
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,500
WHY IS THAT?

175
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
GIRL'S GOTTA HAVE HER SECRETS.

176
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,500
DUDE, YOU LOOK LIKE ASS.

177
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,300
NO ENGLISH.

178
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,300
ALL RIGHT.

179
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,400
TODAY, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MITOSIS.

180
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
YES, WEST.

181
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,200
I HAVE A QUESTION
ABOUT YESTERDAY'S TOPIC.

182
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,500
REGENERATION IN LIZARDS.

183
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,700
NOW, I KNOW YOU SAID
HUMANS COULDN'T REGENERATE.

184
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,200
BUT WHAT IF A LIZARD
WERE TO MATE WITH A HUMAN?

185
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,400
COULD THEIR OFFSPRING DO IT?

186
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
BECAUSE I THINK
I MET A LIZARD GIRL.

187
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,500
THIS DOESN'T STRIKE ME

188
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,400
AS A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION, WEST.

189
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,000
BUT SERIOUSLY.

190
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,200
WHAT IF THAT LIZARD GIRL
WERE TO ACCIDENTALLY

191
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,600
CUT OFF HER ARM,

192
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,300
OR A LEG, OR YOU NAME
THE APPENDAGE,

193
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,100
IN SOME KIND OF...

194
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,600
HORRIFYING SPA DEBACLE?

195
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
WHERE EXACTLY ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?

196
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
WOULD SAID APPENDAGE

197
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
REATTACH ITSELF

198
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,400
BACK ONTO HER LIZARD BODY?

199
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,000
I CUT MYSELF AND THE WOUND HEALS

200
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,900
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

201
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,900
YOU ARE A HERO, LIKE ME.

202
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,400
I HAVE POWERS TOO.

203
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,200
YOU?

204
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,400
- REALLY?
- YES.

205
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,100
I CAN STOP TIME
AND MOVE THROUGH SPACE.

206
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,000
AH.

207
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,100
HELLO.

208
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
HOW ARE SUCH THINGS POSSIBLE?

209
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
SOME SAY IT'S A GIFT FROM GOD.

210
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,700
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S EVOLUTION.

211
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
WHAT IS THAT?

212
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
EVOLUTION?

213
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,000
IT MEANS YOU CAN HEAL
FROM ANY WOUND.

214
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,400
REALLY? ANY WOUND?

215
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,000
SWORD?

216
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,700
SERPENT? FIRE?

217
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,300
THIS'LL MAKE ME RICHER
THAN THE POPE.

218
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,600
RICH?

219
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,400
YES!

220
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,800
SWORDSMAN ARE OBSESSED
WITH DUELS IN THIS COUNTRY.

221
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I'LL CLEAN UP IN WAGES.

222
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,500
YOU HAVE TO DEFEAT WHITE BEARD

223
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,700
AND FIGHT THE 90 HUNGRY RONIN.

224
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,200
IF YOU'RE OBSESSED
WITH MY STORIES SO MUCH,

225
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
HOW ABOUT YOU HANDLE THEM?

226
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,100
KENSEI, YOU HAVE TO STOP
WALKING AWAY FROM YOUR DESTINY!

227
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,600
WHO'S GOING TO STOP ME? WHO?

228
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,900
NO ONE IS GOING TO STOP ME

229
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,800
BECAUSE NO ONE CAN STOP ME.

230
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,300
GOD. THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY!

231
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,100
WHERE HAVE YOU TAKEN ME?

232
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,900
TO GET THE FIRE SCROLL.

233
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,500
IT'S ON TOP OF THOSE STEPS.

234
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
WHO ARE THEY?

235
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,900
THOSE ARE THE 90 ANGRY RONIN,
SWORN TO PROTECT IT.

236
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,700
HOW ANGRY ARE THEY?

237
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
GOOD LUCK, KENSEI.

238
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,400
YOU CAN DO THIS.

239
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,700
I TAKE IT YOU'RE ANNOYED.

240
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,700
WHAT IS IT, WEST?

241
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,100
HUH?

242
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,900
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

243
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,700
I WANT YOU TO ADMIT
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

244
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,900
OKAY, FINE.
I'M A FREAK. ALL RIGHT?

245
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,600
CLAIRE.

246
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,300
I AM SUCH A FREAK, IN FACT,
THAT I HAVE TO TIPTOE

247
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
AROUND THIS SCHOOL PRETENDING TO BE

248
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,700
SOME BRAINLESS BARBIE DOLL

249
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,200
SO NOBODY NOTICES
HOW DIFFERENT I AM.

250
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
'CAUSE IF THEY FOUND OUT,

251
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,600
I'D BE CARTED OFF
TO SOME HUMAN ZOO

252
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,900
SO I COULD BE POKED
AND PRODDED AT

253
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,200
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

254
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,400
SO YEAH, WEST, I'M DIFFERENT.

255
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,100
AND YOU CAN TELL THE WORLD
IF YOU WANT TO,

256
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,800
BECAUSE I AM TIRED OF PRETENDING
TO BE SOMEONE I'M NOT.

257
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,400
CLAIRE, SHUT UP.

258
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,500
A SHOCKER IN EXTRA TIME.

259
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,600
AC MILAN ONE, CELTIC NIL.

260
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,700
COMING UP NEXT ON THE NEWS--

261
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,300
BE CAREFUL.

262
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,600
YOU TOO.

263
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,500
YES, WHO'S THERE?

264
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,800
SAFELINE. HERE FOR THE PICKUP.

265
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,200
HEY! HEY.

266
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,800
I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

267
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,500
ALL RIGHT, BACK AWAY, FRIEND.

268
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,400
I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND, OKAY?

269
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,900
JUST GIVE ME MY $200 BACK.

270
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,400
LOOK, CELTIC WAS SUPPOSED

271
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,500
TO BE A LOCK TO WIN, OKAY?

272
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,400
JUST HELP A GUY OUT.

273
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM.

274
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,200
ACTUALLY, IT IS YOUR PROBLEM.

275
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,400
TIE HIM UP, TUKO.

276
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,900
MIND THESE TWO.

277
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,200
STAY DOWN!

278
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,900
THAT'LL BE THAT NOW.

279
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
THERE HE IS!

280
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
UHH! STOP!

281
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,200
GO!

282
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,900
ISN'T THIS ISAAC MENDEZ'S LOFT?

283
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,800
THE PAINTER.

284
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,000
IT WAS.

285
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,200
UNTIL SYLAR KILLED HIM.

286
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
HE WAS MURDERED?

287
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,600
EVERY SPACE HAS SOME UNHAPPINESS
IN ITS PAST.

288
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
THE COMPANY RECENTLY POURED
A LOT OF MONEY

289
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,600
INTO OUTFITTING THIS LABORATORY.

290
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,700
EVERYTHING STATE OF THE ART.

291
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
WELL, LUCKY TIMING FOR ME THEN.

292
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,700
MOHINDER, IT WAS BUILT FOR YOU.

293
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
I'M SORRY.

294
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,800
YOU DON'T REALIZE
HOW VALUED YOU ARE

295
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
HERE AT THE COMPANY.

296
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED

297
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,000
TO KEEP A CLOSE WATCH ON YOU.

298
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,100
TO ANTICIPATE YOUR EVERY NEED.

299
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,300
THAT IS VERY GENEROUS OF YOU.

300
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,100
BUT REALLY, I PREFER TO WORK ON MY OWN.

301
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,000
SUPERVISION IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST...

302
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,600
AND IN OURS.

303
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,200
YOU'RE PART OF THE FAMILY NOW.

304
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,600
 THE SCROLL!

305
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,400
THINGS'LL BE BETTER NOW.
YOU'LL SEE.

306
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
BUT YOU HAVE
TO REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE.

307
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,900
NO MORE POWERS.

308
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,100
I JUST DON'T SEE THE POINT

309
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,800
OF US HAVING THESE ABILITIES
WHEN WE DON'T EVEN USE THEM.

310
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
THE POINT IS STAYING SAFE.

311
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,200
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
AT A NORMAL LIFE...

312
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,100
WITH NORMAL PEOPLE.

313
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
THEY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

314
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,200
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

315
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,600
I'LL ONLY BE GONE FOR AWHILE.

316
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,100
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
STAYING WITH FAMILY.

317
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,200
IT COULD BE FUN.

318
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,900
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THEM.

319
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,600
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I'LL BE GONE.

320
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,400
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT WHEN I GET BACK,

321
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,500
WE'LL BE TOGETHER.

322
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,300
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

323
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,900
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY
BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING BAD.

324
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,600
I LOVE YOU.

325
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,800
WELL, WELCOME TO NEW ORLEANS.

326
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,600
UHH!

327
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,900
AHH!

328
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,800
NO!

329
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,300
UHH! UHH...

330
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,000
WHAT IS THAT?

331
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
W-WAIT.

332
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,000
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

333
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,400
I HAVE A CAR.

334
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,200
OH, JEEZ.

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
PLEASE DON'T SHOOT.

343
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,300
THIS IS NO JOKE.

344
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,900
NOW GIVE ME THAT DAMN MONEY

345
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,500

00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,600

347
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,100

351
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,500

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,000
NO WAY.

353
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,100
GIVE ME THE DAMN MONEY!

354
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,300

359
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,300
UHH! OOF!

YOU BROUGHT BACK THE SCROLL.

363
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,900
NOW I KNOW THAT YOU WILL GET
THE REST OF THEM UP

364
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,100
TO WHITE BEARD'S CAMP.

365
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,900
AND EVEN YAEKO LOVES YOU.

366
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
I CAN LEAVE NOW.

367
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,800
WAIT. WAIT.
YOU'RE GOING?

368
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,800
YES, I HAVE ANOTHER LIFE TO GO TO.

369
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,700
MY FATHER...ANDO...

370
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,600
THEY'RE ALL WAITING FOR ME.

371
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
BUT WHAT IF I CAN'T
DO THIS WITHOUT YOU?

372
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,900
ONLY YOU CAN KEEP ME FROM
RETURNING TO MY HEATHEN WAYS.

373
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,300
YOU'RE LIKE A CONSCIENCE.

374
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,200
ONLY I TAKE HEED OF YOU.

375
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,100
I ALMOST BROKE HISTORY
BY COMING BACK HERE.

376
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
IF I STAY, I RISK
MAKING IT WORSE.

377
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,100
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, CARP.

378
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
YOU'VE DONE THIS GRUBBY SOUL
A GREAT KINDNESS.

379
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,200
I THANK YOU.

380
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,600
IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR.

381
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,700
NO.

382
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,500
NO, IT IS I WHO AM HONORED...

383
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,700
TO MEET THE GREAT TAKEZO KENSEI.

384
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,200
BYE, FRIEND.

385
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,900
KENSEI! KENSEI!

386
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,900
I MADE YOU SOME BREAKFAST.

387
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
I CAN'T MAKE IT MOVE.

388
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,100
THAT CUP.

389
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,700
I USED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THINGS
MOVE WITH MY MIND.

390
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,700
THANKS FOR MAKING BREAKFAST,
MICHELLE,

391
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,700
YOU'RE A REAL SPORT.

392
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,900
I CAN'T FREEZE ANYTHING.
I CAN'T MOVE THINGS.

393
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,800
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

394
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,300
UH, THEY MUST'VE DISAPPEARED

395
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
WITH YOUR INJURIES.

396
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,000
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE TAKING CARE OF ME?

397
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,100
I'M SORRY.
UH, ARE YOU BREATHING?

398
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,200
NO COLLAPSED LUNG?
NO INFECTION FROM THE WOUND?

399
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,000
EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR,

400
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,800
EVERYTHING THAT I HAD,
IT'S GONE.

401
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,200
LISTEN, THE PEOPLE
I WORK FOR,

402
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,700
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE SURE
YOU GET BETTER.

403
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,100
YOUR BACK'S ALREADY HEALED.

404
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,000
IT'S JUST YOUR CHEST
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

405
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,500
AND WHEN THAT HEALS,

406
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,000
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO REACQUIRE YOUR POWERS.

407
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,700
WITH MY HELP, OF COURSE.

408
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,700
YOU. HOW ARE YOU
GONNA HELP?

409
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,900
YOU GONNA MAKE ME
SOME MORE EGGS?

410
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,600
BY MAKING IT EASY.

411
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,300
BY MAKING IT FUN.

412
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,500
I CAN TAKE YOU ANYWHERE
YOU WANT TO GO.

413
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,700
PARIS. LONDON.

414
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,200
HOW ABOUT JAPAN?

415
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,100
AND I CAN BE...

416
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,800
ANYONE YOU WANT ME TO BE.

417
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,400
IF YOUR FANTASY
IS EXOTIC...

418
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,900
OR MORE RUN-OF-THE-MILL.
OR MORE RUN-OF-THE-MILL.

419
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,300
OR SOMETHING MORE FAMILIAR,

420
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,500
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE INTO.

421
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,400
DON'T YOU SEE?

422
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,200
I CAN HELP YOU.

423
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,000
WE WERE MEANT
TO DO THIS TOGETHER.

424
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,300
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

425
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,800
YOU REALLY ARE
EXTRAORDINARY.

426
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
JUST LIKE ME.

427
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,900
YOU WERE RIGHT.

428
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,400
I AM GONNA GET
MY ABILITIES BACK.

429
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,300
STARTING WITH YOURS.

430
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,800
SO THIS IS WHAT
YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE.

431
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,900
SO SILLY TRYING TO BE
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT.

432
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,500
WELL, MICHELLE OR CANDICE
OR WHOEVER YOU ARE,

433
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,700
IT WASN'T ALL FOR NOTHING.

434
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
THANKS TO YOU...

435
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,800
I'LL BE GOING BACK
TO MAUI NOW.

436
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
LONDON.

437
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,800
JAPAN.

438
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,200
JAPAN!

439
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,400
AH!

440
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,800
IT'S NOT WORKING.

441
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I DON'T HAVE IT.

442
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,100
YOUR POWER.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

443
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,600
AHH!

444
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,900
AH, WOULD YOU QUIT
BEING SUCH A BABY, PRETTY BOY?

445
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,900
PETER.

446
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,900
I MAY NOT KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE,

447
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,000
BUT I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

448
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,900
YOU'RE ONE OF US.

449
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
AND WE HAVE NO SECRETS
AMONG FAMILY.

450
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,400
WELL?

451
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,500
WELL WHAT?

452
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
THIS IS IT.

453
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
YOUR BOX. YOUR LIFE.

454
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,200
YOU GONNA OPEN IT OR WHAT?

455
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,400
WHAT IF IT'S A LIFE
I DON'T WANT?

456
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,300
WHEN I HAD WILL
AGAINST THE WALL,

457
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,000
I COULD'VE KILLED HIM.

458
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,800
I WANTED TO.

459
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,000
WHAT IF THAT'S WHO I AM?

460
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,900
BUT YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM,
DID YOU?

461
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,000
NO, THAT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.

462
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,800
IT'S NOT
BECAUSE OF ME, PETER.

463
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,700
YOU'RE A GOOD SOUL.
I CAN TELL.

464
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,300
WHAT IF I OPEN THIS BOX
AND I FIND OTHERWISE?

465
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
DO YOU LIKE THE WAY
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?

466
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,500
DO YOU LIKE
WHO YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?

467
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,100
WELL, THEN MAYBE FOR NOW
JUST LEAVE IT BE.

468
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,400
I THINK YOURS IS COOLER.

469
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,900
ANY TIME YOUR PARENTS
GET ANNOYING,

470
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,400
YOU CAN JUST
OPEN THE WINDOW

471
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,300
AND TAKE OFF.

472
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,200
ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE.

473
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,400
YOU CAN SKYDIVE
WITHOUT A PARACHUTE.

474
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,300
YOU COULD SKYDIVE
WITHOUT A PLANE.

475
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,800
UH, YOU CAN EAT FIRE
JUST FOR KICKS.

476
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,700
I FEEL PAIN.
I JUST GET OVER IT QUICKLY.

477
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,600
SO HOW WOULD IT FEEL THEN
IF I--IF I DO THIS?

478
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,200
OW! IT HURTS!

479
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,500
WHAT ABOUT THIS THEN?
AH!

480
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
WHAT'S ON YOUR NECK?

481
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,800
A COUPLE YEARS AGO, WHEN WE
WERE LIVING IN ST. LOUIS,

482
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,300
I WAS RIDING
MY BIKE TO SCHOOL,

483
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,300
AND NEXT THING I KNEW
IT WAS A DAY LATER

484
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,500
AND I WAS WAKING UP
IN MY BED.

485
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,900
LAST THING I REMEMBER
IS THIS MAN

486
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
STEPPING OUT OF THE BUSHES
CALLING MY NAME.

487
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,700
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT MAN?

488
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,000
I DON'T KNOW
WHO HE WAS.

489
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,900
BUT I REMEMBER THE WAY
HE LOOKED AT ME.

490
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,900
LIKE I WAS AN ANIMAL
HE WANTED TO TRAP.

491
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,600
I TRY TO PUT HIM
OUT OF MY HEAD.

492
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,000
BUT SOMETIMES I CAN SEE
HIS FACE.

493
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,700
THAT GUY
WITH THE HORN-RIMMED GLASSES.

494
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,200
I HAVE ANOTHER VIAL.

495
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,600
I'LL GET STARTED ON IT
RIGHT AWAY.

496
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,000
YEAH?

497
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,100
I HAVE
TO TAKE THIS OUTSIDE.

498
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,900
WHERE ARE YOU?

499
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,100
I JUST GOT HERE.

500
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,800
I'M SITTING IN YOUR OFFICE.

501
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,300
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO CURE ME?

502
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,900
YES.

503
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,600
AND LIKE I SAID, IN EXCHANGE,
WE'RE GOING TO WANT

504
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,300
A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM YOU.

505
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,300
THEY'RE MOVING THE PAINTINGS
SOMEWHERE.

506
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,000
THERE'S ONLY
A FEW CRATES LEFT.

507
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,000
THIS WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

508
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,000
THIS GUY'S WATCHING ME
LIKE A HAWK.

509
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,300
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I'M IN OVER MY HEAD.

510
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,800
I TOLD YOU YOU HAVE
NO REASON TO WORRY.

511
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,700
AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE,
YOU WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF.

512
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,100
THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM.

513
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,600
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

514
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
I'M SENDING YOU A JPEG

515
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,700
OF A PAINTING I FOUND.

516
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,400
THE REST HAVE BEEN
SHIPPED OFF SOMEWHERE.

517
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,200
IT'S THE LAST
IN THE SERIES.

518
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,000
8 OF 8.

519
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,300
WE KNOW HOW IT BEGINS

520
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,100
WITH THE DEATH
OF KAITO NAKAMURA.

521
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,800
BUT HOW DOES IT END?

522
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,500
NOT WELL, I'M AFRAID.

523
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,700
NIGHT, CLAIRE.

524
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
NIGHT, DAD.

525
