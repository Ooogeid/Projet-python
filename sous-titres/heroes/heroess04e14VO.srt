00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,723


2
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,104
I want to see him.

3
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,615
Plane's ready to go.

4
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,163
I can handle this.
You don't have to have any part in it.

5
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:39,998
I do.

6
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,427


7
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,723
It's awful.

8
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,977
Did the police,
you know, say anything?

9
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,521
- Engine fire or...
- Accident.

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,064
Tragic accident.

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,194
I'm so sorry for your loss.

12
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:10,945
Excuse me.

13
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,711
I tried to stop him.

14
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,714
- I'm sorry.
- Stop who?

15
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,348
Good.
You remembered.

16
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,392
Get everyone to safety.

17
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,853
But not too far.
Understand? Go.

18
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,366
- You're delaying the inevitable.
- You could have killed Doyle.

19
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,326
- You didn't.
- I'll get to him.

20
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,079
I'm much more interested in you.

21
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,500
Memories were fuzzy,
like an orange left out too long,

22
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,377
but I could still find my way back.

23
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,297
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

24
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,634
Been a while since my body
and mind were together.

25
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,554
Be a crisis for a lesser man

26
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,181
having your soul ripped out of you,
but not for me.

27
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,017
I returned...

28
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,103
with one simple,

29
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,148
- singular thought.
- I know. Don't tell me.

30
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,482
Fun.

31
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,526
Feast.

32
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,909
Love what you've done
with the place.

33
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,245
Brought a lot more people in here.

34
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,165
Gonna make me a lot more powerful.

35
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,125
No, it makes me more powerful.

36
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,045
I got big plans for you.

37
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,964
Kill me now, you'll never know.

38
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,634
Everybody has big plans for me.

39
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,345
I think that's all people have.

41
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,711
You all right?

42
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,340
I... wasn't expecting to see you.

43
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,094
I thought I'd give you a lift.

44
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,599
You don't want a ride?

45
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,733
I'd prefer if you didn't come.

46
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,652
You lied to me.

47
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,405
Once again.

48
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,533
About Nathan's death,
about what you did.

49
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:28,745
God.

50
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,123
It was Sylar.

51
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,626
Did you...

52
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,588
forget that it was Sylar?

53
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,632
Did you forget what he did to me?

54
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,301
He attacked me.

55
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,970
He cut open my head.

56
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,890
He killed my father.

57
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,224
And you,

58
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,771
you dressed him up in Nathan's face,
and I hugged him.

59
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,149
And I felt love for him.

60
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,984
We did the wrong thing

61
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,653
for the right reason.

62
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,780
We found a way to contain Sylar

63
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,158
and to keep Nathan alive
at the same time.

64
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,121
- It didn't work. We shouldn't have.
- You did.

65
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,334
And I need time to grieve
without being reminded why.

66
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,569
I keep looking up too,
hoping to see him.

67
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,075
We never have been
very good with death, have we?

68
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,910
Or it's complications.

69
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,164
Can't have been easy for you,
covering this all up with Noah.

70
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,501
- How are you?
- Okay.

71
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,585
I'm okay.

72
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,588
- Nathan was a better liar.
- He got that from you.

73
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,635
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve that.

74
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,221
Sure I do.
I deserve every ounce of your wrath.

75
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,597
No, you don't.

76
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,392
Just want to put my fist
through a wall right now.

77
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,644
No, you want to put a fist
through Sylar.

78
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,232
- What do you want?
- Don't do it.

79
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,067
Nathan was right.

80
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,530
You need to fight the good fight.
Revenge will only get you killed.

81
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,450
And I cannot bear to lose you too.

82
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,165
Claire's here.

83
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,631
You want to help me in the kitchen?

84
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,176
- You trying to escape?
- As quickly as possible.

85
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,596
Why don't you take a break?

86
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,515
Thanks.

87
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,190
Where's your dad?
Didn't see him out there.

88
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,611
I asked him not to come.

89
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,114
- You're pissed.
- You're not?

90
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,908
Oh, I am.

91
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,704
Good, 'cause you're the only person
who's on the same page as me.

92
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,000
- That's a hell of a lie.
- Trying to protect us.

93
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah. That's fine.
I get that...

94
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,174
Did they really think
that they were gonna get away with it?

95
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,928
Forever? That we would
just never find out?

96
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,262
Damn it!

97
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,724
It's not healing.

98
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,355
I have the Haitian's power.
I'll... sorry, I'll turn it off.

99
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,940
No, don't, don't.

100
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,485
Let me find you a band-aid.

101
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,240
A band-aid.
I have not used a band-aid in forever.

102
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,327
It's nice to feel pain.

103
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,120
Feel normal.

104
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,831
We're anything but...

105
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,125
Normal.

106
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,463
Mourning Nathan
could not be more ordinary.

107
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,884
That's what we're here to do.

108
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,553
To cut lemons and limes

109
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,306
and remember that...

110
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,184
stupid jerk.

111
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,981
I can't believe he's gone.

112
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,239
I hope he can find heaven,
because he was a terrible navigator.

113
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,908
I mean, for a guy who could fly.

114
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,871
Why are you laughing?
What's so funny?

115
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,126
He gave me endless grief
for dating a guy who could fly.

116
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,672
He said I had daddy issues,
which... I do.

117
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,009
Whatever happened to that kid?
What was his name?

118
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,094
West.

119
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,555
He goes to NYU.
We're Facebook friends.

120
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,059
It's nice telling stories.

121
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,145
Makes it a little easier.

122
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,982
What about about you?
You must have a million of 'em.

123
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,907
I'm gonna take these out there.

124
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,684
Won't get fooled again.

125
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,773


126
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,859


127
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,362


128
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:39,115


129
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,492


130
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,620


131
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,040


132
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,006


133
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,427


134
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:02,805


135
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,063


136
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,024
Oi, restaurant closed.

137
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,901
Everybody get out.

138
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,406
- Iron maiden? Seriously?
- Just a little nickname

139
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,783
that you earned back in the day.
It's a compliment.

140
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,078
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at Nathan's wake?

141
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,831
Claire didn't want me to come.

142
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,542
Do you have the sodium thiopental?

143
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,045
- You want to talk about this?
- There's just...

144
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,672
nothing much to talk about.
I misled her. She's angry.

145
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,675
I don't blame her. Had I followed
my guts, it wouldn't have happened.

146
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,845
So the truth serum's for you? You're
gonna confess everything to Claire?

147
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,847
Not exactly.

148
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,767
Do you remember
the speedster down in Miami?

149
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,812
Carlos, the Cuban missile crisis.
We couldn't figure out how to stop him.

150
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,732
Well, it turns out that
speedsters don't like the cold.

151
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,360
Or quaaludes.
But mostly the cold.

152
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,821
Tightens their muscles,
slows down their heart,

153
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,908
- levels the playing field.
- Meet Edgar.

154
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,374
He's gonna tell me
everything about the carnival.

155
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,875
Needle?

156
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,474
Why did you put Sylar in my trailer?

157
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,351
Because you're going to help him.

158
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,771
- He's not...
- Dead? No. He's amazingly resilient.

159
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,732
Muscles knitting back into flesh.

160
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,694
But even though all the parts
are back into place,

161
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,197
- there's something wrong with him.
- Well, yeah...

162
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,615
No, not that.

163
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,910
He had the chance to end me,
and he couldn't.

164
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,162
He's different.

165
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,290
Not the cold-blooded killer,
not the blank Slate.

166
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,001
- Then what?
- That's what you're gonna find out.

167
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,754
And how we can use that
to our advantage.

168
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,800
- How am I supposed to do that?
- With your charming personality.

169
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,846
I'm not some piece of flesh
you can just toss around.

170
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,682
You didn't seem to mind
the last time he was here.

171
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,060
Don't be petulant. It's ugly.

172
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,854
Everyone has to do their share.

173
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,814
I know the rules.

174
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,691
If you had strength, I'd put you
in construction. If you had the wisdom,

175
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,944
you'd teach the children, but no.

176
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,614
These hands were meant
for a softer trade...

177
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,700
plying out the demons

178
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,452
that haunt men's souls.

179
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,123
Don't disappoint me.

180
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,583
Your skin is so soft.

181
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,668
It's like a baby.

182
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,921
What are you doing?

183
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,508
I'm gonna help figure out
what's wrong with you.

184
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,094
There's nothing wrong with me.

185
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,181
I heard differently.

186
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,475
You couldn't kill Samuel.

187
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,646
Let's find out why.

188
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,278
What are you afraid of?

189
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:15,849
You're lonely.

190
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,352
You're afraid
you're gonna die alone,

191
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,937
but you want love.

192
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,065
You just don't think
that you deserve it.

193
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,447
Do you know
what I do to people like you?

194
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,243
You cut open our heads.

195
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,245
You steal our powers.

196
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,918
You...

197
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,170
see what people want.

198
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,215
Their desires.

199
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,926
Their hopes.

200
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,222
I like it.

201
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,275
What are the tattoos for?

202
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,652
A map.

203
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,280
How to find what you need.

204
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,706
You don't want to help me.

205
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,835
You want to manipulate me
to your agenda to kill Samuel.

206
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,213
I see what you want.

207
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,633
I got your power.

208
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,054
I don't need to kill.
That's just something I like to do.

209
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,891
Not anymore.

210
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,684
You're impotent.

211
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,587
- I tried to find a photo of you, but...
- There are none.

212
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,965
Not of the illegitimate daughter.

213
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,177
Nathan wanted to acknowledge you.

214
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,805
But you convinced him
that it would tarnish his career.

215
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,600
- I know. I've heard the story.
- You're angry.

216
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,312
I'm disappointed.

217
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,232
In you and my dad.

218
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,110
I'm supposed to look up to my elders,
yet I can't believe a word

219
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,154
that comes out of either one
of your mouths.

220
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,031
Well, I can't blame you, Claire.

221
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,076
But you do have
a good head on your shoulders.

222
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,161
You've grown
into a fine young woman.

223
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,206
It's Peter I'm worried about.

224
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,377
- That I actually do believe.
- He's empathetic beyond his years,

225
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,463
but now it's his time to grieve,
and he has absolutely no idea

226
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,215
how to go about it.

227
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,718
He needs a shoulder to lean on.

228
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,262
Yours.

229
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,056
- You're his mother.
- I am.

230
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,268
But, like you, I'm afraid
he will never trust me again.

231
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,603
He'll listen to you, Claire.

232
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,439
He's up on the roof,
listening to that police scanner

233
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,983
and looking for justice.

234
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,319
Please help him.

235
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,914
<i>Go ahead, 55.</i>

236
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,711
<i>We have a 10.3 at 1583 West Hudson.</i>

237
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,464
<i>Repeat. A 10.3 at 1583 West Hudson.</i>

238
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:38,844
<i>I have a suspect with hostages.
Shots fired. No sign of suspect.</i>

239
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,054
<i>All units hold back.
I'm alone in here,</i>

240
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,765
<i>and I don't want to execute.</i>

241
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,023
55 standing by.
In position outside south corridor.

242
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,942
No sign of suspect or hostages.
Waiting...

243
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,498
I need you to keep breathing.
Just breathe.

244
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,836
- What are you doin' here?
- I followed you.

245
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,047
What the hell are you doing?

246
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,965
Claire. I'm helping.

247
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,843
And so are you. Give me your hand.
Put it right on that.

248
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,136
Don't move.

249
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,223
- Claire, this is Wendy.
- Hey.

250
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,975
Don't worry about the blood.
Keep the pressure on.

251
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,852
And don't move.

252
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,147
What'd you say this guy's name was?

253
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,607
Adam Malamut.

254
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,902
He got fired, and then he...

255
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,779
- He just went crazy.
- Just relax.

256
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:41,573
I'll take care of it.

257
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,076
You can't do this.

258
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,370
- It's a little late for that.
- Peter, wait. Why are you doing this?

259
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,164
I need to be more than a band-aid.

260
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:53,460
Wait! I'm the one
who can't get hurt by bullets!

261
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,968
Just take a deep breath, in through
your nose, out through your mouth.

262
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,470
Try to stay calm.

263
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:08,934
Where's Samuel?

264
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,895
What's he planning?

265
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:15,649
- What does he want with Claire?
- I don't know.

266
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,900
I swear.

267
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:27,202
Nice weight.

268
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,497
Good balance.

269
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,709
Sharp as hell.

270
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,795
You make this yourself?

271
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,549
This is fine work.
I'm impressed.

272
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,804
Is this the knife that cut me?

273
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,271
- Let's start again. Where's Samuel?
- Noah, can I talk to you?

274
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,414
I get that you're angry.
He sliced you up like this albacore.

275
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,334
That's toro.
And this is not revenge.

276
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,544
His face looks
an awful lot like revenge.

277
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,422
- I just want some answers.
- I know you do, but I can tell you

278
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,507
that torture doesn't work.

279
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,303
I might have been the Iron Maiden,
but I have changed.

280
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,973
It's not my liberal agenda.
You are losing your target.

281
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,516
- You're emotional.
- No...

282
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,809
Worried about Claire?

283
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,353
What Samuel's done to her,
these medieval tactics

284
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,647
aren't getting you anywhere
with either of them.

285
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,400
Thanks for the sodium thiopental.

286
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,695
Stop using him as a punching bag,
and start talking to him.

287
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:47,324
There's a story
you're not getting here.

288
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,619
Try to be objective,
look at the facts of the situation.

289
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,541
- He doesn't have a compass.
- Why doesn't he have a compass?

290
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,796
Honey tastes sweeter than vinegar.
I promise.

291
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,021
Who the hell are you?

292
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,523
Don't worry about her.

293
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,318
There you go. You just keep that gun
pointed right at me.

294
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,656
- You work here?
- No.

295
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,783
I'm just like you.

296
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,744
Having a bad day.

297
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,163
The worst, in fact.

298
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,418
You see, I just buried my brother.
He was murdered.

299
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,673
And if that's not bad enough,
I had to stage his death.

300
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,509
Like I'm some kind of mobster

301
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,679
or spy, but I'm not.
I'm just some kid from New York City.

302
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,015
And now everyone
expects me to shake hands

303
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,102
and pretend like everything's normal,
but it's not. It's far from that.

304
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,023
Why are you telling me this, man?

305
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,942
Because I understand
where you're at right now.

306
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,446
You want to punish the
people that have hurt you.

307
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,657
I know what that feels like.

308
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,786
I want to torture the guy
that murdered him.

309
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,956
I want to make him scream.
That's all I can think about.

310
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,252
But I'm trying to be hopeful.

311
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,089
I'm trying to be strong,
even though I feel myself slipping.

312
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,969
I promised my brother
that I'd be a hero.

313
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,016
Don't make me a liar.

314
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,352
Not today.

315
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,704
That hurts every time.

316
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,998
Well, it's supposed to.

317
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,292
That's what happens
when you take a bullet.

318
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,086
I thought I'd get to him first.

319
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,425
I did take him down, though.

320
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,261
You saved the day.

321
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,555
It's your turn now.

322
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,435
Come on.
Help me out.

323
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,479
That won't solve anything.

324
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,606
What are you talking about?
Quit messing around.

325
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,651
I'm messing around?
What about you, huh?

326
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,112
Running into danger?
Going off after Sylar?

327
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:33,865
You're not gonna do anything
but get in trouble.

328
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,283
You've got to stop.

329
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,827
- You have to.
- I can't.

330
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,843
I'm not always gonna be here
to be your personal safety net.

331
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,435
Then this is a good ability
to hang on to.

332
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,771
And even if you do, then what?

333
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,274
What kind of life is this?

334
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,193
A human pin cushion?

335
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,778
If I keep moving?

336
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,780
If I...

337
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,368
just act on instinct...
then I don't have time to think.

338
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,704
About Nathan?

339
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,126
Nathan would be so
pissed at you right now.

340
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,796
Lying to yourself, lying to us.

341
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,259
You're not honoring his memory.
You're avoiding it.

342
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,056
If I think about it,

343
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,766
then it's real.

344
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:43,351
If I mourn,

345
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,479
then it's real.

346
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,485
I miss him.

347
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,781
I know. Me too.

348
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,340
You like tea?

349
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,427
Stupid question.
You're British. Here.

350
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,095
Drink up.
You must be freezing.

351
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,890
- Thought the skirt was the good cop.
- The skirt is the good cop.

352
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:25,185
Trust me. This is her idea,
the two of us talking.

353
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,771
If it were up to me,

354
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,190
you'd be down six fingers by now.

355
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,151
I spotted you as I came out
of my daughter's dorm.

356
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,569
I figure your top speed

357
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,448
is somewhere between
600, 700 miles an hour? More?

358
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,619
You could have killed me at any time,
flew past, gutted me...

359
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,162
Blink of an eye.

360
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,415
But you want me alive.

361
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,047
You need me for something.

362
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,632
What is it?

363
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,553
You don't have a compass.

364
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:01,262
You can't get home.

365
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:05,016
What are you doing out here?

366
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:10,939
Exiled.

367
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,150
What did you do?

368
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,945
Found out that Sammy
killed his brother, Joseph.

369
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,281
He convinced the lot
it was my fault.

370
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,449
And they just believed him
on his say so?

371
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,454
What's he planning?

372
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,831
What's he gonna do with them?
Is he recruiting more?

373
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,166
I don't know.

374
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,585
Sammy's all about saber rattling.

375
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,837
He ordered me to kill Danko.

376
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,840
To slice up your gut.

377
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:40,218
Sorry about that.

378
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,516
You don't seem like a hitman to me.

379
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,686
I'm a juggler.

380
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,271
Joseph taught me.

381
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,733
Called it the most
useful skill a man needs.

382
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,484
A juggler?

383
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,904
If you can keep a chainsaw,
knife, and torch in the air,

384
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,449
- you can balance anything.
- But you're all out of balance.

385
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,451
You're exiled. You're lost.

386
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:08,663
Why did you attack me?

387
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,667
Thought if I caught the boogie man
and brought you back to Samuel,

388
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,002
- he'd take me back.
- You'd go back to Samuel

389
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,880
even after he killed your friend
and blamed it on you?

390
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,049
I'm afraid of what he's gonna do
to my friends.

391
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,760
Where he's gonna lead my family.

392
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,179
That makes two of us.

393
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:30,685
We can help each other here.

394
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,481
Enemy of my enemy makes us...

395
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,442
less antagonistic.

396
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,070
We could stop Samuel together.

397
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,700
Before he has a chance
to hurt the people we love the most.

398
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,539
You think that tea's gone cold?

399
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,012
Fresh out of ink.

400
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,474
You destroyed the last batch.

401
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,976
Then make more.

402
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,355
You want a tattoo?

403
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:19,776
You want to find out
where you're supposed to go next?

404
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:22,070
I say you're already here.

405
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,073
I don't think so.

406
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,116
I know why you can't kill.

407
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,119
Lydia told my everything.

408
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,957
I doubt she told you everything.

409
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,588
You think people are lying,
manipulative bastards.

410
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,007
- They're just trying to con you.
- Aren't you?

411
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,345
You're hurting. You need a friend.

412
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,183
- Even though I tried to kill you?
- Because you tried to kill me.

413
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,644
You're not special.
You're like everyone else.

414
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,646
We all need people
who understand us.

415
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,023
Care for us.

416
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,490
Who's she?

417
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,450
Vanessa.

418
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,287
The love of my life.

419
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,917
I'd move mountains for her
if she'd ask me.

420
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:21,546
Haven't seen her around here.

421
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,301
She's out there.

422
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,138
I'm afraid she'll reject me.

423
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,765
For who I am, for what I've done.

424
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,684
That's the way you think too,

425
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,853
that no one could love you.

426
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,063
Stop pretending
like you know who I am.

427
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,024
You have no idea.

428
00:31:42,024 --> 00:31:44,819
I know Hiro Nakamura
said you're going to die alone

429
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,654
and it's haunting you.

430
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,116
I know you.

431
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,745
I am you.

432
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,999
I'm not a good guy.

433
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,502
But I'm not all bad, either.

434
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:05,965
I found love and forgiveness
and acceptance right here,

435
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,425
and you can too.

436
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,262
If that's true,

437
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:14,682
let the tattoo show me,

438
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,809
and I'll stay.

439
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,396
What?

440
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,358
You afraid
I might see something else?

441
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,736
I'm a carny.

442
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,489
I live for games of chance.

443
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,505
- We should have him up here?
- Trust begets trust.

444
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,053
Never had miso soup before.
It's good. Thank you.

445
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,096
No, thank you.

446
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,725
This is invaluable.
Now we know what we're up against.

447
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,145
The problem, of course,
is finding it.

448
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:02,897
- Claire has a compass.
- No.

449
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,608
- I'm just saying.
- Not involving her.

450
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:09,946
You must have a way to get back in.

451
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,116
Lydia.
She has no great love for Samuel.

452
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,617
Good.

453
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,244
Good.

454
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,081
We're gonna isolate Samuel here,
in this backstage area.

455
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,376
- Quick and targeted.
- And nobody else gets hurt, right?

456
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,547
Ideally.

457
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,424
We'll do everything we can,
but this is a raid.

458
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,386
When it's over, I promise you,
we'll take care of everybody.

459
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,971
- We'll find them all homes.
- They've got a home.

460
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:38,641
The carnival's our home.
Samuel's the problem.

461
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,395
If they're wrapped around his finger,
he'll use them to protect himself.

462
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,480
They're lambs.
They know no better.

463
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,525
He's brainwashed them.
Look what he did to you.

464
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,902
He turned you from a
juggler into an assassin.

465
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,698
Even if we stopped Samuel,
what if somebody else takes his place?

466
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,825
You think of this as a family,

467
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,327
but it has a lot more
in common with a cult.

468
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,164
- Your friends need help.
- They need to be left alone.

469
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,459
Left alone out in the
open makes them targets.

470
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,211
I have never seen that end well.

471
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,171
But by separating them,

472
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,549
by reintegrating them
into the real world,

473
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,843
we can make sure that
this doesn't happen again.

474
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,056
What are you doing?

475
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:21,893
It was a mistake to trust you.

476
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,606
I won't let you hurt my family.

477
00:34:27,064 --> 00:34:29,191
Edgar, just slow down.

478
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,152
You're not violent.

479
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,739
You are.

480
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,089
- What's it doing?
- Stop thinking.

481
00:35:34,256 --> 00:35:36,175
Stop trying to force it.
Let it happen.

482
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,185
Well, isn't that interesting.

483
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,439
I guess you were wrong.

484
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:53,526
I don't belong here.

485
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,287
I like it better up
here than down there.

486
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,376
I have a love-hate
relationship with rooftops.

487
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,090
You gonna go back tonight?

488
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,592
We got school tomorrow.

489
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:21,971
Unless you want me to stay,
which I can.

490
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,181
No, I'm cool.

491
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,768
I'm fine.

492
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,939
'cause I've got to trust you.

493
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,943
Can't have you lying to me, not you.

494
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,028
I'll always be honest with you.

495
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,740
I promise.

496
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,584
Strange request...

497
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,170
- Your old boyfriend.
- West.

498
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,965
Could you... call him for me?

499
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,386
Why?

500
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,685
We had everything we needed
to end this, and I blew it.

501
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,396
You're being hard on yourself.

502
00:37:13,355 --> 00:37:15,691
I thought the expression
was "too hard" on yourself.

503
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:17,109
I said it right.

504
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,070
Still think honey tastes sweet?

505
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:22,531
I still think it was
the right move, yes.

506
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,909
Look, I've seen this before
with other cult leaders.

507
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,120
Samuel has done a number on Edgar.

508
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,121
He's got his hooks in all of them.

509
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:31,332
You mean Claire.

510
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,877
Yeah, I mean Claire.

511
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,754
You're still her father.

512
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,508
You're the only one she has left,
and she needs you.

513
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,638
The thing about burned bridges
is they can be rebuilt.

514
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,009
Vanessa.

515
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,912
"In the library studying late.

516
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,371
Gretchen."

517
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:55,416
Great.

518
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:42,672
Hello, cheerleader.
