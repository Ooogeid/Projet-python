<i>Previously on </i>Heroes...

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:05,213
We have a problem...

3
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:07,298
Sylar.
He's gone.

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,011
Nathan.
What are you...

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,473
I think I'm in trouble.

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:19,060
Ever think that we can just live,
out in the open?

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,564
- I'm a friend, Tracy.
- What is this place?

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,025
Home.
Please take this.

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,235
To find your way back here.

10
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,363
I pushed Nathan's memories
into your mind.

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,116
I made your body think
that it was him.

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,951
I've gotta go find Nathan.

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,286
Get my body back.

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,914
Then I kill every single person
even remotely involved.

15
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,625
- Police, freeze.
- What the hell are you doing?

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,378
- I'm crossing that line.
- You idiot, you'll die with me.

17
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,297
- I know.
- Gun.

18
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,677
Where is Charlie?

19
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,387
I'm the only one...

20
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,265
who knows exactly
where your sweet Charlie is.

21
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,641
And you can save her,

22
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:02,062
but only if you do
exactly what I ask you to do.

23
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,649
I made a mistake
about eight weeks ago.

24
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,122
This green earth
has given us so much.

25
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,418
- Feels good to give back what we can.
- Why don't you give back Charlie?

26
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,088
You're an evil man, Butterfly Man.

27
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,674
You must release Charlie
from wherever you're holding her.

28
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,510
I have a way for you
to earn her freedom.

29
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,763
I met a man eight weeks ago.

30
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,848
He had something I wanted.

31
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,936
A film from 1961.
His name was...

32
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,479
Mohinder Suresh.

33
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,064
I know Dr. Suresh.

34
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,109
I don't need to time travel.
I can find him right now.

35
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,777
Dr. Suresh is dead.

36
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,112
You killed Dr. Suresh.

37
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,490
I need you to go back eight weeks.

38
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,368
To a motel room in Texas.

39
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,828
- To save his life?
- No, to save that film,

40
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,330
before he destroyed it.

41
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,124
Once you return, deliver it to me,

42
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,168
your sweet Charlie will be set free.

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,922
I don't know
if I can even time travel anymore.

44
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,467
Then you're gonna have
to try very, very hard.

45
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,762
Your sweet Charlie's life
depends on it.

46
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,225
- We're done here.
- Let's go.

47
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,024
So... India was connected
to Australia?

48
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,111
As well as Madagascar
and most of Southern Africa.

49
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,990
Now together, they made
a supercontinent called Pangaea.

50
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,869
That is until India broke off
and began to migrate north.

51
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,163
Everything keeps changing,
doesn't it?

52
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,414
Indeed.

53
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,499
Come on.

54
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,877
One of the great lessons
of plate tectonics

55
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,463
is that all things
are subject to evolution,

56
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,591
even the earth beneath our feet.

57
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,385
Remember to read chapter six
before class.

58
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,178
Thank you, Dr. Suresh.

59
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,850
Your students adore you, Mohinder.

60
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,478
You were born to teach.

61
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,397
It does feel good to be
back in the classroom again.

62
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,693
Listen, I was thinking of making
lamb biryani for dinner tonight.

63
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,781
You promised you were going
to throw this away.

64
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,240
I am.

65
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,077
It was delivered over a month ago.
I assumed you meant immediately.

66
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,999
Look, it's all of my father's work
from coyote sands in the 60s.

67
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,376
And I didn't mean to lie to you.

68
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,462
It's just hard to let go.

69
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,383
We have a good life, Mohinder.

70
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,385
A good, simple life here.

71
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:41,971
Every time you dig
into your father's research,

72
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,224
you disappear into a rabbit hole.

73
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,684
It only leads you to a dark place.

74
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,690
Perhaps you're right.

75
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,859
You doing okay?

76
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,739
You've been sitting here
staring at that poster for two hours.

77
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,741
You ever wonder
what it would be like.

78
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,244
Running off and joining a carnival?

79
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,664
That'd be a dream come true.

80
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,875
Living with a bunch
of fire-breathing freaks.

81
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,962
Just because they're different
doesn't make them freaks.

82
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,464
Seriously, can you imagine
spending your life

83
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,425
in some trailer
moving from town to town?

84
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,720
And you spend your life where,
in some crappy diner?

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,641
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,310
You're okay?

87
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,729
I'm great.

88
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,772
I'm fantastic.

89
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,573
My God.

90
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,116
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,912
We'll figure out what's going on.

92
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,248
I didn't lose my car keys,
I lost a week of my life.

93
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,334
And you woke up in a carnival.
You sure you wanna remember that?

94
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,338
Senator Petrelli, welcome back.

95
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,382
It's good to be back.

96
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,842
Elizabeth,

97
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,887
do me a favor. Will you get my schedule
out of the front office?

98
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,472
Sure.

99
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,312
That was awfully casual.

100
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,191
I'm telling you.
It makes no sense.

101
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,360
- What's that?
- Even if my lost weekend

102
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,820
was just some crazy bender
under the big top,

103
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,572
a senator...

104
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,992
going off the grid. That ought
to raise one or two alarms.

105
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,535
Don't you think?

106
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,579
Mom say anything
when you talked to her?

107
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,664
She's in Washington,
wants to meet us here.

108
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,625
What are you thinking?

109
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
Talk to me.

110
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,712
I thought I had a handle on this.
But these last few weeks,

111
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,048
it's just been like
I don't know who I am anymore.

112
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,635
Just the last guy I figured
for an identity crisis, Nathan.

113
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,013
- Senator?
- Go ahead.

114
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,265
The good news is...
your day's wide open.

115
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,392
We cleared your calendar
because of your vacation.

116
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,394
Vacation?

117
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,812
Sir, your mother said
you weren't sure

118
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,940
how long you'd be gone, so...

119
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,109
My mother.

120
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,443
Right.

121
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,779
Thank you.

122
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,573
Deja vu.

123
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,618
So sorry, you startled me.
Can I help you?

124
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,869
Rene?

125
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,246
It's okay.

126
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,667
- Did my mother send you?
- Don't come any closer.

127
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,878
I've come here to speak with Peter.

128
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,133
It's okay. Come on.

129
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,387
What are you doing here?

130
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,265
I came to warn you, Peter.

131
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,934
You need to know the truth.

132
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,987

133
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,446
Freeze!

134
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,240
It's me, Tracy Strauss.

135
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,452
And you are breaking and entering
in my dad's apartment because?

136
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,162
I really need to see him.

137
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,790
Yeah, well, that's why
God invented doorbells.

138
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,169
I didn't mean to. I put my hand
on the doorknob and it just...

139
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,464
Do you know where he is?

140
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,549
Something is going wrong
with my power.

141
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,301
I can't control it.

142
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,511
I didn't know where else to go.

143
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,474
Tracy, you're freezing.

144
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,356
So this was my mother's idea
to clean up Nathan's mess.

145
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:47,026
She sends you to wipe out
our memories.

146
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,862
It's what she wants me to do,
but I cannot do it.

147
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,988
Why is that?

148
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,117
Your mother is blinded
by her emotions.

149
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,496
There are some lines
that should never be crossed.

150
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,833
Why do you keep looking at him?

151
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,627
It is not up to me
to reveal this thing.

152
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,005
The decision must be yours.

153
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,468
The answer you seek... is here.

154
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,971
If you go, Peter,

155
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:16,347
go alone.

156
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,271
What you discover may be
more terrible than you can bear.

157
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,711
<i>This is Dr. Chandra Suresh,

<i>Coyote Sands relocation center,</i>

159
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,965
<i>March 5th, 1961.</i>

160
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>I've been trying to alert
the authorities to the potential danger</i>

161
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,098
<i>of gathering so many persons
with abilities in one location.</i>

162
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,976
<i>My concern... centers around</i>

163
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,312
<i>an apparent force...</i>

164
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,022
<i>small, but measurable...</i>

165
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,983
<i>that emanates
from all such individuals.</i>

166
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,779
<i>When two or more of these forces
are proximate,</i>

167
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,657
<i>they amplify, exponentially,</i>

168
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,368

<i>This is entry number 21.</i>

00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,518
<i>of seismic activity
throughout the day.</i>

178
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,437
<i>- He's crowning!
- I fear that this child may indeed...</i>

179
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,316
<i>I'm coming! It's okay!</i>

180
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,235
<i>It's okay.</i>

181
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,365
<i>It's okay, don't worry.
Nurse!</i>

182
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,499
You okay?

183
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,132
That's better.

184
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,553
Why is this happening to me?

185
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,184
I thought it would be a good idea
to make you some tea.

186
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,644
You sure you're okay?

187
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,938
Thanks, Claire.

188
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,269
What happened?

189
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,438
The water started to freeze.

190
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,692
It is happening over and over again,
and I can't stop it.

191
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,737
Just calm down.
Try to take a deep breath.

192
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,543
Can you hear me?

193
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,300
My God.

194
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,515
One hundred and six.

195
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,315
I really thought we were done
with this cloak and dagger stuff.

196
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,903
I still can't figure out why the Haitian
didn't want me in the loop.

197
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,655
Well, does it matter now?

198
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,871
This just gets better and better.

199
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,044
Check it out.

200
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,631
- Are we good?
- Good.

201
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,601
- What do you got?
- It's a body.

202
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,235
What is it?

203
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,241
It's me.

204
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,840
That's not you.
Could be...

205
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,759
A shape-shifter
or something, it's not...

206
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,970

The Haitian wanted you to see this.

207
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,597
This is just weird.

208
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,391
- Don't...
- Sorry.

209
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,107
You're now Nathan Petrelli.

210
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,069
What did you see?

211
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,240
Bits and pieces of things.
A hotel room.

212
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,161
Old news.
He's been dead for weeks.

213
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,621
I know. I know.

214
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,541
- I heard... Parkman.
- Matt?

215
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,752
His voice, he was angry.

216
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,506
Whatever's going on, we won't get
answers from mom or the Haitian.

217
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,258
- We gotta find Matt.
- Where is he?

218
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,052
- L.A.
- Let's go find him.

219
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,303
You sure?

220
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,889
I'm not sure of anything.

221
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,276
I gotta get you in the bath.

222
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,944
Gotta get you in.

223
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,259
No, I heal.
I heal.

224
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,178
It's, like, what I do.

225
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,154
You think you ever really
know somebody?

226
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,323
God, are you hearing yourself?

227
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,079
Okay, you know what I see
when I look at all this?

228
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,500
I see the big brother
that would let me win by a nose

229
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,001
when we would race.

230
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,129
I see the naval officer
who would rearrange his leave.

231
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,882
So that I could have
a good birthday.

232
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:50,926
And the past couple years,

233
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,179
I've seen the guy that's saved
my ass more than a few times.

234
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,223
- I made a lot of mistakes.
- So have I.

235
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,184
Don't beat yourself up over it.

236
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,813
Senator Petrelli.

237
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,523
I found something.

238
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,526
I just hope this isn't
the Matt Parkman you're looking for.

239
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,947
He's in a hospital in Texas
under guard.

240
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,783
They're saying he tried
to commit suicide by cop.

241
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,329
Thank you, Elizabeth.

242
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,541
Multiple gunshot wounds.

243
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,043
He's in critical condition.

244
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,258
You know, Nathan,
I can heal people now.

245
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,762
If we could get in,

246
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,638
I think I can save him.

247
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,192
I'm trying.

248
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:54,406
You can do this, Hiro.
I have faith in you.

249
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,555
Mira.

250
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,141
I've made a remarkable discovery.

251
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,478
There's a power,
an actual quantifiable force...

252
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,147
You promised me, Mohinder.

253
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,815
Mira, this is important.

254
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,442
Using my father's equations,
I built a device,

255
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,569
a sort of compass
that I can use to...

256
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,154
Will you listen to yourself?

257
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,866
You're possessed again
by these voices in your head.

258
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,408
You don't understand.

259
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,452
By following this compass...

260
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,665
If the child on that film
is still alive,

261
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,209
and surrounds himself with
a large enough number of specials,

262
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,253
- he can become the most pow...
- Stop.

263
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,630
I'm begging you, Mohinder.

264
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:36,883
Please think very carefully
about what you have,

265
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,261
about what you have to lose.

266
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,846
I love you.

267
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,265
But if you disappear again,

268
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,267
I will not wait for you to return.

269
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,364
- Can you help him?
- I can try.

270
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,720
You're okay. You're okay.
It's me, Peter.

271
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,056
- What happened?
- You're okay.

272
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,394
Good things do come
to those who wait.

273
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,564
- Son of a bitch, get out of my head.
- I brought you back.

274
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,149
No, you don't understand.
This is exactly what he wants.

275
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:19,486
- What's he talking about?
- Bring him closer, Parkman.

276
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,238
One touch is all I need.

277
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,573
Then you can have
your miserable life back.

278
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,492
I can have my body back.

279
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,535
Shut up!

280
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,328
You guys, run.

281
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,205
Get away from me
before he comes back.

282
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,040
Before who comes back?


283
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,209
- Sylar's dead.
- No, he's in my head.

284
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,169
He's trying to con...
control my mind.

285
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,214
I know this sounds crazy,
but if he controls me,

286
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,550
if he gets my power,
he's gonna jump back into his body.

287
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,510
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Matt.

288
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,762
What do you mean, "his body"?

289
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,306
This should be good.

290
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,516
Nathan, you're...
you're dead.

291
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,229
Sylar murdered you,
he cut your throat.

292
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,399
I used my power to purge
his mind from his body

293
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,026
and put your thoughts in.

294
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,903
You're weakening, Parkman.

295
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,779
I'm not gonna let you do this.

296
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,532
I don't have time for
all the five stages of grief.

297
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,910
Let's go right from denial
to acceptance.

298
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,174
Oh, my...
Oh, my God, you son of a bitch.

299
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,342
It's true.

300
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,429
I'm so sorry.

301
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,307
- Stay back.
- You're saying I'm Sylar?

302
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,310
Yes.
But I can make it all right.

303
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,062
All you need to do is take my hand.

304
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,116
All you need to do is take my hand.

305
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,536
- Don't. Don't take his hand.
- It all makes sense, Pete.

306
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,038
- Get away from him.
- Stop!

307
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,456
It all adds up.

308
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,833
- These new powers aren't mine.
- Stop.

309
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,460
They're sylar's.

310
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,379
I don't exist.

311
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,716
Doesn't make sense.
I don't buy that.

312
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,968
Take my hand.

313
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,385
He's controlling you!

314
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,929
Take my hand now.

315
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:10,263
Do it.

316
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:12,015
I'll kill you first.

317
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,769
It's okay, Pete.
Matt's right.

318
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,354
It's time to end it.

319
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,982
One touch, Nathan.
And it's over.

320
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,734
No, don't touch him.
You touch him, he's got my power.

321
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,736
His mind'll go back into his body.

322
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,029
Stop. Stop!

323
00:23:26,821 --> 00:23:28,865
You!
Back away from the prisoner.

324
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:30,784
Take my hand, do it now.

325
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,577
- I said, get away.
- Back away!

326
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,626
Where is he?

327
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,461
Nathan, where is he?

328
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,296
Pete, come here.

329
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,549
We gotta get out of here.

330
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,301
No! Nathan!

331
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,637
Nathan, is he in you?

332
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,472
You son of a bitch, is he in you?

333
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,935
They're in here!

334
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,545
Can I help you with something?

335
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,547
I hope so.

336
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,675
I'm looking for someone
who may or may not even exist.

337
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,094
If he does, his name would be
Samuel Sullivan.

338
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,729
I'm Joseph Sullivan, proprietor.

339
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,273
The man you are looking for
is my brother.

340
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:45,108
Come with me.

341
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,944
If my evidence is correct,

342
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,321
your brother may be capable
of magnifying his powers.

343
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,615
Simply by being near others
with abilities.

344
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,534
Powers, abilities.

345
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,786
I'd like to help you, doctor.

346
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,789
But I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're talking about.

347
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,460
I thought you were going
to build a fire.

348
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,297
Figured... Edgar and Damian
could handle that.

349
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,678
I'm Samuel.

350
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,889
Samuel Sullivan?

351
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,600
Dr. Suresh here
has a few questions for me.

352
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,646
He's writing a book on
the life of traveling carnies.

353
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,940
People wanna read a thing like that?

354
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,529
It's a colorful and exotic world.

355
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,324
Why don't you join the others
at the fire pit.

356
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,368
I'm sure they could use your help.

357
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,495
Yeah, of course.

358
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,170
I've just traveled 8,000 miles
to speak with your brother.

359
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,215
If you're gonna try and stop me,
you'd better have a damn good reason.

360
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:51,966
Please.

361
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,677
Come inside.

362
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,664
When you came, I was already dead.

363
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,832
You don't remember
seeing anyone else in that room.

364
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,627
You took me to the morgue.
And that's all you remember.

365
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,088
And do me a favor.
Take off all your clothes.

366
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,548
- Let me give you my clothes.
- Yeah, good idea.

367
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:34,467
Hurry up, let's go.
Come on.

368
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,728
Why are we here, Nathan?

369
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,897
I shouldn't be around people
right now.

370
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:54,070
Something happened to me out there.

371
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:55,947
What?

372
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,992
I nearly put you through a wall
with a flick of my hand.

373
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,413
If Sylar gets into my head,

374
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,790
the way he got into Parkman's...

375
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,627
I can't risk that with you.

376
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,796
There's a road around here
somewhere.

377
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,049
You'll find your way home.

378
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,890
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

379
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,768
Go ahead.
I'll be right behind you.

380
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,197
That film leaves little doubt.

381
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:42,077
- Your brother's destruction power...
- I'm aware of what he's capable of.

382
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,329
But Samuel himself has no idea.

383
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,749
And it's been my life's work
to keep it that way,

384
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,670
to keep him in the dark about
the true nature of his power.

385
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,304
Soon after our release from
internment at Coyote Sands,

386
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,849
my mother told me
the truth about Samuel.

387
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,310
You saw it on film.

388
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,145
My mother lived it.

389
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,690
She knew exactly how dangerous
he could become.

390
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,610
I've kept our community
small in number

391
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,862
to ensure Samuel's power
remains subdued.

392
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,823
I love my brother.

393
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,245
But he's become a man
of great ambition.

394
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,582
Somewhere inside, he can taste it,

395
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,628
the immense potential
he was born with.

396
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,505
Under the right circumstances,

397
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,508
your brother's powers
could increase a thousand-fold.

398
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,302
- The information on that film...
- Burn the film!

399
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,638
Go back to India.

400
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,560
We must do everything possible
to keep this genie in a bottle.

401
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,270
How do I know I can trust you?

402
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,193
I have watched over him
for 40 years,

403
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,280
and everything's been just fine.

404
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:04,242
You're no longer welcome here.

405
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,368
Mira, it's me.

406
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,747
You were right.

407
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,250
This was all a mistake.

408
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,461
I should have left that film
in the trash.

409
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,713
I should have left
that box unopened.

410
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,634
I miss you.

411
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,763
I'll be on the next plane home.

412
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,092
Be careful, Dr. Suresh.

413
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,678
Evil butterfly man
will be coming for you.

414
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,018
You know, you have not lost control
of your abilities in over an hour.

415
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,730
Whatever's happening with you,

416
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,815
I don't think it's physical.

417
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,567
It's psychological.

418
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,443
Great.

419
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,362
I panic attack with powers.

420
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,574
When did it start?

421
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:51,909
Just this morning.

422
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,997
I was sitting in this diner
thinking about...

423
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,498
About what?

424
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,170
About changing everything.

425
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,756
My entire life.

426
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,886
I've been so lost, Claire.

427
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,974
I tried so hard, to put
my old life back together,

428
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,309
but once I did,

429
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,145
nothing fit anymore.

430
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,734
Then I met this...

431
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,820
strange man named Samuel.

432
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,365
He lives with a group of people...

433
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,159
Who all have abilities.

434
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,994
Yeah, I met him too.

435
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,830
He invited me to join them,

436
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,084
to move to this place where...
we're all accepted.

437
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,631
I think I might do it.

438
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,384
Give up everything.

439
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,637
Just start a new life.

440
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,097
Maybe you should.

441
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,559
Maybe that's what your body
is telling you it wants.

442
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,564
It's great to have someone
to talk to about all this.

443
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:07,652
It's hard to find a friend
out there in the normal world.

444
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,363
Someone you can trust.

445
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,492
Yeah.
I had something like that,

446
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,578
but I'm pretty sure that's over.

447
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,499
Oh, it just sounded
so good on paper.

448
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,167
College.

449
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,046
Now I'm starting to wonder if...

450
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,464
It's hard out there,

451
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,008
for girls like us.

452
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,055
Ladies.

453
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,604
How was your day?

454
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,021
Oh, you know.

455
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,899
Same old same old.

456
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,125
I need to know what was
on that film.

457
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,961
It's about my ability, isn't it?

458
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,839
A way for me to increase my power

459
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:11,465
a thousand-fold.

460
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,134
Tell me!

461
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,428
Your brother warned me about you.

462
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,392
After all these years,
he's been betraying me?

463
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:27,106
Holding me back
so that he could keep playing the king.

464
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,155
This is your last chance.

465
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,282
Tell me what's on that film.

466
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,159
Never.

467
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,953
I will learn the truth.

468
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:43,790
And I will do everything I can
to stop you.

469
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,726
I'm sorry.

470
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,084
Hello, old friend.

471
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,964
I am not the Hiro Nakamura you know.

472
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:37,134
- I have come 8 weeks from the future.
- To save my life?

473
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,345
To save this film.

474
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,389
In the future I come from,

475
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,099
you were dead.

476
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,851
I was murdered right here
in this room.

477
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,813
How did you know I would need
that Kevlar vest?

478
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,650
My time travel
is not so good lately.

479
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,819
The first time I tried,
I arrived ten minutes from now.

480
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,071
Wasn't pretty.

481
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:01,408
If I hadn't gone right to Samuel,

482
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:04,286
he would have never known
the secrets of his power.

483
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,081
My investigation has corrupted him.
We have to stop him, Hiro.

484
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,416
And we will.

485
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,253
But first, you have to disappear

486
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,756
for eight more weeks
until he releases Charlie.

487
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,635
Samuel is holding captive
the woman I love

488
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,345
until I deliver this film.

489
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,723
This man is extremely dangerous.
I can't just go away for eight weeks

490
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,433
while he consolidates his power.

491
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,393
Please.

492
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,438
If he knew I spared your life,
he will never release Charlie.

493
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,315
I understand your concern,

494
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,276
and I appreciate
all that you've done.

495
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,945
But our primary focus
must be stopping Samuel.

496
00:36:38,195 --> 00:36:39,655
I won't risk Charlie's life.

497
00:36:39,905 --> 00:36:42,366
Well then, we'll have
to agree to disagree, Hiro.

498
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:48,622
If you will not disappear
until Charlie is safe,

499
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,666
then I will have
to make you disappear.

500
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,209
What do you mean?

501
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,048
Sorry.

502
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:03,637
He used to say, "Put your finger
in a bucket of water, pull it out,

503
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,723
"and see how fast
that hole fills up."

504
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,602
Thanks a lot.

505
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,740
Your have your film.
Now I want Charlie.

506
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,992
Soon.

507
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,330
Sorry your friend had to die.

508
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,141
Mr. Ahmadi,

509
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:51,185
time for your medication.

510
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,187
My name is Mohinder Suresh.

511
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,942
My name is Mohinder...

512
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,293
Janice, honey, it's me.

513
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,379
This is tough
to explain into a machine.

514
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,255
Remember,
there was a guy inside my head

515
00:38:20,422 --> 00:38:23,092
taking control of my mind,
a monster named Sylar?

516
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,344
Well, I just want to let you know

517
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,180
the craziness over the last few weeks
is finally over.

518
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,267
And... Sylar's gone.

519
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,061
He's gone back into his own body.

520
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:37,439
I think he got what he wanted.

521
00:39:01,463 --> 00:39:03,841
I'm not really sure
what I'm doing here.

522
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,678
Not even sure I hope to find a...

523
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,351
I just know that I can't go on
living my old life anymore.

524
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:18,814
I'm glad you called, Tracy.

525
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,482
I'd hoped you would.

526
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,278
I felt a real connection between us.

527
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,200
There's something
I'm gonna ask of you.

528
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,288
A way for you to use your gifts

529
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,708
to help make this
a better world for all people

530
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,001
of abilities.

531
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:45,007
Together, we can accomplish
great things.

532
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,053
You have unique talents, Tracy.

533
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,405
Nathan, this...

534
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,492
This idea, this thought
that you're...

535
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,743
Sylar.

536
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:16,998
Change the voice, chance the face,
still him underneath.

537
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,461
These hands have killed
dozens of people, Pete.

538
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,672
Friends of ours.

539
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,175
Whoever Nathan Petrelli was,
he's gone now.

540
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,637
Just some random thoughts
in a mass murderer's head.

541
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,765
Okay, look, assuming
that I believe any of that.

542
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:38,852
What would it matter?

543
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,146
I mean, didn't Matt say
that he forced Sylar out?

544
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,315
You really think Matt could purge

545
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,693
every sick thought from that head?

546
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,573
To the rest of the world,
I'm Nathan Petrelli, Pete.

547
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,284
But every time you look at me,

548
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,705
the way you're looking at me
right now,

549
00:40:58,872 --> 00:41:00,541
you're gonna see Sylar.

550
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,378
Tell me I'm wrong.

551
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,384
Tell me I'm wrong, Pete.

552
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,227
