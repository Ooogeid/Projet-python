1
00:00:00,394 --> 00:00:01,528
Previously on Heroes

2
00:00:02,425 --> 00:00:04,626
I think Sylar's
beginning to emerge again.

3
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:05,794
I'm part of you Matt.

4
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,429
Whatever you did
to me I held on.

5
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:09,230
Now I'm inside your head.

6
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:11,499
I'm in control
here not the power.

7
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,802
I'm not you. You
son of a bitch!

8
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:15,770
Keppler! The guy's
name is keppler.

9
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:17,138
Lives in long beach.

10
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:19,307
You're supposed to be the
man with the plan, remember?

11
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,042
I'm not sure I'm
that guy anymore.

12
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:22,176
Why's that?

13
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:23,812
Because I've lost
my family, Angela.

14
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,380
Maybe changing your
name back to Bennet

15
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:27,048
Wasn't such a great
idea after all.

16
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,217
But they say college is
for reinventing yourself.

17
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:31,753
Have you ever heard of
the jump push fall test?

18
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:32,887
All we need is a dummy

19
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,723
The approximate size
and weight of Annie.

20
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,658
So where do we get our
hands on a dead body?

21
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,793
I guess she did
kill herself.

22
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,834
I met an empath.

23
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,235
You talk to him?

24
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:51,806
Didn't really
get a chance.

25
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:57,579
Claire?

26
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:01,850
Claire, it's
Gretchen. Open up.

27
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:06,588
Claire, we need to talk!

28
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:57,071
No darling, this
batch isn't for you.

29
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:58,406
I think

30
00:01:58,474 --> 00:02:01,543
I think I found someone
to fill Joseph's shoes.

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,778
I'm going out.

32
00:02:05,714 --> 00:02:06,815
Wearing that?

33
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:09,651
I draw unwanted
attention being myself.

34
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:13,588
Haven't worn a suit
since I was a boy.

35
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:17,024
My parents forced
us to be prim

36
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:21,963
Binding us to a life
of combed hair and

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,466
Shined shoes.

38
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:27,168
And then I discovered

39
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:30,805
I could control the
very earth under my feet

40
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:34,175
And I was liberated.

41
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:36,043
I could be filthy.

42
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:41,749
Tie still feels like a
damn noose around my neck.

43
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:43,985
Come here.

44
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:49,591
You don't have to leave.

45
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:52,494
You know I could I could
do whatever you want.

46
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,629
No. Thank you.

47
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:56,698
It's my responsibility.

48
00:02:56,765 --> 00:03:01,703
Ever since Joseph died
I feel like the lights

49
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,906
Don't shine as
bright in here.

50
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:07,909
Feel like I'm missing
a part of myself.

51
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:09,744
He was my compass.

52
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:11,913
I'm afraid of where
we're going without it.

53
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,181
- I need it back. 
- I'm sorry for your loss.

54
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:17,385
But you know you cannot
replace your brother.

55
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:19,654
No. You don't understand.

56
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:24,526
We have a need and
I have a candidate.

57
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,195
I just want to see

58
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:31,432
If he deserves a
place at our table.

59
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,254
Do you think that
you might go home

60
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,389
While you're out there?

61
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:58,426
No. I left that life.

62
00:03:58,493 --> 00:04:01,495
I don't ever want
to go back again.

63
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:09,904
- How do I look? 
- Like everybody else.

64
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:41,636
Hey. Are you
peter petrelli

65
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:44,038
The paramedic who saved
that cop's life last week?

66
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:46,074
- Yeah. 
- That was awesome man.

67
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:47,642
- Here. 
- Thanks. What's this?

68
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,643
You been served.

69
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:49,911
Guess you need
to be more careful

70
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,446
When you're saving
people£¬hero.

71
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:44,391
You expecting
somebody, Parkman?

72
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,627
Suspect's house
is over there.

73
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:48,129
How damn long does it take
a judge to issue a warrant?

74
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,266
We are gonna get
this guy, okay?

75
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:54,702
We're gonna find the stash
both get commendations.

76
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,104
It's gonna be
a great day.

77
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,372
Just relax.

78
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,674
Yeah.

79
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,376
It's not even
about that. I...

80
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,382
My 30-day sobriety chip.

81
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:13,687
I slipped. I used.

82
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:15,456
I'm still being haunted

83
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:17,458
By the ghost of all the
crappy things I've done past

84
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:19,794
And it got the
better of me.

85
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:23,664
A.d.a.

86
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,070
Yeah.

87
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,706
I wish I was a ghost.

88
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:35,676
It would be so much
better than this hell

89
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:38,279
Being stuck in your
miserable life...ehh!

90
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:40,381
I mean have you seen
yourself eat a burrito?

91
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,083
Why don't you just get
the hell out of here?

92
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:44,518
Well there's
only one way out.

93
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:46,720
Which is you need to figure
out how to undo what you did.

94
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,924
Give me back my body
and I will be happy

95
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:52,226
To leave you stewing
in your mediocrity.

96
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:54,662
You're a killer.
i'm a cop.

97
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,430
If I have to keep you
trapped inside this prison

98
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:59,033
For the rest of my life

99
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:01,635
So be it.

100
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:04,038
You really think you're
up to the challenge?

101
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:07,241
You got no power. None.

102
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:10,945
You're annoying as hell
yes but ultimately harmless.

103
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:12,513
I can just ignore you
until you fade away

104
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,781
Like a bad memory.

105
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,917
We'll see.

106
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:23,390
- We got the warrant.
- Good.

107
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,926
I want you on this job.

108
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:26,460
But you're not
going into that house

109
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:27,995
Until I know that
you'll keep it together.

110
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:30,798
I'm fine. Look.

111
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:38,539
It's the first day of
the rest of my life right?

112
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,242
So I put away my ghosts
and put my game face on.

113
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,945
- Let's go.
- All right.

114
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,249
Police open up! Open up!

115
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,640
I'll check upstairs.

116
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:18,512
Parkman.

117
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,181
I'm not interrupting
you, am I?

118
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:25,519
I'm everywhere.

119
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:40,134
Hey. Where you going?
He's in the closet.

120
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:41,535
Yeah.

121
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:43,670
Your drug dealer
is in that closet.

122
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:46,740
What kind of cop
doesn't check a closet?

123
00:09:49,444 --> 00:09:50,711
And he has a gun.

124
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:58,419
You're done. Drop it.

125
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,420
Now!

126
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,992
Okay!

127
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:08,930
You're welcome.

128
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:21,806
Gretchen?

129
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,541
I told you that...

130
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:25,911
Dad. What are
you doing here?

131
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:29,934
"Hey dad. Nice
to see you.

132
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:33,070
Thanks for bringing the
house-warming presents."

133
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:35,506
Hey dad. nice to see you.

134
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:37,642
Thanks for bringing the
housewarming presents.

135
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:43,881
You okay? Yeah. I'm fine.

136
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:45,611
Your mother told me

137
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,908
About your roommate
Annie committing suicide.

138
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:50,898
I should have
called you. I know.

139
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:53,700
- I didn't call because... 
- No. No no no I...

140
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,101
I don't want to
put you on the spot.

141
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,103
I just wanna make
sure you're all right.

142
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,672
I'm dealing with
it. I'm fine.

143
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,308
I know that fine. It's uh

144
00:11:02,376 --> 00:11:03,843
It's not very convincing.

145
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:06,178
You want to try again?

146
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,081
It's not just the
whole Annie thing, it's

147
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,751
It's just an
adjustment college.

148
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:13,520
I'm adjusting.

149
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:17,490
I miss my family.
I miss you.

150
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:21,227
Mom. Even Lyle.

151
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,634
What do you say
we grab some lunch?

152
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:30,169
Spend a little time talk.

153
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:32,305
- If you're not busy.
- No.

154
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,307
Sounds like a plan.

155
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:37,777
- Let me just go get pretty.
- You look beautiful.

156
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:43,215
I'll be just a minute.

157
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,959
So this is your plan?

158
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,194
You're just
gonna avoid me?

159
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:57,564
I'm not.

160
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:00,399
Wow. You're even gonna avoid
admitting you're avoiding me.

161
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:02,134
No no no I'm not.

162
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,804
I was just busy
and-and studying and

163
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:07,039
Organic chem is a bitch.

164
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:09,342
How's uh art history?

165
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:13,379
So we're really not
gonna talk about this?

166
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:14,881
Look, whatever it is

167
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:17,617
You thought you saw the
other night,you didn't see.

168
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:19,586
I didn't see you hurl
yourself out a window

169
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:21,521
And then snap your
bones back into place?

170
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:22,689
No!

171
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,257
No!

172
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:27,293
I mean yes I was-I
was on the ground

173
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:29,295
And I was testing your
theory you know jump push fall

174
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:31,464
And I think Annie
did commit suicide

175
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:33,800
Which is awful
and--and tragic.

176
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,702
You don't have
to lie to me.

177
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:36,936
Look you were
wrong about Annie

178
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:38,237
Just like you're
wrong about me.

179
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:40,807
Seriously what are
you a vampire an alien?

180
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,242
Some kind of freakish
government experiment?

181
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,779
All right. I just
have to change.

182
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:53,052
Hi Mr. bennet.

183
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,455
Who's your friend?

184
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:58,290
Oh that's uh Gretchen.

185
00:12:58,358 --> 00:12:59,926
Nice to meet you.

186
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,463
Would you like to
join us for lunch?

187
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:07,133
Oh. That's nice.

188
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,969
You don't-you don't
have to do that.

189
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,370
It would be my pleasure.

190
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,139
I'm pretty sure
that Gretchen

191
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,441
Has an art history
assignment due tomorrow.

192
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:16,576
Isn't that
right Gretchen?

193
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:19,378
Yeah but I finished
my paper already.

194
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:21,447
- And I'm starving.
- Great.

195
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:23,149
Great.

196
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:24,817
Great.

197
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,401
Hey. We can do this the
easy way or the hard way.

198
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:44,470
So why don't you just tell
us where you hid the drugs?

199
00:13:44,538 --> 00:13:46,405
- Why don't you ask my
lawyer? - Did he just--

200
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:48,708
I can't believe people
actually say that.

201
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:49,554
You can call
your lawyer after

202
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:50,309
We're done
searching that house

203
00:13:50,377 --> 00:13:53,880
- No you can't do that man.
- We have a warrant.

204
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,915
You attempted to
murder an officer--me.

205
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:58,651
So we are gonna stay
here as long as it takes.

206
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,820
Or you could just
grow a pair and

207
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:02,822
End this
idiotic sobriety.

208
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,991
I'm gonna ask
you one more time

209
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:08,227
Stop asking. Use
your abilities.

210
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:13,390
I'm gonna go check
in the bathroom.

211
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:21,120
Not as easy to ignore
me as you thought.

212
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:23,122
It's because
I ooze charm.

213
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,363
- Looking in the wrong place.
- Stop helping.

214
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,365
Hey if I'm gonna
be stuck in here

215
00:14:32,432 --> 00:14:33,899
I might as well
make the most of it.

216
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,468
I always thought I'd
be an excellent cop.

217
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:39,438
Fine. Ignore me.

218
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:44,243
Something doesn't
fit in this picture.

219
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:58,291
- Stuffed rabbit?
- A stuffed rabbit!

220
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:05,631
This house isn't
used for drugs.

221
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:08,190
It's used for
something worse

222
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:11,036
A lot worse.

223
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,408
Hi. I need a file.

224
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:18,000
Um Hooper William.
h-o-o-p-e-r.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,145
Look it'll just
take a second.

226
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:24,550
It's my accident report. if
you could just type it in.

227
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:26,151
Seriously?

228
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:29,988
I get it.

229
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:32,057
You're just uh
doing your job.

230
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,226
I'm doing my job.

231
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:37,930
Save a guy's life
and he sues me for it.

232
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:43,068
I guess no good deed
goes unpunished right?

233
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:48,273
I'm talking to myself.

234
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,388
Who are you listening to?

235
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:06,822
Your headphones.

236
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:12,645
It's cool. I like
that band too.

237
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:29,196
You okay?

238
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:36,798
He's in physical
therapy right now.

239
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,667
Thank you.

240
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:47,279
'scuse me.
William Hooper?

241
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:52,824
Yes? That's me.

242
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:02,949
I think there's
been a mistake.

243
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:04,597
I've never
met you before.

244
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:06,331
There's no mistake.
Mr. petrelli.

245
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,100
You pulled me
from the 424 bus

246
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:10,135
After it crashed at
lexington and 53rd.

247
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,525
I remember you
were fast so fast

248
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:16,867
So negligent you
dislocated my arm.

249
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,868
Well I remember everybody
that was on that bus.

250
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:20,436
You weren't on it.

251
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:23,505
What is this a scam? You
recognize my family name?

252
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,174
You want money?

253
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,009
I'm not scamming you.
Don't need your cash.

254
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:30,179
- Then what? 
- Empathy.

255
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,582
I'm in town because
of my brother Joseph.

256
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,152
He died and

257
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,054
There's a lot of loose
ends to take care of

258
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,755
When someone passes.

259
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:41,891
I'm all alone now.

260
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,026
I have to take care
of our entire family.

261
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,595
It's my responsibility.
It's my burden.

262
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:49,298
But I can't do that
on account of you.

263
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,933
Doctor says i won't
work for months.

264
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:53,035
If I don't work I
don't feed my family.

265
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,303
Are you the kinda man

266
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:55,671
That's going to allow
my family to starve?

267
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,606
You know what?
this was a mistake.

268
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,441
I'm gonna let the lawyers
handle it--good day.

269
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:02,611
Working two three
shifts at a time.

270
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,248
My lawyer already
checked on you.

271
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:11,854
I know what it's like to feel
the pressure of obligation.

272
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:14,456
But isn't it possible
i was on that bus

273
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:17,593
And you've become so
spread thin that you

274
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,728
Forgot?

275
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:23,332
No. It's not.

276
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,070
You're not
going blind Emma.

277
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:30,139
There's nothing
wrong with your eyes.

278
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:34,281
Then... what's
happening to me?

279
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:38,486
When you saw the lights
did other people see them?

280
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:42,058
Yes. Of course--
I just signed,

281
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:46,362
"Hey, do you see an Aurora Borelis
ink blot coming from that coffee mug?"

282
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,558
Did you ever hear
of synesthesia?

283
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:54,009
Corossing
senses together.

284
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,271
Yeah. Yeah.

285
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:57,079
People say that
they can smell words

286
00:18:57,105 --> 00:18:59,114
Or hear numbers.

287
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,478
And, I'm what...?
Seeing sound as color?

288
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:07,201
It's possible. It's very
common in deaf cases.

289
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:11,080
Maybe your body's trying
to tell you something.

290
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,154
Couldn't it just
send an e-mail?

291
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:18,087
Emma. Emma.
This is serious.

292
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:21,324
You know you are
completely disengaged.

293
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:24,961
You file records when you
could be treating patients.

294
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:29,354
I like my job.
It's... quiet.

295
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:32,157
Is that why you
wear the headphones?

296
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:36,650
I wear the headphones because
the minute I take them off,

297
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:39,482
Someone's asking for the
time, or my phone number,

298
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:41,593
or directions to
the Statue of Liberty

299
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,849
I don't want to
see their faces.

300
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,850
That look.

301
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,522
Insensitive eyebrows

302
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:50,697
Oh, she's deaf.

303
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:03,799
Okay. We've
got saag paneer.

304
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,601
Baingan bharta.

305
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,236
Aloo gobi.

306
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:09,105
- Tikka masala. 
- Seriously?

307
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:10,772
It just looks
like green brown

308
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,241
Yellow and orange.

309
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:14,477
Don't make the stink
face. you're gonna love it.

310
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:18,047
Except he
forgot the raita.

311
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:20,149
I don't want to
offend your dad

312
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,584
But what if i
don't like yellow?

313
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:24,153
- Just do the napkin trick. 
- Sir?

314
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:28,350
Excuse me we also had an
order of raita for the table.

315
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,394
Clever. You're very
good at hiding things.

316
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,464
So gretchen
what's your major?

317
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,634
Physiology and
biomechanics.

318
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:41,003
I thought it
was art history.

319
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:42,604
I'm gonna change.

320
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,873
I'm obsessed with the
abilities of the human body.

321
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:48,777
The other day
I saw this girl

322
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:50,546
On youtube.

323
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:51,914
She was born
with this gene

324
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:54,316
That doesn't let her feel
any pain like nothing.

325
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,618
And her parents are freaked
that she could cut her hand

326
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,154
Or burn herself
and not even know.

327
00:20:58,221 --> 00:20:59,855
So she's totally
cloistered.

328
00:20:59,923 --> 00:21:02,324
Pretty cool huh?

329
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:04,626
It's unusual to
say the least.

330
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:07,163
So what do you
think, Claire?

331
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,298
Wanna audit some of
these classes with me?

332
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:11,767
What do you
think, Claire?

333
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,636
Why would I be
interested in that?

334
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:17,473
Because it's awesome
we could do it together

335
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,974
And you're
still undeclared.

336
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:22,445
Well I can be undeclared
till, uh, third year.

337
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:25,081
Yeah, but that's just like
denying the inevitable.

338
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:27,049
How long can
you do that for?

339
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:29,051
You know this yellow
is really good.

340
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,719
Yummy yellow.

341
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:33,222
So Mr. Bennet
what do you do?

342
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,224
Retired.

343
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:39,228
But I'm always finding new
reasons to go back to work.

344
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,941
Whose do you
think this is?

345
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:54,143
I mean it's not
his daughter.

346
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:56,512
Would you let
your kid play here?

347
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,046
Yeah, me neither.

348
00:21:58,115 --> 00:21:59,381
Here I think these keys
go up to the garage.

349
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:01,016
- I'm gonna go check it out. 
- Okay cool.

350
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:04,587
I'll keep an eye on him.

351
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:07,055
Okay, tell me what the
hell you think you know.

352
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:08,890
Come on, whose
stuffed animal is that?

353
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,860
Is there a kid
here? Tell me.

354
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,532
Right. you're
ignoring me now?

355
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,134
Doesn't feel
very good does it?

356
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:20,236
Somebody has
something you want

357
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:22,704
And they just won't
give it to you.

358
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:26,208
I never intended
for this to happen.

359
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:27,843
Unless you did,
Mr. Parkman.

360
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,445
What the hell's
that supposed to me?

361
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:31,347
Your life's a mess, Matt.

362
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:33,682
I'm stuck inside your
mind with your powers

363
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,651
And all your anxieties.

364
00:22:35,718 --> 00:22:38,287
It's sad.

365
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:40,222
You're so desperate for
anyone to love you...

366
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,225
I mean Janice
or your kid.

367
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:45,727
And they never will love
you. And you wanna know why?

368
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:47,229
- Shut up!
- I didn't say anything, man!

369
00:22:47,297 --> 00:22:49,998
Because you come in at a
zero on the confidence scale.

370
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:51,933
You're always
second-guessing yourself.

371
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,502
Listen, I'm innocent!

372
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,604
Sweating every decision
you make--literally.

373
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:58,207
- I swear!
- You know what I think?

374
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:03,646
I think you wanted me
in here to help you.

375
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:06,649
You wanted me to pick your
sorry ass up out of the mud

376
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:09,851
And help make you a man.

377
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,761
Very good, detective.

378
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:22,565
You found it
all on your own.

379
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:24,766
I'm almost impressed.

380
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:26,968
Now what are you
gonna do, Matt?

381
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:33,442
Are you man
enough to save her?

382
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:49,443
You were right,
Mr. Bennet.

383
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,978
This was outstanding.
Thank you.

384
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,714
You're welcome.

385
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,749
That mango lassi just
goes right through you.

386
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:58,285
Excuse me.

387
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,288
-Okay, look.. 
- I know things are difficult,

388
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,957
But I can't believe you
told her about your ability.

389
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:06,260
I didn't tell her!
She just found out.

390
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:09,763
I gotta contact the Haitian.
erase Gretchen's memory.

391
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,265
Clean this mess up.

392
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:14,801
Hey! Gretchen is not the
enemy. She's just a girl.

393
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:16,603
And she's the only
friend that I've made.

394
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:18,338
I appreciate your concern

395
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,374
But I don't need you
fighting my battles for me.

396
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:21,508
I can handle this.

397
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:24,177
Really? What's
your plan, Claire?

398
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:29,949
Stop. You make
that phone call

399
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:32,118
And I swear I
will banish you.

400
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:35,255
I will not call.
I will not email.

401
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:37,758
This is my mess and
I'm gonna clean it up.

402
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:43,096
So. What's for dessert?

403
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:49,035
- Where is she?
- What are you talking about?

404
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:50,837
This is what
I'm talking about

405
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:52,606
The girl you wrote
the ransom note for.

406
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,073
- Where is she?
- There is no girl.

407
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:56,476
Little girl's life
at stake, Parkman.

408
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:58,144
You don't have
a lot of time.

409
00:24:58,212 --> 00:25:00,714
Use your power.

410
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:02,148
Use your power.

411
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:04,884
Under the stairs

412
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:07,086
She's under... She's
under the stairs.

413
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:29,676
What did you do?
What did you do!

414
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:32,679
What? Dude, what
are you doing?

415
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:35,415
Parkman! Parkman what
the hell are you doing?

416
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:37,283
A girl. He killed a girl.

417
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:39,786
Her body's
under the stairs.

418
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:47,794
- What girl?
- The girl!

419
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:51,465
The girl's body
Mike. she's right--

420
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:11,351
The stuffed rabbit.
where's the stuffed--

421
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:13,286
Pink stuffed

422
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:22,796
I used your own
power against you.

423
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:34,741
You're being sued?

424
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,276
This is a scam.

425
00:26:36,343 --> 00:26:38,512
This guy wasn't even
in that bus crash.

426
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,146
According to
my log he was.

427
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:42,115
The hospital is not gonna
take the fall on this.

428
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:43,450
They're gonna blame you.

429
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,819
For what? I've been
nothing but committed.

430
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:47,888
Yeah I know.
You're everywhere.

431
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:50,424
Always the
first on scene.

432
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:52,459
What's that
supposed to mean?

433
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,796
There's a couple of
people floating the theory

434
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:57,597
that you cause the
accidents yourself.

435
00:26:57,665 --> 00:26:58,865
Glory hounding.

436
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:02,268
So what you-you
believe them?

437
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:03,603
They ask if you've
been reckless

438
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:05,806
They ask if you've been
behaving suspiciously.

439
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:08,174
- You have.
- Hesam, you know me.

440
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:10,310
- We're partners.
- Partners?

441
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:13,212
Man, you run off the
second we get on scene.

442
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,882
I'm your chauffeur.

443
00:28:07,935 --> 00:28:10,570
He was on the bus.

444
00:28:18,826 --> 00:28:22,127
Look. Claire, I'm sorry
if I push too hard.

445
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,209
I push. I'm pushy.

446
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:25,058
Ya think?

447
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,132
You don't want to
talk. I get that.

448
00:28:29,132 --> 00:28:31,601
Wanted to keep a
secret that got out.

449
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:38,567
When I was in junior high

450
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:41,569
The girls called me
retchin' Gretchen.

451
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,306
That's a
terrible nickname.

452
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:46,675
Yeah, they said that
I smelled like puke

453
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:48,143
Because I was bulimic.

454
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:52,647
Wow. I can't believe
they would make that up.

455
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:56,185
Yeah. Made it up.

456
00:28:56,252 --> 00:29:00,722
I'll see you around.

457
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,524
Gretchen.

458
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:10,632
I really really
want to trust you

459
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,236
But my life has been a
complex series of disasters

460
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:17,605
And it's been a
really really long time

461
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:22,077
Since I felt safe enough
to tell anyone the truth.

462
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:26,148
But I'm tired of keeping
the secret to myself.

463
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:30,853
So ask me anything.

464
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,956
I'll tell you the truth.

465
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,604
Mr. petrelli. didn't
expect to see you again.

466
00:29:49,672 --> 00:29:51,806
You look like you've been
running all over the city.

467
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,943
I need to
apologize to you.

468
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:56,378
You were on that bus.

469
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:59,181
I made a mistake
and i am sorry.

470
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:00,815
Thank you.

471
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,451
I'm gonna make it right.

472
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,122
No need to
concern yourself.

473
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,759
There must be
something i can do.

474
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:13,362
Have you ever
lost a brother?

475
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,665
No. no i haven't.

476
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:20,969
I used to work hospice.

477
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:25,573
I used to help families through
the worst pain imaginable.

478
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:30,645
Joseph and i
grew up nearby.

479
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:33,748
I thought i'd
go back home

480
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:36,184
To remember
the good times.

481
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,086
Can't bring
yourself to go?

482
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:41,890
Too many bad memories
mixed in with the good.

483
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:46,461
My trip here
started as one thing

484
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:48,663
But it turned into
something else.

485
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,935
Can't seem to find
any solace anywhere.

486
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,907
Grieving is messy.

487
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:01,443
I saw it all the time.

488
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,178
People can offer
their condolences.

489
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:06,014
They can tell you they're
sorry for your loss

490
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:10,819
But they don't know what
it is that you're feeling.

491
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:14,222
What do you
say to people?

492
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,091
I just sit with them

493
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,460
Be with them.

494
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:20,462
I'd let 'em know that
they're not alone.

495
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:23,865
So what made you
become a paramedic?

496
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:27,169
I wanted to save lives
instead of watching them pass.

497
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,810
You're exactly who
i'd hoped you'd be.

498
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,418
I'm dropping the lawsuit.

499
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:47,122
Thank you peter
for everything.

500
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:51,026
You know it's not
for nothing but if you

501
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:53,061
Made the trip all
the way out here

502
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:56,698
I really think that you
should visit your home.

503
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:59,034
I think i will.

504
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,912
Sorry to bother
you at this hour

505
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:44,356
But um

506
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:47,754
I grew up here.

507
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:49,185
My father used
to be the butler.

508
00:35:49,185 --> 00:35:51,619
My mother was the maid.

509
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:54,856
My brother uh
recently passed away

510
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:57,558
And uh i just

511
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:59,327
Thought i could
take a look around.

512
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:01,629
Not here but in
the carriage house.

513
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:03,531
We're actually in the
middle of a dinner party.

514
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,565
Please.

515
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:07,535
This really is
not a good time.

516
00:36:07,603 --> 00:36:11,005
Sorry for your loss.

517
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:32,526
So wait you're telling me
that you've never been drunk?

518
00:36:32,594 --> 00:36:36,164
Because that's like 85%
of the college experience.

519
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:38,666
I know. it just
doesn't work on me.

520
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:40,568
I heal too quickly.

521
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:41,702
But the good thing is

522
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:44,372
You will always have
a designated driver.

523
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:49,811
Can I see it?

524
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:53,014
See what?

525
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:55,150
The healing?

526
00:36:55,217 --> 00:36:57,451
If that's not
crossing a line.

527
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:08,229
The hand's always
the favorite.

528
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:13,467
Go for it.

529
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:15,303
I've never done
this before.

530
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,338
Well I would hope not.

531
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,909
It's okay.

532
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:26,547
Aah! oh my god oh my god!

533
00:37:26,615 --> 00:37:27,982
I'm so sorry!
are you okay?

534
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,550
I'm just kidding.
i'm sorry.

535
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:32,854
That was mean. I'm fine.

536
00:37:43,098 --> 00:37:45,566
I have to take this.

537
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:49,704
I'll be right back.

538
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:56,244
Dad I've got everything
under control, okay?

539
00:37:56,312 --> 00:37:59,214
And I told Gretchen
everything about everything

540
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:00,882
And I know that
you're gonna be mad.

541
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,583
But this was my choice.

542
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:04,185
It's not just us anymore

543
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:06,221
And I'm gonna have
other people in my life

544
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:08,489
Friends and boyfriends

545
00:38:08,557 --> 00:38:11,492
And I can't close
myself off with lies.

546
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,662
- Did you rehearse that speech?
- Yes.

547
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,931
I wanted to get it right.

548
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:20,869
No, it..it was
good. listen I, um

549
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:23,004
I think I owe
you an apology.

550
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:26,140
I was a bit harsh
earlier at the restaurant.

551
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:29,377
- A bit?
- Okay. Two bits.

552
00:38:29,444 --> 00:38:31,246
It's just...

553
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:33,514
When I look at you

554
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:37,919
I can't help seeing
my Claire bear and, uh

555
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:39,520
When you get in
any kind of trouble

556
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:42,323
I feel this instinct
to protect you.

557
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:44,458
Well you can't
do that now.

558
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:46,527
I don't think I can
ever really do it again.

559
00:38:46,595 --> 00:38:47,962
Not like before.

560
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,731
Look I will always
be here for you.

561
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:53,134
Always.

562
00:38:53,202 --> 00:38:54,936
But you're right.

563
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:57,038
You can handle your
own problems now.

564
00:38:57,106 --> 00:39:01,142
And I'll try to worry
about myself from now on.

565
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:05,280
Thanks.

566
00:39:05,347 --> 00:39:06,814
Good night, dad.

567
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:09,117
Good night  Claire.

568
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:11,352
Good night.

569
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:26,100
Can I, uh, borrow this?

570
00:39:26,168 --> 00:39:27,635
No.

571
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:29,337
Right. Sorry.

572
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:31,406
No, I..I mean yes.

573
00:39:31,473 --> 00:39:33,641
Yes, but

574
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,844
Well you won't have
to borrow it because

575
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:39,414
It'll be here.

576
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:42,917
Do you want to
be my roommate?

577
00:39:44,486 --> 00:39:46,154
Let me think, um

578
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:50,091
Rooming with a boring girl
who smells like pickles

579
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,463
Or the supergirl who's got
excellent taste in literature.

580
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:00,013
Well, all right
then. Roommate

581
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,514
I just I don't see any
other way out of this.

582
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:14,682
You crossed the line man.

583
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:17,018
What's gonna
happen to me, Mike?

584
00:40:17,086 --> 00:40:19,920
You need to find yourself
a damn good lawyer.

585
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:22,523
This is gonna
ruin my life.

586
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,658
I am sorry.

587
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:27,395
Yeah.

588
00:40:28,365 --> 00:40:29,964
Me too.

589
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:41,575
What are you doing?

590
00:40:41,643 --> 00:40:44,278
I guess I'm just not
strong enough anymore.

591
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:51,785
Nothing happened here.

592
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:53,354
He attacked you.
I stopped him.

593
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:57,691
That's all.
Go call it in.

594
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:00,161
I'll go call it in, Matt.

595
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:04,901
I'm proud of you.

596
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:07,569
You're finally
becoming more like me.

597
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:12,430
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

598
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:17,579
Now they can
all be like this

599
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,986
Or you and I can
go find my body.

600
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:41,173
Weird, huh.

601
00:41:44,444 --> 00:41:45,512
Sorry to make
you boys come out.

602
00:41:45,512 --> 00:41:48,547
Three people died here.
Could have been a lot worse.

603
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:51,283
- So what happened?
- Sinkhole.

604
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:53,352
Sinkhole?
