2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:06,964
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
tear open your head right here.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,924
Because you'll never find your dad.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,053
We need to show progress.
These are our targets.

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,598
Hunt them, track them,
and bring them home alive.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,268
If you kill me,
I'll get exactly what I want.

7
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,563
- And what is that?
- They'll see what I've been telling.

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,690
They'll know just how dangerous
you people are.

9
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:28,040
Daphne's alive, Matt.
They have her, alive.

10
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:30,571
- You're lying to me!
- No, no, no. I won't fight you.

11
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:33,616
Your mother wants me to move out
of the house for a while.

12
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,091
She's right.

13
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:37,662
We keep too many secrets
in this family.

14
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,873
- They're just locking people up?
- Believe it, it's happening.

15
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:43,959
Somebody sent me to warn you.
You must be on a list or something.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,961
I can breathe under water.

17
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,048
You're in danger, we need to get out
of here immediatley.

18
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,141
We're out of whole wheat.
Sorry.

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,009
Whatever.
I'm starving.

20
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:04,093
My mom's going to the market soon,
so hopefully she'll take Lyle.

21
00:01:04,218 --> 00:01:06,916
You can come downstairs,
stretch your legs a bit.

22
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,568
Well, that's a good thing.
I'm starting to stink.

23
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,533
Look I've got the cash. There's a train
leaving for Albuquerque tonight.

24
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,801
Albuquerque?

25
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:20,903
I don't know anyone in Albuquerque.

26
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:22,206
That's the point.

27
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,124
You could start over,
become a new person...

28
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,021
- Where no one could find you.
- Yeah, but I never agreed to that.

29
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,799
My family's here, my friends.
My life.

30
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,967
Do you want them to find you?

31
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,804
- Make you disappear forever?
- They're gonna find me anyways.

32
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:40,877
The government has those spy satellites.
They're probably watching us right now.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,731
- No, we're fine.
- Yeah, but you don't know that.

34
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:51,736
You're not Harriet Tubman, all right?
And this isn't the underground railroad.

35
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:54,947
You're just a high school girl,
and you're in way over your head.

36
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:59,723
If it wasn't for this high school girl,
you might already be dead.

37
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,539
So you want to survive, you'll have
to do exactly what I tell you, got it?

38
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,295
I need to speak with you.

39
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,511
- Hey, mom. What's up?
- Our house money's gone.

40
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,657
You know, the money I keep
in Mr. Muggle's rubber sneaker.

41
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:23,437
Any idea where that went?

42
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:26,811
- Maybe Lyle took it.
- I already grilled him.

43
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,981
Per usual, he has no clue.

44
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:35,446
Okay, fine, I took it.
I was was gonna pay you back.

45
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,946
Claire, I don't get it.

46
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:40,451
You have a nice allowance.
What do you need $300 for?

47
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:43,743
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- No, I just...

48
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,120
What is it, Muggles?

49
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,628
What's under the bed, boy?
What is it?

50
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,428
What is going on with you, Claire?

51
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,515
Nothing.
Nothing, I swear.

52
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,729
I didn't hear anything.

53
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,149
Mrs Bennet, right?

54
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:21,736
Hi.

55
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:35,126
Home sweet home.

56
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:37,428
Not anymore.

57
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,942
Got a one-bedroom in Dupont Circle.

58
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:43,702
You don't mind that we're
keeping an eye on your daughter,

59
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:46,127
making sure she's behaving herself?

60
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:49,055
Claire's a big girl.
She makes her own decisions.

61
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,524
If she does something wrong,
she can live with the consequences.

62
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,652
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

63
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
Peter Petrelli

64
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,032
has joined Matt Parkman
as priority one.

65
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,579
Charged with kidnapping, assault, and
attempted murder of federal officers.

66
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,394
Both of these men are considered armed
and dangerous, and should be taken down

67
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:13,252
by any means necessary.

68
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,739
Short of lethal force.

69
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:17,777
Actually, Senator, my men
have been given the go ahead...

70
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,551
- shoot to kill.
- On whose authority, Danko?

71
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:22,094
Mine.

72
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:26,305
Back to work.

73
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,416
Do you really want to push my hand?

74
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,145
Your brother came into my house,

75
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:34,481
- put a gun to my head.
- I saved your life, if I remember.

76
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:36,378
You made this personal.

77
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:37,985
Now I do what I need to do.

78
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,058
- Keep an eye on him for me, will you?
- Matt and Peter kidnapped me

79
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,833
and threatened my life.

80
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,428
What makes you think
I won't shoot them myself?

81
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,209
Sir, we have a lead.

82
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:56,975
Manhattan.

83
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:13,771
Matt, you need to stop. Matt.

84
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,191
Matt, you need to stop!

85
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,652
- Stop. Stop.
- What happened?

86
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,022
You've been painting the same image
over and over again all night, okay.

87
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:26,230
I'm guessing you're trying to find
some answers how to stop this.

88
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:28,577
- Oh, God.
- Look, we need to leave, okay?

89
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,345
It's too dangerous here.
We gotta go now.

90
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:35,459
The only thing that matters right now
is finding Daphne and getting her back.

91
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,077
One life at a time.

92
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:43,884
Look, Matt, when you were
in Bennet's head,

93
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,542
could you see... could you tell
where Daphne was?

94
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,885
- Anything?
- I don't know. I don't know.

95
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,413
I mean I didn't see much.
I saw a hallway.

96
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,729
Did you turn that on?

97
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,654
- Who the hell is Rebel?
- I have no idea.

98
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,820
- Address...
- Daphne!

99
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,510
Someone's listening
to our conversation.

100
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,245
No. He's just hacking in.
This could be information.

101
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:14,328
- We need this information!
- We don't know who this is.

102
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:16,570
How can we trust this person, huh?

103
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,965
What if this is a setup?

104
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,552
And what if he's telling the truth?

105
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:29,465
Go! Go, go, go!

106
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:44,038
<i>They're gone.</i>

107
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,576
<i>We just missed 'em.</i>

108
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,529
I think

109
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,636
I know where they're headed.

110
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:11,487
www.Heroes-France.com

111
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,453
This is our last release.

112
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:15,944
To the <i>Heroes</i> community: thank you.

113
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:17,633
And keep sharing.

114
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:20,063


115
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,655
Mom, this is Alex.

116
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:30,449
He's...

117
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,907
He's my new boyfriend.

118
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,627
That doesn't explain
why he's hiding in your closet.

119
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:38,752
Right.

120
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,419
We're...

121
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:46,428
You're really gonna make me
say it out loud?

122
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:47,674
Absolutely.

123
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,535
We're having sex.

124
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:54,640
And I know it's wrong.
Very, very wrong.

125
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,142
You do understand that
my daughter is only 17.

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,910
I haven't touched her.

127
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,563
Okay?
I barely even make eye contact.

128
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:05,442
The truth.

129
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:12,204
He's like me.

130
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:14,743
He has an ability.

131
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,913
You can tell her.

132
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,791
I can breathe underwater.

133
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:24,294
He has a power?
And you brought him here?!

134
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,421
Dad was after him.
I didn't know what else to do.

135
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,674
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

136
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,004
Yes, I do, but what was I
supposed to do, just let him...

137
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,137
And on top of that you lied to me!

138
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:38,962
I am so disappointed.

139
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,248
The agent still there?

140
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:51,486
Pretty sure you lost him when
you skidded off onto the dirt road.

141
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,991
But just to be sure...

142
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,596
we're clear, officially,
off the grid.

143
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:02,124
No communications within 50 Miles.

144
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,792
- You sound disappointed.
- Maybe I am.

145
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,297
I mean, the way I see it,
agents catch up with us, we just...

146
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,842
charbroil 'em from the inside out.

147
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,511
I don't want to leave the trail of dead
bodies directly to my father's house.

148
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,483
Why are you doing this?
Parents suck.

149
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:21,518
You never get what you want
from them.

150
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,960
When I was a kid, I just wanted
my dad to take me fishing. He used my...

151
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:27,025
arm as an ashtray instead.

152
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:30,774
Seriously, look.
I have the scars to prove it.

153
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,283
- You should have worn a seat belt.
- Dude, you're hurting me.

154
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,119
- Why don't you want me to see my dad?
- I just... I don't get it.

155
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,955
You don't need to get anything.
My father's the only one with answers.

156
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:48,389
You're the most powerful dude
on the planet.

157
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:50,964
I mean, what could you
possibly need?

158
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,258
We don't need anyone.
- What?

159
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,795
Hey, what are you doing?

160
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:01,194
What the hell?!

161
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:23,664
If you're hungry, there's
a burger place up the road.

162
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:39,034
I'm sorry I lied to you.

163
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:41,890
I should have told you about Alex.

164
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,063
What you're doing is extremely
dangerous. Do you understand that?

165
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,356
They were gonna
lock him up for no reason.

166
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,441
And they'll do
the same thing to you.

167
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,193
This is not a game.

168
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,697
Mom, I have to do this.

169
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:00,600
I know that it's hard for you. You want
a normal life, a regular family.

170
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,788
But that's why Dad and I have to lie.
So we can protect you.

171
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:05,943
Why?!

172
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,371
Because I'm some fragile
creature in need of protection?

173
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:11,868
- No, that's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant,

174
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:14,756
and I've got news for you.
I'm strong.

175
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:18,037
Much stronger than either
you or your father think.

176
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:19,886
And I know more
than you think I know.

177
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:22,725
For example, I know that right now,

178
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:25,442
there's a van parked outside
on the street.

179
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,395
They're watching us.
They're watching you.

180
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,822
You think she's hiding
the Woolsley kid?

181
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:44,953
Absolutely.

182
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,883
I'm telling you she's helping him.

183
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:53,420
Those pool cleaners have been
parked out there for four hours.

184
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,300
Nobody's pool is that dirty.

185
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,674
This is bad.

186
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,260
How you gonna save Alex, Claire?

187
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:02,346
You can't go out there.

188
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:05,368
You gonna keep him
up in your closet forever?

189
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,373
No, I'll come up with something.

190
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:10,103
I have a plan.

191
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:13,787
I just haven't thought of it yet.

192
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,525
I have an idea.

193
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,153
- You do?
- Yeah.

194
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,520
And you can either
keep me in the dark,

195
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,245
and lie to protect me,

196
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:25,077
or you can let me help.

197
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,037
I say we definitely let her help.

198
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,933
All right, Mom...

199
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:34,907
what's the plan?

200
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,056
We're not gonna have a lot of time. Get
in there, do your mind-control magic,

201
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,385
and then we get Daphne
and we're out.

202
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,971
It's impossible. Look at this building.
It's gotta be jam packed full of people.

203
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,349
There are only so many minds
I can control at any given time.

204
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,669
You're right.

205
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,728
What are you doing?
What is that?

206
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,543
- I just borrowed your power.
- Great!

207
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:57,484
- Now, we can watch each other's backs.
- And you can't fly now.

208
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,965
Which basically rules out
our rooftop escape plan.

209
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,550
See, we gotta get
into the building first.

210
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:05,555
And two guys pushing thoughts
is better than one.

211
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:06,983
Come on.

212
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,472
Top floor.

213
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,332
I love doing that.

214
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,296
Right?
Makes it a lot easier.

215
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,090
Cameras are everywhere. Let's go.

216
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:07,387
In here. Come on.

217
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:13,192
- You're not allowed in here.
- You're gonna finish your lunch

218
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,696
in the hall and make sure
no one comes in.

219
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:18,398
I'll just finish my lunch
in the hall.

220
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:23,904
The plan was to find Daphne.

221
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,655
Gotta know where to look, huh?

222
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,889
Sir, take a look at this.

223
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,458
Okay, this is a problem.

224
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:39,276
How the hell did they get in here?

225
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,596
Targets are in Operations. Shut down
the computer systems, everything.

226
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,009
- Can't. Someone's hacking in.
- Damn it, just shut it down!

227
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,844
- Let's go!
- Wait.

228
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,805
- Hell with that.
- I wouldn't go out there if I were you.

229
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,390
You're not me.

230
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,404
Son of a bitch.

231
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:19,626
- What?
- How'd you do on your history exam?

232
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,156
- C-minus.
- Right. You're grounded.

233
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:24,503
Drivers license, please.
Now.

234
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,886
Thank you.

235
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,810
- That was harsh.
- He's a terrible driver anyway.

236
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:40,843
To disappear,
you need a new identity.

237
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:42,451
Trick is

238
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,403
to remove the photo
without tearing it.

239
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,199
There.

240
00:15:49,597 --> 00:15:52,033
I cannot believe you know
how to make a fake I.D.

241
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,536
Where did you learn that?

242
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:56,121
- Dad?
- No.

243
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:58,744
Claire, believe it or not,
I was a teenager once.

244
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:02,254
And an enterprising one,
not unlike you, young lady.

245
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,794
There was this band once
I just had to see.

246
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,299
Def Leopard.
Oh, my God, Rick Savage.

247
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:10,291
Bass player. So cute!

248
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:13,554
- What I would have given to...
- Mom!

249
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:16,349
Sorry.

250
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,226
Alex, you need to change your looks.

251
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,937
Probably using
facial recognition algorithms.

252
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,772
That I learned from your father.

253
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,983
You can find a change of clothes
upstairs.

254
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,569
I appreciate everything
that you're doing.

255
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,226
You know I didn't mean
to drag you into all of this.

256
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,802
You were gonna do it
one way or another, Claire.

257
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,630
Just thought I might help.

258
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:50,510
I'm sorry for being the way I am.

259
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:56,179
Making everything so much harder.

260
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:58,558
Sometimes I just wish I was normal.

261
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,189
Why on earth would you want that?

262
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:06,733
It would just
make everything easier.

263
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,952
Maybe you and Dad would
still be together.

264
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:15,283
Honey, your father and I had issues
long before you came around.

265
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:19,243
- Why'd you marry him?
- 'Cause I fell in love with him,

266
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:22,075
warts and all.
He was dangerous, handsome.

267
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,834
I accepted everything
that went with that.

268
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:28,778
But now...

269
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,567
I'm tired of being lied to.

270
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:38,066
I can't see my marriage anymore.

271
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:41,053
So it's...

272
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,145
over. You guys are gonna
get a divorce.

273
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:46,536
I don't know.

274
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Maybe.

275
00:17:49,057 --> 00:17:52,112
But whatever happens
between your father and I

276
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:55,145
has nothing to do with you.

277
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:00,188
Okay?

278
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,490
So what are we looking for?

279
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,486
Something happened here.

280
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:23,731
Yeah, like a million years ago.

281
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:28,859
I've been here before.

282
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:31,544
How do you know?

283
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,256
I remember.

284
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:50,005
My father was here too.

285
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:38,756
Hello?

286
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:42,263
Where did you just go?

287
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,560
I can remember my father.

288
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,127
Are you sure?

289
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:16,624
Positive.

290
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:26,724
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

291
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:30,895
I still don't know why
you're doing all this for me.

292
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:35,277
Well, we're an endangered species.
I'm just...

293
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:39,946
doing my best to try to save us.

294
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,925
Hell, I didn't even know
there were others like me.

295
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,451
- I remember that feeling.
- So...

296
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,359
how do I look?

297
00:20:51,012 --> 00:20:52,709
Like an exceptionally cute boy

298
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,536
who can breathe underwater.

299
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,520
You're special, Claire.

300
00:20:57,867 --> 00:21:00,067
And not just because of the whole

301
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,135
immortal healing thing.

302
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:05,096
I don't know. Maybe if...

303
00:21:05,716 --> 00:21:08,474
things were different,
we could have gone out or something.

304
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,895
We could have been hiding in your
bedroom for entirely different reasons.

305
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:17,927
Even if things were different,
I'm not...

306
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:21,321
really into the whole
relationship thing right now.

307
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,870
It just seems like everyone
who gets married gets a divorce.

308
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:32,148
Okay, I think it's more like a half

309
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:34,250
of all marriages
get a divorce or something.

310
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,418
Yeah, but who knows how happy
that other half is.

311
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:39,126
I don't know.

312
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,505
I still think it's worth it.

313
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:45,929
Why?

314
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,160
For moments like this.

315
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:52,925
When someone gets you the way that

316
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,295
no one else does.

317
00:21:57,987 --> 00:21:59,737
It's definitely worth it.

318
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,992
Those agents are coming toward the
house. Alex, come with me. Come with me!

319
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Go.

320
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:14,248
- Come on, in here.
- They're gonna look here first.

321
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,574
No, you have to whack it. Watch.

322
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:18,621
Now get down here
and push it with your foot.

323
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:20,421
Your dad used to store guns, files,

324
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,876
god knows what else in there. He doesn't
think I know about it... careful.

325
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,471
That's right, now close it.
Close it behind you.

326
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:29,448
Just another day
in the Bennet house.

327
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:31,766
- Let's go. Let's go!
- That is so weird.

328
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,854
You're not supposed to be here.
I'm off limits.

329
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,191
Top floor is clear.

330
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,303
I told you,
you're wasting your time.

331
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:43,478
Oh, come on, Claire,
we both know what's going on.

332
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,540
Hot guy, just your type.

333
00:22:46,343 --> 00:22:47,443
Where is he?

334
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,483
He's here. I know it.

335
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:26,029
Well, that would be wrong,
wouldn't it?

336
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,394
If you two are finished here,

337
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:30,700
I need you to get the hell
out of my house.

338
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,161
That was close.

339
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:54,727
I cannot believe the way
you stood up to that bitch.

340
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:56,652
Let's not celebrate yet.

341
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:59,228
They're not gonna give up so easily.

342
00:24:00,461 --> 00:24:02,211
The train's leaving soon.

343
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:05,089
We need to find a way
to get you to the station.

344
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:06,778
You have both done enough.

345
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:09,906
Maybe I can slip out back.
Make a run for it.

346
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,474
- No, they'll catch you.
- Maybe not.

347
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:17,115
We're gonna give him a head start.

348
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:28,341
- I think I got something. Millbrook?
- Daphne?

349
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,512
She's not here anymore, Matt.
Transferred to a medical facility.

350
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,347
Damn it.
Of course.

351
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,141
Wait, hold on a second.
Look.

352
00:24:37,437 --> 00:24:39,018
- Your friend is back.
- Rebel?

353
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,103
Tell him he screwed us.
Daphne's gone.

354
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,906
He's opening up a file. I think there's
something he wants us to see.

355
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:45,881
- What is it?
- Come here.

356
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,193
That's us.

357
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:51,114
That's the entire operation.
They got the whole thing on tape.

358
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,742
- What you doing?
- Copying the files.

359
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,410
What for?
- To expose them.

360
00:24:57,207 --> 00:25:00,123
Look, American citizens
rounded up like this. No warrants.

361
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:03,084
No trials. This is gonna look great
on the evening news.

362
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,920
Nathan's not gonna know what hit him.
We'll use this as leverage.

363
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,808
Daphne's not here, Matt. There's no
guarantee that we're gonna find her,

364
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:11,281
- but if we have this...
- We can make a deal.

365
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:15,372
- Everything we've got for Daphne.
- One life at a time.

366
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,842
Parkman's a telepath.

367
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:23,327
Incredibly powerful.
But when he uses his ability,

368
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:25,702
his senses become raw nerves,

369
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:28,677
and he becomes susceptible.
We exploit that...

370
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,989
- we can disrupt his thoughts.
- That just might work. Let's do it.

371
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,710
- Can't focus. We gotta get outta here.
- I need more time!

372
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:49,802
It's done! I got it!

373
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,383
Matt!
- What?

374
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:53,926
30 seconds for what?

375
00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:57,849
It's off. Come on, let's go! Go!

376
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:03,626
Wait. You do not want to shoot us.

377
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:06,955
Hey, wait.
Down. Down. Good, good, good.

378
00:26:09,705 --> 00:26:12,445
Don't do it!
This is only gonna end badly.

379
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,856
Don't do this.

380
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,724
- I'll hold 'em, you go.
- What about you?

381
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,123
There's no time.
Go. Go. I'll hold 'em.

382
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,226
You know me.

383
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,797
Nice and easy.

384
00:26:41,364 --> 00:26:43,364
Something terrible happened here.

385
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:46,812
What are you talking about?
It's a toy car. What's the big deal?

386
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:53,158
My father did something to me.

387
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,364
Something I forgot.

388
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,382
That's a good thing, right?

389
00:26:59,462 --> 00:27:02,328
Not remembering all the crap
that happens to you when you're a kid.

390
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:07,372
It eats away at your soul.

391
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:17,426
Mommy.

392
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,449
Mommy.

393
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:37,344
So you didn't find Peter?

394
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:40,926
You're not helping him, are you?

395
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:43,574
Don't be ridiculous.

396
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,307
Someone's out there
calling themself "Rebel."

397
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:48,427
Knows we're building 26s.

398
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,728
How it runs.

399
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:52,855
So I see.

400
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,013
You have all that information too.

401
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:57,735
Tell me this isn't you.

402
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:02,197
Of course not. First of all, I don't
know the first thing about computers.

403
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:03,945
But you could hire someone for that.

404
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,690
And beyond that, I know
who's keeping me safe, Nathan.

405
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:09,732
I can live my life in peace,
thanks to your generosity.

406
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,735
I would never betray you.

407
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,631
Look, Peter...
he stole a dangerous file.

408
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:21,672
And there are people
that want him dead because of that.

409
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:23,491
You're in charge.
You can protect him.

410
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:26,222
I'm doing all I can to contain
and control these people with abilities,

411
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,433
but there are other people
that want to see them all dead.

412
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:33,618
Yes, dear. I've had a bit
of experience with all this.

413
00:29:37,296 --> 00:29:39,148
- Hello?
- It's me.

414
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:42,321
- Pete, where are you?
- Is he okay?

415
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,408
I'm only gonna say this once.
You know what I took.

416
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:49,328
I've got evidence against you
and your entire organization.

417
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,496
<i>What you've been doing to us.</i>

418
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:53,833
- What do you want?
- A trade.

419
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,299
Matt Parkman and Daphne Millbrook
for everything that I've got.

420
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:58,295
<i>That's it?</i>

421
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:01,564
- Two people? I don't understand.
- Look, if anything happens to them

422
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:05,347
or me, all the information I've got
goes directly to the nightly news,

423
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,263
<i>do you want that?</i>

424
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:10,333
- So do we have a deal?
- Fine.

425
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:13,032
Where do you want to meet?

426
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,151
My son and I are going to a movie.

427
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:37,460
That threaten
the Federal Government?

428
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:01,924
You okay?

429
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,570
Yeah. Fine.

430
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:09,547
You can get off of me now.

431
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:13,665
Oh, God.

432
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,996
We gotta go.
That way.

433
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,038
End of the block.
Think I see 'em.

434
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,739
- We all set?
- Town car's ready.

435
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:32,911
Ten minutes to the exchange.

436
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,161
- Your boys know where they're headed?
- Exactly where your brother wants.

437
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,456
- 4001 North Nebraska Avenue.
- Next to the network news.

438
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,827
- I don't suppose that's a coincidence.
- Peter's no dummy.

439
00:32:43,432 --> 00:32:45,203
Daphne and Matt ready for transport?

440
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:47,608
No, Senator, they're not.

441
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:50,737
We're not making a deal.

442
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,140
What's he talking about?

443
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,931
What the hell are you talking about?

444
00:32:57,365 --> 00:32:59,005
I have another plan.

445
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,845
You realize if my brother's harmed
in any way, copies of those files

446
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,861
are gonna make their way to every
news organization in this country.

447
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:06,964
Our entire operation
will be compromised.

448
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,777
I'm aware of the situation.

449
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,539
Then get Millbrook
and Parkman released right now,

450
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:14,824
put them in the car,
and get them down to the parking lot.

451
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,108
Or do you want to disobey
a direct order?

452
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:20,873
I'm following orders,
Senator, just not yours.

453
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,909
The United States Government will
not make deals with terrorists.

454
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:27,534
Those were the President's
exact words.

455
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,341
Despite your endless protestations,
your brother's a terrorist.

456
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:31,509
Terrorist?

457
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,927
My brother's not a terrorist.

458
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,817
<i>Target spotted
approaching parking lot.</i>

459
00:33:36,942 --> 00:33:39,312
I'm en route.
Hold your stations.

460
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:42,191
Just stay out of my way.
Let's go.

461
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:47,941
Just remember,
Peter can hear your thoughts.

462
00:34:10,063 --> 00:34:11,423
Where are they, Bennet?

463
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:15,594
<i>Matt, Daphne.</i>

464
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:17,763
- Listen to me.
- <i>Are you in there?</i>

465
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,973
- Come with me.
- <i>Matt?</i>

466
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,991
And nobody has to get hurt.

467
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:25,104
<i>Peter... listen to me!</i>

468
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:27,147
<i>They're not here.
You're being set up.</i>

469
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,526
Time to die, Petrelli.

470
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,743
<i>Just a little further.
Gimme the kill shot.</i>

471
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:36,699
<i>I'm trying to save your life.
Get out of here, he's gonna...</i>

472
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:06,812
Are you all right?

473
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:10,858
- It's just a scratch. He'll be fine.
- What do you want, a thank you?

474
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:14,987
Why... are you doing this, Nathan?

475
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:18,282
Doing what, saving your life
or trying to save the world?

476
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,701
Perhaps there's
a better way of doing it.

477
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,421
This hasn't turned out
exactly the way I wanted it to.

478
00:35:23,546 --> 00:35:26,369
Okay? I'm aware of that. There's
a lot of different agendas going on.

479
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:29,501
All leading to killing us.
You realize you're responsible for that.

480
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,003
Yeah, I do.

481
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,819
It's out of control, and it's my fault.
But I can fix it.

482
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:37,176
In fact, I'm the only one
who can fix it.

483
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,680
- Why? 'Cause you're one of us?
- Because I'm the only one

484
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,134
who really cares if
you're alive or not, Pete.

485
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,517
Come with me, okay,
and I promise you'll be treated well.

486
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,404
- Don't do this, Nathan.
- It's okay.

487
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:49,813
Ma, please.
You have my word.

488
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:08,659
- I know you'll take care of me.
- I will.

489
00:36:08,784 --> 00:36:10,083
Because you love me.

490
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:12,892
Pete, I'm just trying to help.

491
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:19,760
Bye, Nathan.

492
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,725
No, Nathan, don't.

493
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:30,103
You give me one good reason why
I shouldn't go after him right now.

494
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:32,706
Because the game has changed.

495
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:35,514
I've seen it,
and you need to be ready.

496
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,171
<i>And we have some
breaking news for you now.</i>

497
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,199
<i>Rumors have surfaced
that the U.S. Government</i>

498
00:36:58,324 --> 00:37:01,343
<i>has recently broadened
the reach of the Patriot Act.</i>

499
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:05,082
<i>Thanks, Brian. Well, tonight sources
have provided our news bureau</i>

500
00:37:05,207 --> 00:37:07,540
<i>some startling footage
taken directly</i>

501
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:10,477
<i>from an unnamed government
agency right here in Washington.</i>

502
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:12,980
<i>Now, this video shows
American citizens</i>

503
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:17,152
<i>in hoods and restraints in what
appears to be a clear violation</i>

504
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,027
<i>of their constitutional rights.</i>

505
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,248
<i>Is the government running
a secret military organization</i>

506
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,658
<i>with the authority
to disregard civil liberty?</i>

507
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:29,185
So what, we're just gonna
stay here all day?

508
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:36,336
The guy's an ass, plain and simple.
All right, I told you parents su...

509
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:40,902
He killed my mother.

510
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:46,638
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

511
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,641
I mean, I've been trying
to tell you that he's a jerk.

512
00:37:50,755 --> 00:37:53,854
You've been trying to tell me, really?
When did that happen?

513
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,640
'Cause all I can remember
is the cute little stories

514
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:58,793
of you two bird watching
around the neighborhood.

515
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:01,445
You made him sound like
Mr. freakin' Rogers.

516
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,614
I was just waiting
for the right time.

517
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:10,996
Hey, I got an idea.

518
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:14,134
Why don't we drive up to Canada,

519
00:38:14,904 --> 00:38:16,946
because we're close to the border.

520
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:18,767
We could rob some old ladies.

521
00:38:18,892 --> 00:38:20,492
That's not gonna happen.

522
00:38:20,617 --> 00:38:22,507
Why are you doing this to me?

523
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,984
Because you're here,
and I need to express my feelings.

524
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,820
You used me

525
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:31,820
for some joy ride, an escape.

526
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,768
I got news for you, kid.

527
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:35,896
There is no escape.

528
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,398
There is only pain.

529
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:41,793
And you can never outrun it no matter
what you do, no matter where you go.

530
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
Go home to your mother, Luke.

531
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,119
You're not gonna kill me?

532
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,450
Seems a little on the nose.

533
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,310
Where you going?

534
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,830
To find my father.

535
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:04,600
'Cause now that
I've seen the truth...

536
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:08,962
I want him to die.

537
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,087
What the hell are you doing?

538
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:27,948
Must've realized there'd be
consequences for your actions.

539
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:30,770
Yeah, when that story breaks,
you're exposed.

540
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:32,781
And the world will see

541
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,707
what you're doing.
You're hunting innocent people.

542
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,375
You're not innocent.

543
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,294
The world just doesn't realize
how dangerous you are.

544
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:43,011
Now

545
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
they will,

546
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:48,476
and they'll beg me
to hunt you down and kill you.

547
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,849
The enemy has a face, Parkman.
It's you.

548
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,930
No, I don't want to hurt anyone.

549
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,599
Really?

550
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:00,186
To me...

551
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,734
you look exactly like a terrorist.

552
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,146
Why did you...

553
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:53,409
You gonna miss having
a cute guy in your closet?

554
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:54,916
A little.

555
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:58,747
You were incredible.

556
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:03,877
Nice to know I still have
a few tricks up my sleeve.

557
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,000
I love you.

558
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:09,249
I love you.

559
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:10,924
Just the way you are.

560
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:15,305
I wouldn't trade this life
for anything.

561
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
Me either.

562
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,510
So I made popcorn.
Figure we could watch a movie.

563
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:26,566
Some sappy love story.

564
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,385
Ah, sounds perfect.

565
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:33,536
I'll be right down.

566
00:41:59,568 --> 00:42:00,668
Hey, Barbie.

567
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,270
You!

568
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:07,640
I got a message from
someone named Rebel.

569
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,513
I need your help, Barbie.
