1
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:09,587
- My brother joseph and I
have had two families.

2
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:11,890
The first one...

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:16,127
Well, let's just say
it didn't work out too well.

4
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:20,465
But over the years,
we made ourselves a new one.

5
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:24,569
And it was to this family,
alof you,

6
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:29,107
That his heart really
belonged.

7
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:31,709
You see...

8
00:00:31,777 --> 00:00:37,548
A family is something that
joseph and I needed.

9
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:39,150
It offered us protection

10
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:44,455
From the outside world...

11
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:49,294
A world that never understood
or appreciated

12
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:55,233
What makes us different.

13
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:58,569
There are others like us
out there...

14
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:05,277
In the shadows,
in the light.

15
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:10,348
Each grasping for meaning
in a world

16
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,952
That won't accept them
for who they really are.

17
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,522
They, like us,
are blessed,

18
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:20,491
Gifted with extraordinary
abilities.

19
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,995
And they, like us, struggle
with finding their place

20
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:29,801
In an ordinary world.

21
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:34,005
Haunted by their past...

22
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:35,506
From those who would
harm them

23
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:38,643
And keep them from
their destiny.

24
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,478
Every one of them deserves
a chance

25
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:42,447
To be who they really are,

26
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:44,983
But to what end,

27
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:48,719
For what purpose?

28
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:50,855
Here in this place,

29
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:54,759
We offer salvation.

30
00:01:57,763 --> 00:02:00,165
We offer hope.

31
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:03,234
We offer redemption.

32
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:04,802
And one by one,

33
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:10,141
They will come to our side,

34
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,544
To our family,

35
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:17,983
And they will find
their way home.

36
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,686
And all who have gathered
will be strong.

37
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,258
And all who have gathered

38
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:32,297
Will stand in unison.

39
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:33,898
I say it's time

40
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:37,202
We found
our way back home again.

41
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,085
Find your way home,
brother.

42
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:44,169
[Rock music]

43
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:05,790
- You must be my new
roommate.

44
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,459
- Yeah, I guess I am.
I'm Claire.

45
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:09,427
- Hi. I'm annie.

46
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:10,895
It's nice to finally meet you,
Claire.

47
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:12,063
- You too.

48
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:13,465
- The school, um,
they wouldn't really

49
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:14,732
Send any information.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,234
Otherwise, I would have
friended you on facebook.

51
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:17,668
- Oh, that's my fault.

52
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,770
I always check those little
privacy boxes for some reason.

53
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:22,407
- I did that same thing
with my ap classmate's profile

54
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,909
After I got a b-Plus
in ap physics.

55
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:27,044
Are you on apclassmates.Com?

56
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:29,814
- No, I'm not
in advanced placement.

57
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:32,883
I got my g.E.D.

58
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,419
It's not because I dropped out
or anything,

59
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:35,753
I was just traveling.

60
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:38,923
- And you got into this school
with a g.E.D.?

61
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:41,692
What do your parents do?

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,665
- Uh, my mom breeds
championship show dogs,

63
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:51,002
And my dad works for
the government.

64
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:52,504
- So that's how you got in
with a g.E.D.

65
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,640
- No, I just got
really good scores.

66
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:56,807
- Oh.

67
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,510
Well, you'll probably place

68
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:00,378
In fenton's
linear algebra class then today.

69
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:01,679
- Today?

70
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:03,114
- He only takes 35 students
a semester,

71
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:04,715
And the placement test
is today at 1:00.

72
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:05,883
You get in
and it pretty much

73
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,985
Sets the whole dominoes
into motion, you know?

74
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:10,021
So, um, what's your plan
for graduate school?

75
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:12,590
- I don't really have one.

76
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:13,758
Guess it's kind of why
I'm here.

77
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:16,794
- No, you have to go to college
with a plan.

78
00:05:16,862 --> 00:05:18,029
How are you gonna find
our future without a map?

79
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:19,997
- You have a map
of your future?

80
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,133
- Yeah.

81
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,469
See, I call this
my trajectory.

82
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:27,539
This is me in three years,
graduating magna cum laude

83
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:30,041
In poli-Sci pre-Law,
this is me in eight years,

84
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,209
Massachusetts
attorney general,

85
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,344
And this is me
in 12 years,

86
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,547
Being sworn in as the youngest
governor in u.S. History.

87
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:40,818
- Wow, you really
thought that through.

88
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:43,754
- Don't you think it's time
you put childish things

89
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:48,059
Behind you and thought this
through yourself, Claire?

90
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:50,761
I mean, don't let g.E.D.
Be a lifestyle choice.

91
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:52,197
I'll tell you what.

92
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,699
If you want, I'll help you
make your own trajectory.

93
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,334
It can be our project.

94
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:59,604
- Sounds great.

95
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:34,726
- Dispatch,
this is unit 5-9.

96
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:36,728
We are 12 blocks out.
We're on it.

97
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:38,162
- On it?
- We're on it.

98
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,497
- Look at this parking lot.

99
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:41,298
We're not going anywhere
in this mess.

100
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,133
- Oh, you're right.

101
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,370
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna hoof it.

102
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,071
- You're crazy.
We're 12 blocks away.

103
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:48,873
You'll never make it.

104
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,909
- Hesam, I grew up out here.
There's always a shortcut.

105
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:51,268
- Hi.
I'm here to save you.

106
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:57,557
- Roomie.

107
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,593
Hey, Claire.

108
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:04,197
Hey. Hi.

109
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,700
- Sorry.

110
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:09,269
- I'm so excited.

111
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:10,470
You know,
if you pass this test,

112
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:12,572
Then we're gonna be
in class together.

113
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:14,675
You and I are gonna keep
each other on our tippy toes.

114
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,343
But, um...

115
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,178
Please don't think of this
as a competition, okay?

116
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,613
This is about sisterhood.

117
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:22,482
- Yay. Sisterhood.

118
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,317
- Okay.

119
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:27,655
This is a placement test
for linear algebra 170.

120
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:29,790
35 of you geniuses
will be lucky enough

121
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:31,025
To get in this class.

122
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:34,327
The rest,
you can try next semester.

123
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:36,664
You each have
45 minutes

124
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:40,968
To solve this equation.

125
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:45,272
Please show your work.

126
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,280
Is this a joke?

127
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:56,216
- I know, it's so easy.

128
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:59,352
Are you sweating?

129
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,754
- No.

130
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:02,622
No, it's just a little hot
in here.

131
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:41,995
- Where are you going?

132
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:45,032
- This class isn't for me.

133
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,607
- There he is.

134
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:57,577
So that pregnant woman?
- Uh-Huh?

135
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,312
- Heard she delivered twins.

136
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,748
Named them both Peter.

137
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:05,219
- The pregnant woman's name
is kristy.

138
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:07,287
And she had twin girls.
Thank you.

139
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:08,655
Named them haylie and katie.

140
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,758
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

141
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,159
Hey, they're still up
in neonatal.

142
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:13,560
You know,
you should stop by.

143
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:14,728
They'd like to thank you
in person.

144
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:18,732
- I'm good.

145
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:25,973
What?

146
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,841
- You single-Handedly saved
three lives.

147
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,677
If it was me, I'd be floating
on cloud nine right now.

148
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,412
- I am.

149
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,581
- Well, you could have
fooled me.

150
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:37,985
What's going on with you?

151
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:39,486
- If I would have showed up
30 seconds later,

152
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:42,622
That woman, her babies--
They'd be dead.

153
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,324
It's too close, man.

154
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,625
I've gotta be faster.

155
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,262
- Dude, you got there faster
than humanly possible.

156
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,664
If I was a religious man,
I'd think it was a miracle.

157
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:54,268
- A miracle?

158
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:55,735
Catch you tomorrow.

159
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:57,004
- Well, hang on.
Where are you going?

160
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,873
- Took on a shift.
- We just got off a double.

161
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,474
- Yeah, I know,
but james is sick.

162
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:02,843
I figured I'd cover for him.

163
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:04,311
- Too late,
jackson's already covering.

164
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:08,415
Dude, there's a life
outside this place.

165
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:09,950
Now me and some of the guys
are going out,

166
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:12,419
Houlihan's still open,
come with us.

167
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:13,821
- I'm good, man.
I'll see you tomorrow.

168
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:16,356
Have fun.

169
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:18,992
See you tomorrow.

170
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:05,865
- I take it you've seen
the paper this morning.

171
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:09,836
All four worked in building 26,
danko's men.

172
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:12,072
These are revenge killings.

173
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,507
And we both know
it's Tracy Strauss.

174
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:15,708
- I'm sure it won't be long

175
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:17,411
Before she makes her way
up that list to me.

176
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,012
- Or Nathan.

177
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,447
Which is exactly why
you're gonna stop

178
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:22,115
Dragging your feet
and pull the trigger

179
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,151
On this operation.

180
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:26,853
It's been six weeks, noah.

181
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:29,489
I've given you time to put
your personal life in order.

182
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:32,326
And Nathan says
you're avoiding his phone calls.

183
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:34,194
- By Nathan, you mean sylar,
right?

184
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:36,863
- We've been over this, noah.

185
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:38,665
It's all working exactly
as planned.

186
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:41,101
- As planned?
What plan?

187
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,470
- We had no other choice.

188
00:15:43,537 --> 00:15:45,805
Matt Parkman had to turn sylar
into Nathan,

189
00:15:45,873 --> 00:15:47,874
And as I recall,
you were in on it.

190
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:49,809
- I made an emotional decision

191
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,044
Because I didn't want
to see you lose your son,

192
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:52,446
But it was wrong.

193
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:53,913
For 50 years,

194
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:55,949
The company avoided emotions
for good reason.

195
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,684
I can barely look him
in the eye

196
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:58,852
Knowing who's under
that skin.

197
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,220
- Then don't.

198
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:04,391
Just do your job to get
the company up and running.

199
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:08,561
You're supposed to be the man
with the plan, remember?

200
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,930
- I'm not sure I'm that guy
anymore.

201
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,132
- Why is that?

202
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,735
- Because I've lost my family,
angela.

203
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:16,903
If you'll excuse me,

204
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:18,438
Today is Claire's first day
of college

205
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:20,474
And I'm already late, which
doesn't help the situation.

206
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,571
Danko.

207
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:58,908
- It appears Tracy Strauss
just paid you a visit.

208
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:02,244
What I can't figure out
is how she survived.

209
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:05,047
I put a bullet
in her myself.

210
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:07,149
She shattered into
a thousand pieces of ice.

211
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:10,853
- Ice melts.

212
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:13,656
I'm gonna take a wild guess...

213
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,525
That your being here
isn't a coincidence.

214
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:19,061
- I'm here...

215
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:23,366
To offer a solution
to our mutual problem.

216
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:28,270
You and I kill Tracy Strauss
before she kills us.

217
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:31,441
- Last time I made a deal
with you,

218
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:34,176
You tried to stab me
with a syringe.

219
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:35,778
- Fair enough.

220
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:38,414
- I'm thinking you're next
on her list.

221
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,982
- That makes us both
wanted men.

222
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,183
- So what are you doing here?

223
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:43,219
You ought to be hiding
under a rock somewhere.

224
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,221
- Just because the government
stopped hunting these people

225
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,556
Doesn't mean I have.

226
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:48,023
I hear you and the petrellis,

227
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:51,661
You're going back into business
to do just that.

228
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:52,895
- No, you heard wrong.

229
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,163
I'm not in that business
anymore.

230
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:55,365
I'm changing careers.

231
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:57,299
- What did you do,
grow a conscience?

232
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:59,836
- Time to cash out.

233
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:01,070
Start over.

234
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:03,506
- Guys like us...

235
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:05,875
We don't start over.

236
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:08,244
- I'm not like you.

237
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,079
- She's coming back for you.

238
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:13,449
You know that, right?

239
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:16,118
I guess you're on your own.

240
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:18,755
- I guess I am.

241
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:43,112
- No, thank you.

242
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:44,514
- You made the right call.

243
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,115
Cheerleaders are
a very subversive group.

244
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,817
You don't wanna mix
with that crowd.

245
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,585
- No, thanks.

246
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,120
I used to be one of them.

247
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,622
- Oh, so you know.

248
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:56,158
- I do.
Um, were you?

249
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,894
You weren't a cheerleader,
were you?

250
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,229
- Um, no.

251
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:04,199
I--I tried out,
but I didn't make the team.

252
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,969
They said that my cheers
sounded more like taunts.

253
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:11,641
- Yeah, that's not good.

254
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,676
- Uh, I'm gretchen berg.
Who are you?

255
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:16,345
- I'm Claire Bennet.
- Oh, hi, Claire Bennet.

256
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,180
So where are you from?

257
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:19,749
- Kind of all over the place.

258
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,717
Uh, been in southern California
for a while,

259
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,986
But Texas originally,
Odessa.

260
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:25,287
- Really?
- Mm-Hmm.

261
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:27,657
- I'm from Austin.
- Oh, small world.

262
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:30,292
- Wait, you're not that
Claire Bennet, are you?

263
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,663
- Which Claire Bennet
would that be?

264
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,733
- Murder at Union wells
in odessa Claire Bennet.

265
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,536
- You heard about that?

266
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:42,438
- A cheerleader in texas
gets her head sawed off

267
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:43,606
At the homecoming game?

268
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:47,309
Yeah, I've heard about that.

269
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:49,812
- You know, I kind of
want to keep the whole

270
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,648
Murder at Union wells
on the D-L.

271
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:53,816
- No kidding.

272
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,118
I mean, if I were you,
I would change my name.

273
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:58,053
Like now.

274
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,055
They'd probably let you
do it over the phone.

275
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,657
- No, they won't.
I would know.

276
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,593
I changed my name
for a while.

277
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,462
- Oh. Why did you
change it back?

278
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,998
- 'Cause I wanted to be
Claire Bennet again.

279
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:11,300
I thought people might forget.

280
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:14,670
- No, girl.
Google's your enemy.

281
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:18,340
- I, uh, I have to take care
of something.

282
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:19,509
Nice to meet you.

283
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:22,011
- You too.

284
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,488
- What have you done to me,
mom?

285
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:42,391
Took me a half hour
to get here.

286
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:45,661
I'm sorry.
Where are my manners?

287
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:50,666
You look lovely as usual.

288
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:03,913
- Miss Petrelli, we're here.

289
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:06,082
- Thank you, alfred.

290
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:17,860
- What have you done to me?

291
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:20,997
Took me a half an hour
to get here.

292
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,599
I'm sorry.
Where are my manners?

293
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,902
You look lovely.

294
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,841
As usual.

295
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:37,880
You okay, mom?

296
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:41,651
- Yeah.

297
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:42,918
I'm just, um--

298
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:45,254
I'm worried about the company,
that's all.

299
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,790
I'm worried that noah
might be wavering.

300
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:50,059
He's been very distracted
lately.

301
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:54,864
- I'll talk to him,
don't worry.

302
00:23:54,931 --> 00:23:58,233
Do I like sushi?

303
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:59,969
- You're the one who had
a craving for yellowtail.

304
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:02,571
I wanted italian.

305
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:10,279
- It's interesting.

306
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:12,614
- Life.
It's all about new horizons.

307
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:14,083
It keeps you
from getting stale.

308
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:15,818
- Exactly.

309
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:18,187
You know,
these last couple of weeks

310
00:24:18,254 --> 00:24:21,523
I've been taking stock
of a lot of things.

311
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:25,161
I feel like there's
a lot of...

312
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:27,797
I don't know, mom.

313
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:30,132
Guess there's a lot of change
going on with me.

314
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,034
- Really?
- Yeah.

315
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:34,403
- How so?
- I don't know.

316
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,938
It's like when I look back
on my life,

317
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:39,474
It just seems like it's not
my life I'm looking back on.

318
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:44,279
Does that make any sense?

319
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:46,148
- Self-Reflection.

320
00:24:46,216 --> 00:24:47,817
Happens when you hit 40,

321
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:50,953
Along with all sorts of
other unpleasant surprises.

322
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,487
- I'm being serious, mom.

323
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:56,826
Look at the person I've been,
the kind of father.

324
00:24:56,893 --> 00:25:00,562
The kind of brother.

325
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,997
The kind of son to you.

326
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:05,935
- You've been just fine
under the circumstances.

327
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:07,103
- No.

328
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,072
I have been a jackass.

329
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,507
But I'm gonna change
all that.

330
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:15,444
I'm gonna reconnect
with everybody in my life

331
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:18,447
Who's important,
and this time,

332
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:23,786
I'm gonna be a better me.

333
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:25,821
- Okay, Nathan.

334
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:29,591
You have a big, important,
stressful life.

335
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:31,493
And it's bound
to get confusing.

336
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:34,463
And a man your age starts
to feel his own mortality.

337
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,766
- That's just it.

338
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:40,236
I don't feel mortal.

339
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:42,872
I feel invincible.

340
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,141
- It's midlife crisis.
That's all this is.

341
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,209
Here's my suggestion.

342
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:51,580
You go out and you get yourself
a big expensive sports car

343
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:54,349
And a younger woman
with questionable morals.

344
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:58,053
That's what your father did,
and it worked for him.

345
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:08,297
What would I be without you?

346
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:15,171
- I'm gonna get
the phone, okay?

347
00:26:18,474 --> 00:26:19,641
Yeah.

348
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:20,709
- Detective Parkman.

349
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,211
Angela Petrelli.

350
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,446
- I told you never to call me.

351
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:26,515
- We have a problem.

352
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:28,517
- What kind of problem?

353
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:30,419
- That thing you did
six weeks ago.

354
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:31,887
- You mean when you and Bennet
strong-Armed me

355
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:34,089
Into playing god,
that thing?

356
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:37,827
- I think sylar's beginning
to emerge again.

357
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:39,561
- That's because he is
sylar.

358
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:40,729
- No, you made sylar go away

359
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:42,597
When you turned him
into my son.

360
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,066
I saw you do it.

361
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:45,801
- Okay, then why the hell
are you calling me?

362
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,036
- Because you need to fix it.

363
00:26:47,103 --> 00:26:48,670
You need to patch it up,
upgrade it,

364
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:49,839
Whatever it is you do.

365
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:51,440
- How exactly?

366
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:54,276
- You go back into his mind
and erase his memory again.

367
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:55,444
That's what you do.

368
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:58,214
- No, not anymore.
I stopped.

369
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,548
Look, ever since that day,

370
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:00,816
I have felt like something
got inside of me

371
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:02,218
And I can't get it out.

372
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:06,655
I started seeing things
and I--I've stopped, okay?

373
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:07,957
I'm done. I'm out.

374
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:10,893
- There's no such thing
as out, detective.

375
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:12,261
Not for people like us.

376
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:14,029
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

377
00:27:14,097 --> 00:27:16,098
- I'm telling you, sylar
could emerge at any minute.

378
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,566
Are you telling me
you are not willing

379
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:18,834
To fix our problem?

380
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:22,071
- This is not our problem.
This is your problem.

381
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:24,907
So...

382
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:26,342
Good luck with it.

383
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:29,784
- And honestly,
I'm sure she could be

384
00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:34,523
A really above-Average student
if she just applied herself.

385
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,324
- Claire.

386
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:37,925
- Hey, you made it.

387
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:39,961
- Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.

388
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:43,532
I was having a little problem
with my car.

389
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,002
And annie was just, um,
catching me up.

390
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,204
- Oh, she was?

391
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:51,139
- So I'll see you at
the mixer tonight.

392
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,408
<i>I hear they have guitar hero 3
set up down there.</i>

393
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:55,910
<i>And well, I sort of
excel at guitar hero 3,</i>

394
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,213
So, um,
consider yourself served.

395
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:00,014
It was very nice to meet you,
mr. Bennet.

396
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:01,849
- You too.

397
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:07,088
- So annie was catching you up.

398
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:10,525
- Maybe you can, uh, take that
algebra class next semester.

399
00:29:10,593 --> 00:29:13,528
- But see, that is probably

400
00:29:13,596 --> 00:29:15,697
The least interesting part
of my day.

401
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:17,399
- How so?

402
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,634
- I was recognized
as a survivor

403
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:22,304
Of the homecoming massacre
back in odessa.

404
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:23,371
Well, my name was.

405
00:29:23,439 --> 00:29:24,972
- I'm sorry.

406
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,675
You know,
maybe changing your name

407
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:28,343
Back to Bennet wasn't
such a great idea after all,

408
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:30,212
But they say college
is for reinventing yourself.

409
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,715
- I don't want to pretend
to be anyone but me.

410
00:29:33,782 --> 00:29:37,185
I just wanna be Claire Bennet,
daughter of noah Bennet.

411
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,161
You know, annie asked me today
what my dad did for a living.

412
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,963
And I actually told her
the truth.

413
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:50,732
Ish.

414
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,835
I told her you worked
for the government, but still.

415
00:29:53,902 --> 00:29:56,871
And I like telling the truth.

416
00:29:56,939 --> 00:30:01,276
What if my way
of reinventing myself

417
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:04,045
Is by telling the truth?

418
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:06,080
- Ish.
- Ish.

419
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:08,182
- Maybe not the whole truth.
- The whole truth.

420
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:12,454
- No.
Just be careful, sweetheart.

421
00:30:43,185 --> 00:30:46,087
- All right, lydia.

422
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:50,191
Show me who he is.

423
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:08,910
- His name is danko.

424
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:12,480
Emile danko.

425
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:18,753
- You wanted to see me, sam.

426
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:22,890
- I have a favor
to ask of you, edgar.

427
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,826
- Can't you send
someone else this time?

428
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:27,829
- I'd take it as a compliment
to your unique skills.

429
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:31,098
- Well, what you said
this morning

430
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:34,803
About redemption--
I'm hoping that's possible.

431
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,038
All of this.

432
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:41,209
- Yes, well, I left out the part
about vengeance.

433
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:44,212
That's where he comes in.

434
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:51,319
- But I've only killed
when I've absolutely had to.

435
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:55,056
- The line's been crossed.

436
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,358
They crossed it, not us.

437
00:31:56,425 --> 00:32:00,595
I need you to go to him,
get the compass back,

438
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,464
And the kill
the son of a bitch.

439
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,699
That's what joseph
would have wanted.

440
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:09,704
- Well, joseph's
not here anymore.

441
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:39,200
- I'm sorry.

442
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:42,236
I won't ask you again
after this one.

443
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:46,073
I promise.

444
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:10,031
- And here I was thinking
that I'd be the one

445
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,733
That got away.

446
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:13,501
- No.

447
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:15,603
You're just number five.

448
00:33:15,671 --> 00:33:16,905
- You know,
five's my lucky number.

449
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:19,974
- Mm.
- Or it used to be.

450
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,142
Is it still lucky?

451
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:26,213
- I haven't decided yet.

452
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,115
- I saw you break into
a thousand pieces,

453
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:29,317
And yet here you are.

454
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,718
That is a neat trick.

455
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:34,388
- It wasn't a trick.

456
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:41,395
I felt myself shatter.

457
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:44,298
Melting...

458
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:47,569
And then all those pieces of me
came floating back together

459
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:51,506
With one cohesive thought.

460
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:53,074
Killing all of you.

461
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:55,777
- Okay, now see, that's
the part that I don't get.

462
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:58,112
Because I don't think
that you're really a killer.

463
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,213
That's not who you are.

464
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:01,549
- No, that's all I am.

465
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:05,553
You took the rest
away from me.

466
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:12,393
- I can help you get
your life back.

467
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:13,761
- How? Danko said
that he wouldn't stop

468
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:14,929
Until I was killed.

469
00:34:14,997 --> 00:34:16,931
- What if I could make it
so that danko

470
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:19,333
Wasn't interested in you
anymore?

471
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:24,572
- Why do you want to do this
for me?

472
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,340
- 20 years of bagging
and tagging

473
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:28,743
And I never helped...

474
00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:32,547
A single one of you.

475
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:35,316
Maybe we're both looking
for redemption.

476
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:40,788
What do you say?

477
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:42,957
Is it a deal?

478
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,160
- Mm.

479
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:48,162
I bet you wish
it was that easy.

480
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,714
- I got your phone call.

481
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:09,584
Change your mind about
Tracy Strauss?

482
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:11,185
- No.

483
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:13,421
I came here to change yours.

484
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:17,058
- Sorry.
I'm gonna kill her.

485
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:21,429
Even if I have to suck her up
in a wet vac to do it.

486
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,798
She murdered four of my men.

487
00:35:23,866 --> 00:35:25,033
She's a killer.

488
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,070
- I'm recommending that
you let this thing go.

489
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:31,272
You said guys like us
never start over.

490
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:36,010
I'm offering you a chance
to do just that.

491
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:37,879
Consider it
a permanent vacation

492
00:35:37,947 --> 00:35:39,647
Courtesy of the u.S. Government.

493
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:41,683
- Not interested.

494
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,019
- Not acceptable.

495
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:48,890
I want you to forget about
Tracy Strauss.

496
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:53,461
- Well...
we all want things, Bennet.

497
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:55,396
- And I'm gonna get
what I want.

498
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:30,732
- Hey, this is Peter.
Leave a message.

499
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:33,101
Get back to you
when I can. Thanks.

500
00:36:33,168 --> 00:36:35,803
- Look, I've left you--

501
00:36:35,871 --> 00:36:37,772
I've left you three messages.

502
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,108
You need to call me back.

503
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:41,275
Something's happening to me

504
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:42,576
And I think you're
the only person

505
00:36:42,645 --> 00:36:44,578
Who's gonna understand
what it is.

506
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:47,148
It's, uh...

507
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:50,051
Just call me.

508
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:53,387
Please.

509
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:25,019
- Who the hell are you?

510
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:28,622
- You know exactly who I am.

511
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:31,893
- They sent you
to get it back.

512
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,667
- He made you forget.

513
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:42,603
- What did you say?

514
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,113
- It's not worth it.

515
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:57,685
- Who are you?

516
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,486
- You took something from us.

517
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:00,688
Now I'm gonna get it back.

518
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:01,956
- You're never gonna find it.

519
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:03,557
- Oh?

520
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,059
I think I will.

521
00:39:20,577 --> 00:39:22,045
- Hey.
- Hi.

522
00:39:22,113 --> 00:39:23,646
Uh...

523
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:26,582
I'm sorry if I freaked you out
with that whole, uh,

524
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,917
Murder at Union wells thing.

525
00:39:27,985 --> 00:39:30,553
I just--It was so scandalous
and I got excited.

526
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,022
- No. No, no, no.
Don't apologize.

527
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:34,357
It was just weird
talking about it

528
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:37,027
Because I was never allowed
to talk about it before.

529
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:39,996
- So what, you pretended like
it didn't happen?

530
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:43,066
- No, I just kept trying
to start my life over

531
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:45,035
And I thought I could take
what I liked about

532
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:48,671
Who I was and leave
all the other stuff behind.

533
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:50,140
- Whoo! Yeah!

534
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:53,209
<i>That is how you play
guitar hero.</i>

535
00:39:53,277 --> 00:39:55,178
Claire!
Hey, come on, over here!

536
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:57,280
You and me.

537
00:39:57,348 --> 00:39:59,516
You have been served.
Come on!

538
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,484
- Who is she?

539
00:40:01,552 --> 00:40:03,219
She's horrible.

540
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:05,321
She's been hogging the thing
all night.

541
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:07,057
- That would be my roommate.

542
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:08,724
- Come on, we're up.

543
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,898
- I was gonna play
with gretchen.

544
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:17,767
- Does gretchen know how
to play?

545
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:20,336
- No, but gretchen
doesn't care.

546
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,606
- Your opponent's supposed
to raise your game,

547
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:25,007
Not lower it.

548
00:40:25,076 --> 00:40:28,478
- Well, since neither one of us
know what we're doing,

549
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:31,414
We'll be
on even playing fields.

550
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:34,317
This is gonna be
really bad.

551
00:40:39,557 --> 00:40:43,193
Oh, I got one.

552
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,895
Yellow.

553
00:40:45,963 --> 00:40:47,863
Yes. Yes!
- Oh, no.

554
00:40:51,835 --> 00:40:54,070
- I must be getting better
every second.

555
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:30,573
- Hiro. Hiro.

556
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:32,708
Hiro! Hiro, hiro.

557
00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:47,042
- Hiro.

558
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:49,011
Hiro.
Hiro!

559
00:44:05,028 --> 00:44:07,897
- Hiro.

560
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:09,499
Hiro!

561
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:38,828
- Who is he?

562
00:44:38,895 --> 00:44:42,231
- His name is hiro.
Hiro nakamura.

563
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:44,701
And he was here
at the carnival.

564
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,102
- When? How long ago?

565
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,540
- 14 years.

566
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:53,843
- Thank you, lydia.

567
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,911
That's all for now.

568
00:45:05,922 --> 00:45:08,891
- Are we really going
to stop moving

569
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:13,563
After all these years?

570
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,500
- It's time.
Yes.

571
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:23,573
Listen...

572
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,041
I know you're weak.

573
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:28,745
But I need you to try
and do it one more time.

574
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:31,681
For me.

575
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:36,118
I think we found someone
who can help us fix the past.

576
00:45:36,186 --> 00:45:38,755
- That's good news, samuel.

577
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,222
- Yes.

578
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,924
So...

579
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:44,427
I need you to send me back.

580
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:46,095
- How far?

581
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:48,964
- 14 years.

582
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:58,274
- Hey, I didn't see you
leave the party.

583
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:03,078
Guess you're still there.

584
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:05,247
And you
left the windows open.

585
00:46:29,105 --> 00:46:30,940
- Ah.

586
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,271
- Matty.

587
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:03,673
Matty!

588
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:24,527
Matty.

589
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:28,230
Matty, are you hiding again?

590
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:30,867
Where's matty?

591
00:47:33,837 --> 00:47:39,709
- Hi, daddy.

592
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:46,181
I want my body back.

593
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,148
- You put him down.
Please.

594
00:47:51,216 --> 00:47:53,050
- Oh, poor daddy.

595
00:47:53,118 --> 00:47:56,019
He looks pretty scared,
huh?

596
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:59,089
Can you say
"freaking out"?

597
00:47:59,157 --> 00:48:01,191
- I don't--
I don't understand.

598
00:48:01,259 --> 00:48:03,693
How are you even here?

599
00:48:03,762 --> 00:48:06,596
- I'm part of you, Matt.

600
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:08,431
Whatever you did to me,
I held on,

601
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:09,733
And now I'm inside
your head.

602
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:11,969
- So you're not real?

603
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:16,439
- Then how could I be holding
your little boy?

604
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:18,842
- Just put him down.

605
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:23,280
Not until you give me
what I want.

606
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:26,283
You did something to me,
to my mind.

607
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,318
That's why I'm here.

608
00:48:28,386 --> 00:48:30,520
Tell me what you did.
What did you put in my body?

609
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:33,056
- Okay, just put him down
and then we'll talk about this.

610
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:34,124
- Tell me.

611
00:48:34,192 --> 00:48:36,760
- Matt?

612
00:48:36,828 --> 00:48:39,930
- Here comes mommy.

613
00:48:39,998 --> 00:48:41,064
Catch.

614
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:42,132
- No!

615
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,771
- Matt, are you okay?

616
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,373
- Yeah.

617
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:54,011
I thought I heard him crying,
that's all.

618
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:56,379
- Matt, he's fast asleep.

619
00:48:57,882 --> 00:49:00,350
- What's going on
with you?

620
00:49:00,418 --> 00:49:02,186
- I'm just tired,
I guess.

621
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:04,855
- Come back to bed.

622
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:56,974
- Hello?

623
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:59,176
- I must have dialed
the wrong number.

624
00:49:59,244 --> 00:50:03,313
- Who were you
looking for?

625
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:05,715
- Sandra...

626
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:06,917
Bennet.

627
00:50:06,985 --> 00:50:09,052
- Yeah, she's here.

628
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,387
Hang on.

629
00:50:10,454 --> 00:50:12,956
Sandra!

630
00:50:13,024 --> 00:50:14,391
- Hello?

631
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,027
Hello?

632
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:27,804
- Sandra?

633
00:50:27,872 --> 00:50:31,275
- No. No, this is Tracy.

634
00:51:02,173 --> 00:51:04,174
- I didn't do it.

635
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:43,840
- What have you got to lose,
hiro?

636
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:47,677
- Do I know you?

637
00:52:49,713 --> 00:52:52,516
- The name's samuel,

638
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,919
And I think we're gonna be
great friends.

639
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:08,145
- Did your roommate express
any suicidal thoughts,

640
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:11,148
Feelings
of being overwhelmed,

641
00:53:11,215 --> 00:53:13,817
Low self-esteem?

642
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:16,219
- No.

643
00:53:16,288 --> 00:53:18,522
No, if anything, she had
too much self-Esteem.

644
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,157
She was an overachiever.

645
00:53:20,224 --> 00:53:22,559
She loved herself.

646
00:53:22,627 --> 00:53:24,395
- That's not the impression
she left in her suicide note.

647
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:26,730
- What suicide note?

648
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,367
- This was on her pillow.

649
00:53:30,435 --> 00:53:32,269
- No, it wasn't.

650
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:33,437
- It may have been
something you overlooked.

651
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:36,740
- No, I distinctly remember
being impressed

652
00:53:36,808 --> 00:53:38,275
With how crisp
her pillowcase was

653
00:53:38,343 --> 00:53:40,377
And that there wasn't
a suicide note.

654
00:53:40,445 --> 00:53:41,779
This wasn't there.

655
00:53:44,148 --> 00:53:47,551
- Would you get them
out of here?

656
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:50,421
You said she was
an overachiever?

657
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:52,956
- Look, even an overachiever
can't write a suicide note

658
00:53:53,024 --> 00:53:54,224
After she's dead.

659
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:56,960
She wouldn't do this.

660
00:53:57,028 --> 00:53:59,930
<i>She was just beating the entire
floor's butt at guitar hero.</i>

661
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:02,333
This was not a suicide.

662
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,869
- What, then?
Murder?

663
00:54:05,937 --> 00:54:07,871
Why would someone
want to murder your roommate?

664
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:10,641
- I don't know.
Isn't that your job?

665
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:12,643
- Yep, it sure is.

666
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:15,879
Thanks for your help,
miss Bennet.

667
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:20,878
- So you're
a time traveler?

668
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:23,346
- Yes.
How did you know that?

669
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:27,684
- I have a gift, hiro.

670
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:29,686
Just like you.

671
00:55:29,754 --> 00:55:32,055
- Oh.

672
00:55:33,825 --> 00:55:35,258
What are you doing here?

673
00:55:35,326 --> 00:55:37,160
I'm thinking it has
something to do

674
00:55:37,228 --> 00:55:38,929
With that young man.

675
00:55:38,996 --> 00:55:42,633
Is he you?

676
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,403
- Yes, but I cannot interfere.
- Why not?

677
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:48,104
- Because this is where
it starts,

678
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:50,941
How I become the master
of time and space.

679
00:55:51,008 --> 00:55:54,311
If I interfere,
I will never become a hero.

680
00:55:54,378 --> 00:55:56,012
I won't save
the cheerleader,

681
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,448
And new york will explode.

682
00:55:57,515 --> 00:55:58,749
It's the butterfly effect.

683
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:01,618
- Hmm.
That would be bad.

684
00:56:03,588 --> 00:56:06,122
- [Shouts in japanese]

685
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:10,093
- But I bet
there's some butterflies

686
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:12,028
That you could change.

687
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:14,297
I mean, why not
make this trip worthwhile?

688
00:56:14,365 --> 00:56:16,567
- No, you can never
change the past.

689
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:18,268
It's bad, always.

690
00:56:18,336 --> 00:56:19,703
Everything is connected.

691
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:21,004
- Not everything.

692
00:56:21,072 --> 00:56:23,941
Sometimes, if you want
to change one thing,

693
00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:25,342
That's all you do.

694
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:27,911
Change one thing.

695
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:36,553
You have a rare gift,
hiro,

696
00:56:36,621 --> 00:56:39,389
To right the wrongs
of your life.

697
00:56:39,457 --> 00:56:43,660
Isn't there anything else
you'd care to fix?

698
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:45,829
- The slushy incident!

699
00:56:45,897 --> 00:56:48,565
That was all my fault.

700
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:51,067
I bumped into ando
and made him spill his drink

701
00:56:51,135 --> 00:56:52,636
All over kimiko's
favorite dress.

702
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:55,606
That is the reason why
she started to hate him.

703
00:56:55,673 --> 00:56:59,009
- Now's your chance
to make them happy.

704
00:56:59,076 --> 00:57:01,311
You have the power.

705
00:57:01,379 --> 00:57:06,750
- No. I have a code
to never change the--Aah!

706
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:08,418
- There are things in this world
that are wrong, hiro.

707
00:57:08,486 --> 00:57:09,753
You can make them right.

708
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:11,187
If you master these skills,

709
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:12,856
You and I will have
a bright future together.

710
00:57:12,924 --> 00:57:14,024
- You and me?
I don't understand.

711
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:15,993
- You just need
to take a chance.

712
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,187
- Danko and I, we were just
talking in the hall.

713
00:58:51,255 --> 00:58:53,023
The next thing I know,
he's dead,

714
00:58:53,091 --> 00:58:54,791
And this guy is on me.

715
00:58:54,859 --> 00:58:56,093
I got lucky.

716
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,427
I mean,
this whole water thing,

717
00:58:57,495 --> 00:58:58,495
It just--It kicked in
on instinct.

718
00:58:58,562 --> 00:59:00,697
- What are you doing here,
Tracy?

719
00:59:00,765 --> 00:59:02,866
I wanted you
to leave danko to me.

720
00:59:02,934 --> 00:59:04,234
- I couldn't just
let it go.

721
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:07,504
I didn't know if I could
trust you to deal with him.

722
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:09,773
This is my life.

723
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:12,308
I needed to know.

724
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:16,079
When I got here, I saw that
you did what you promised.

725
00:59:16,147 --> 00:59:17,814
He didn't know me...

726
00:59:20,584 --> 00:59:23,954
So I figured,
just live and let live.

727
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:25,822
And as I was leaving,
this guy--

728
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,858
- The guy with the knives?

729
00:59:27,925 --> 00:59:29,993
- He was fast.

730
00:59:30,061 --> 00:59:31,227
Scary fast.

731
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:32,896
Definitely one of us.

732
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,399
One of me.

733
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:40,671
- You have no idea why
he'd want to kill danko?

734
00:59:40,738 --> 00:59:43,073
- I think I heard him say
he was looking for something.

735
00:59:43,141 --> 00:59:45,709
I don't know.
Maybe it was revenge.

736
00:59:45,777 --> 00:59:47,778
Danko made
a lot of enemies.

737
00:59:47,845 --> 00:59:49,880
- This wasn't revenge.

738
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:51,381
Look at the wounds.

739
00:59:51,448 --> 00:59:53,817
They were all
to the stomach.

740
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:55,952
If it were me, and I was
looking for revenge,

741
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,453
I'd go for the jugular

742
00:59:57,521 --> 01:00:01,758
Or the carotid artery
or the heart.

743
01:00:01,826 --> 01:00:06,963
No, I think
you heard right.

744
01:00:07,031 --> 01:00:10,667
I think the killer
was looking for something.

745
01:00:10,735 --> 01:00:12,002
- That's personal.

746
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:15,271
- And I think
I found it.

747
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:19,009
- What is that?

748
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:20,711
- A key.

749
01:00:20,778 --> 01:00:22,245
- To what?

750
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,751
- That's a good question.

751
01:00:40,454 --> 01:00:42,088
- Come on, matty-Man,
you can do it.

752
01:00:42,156 --> 01:00:43,656
Show me
you're a big boy.

753
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,524
Oh! Oh, look at you!
- Did you see that?

754
01:00:45,592 --> 01:00:48,027
- All right.
- Good job. I got him.

755
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:50,163
I got him.
Good job, dude.

756
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,464
God, he usually takes
so much longer

757
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:52,665
To warm up to strangers.

758
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:53,933
- Oh, Roy's not a stranger.

759
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:54,934
He's been delivering
water to us

760
01:00:55,002 --> 01:00:56,235
Since matty was born.

761
01:00:56,303 --> 01:00:57,770
- I can't believe
it's been that long.

762
01:00:57,838 --> 01:00:59,839
Time flies, huh, janice?
- Yeah.

763
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,407
- Yeah, it sure does.

764
01:01:01,475 --> 01:01:03,142
Whoa!

765
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,011
- Listen, the heating unit
on your cooler is busted.

766
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,112
I'll swing by later
to fix it.

767
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,880
- Thanks, Roy.

768
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:09,715
- Yeah. Thanks, Roy.

769
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,351
- No problem.
- Bye.

770
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,618
- Bye.

771
01:01:14,788 --> 01:01:15,989
- What?

772
01:01:16,056 --> 01:01:17,623
- Janice?

773
01:01:17,691 --> 01:01:18,858
- That's my name.

774
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,093
- No, your name
is mrs. Parkman.

775
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,194
Look, when I
delivered water,

776
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,695
We were professional.

777
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,030
- You never
delivered water.

778
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:25,031
- Pizza, water, whatever.
That's not the point.

779
01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:27,500
The point is...

780
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:28,968
[Sighs]

781
01:01:29,036 --> 01:01:32,005
He was here, I wasn't,
and I'm just a little pissed.

782
01:01:32,072 --> 01:01:36,509
- I thought
we were past that.

783
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:38,744
- Yeah.

784
01:01:38,812 --> 01:01:42,215
Yeah, we are.
I'm sorry.

785
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:45,284
- Hey, you're tired.

786
01:01:45,352 --> 01:01:47,620
You haven't been
sleeping properly.

787
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:50,156
- Well, I've been snoring
a lot less, so...

788
01:01:50,224 --> 01:01:52,425
- I'm worried about you.

789
01:01:52,493 --> 01:01:54,160
- It's just work.

790
01:01:54,228 --> 01:01:56,529
I--I got a lead
on this huge drug ring,

791
01:01:56,596 --> 01:01:58,297
And all I need is the name
of the supplier.

792
01:01:58,365 --> 01:02:01,700
- And if you could
read a few minds,

793
01:02:01,768 --> 01:02:03,002
- Yeah, but I told you, I'm not
yodoing that anymore, right?

794
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:04,570
I kicked that for good.

795
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,540
- I know,
and I'm proud of you.

796
01:02:07,607 --> 01:02:09,808
I'm just worried
that it's taking a toll.

797
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:11,077
- Don't worry.

798
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:14,047
- I-I got this
under control.

799
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:35,068
- Hello, Peter.

800
01:02:35,135 --> 01:02:37,203
Can we talk
for a minute?

801
01:02:39,606 --> 01:02:41,441
- Can I get you
something to drink?

802
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,142
- Yeah, thanks.

803
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,710
Love what you've done
with the place.

804
01:02:44,778 --> 01:02:46,212
- Thank you.

805
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:50,283
So I have water
or mustard.

806
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:54,620
- Water is good.

807
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,389
So what have you
been up to?

808
01:02:56,457 --> 01:02:58,857
- I got my old job back.

809
01:02:58,925 --> 01:02:59,959
Paramedic.

810
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,294
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

811
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,595
- It must be
keeping you busy.

812
01:03:02,662 --> 01:03:05,998
Your mother says she hasn't
seen you in weeks.

813
01:03:06,066 --> 01:03:09,935
Wow, this is amazing.
Is this all you?

814
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:11,104
- Mm-Hmm.

815
01:03:11,171 --> 01:03:12,771
- Are you using powers?

816
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:15,441
- Well, in my line of work,
it helps to be, uh...

817
01:03:15,509 --> 01:03:17,410
Strong, agile.

818
01:03:17,478 --> 01:03:19,312
- Incident,
23rd and--

819
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,981
- Thank you, dr. Suresh.

820
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:25,318
It's a pretty
convenient power.

821
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:26,919
- Good for you.

822
01:03:26,987 --> 01:03:28,454
- I figure one of us has got to
make up for all we've done.

823
01:03:28,522 --> 01:03:30,156
- Meaning--

824
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:33,359
- You, me, my family,
the company.

825
01:03:33,427 --> 01:03:35,928
Come on, we haven't exactly
been model citizens, noah.

826
01:03:35,996 --> 01:03:38,964
- It's a pretty heavy burden
for one guy.

827
01:03:39,032 --> 01:03:42,101
- You said
you wanted to talk.

828
01:03:42,169 --> 01:03:45,171
- Yeah.

829
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:46,672
Danko's dead.

830
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:51,144
Killed because of this.

831
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:52,545
- A key?

832
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:53,746
- I did some research.

833
01:03:53,813 --> 01:03:55,281
This key opens
a safe deposit box

834
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:56,749
In a downtown bank.

835
01:03:56,816 --> 01:03:58,217
Now the way I figure it,

836
01:03:58,285 --> 01:04:00,919
The guy that killed danko
is probably just waiting

837
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:03,022
For whoever shows up
with this key.

838
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,691
I need a partner on this,
somebody I can trust.

839
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,394
He could jump me
just about anywhere,

840
01:04:08,462 --> 01:04:09,995
And I'd never know
what hit me,

841
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:13,166
'Cause he's super fast
and he has a thing for knives.

842
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:17,136
- How fast?

843
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:22,675
- Thanks for letting me
stay with you.

844
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:25,144
- Of course. I would
never leave you here.

845
01:04:25,212 --> 01:04:26,879
Not after what happened.

846
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,048
- Annie's parents
came by last night.

847
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,017
I thought they should know about
the supposed suicide letter.

848
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:33,886
- You didn't say anything,
did you?

849
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:37,990
- No, but I think they have
the right to know, don't you?

850
01:04:38,058 --> 01:04:40,560
I mean, if it were me,
you would want to know.

851
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,495
- It's not your business to tell
the parents about the note.

852
01:04:42,563 --> 01:04:44,763
Let the police handle it.

853
01:04:44,831 --> 01:04:47,066
- It's the truth.

854
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:55,374
- Welcome back.

855
01:04:55,442 --> 01:04:57,310
- Hey. Uh, gretchen,
this is my mom.

856
01:04:57,377 --> 01:04:58,311
Mom, gretchen.
- A pleasure.

857
01:04:58,378 --> 01:04:59,312
- Hi.

858
01:04:59,379 --> 01:05:01,780
- Bizarre, huh?

859
01:05:01,848 --> 01:05:03,282
I heard
you told the cops

860
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,684
That you didn't see
a suicide note.

861
01:05:04,751 --> 01:05:08,354
So what do you think,
murder or horrific accident?

862
01:05:08,422 --> 01:05:11,190
- Uh, Claire may have been
mistaken about the note.

863
01:05:11,258 --> 01:05:13,792
- May have been?
Did you see one or not?

864
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,662
- Well, I didn't at first,
but it was dark.

865
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,631
Maybe I missed it.

866
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:19,998
- Suicide makes no sense.

867
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:21,534
I mean, the girl
had a trajectory.

868
01:05:21,602 --> 01:05:24,437
Who maps out their life
for the next 50 years

869
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,039
And then throws themself
out a window?

870
01:05:27,107 --> 01:05:30,209
- I should go.

871
01:05:30,277 --> 01:05:31,377
You okay?

872
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:33,346
- Yeah.
Thanks for everything.

873
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:34,380
- You're welcome.

874
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:39,017
Remember, new life,
new beginning.

875
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:40,419
Bye.
Nice to meet you.

876
01:05:40,487 --> 01:05:43,656
- Likewise.

877
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,429
- So, it's murder,
right?

878
01:05:50,497 --> 01:05:53,666
How do we prove it?

879
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:55,468
- So you think your knife guy's
gonna show?

880
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,336
- I don't know, but it sure
makes me feel better

881
01:05:57,404 --> 01:05:58,604
Having you around.

882
01:05:58,672 --> 01:06:03,376
- Yeah, I'll bet.

883
01:06:03,443 --> 01:06:05,645
- Do you mind if I make
an observation?

884
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,780
I think you should
seriously consider

885
01:06:07,847 --> 01:06:09,181
How you're living
your life.

886
01:06:09,249 --> 01:06:11,317
- Where did that
come from?

887
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:14,453
- I saw your apartment,
the police scanner,

888
01:06:14,521 --> 01:06:15,821
All those newspaper articles.

889
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,056
You're saving lives,
and you're keeping track.

890
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:19,892
I'll bet you know
every one of their names.

891
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:22,461
- And?

892
01:06:22,529 --> 01:06:24,263
- Do any of them
know yours?

893
01:06:24,331 --> 01:06:26,031
It's not healthy
to live alone, Peter.

894
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:27,966
No connections to anybody.
It's a dead end.

895
01:06:28,034 --> 01:06:31,103
Trust me.
I'm exhibit "a."

896
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:33,872
For years, I put my job
ahead of my family,

897
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,341
And now my kids
are off at school

898
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,242
And I'm eating cereal
for dinner

899
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:40,746
And a strange man is answering
my wife's phone.

900
01:06:40,814 --> 01:06:42,448
My point is I'm alone.

901
01:06:42,516 --> 01:06:46,118
That's no way to live.

902
01:06:49,289 --> 01:06:52,825
- Here you are,
mr. Danko.

903
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:56,562
And I'll be right outside
when you're finished.

904
01:07:03,203 --> 01:07:06,171
- So what'd we win?

905
01:07:12,912 --> 01:07:17,717
A compass. Danko got killed
for a compass?

906
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:20,619
- A broken compass.

907
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:22,988
- Hmm.

908
01:07:23,056 --> 01:07:25,224
- Yeah. We need
just another minute.

909
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:32,898
- That doesn't belong
to you.

910
01:07:58,254 --> 01:07:59,287
- He has power.

911
01:07:59,355 --> 01:08:01,890
- I got it.
I got it.

912
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:04,827
- Bloody hell.

913
01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:40,262
- What happened?

914
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:41,864
- I don't know.
He took off.

915
01:08:44,534 --> 01:08:46,669
He's still breathing.

916
01:08:48,905 --> 01:08:51,707
Thanks a lot, doc.
- Okay.

917
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:57,680
- How's he doing?

918
01:08:57,747 --> 01:08:59,381
- Oh, he's recovering.
I hope it was worth it.

919
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:00,649
- No, not really.

920
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:01,984
I can't figure out
why danko

921
01:09:02,052 --> 01:09:04,820
Thought this
was worth dying for.

922
01:09:07,423 --> 01:09:10,693
- Could I see it?

923
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,428
Whoa! Hello.

924
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:15,964
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

925
01:09:20,804 --> 01:09:23,238
- Well, apparently,
it only works for you.

926
01:09:23,306 --> 01:09:25,674
Here.
- No! No, no, no, no.

927
01:09:25,742 --> 01:09:27,242
- Peter,
this is a lead.

928
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,377
You saw that guy. There could be
others out there like him.

929
01:09:29,445 --> 01:09:32,081
- Look, my life finally
makes sense to me.

930
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:35,217
In the last six weeks,
I have saved 53 people.

931
01:09:35,284 --> 01:09:36,384
I'm with you for, what?
An hour,

932
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:38,020
And some innocent guy
almost gets killed?

933
01:09:38,088 --> 01:09:40,155
The further
I stay away from you

934
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,257
And whatever it is
that you're doing,

935
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:44,259
The happier I'm gonna be.

936
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:45,393
- He murdered danko.

937
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:48,130
He almost killed
you and me for this.

938
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:49,598
- So why don't you
just let him have it?

939
01:09:52,168 --> 01:09:55,070
Look...

940
01:09:55,138 --> 01:09:56,404
My life is simple.

941
01:09:56,472 --> 01:09:58,373
Okay?
I understand it.

942
01:09:58,441 --> 01:10:01,309
I don't need for things
to get complicated.

943
01:10:01,377 --> 01:10:03,045
- So why'd you come
with me?

944
01:10:03,113 --> 01:10:06,414
- The ability. It'll help me
do my job better.

945
01:10:06,482 --> 01:10:10,318
The one where I actually
save people.

946
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:14,123
- I guess this is good-Bye.

947
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:16,291
I wish you all the luck
in the world, Peter.

948
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:18,526
- Thank you, noah.

949
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:22,798
- Hey!

950
01:10:22,866 --> 01:10:24,032
Call your mother.

951
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,668
<i>[The bravery's
an honest mistake]</i>

952
01:10:46,355 --> 01:10:48,257
<i>- Forensic pathology:

<i>Knight's forensic pathology

955
01:10:53,997 --> 01:10:57,332
- Where did you get those,
the homicide bookstore?

956
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,934
- Is there such a place?

957
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:03,138
- Don't you think you're going
a little overboard?

958
01:11:03,206 --> 01:11:04,973
- Don't you want to prove your
roommate was defenestrated?

959
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:07,142
- Of course.

960
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:09,211
And yes, I know what
"defenestrated" means.

961
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:11,847
- Well, don't get mad at me
for using it in a sentence.

962
01:11:11,915 --> 01:11:14,283
Have you ever heard of
the "jump, push, fall" test?

963
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,650
- The what?

964
01:11:15,718 --> 01:11:17,820
- It's when cops get a dummy
the approximate size

965
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:19,421
And weight of the victim,
and they throw it

966
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:20,923
Out the window to see
how it lands.

967
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:22,691
- What page is that on?

968
01:11:22,758 --> 01:11:24,793
- Oh, it's not in there.

969
01:11:24,861 --> 01:11:27,062
<i>I saw it on an episode
of crossing jordan.</i>

970
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:31,867
Look, if you fall,
you go straight down.

971
01:11:31,935 --> 01:11:34,402
If you jump,
you go a little further.

972
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:35,804
But if you're pushed...

973
01:11:37,606 --> 01:11:39,341
Sorry.

974
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:47,983
- All we need is a dummy

975
01:11:48,051 --> 01:11:49,718
Of the approximate size
and weight of annie.

976
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:51,753
- You're not serious.

977
01:11:51,821 --> 01:11:56,992
- Maybe we could swipe a cadaver
from the medical school.

978
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:59,895
What?
It's a victimless crime.

979
01:11:59,963 --> 01:12:02,064
- Let's not get
carried away.

980
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:05,100
- Why not?
This is murder!

981
01:12:07,503 --> 01:12:10,105
- Maybe, but I'm not trying
to be a social pariah

982
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:11,606
Before midterms.

983
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:15,110
- Mm. The ship's
already sailed, Claire.

984
01:12:15,178 --> 01:12:17,412
So where do we get
our hands on a dead body?

985
01:12:21,351 --> 01:12:22,717
- Hi, my name's Matt.

986
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:23,986
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Matt.

987
01:12:24,053 --> 01:12:26,188
- Uh, it's been six weeks
since I last used,

988
01:12:26,256 --> 01:12:27,856
And, um,

989
01:12:27,924 --> 01:12:33,128
And I'm feeling confused.

990
01:12:33,196 --> 01:12:37,332
Uh, when I--
When I used,

991
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,734
I was totally selfish.

992
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:44,072
I didn't think
about what I did to others,

993
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,541
And, uh,
how I may have hurt them.

994
01:12:49,712 --> 01:12:51,146
- Sorry.

995
01:12:51,214 --> 01:12:53,982
You mean like
what you did to me?

996
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,651
Hi.

997
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:00,122
My name is sylar.

998
01:13:00,189 --> 01:13:01,924
It's been about
six weeks or so

999
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:05,727
Since I've seen my body,
and I want it back.

1000
01:13:05,795 --> 01:13:10,698
- Recently, uh,
there have been these, uh,

1001
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:12,000
Ghosts.

1002
01:13:12,068 --> 01:13:14,836
These things have been
popping up from my old life

1003
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:17,539
And haunting me.

1004
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:18,873
- Do you really think you're
gonna stop using your powers?

1005
01:13:18,942 --> 01:13:20,842
Are you crazy?
[Laughs]

1006
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,178
I mean, I bet you couldn't even
make it through a day.

1007
01:13:25,014 --> 01:13:26,214
- I can't seem to get these
images out of my head.

1008
01:13:26,282 --> 01:13:30,718
- You're weak!
You're simpleminded!

1009
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:32,421
I bet I could make you
use your powers!

1010
01:13:32,488 --> 01:13:33,422
- Go away!

1011
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:34,589
- I could make you

1012
01:13:34,657 --> 01:13:37,025
Use your powers!

1013
01:13:39,095 --> 01:13:40,429
- I'm sorry.

1014
01:13:40,496 --> 01:13:43,332
- Hey, buddy,
are you okay?

1015
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:49,737
- Does this guy look okay,
seriously?

1016
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:51,974
I mean, look.

1017
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:53,408
20 pounds overweight,

1018
01:13:53,476 --> 01:13:54,609
Blood pressure's
through the roof.

1019
01:13:54,677 --> 01:13:56,144
He's like a heart attack
waiting to happen!

1020
01:13:56,212 --> 01:13:58,546
- Stop it!
Stop it!

1021
01:14:01,617 --> 01:14:05,120
- Uh, let's,
uh, let's--Let's get things

1022
01:14:05,188 --> 01:14:06,521
Moving along a bit, um...

1023
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,157
- Who's next?

1024
01:15:42,323 --> 01:15:43,756
- All right, let me take
a crack at this guy,

1025
01:15:43,824 --> 01:15:45,991
See if I can get him
to talk.

1026
01:15:46,059 --> 01:15:48,060
- Now you seemed a little off
today at the meeting.

1027
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:49,629
- No, no, no, no, no.
I'm good.

1028
01:15:49,697 --> 01:15:50,730
- You sure?

1029
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:51,731
- I'm good.
I'm under control.

1030
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:53,132
It's good.

1031
01:15:56,637 --> 01:15:58,738
Double shot mocha.

1032
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:02,342
You look like you could use
a little pick-Me-Up.

1033
01:16:06,413 --> 01:16:08,948
It's okay.
No strings attached.

1034
01:16:09,015 --> 01:16:10,783
- Not interested.

1035
01:16:10,851 --> 01:16:12,084
- Come on, let's do this easy,
all right?

1036
01:16:12,152 --> 01:16:14,621
Just two guys talking.
Come on.

1037
01:16:14,688 --> 01:16:16,856
- I get it.
You are the good cop.

1038
01:16:16,923 --> 01:16:18,291
How ironic.

1039
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:23,329
So we need a name.

1040
01:16:23,397 --> 01:16:25,732
Your supplier, all right?
You give us that name,

1041
01:16:25,799 --> 01:16:27,032
You keep a clean record.

1042
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,102
- He's a liar,
totally lying.

1043
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,538
- Why are you looking
at my forehead?

1044
01:16:32,606 --> 01:16:34,274
Does it say "schmuck"
or something?

1045
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:35,675
- I wasn't staring
at your forehead.

1046
01:16:35,743 --> 01:16:37,977
- You're not getting
a name, coffee boy.

1047
01:16:38,044 --> 01:16:39,245
- Is that all you need, Matt?
A name? Seriously?

1048
01:16:39,313 --> 01:16:40,413
What the hell
are you waiting for?

1049
01:16:40,481 --> 01:16:42,081
It's got to be
floating around

1050
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:43,483
In his comical little brain
somewhere, right?

1051
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:45,985
- I don't do that anymore.
- Don't do what anymore?

1052
01:16:46,052 --> 01:16:47,320
- Why is that?
Because you're addicted?

1053
01:16:47,388 --> 01:16:50,089
- Leave me alone.
- Who are you talking to?

1054
01:16:50,157 --> 01:16:53,192
- Just read his mind, Matt.
You know you want to.

1055
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:54,694
I could help you.

1056
01:16:54,762 --> 01:16:55,695
I could take a nice,
little chunk

1057
01:16:55,763 --> 01:16:56,996
Out of his skull
in the process.

1058
01:16:57,063 --> 01:16:58,998
- Stop it!
- What's the matter with you?

1059
01:16:59,065 --> 01:17:02,168
- Just give me a name, okay?
- Take it from him!

1060
01:17:02,235 --> 01:17:03,269
- No!
- No?

1061
01:17:03,337 --> 01:17:05,070
- Why the hell not?
- Leave me alone.

1062
01:17:05,138 --> 01:17:06,606
- You are a loser.
A total loser.

1063
01:17:06,674 --> 01:17:08,174
No wonder your wife is having
sex with the water guy.

1064
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:09,809
- Shut the hell up.
- I didn't say anything.

1065
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:10,976
- I'm not talking
to you right now.

1066
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:12,111
- Come on, Matt.

1067
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:13,413
She's cheated
on you once already,

1068
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,248
And we both know what janice
needs is a real man.

1069
01:17:16,317 --> 01:17:18,651
Someone who's not afraid
of power.

1070
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,720
Someone who knows
what to do with it.

1071
01:17:20,788 --> 01:17:23,889
- I'm in control here,
not the power.

1072
01:17:23,957 --> 01:17:26,025
And not you,
you son of a bitch!

1073
01:17:28,195 --> 01:17:30,663
- Keppler.
The guy's name is keppler.

1074
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:32,598
Lives in long beach,
okay?

1075
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:35,802
Just leave me alone.

1076
01:17:43,444 --> 01:17:46,346
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1077
01:17:46,413 --> 01:17:48,113
Have a nice day off?
- Yeah, it was good.

1078
01:17:48,181 --> 01:17:50,783
Very productive.
I got a lot done.

1079
01:17:50,851 --> 01:17:51,917
- You okay?

1080
01:17:51,985 --> 01:17:55,187
- Oh, yeah.
That's--I'm fine.

1081
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:56,823
- Is that clam chowder?
- It is.

1082
01:17:56,890 --> 01:17:58,324
- It smells good.
Where'd you get it?

1083
01:17:58,392 --> 01:17:59,659
- This place called
legal sea foods.

1084
01:17:59,727 --> 01:18:01,561
I got one for you.

1085
01:18:01,628 --> 01:18:04,230
- Never heard of it.
- It's up in boston.

1086
01:18:04,297 --> 01:18:06,366
- Boston?

1087
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:07,600
- Yeah.

1088
01:18:07,668 --> 01:18:08,801
- Well, how'd you get it
down here?

1089
01:18:08,869 --> 01:18:10,135
- I know a guy.

1090
01:18:10,203 --> 01:18:12,805
- That's the partner
I know and love.

1091
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:15,975
- All available units,
code three, fifth and lexington.

1092
01:18:16,042 --> 01:18:17,410
- Never mind that.

1093
01:18:17,478 --> 01:18:21,313
We've still got five minutes
till we're on duty.

1094
01:18:21,382 --> 01:18:24,517
Peter?

1095
01:18:27,254 --> 01:18:28,320
- Noah?

1096
01:18:28,389 --> 01:18:29,589
Noah?

1097
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:36,028
Just hang on.
Just hang on, okay?

1098
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,168
- He took the compass.

1099
01:18:57,007 --> 01:18:58,173
- Hi.

1100
01:18:58,241 --> 01:18:59,642
- Hey.

1101
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:01,243
- How are you?

1102
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:04,279
- Oh, you know, it looks
worse than it feels.

1103
01:19:04,347 --> 01:19:07,383
- When you called, I figured
I owed it to you.

1104
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:11,554
- Hey, you know that key
inside of danko?

1105
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:15,157
It turns out
it led me to a, uh,

1106
01:19:15,225 --> 01:19:16,893
Broken, old compass.

1107
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,761
Your friend
with the knives

1108
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:21,564
Just came
and took it back anyway.

1109
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:23,098
- You gonna go after him?

1110
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:24,667
- I don't know.

1111
01:19:24,735 --> 01:19:27,503
I, uh, I prefer the old way
of doing business--

1112
01:19:27,571 --> 01:19:29,005
One of me, one of you.

1113
01:19:29,072 --> 01:19:32,307
This new way
just feels too...

1114
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:35,811
Dangerous to try
to stop them alone.

1115
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:40,917
- Maybe this guy
with the knives is like me,

1116
01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:44,353
Just trying
to get their life back,

1117
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:45,788
Keeping what's his.

1118
01:19:45,856 --> 01:19:48,758
Maybe the idea
isn't to stop them

1119
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:53,128
But to figure out
a way to help them.

1120
01:19:53,196 --> 01:19:54,964
- Yeah, maybe.

1121
01:20:00,537 --> 01:20:03,606
- So be honest.
Why did you call?

1122
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:05,507
- You know, I--
I can't call my wife.

1123
01:20:05,576 --> 01:20:08,477
My ex-wife.

1124
01:20:08,545 --> 01:20:09,979
And I didn't want
to worry Claire,

1125
01:20:10,047 --> 01:20:12,848
So I just, uh...

1126
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,685
I'm--I'm--
- No, I get it.

1127
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:18,520
You don't want
to be alone.

1128
01:20:18,589 --> 01:20:20,856
- Yeah, I guess not.

1129
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:26,028
- So what's in the bag?

1130
01:20:26,096 --> 01:20:30,066
- Um, I-I have no idea.
What is it?

1131
01:20:30,133 --> 01:20:32,602
Clam chowder?
- Mmm, it's still warm.

1132
01:20:32,669 --> 01:20:37,139
Looks like you have someone
looking out for you.

1133
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,842
- You want some?
There's plenty.

1134
01:20:45,582 --> 01:20:49,351
- You got an extra spoon?

1135
01:20:58,962 --> 01:21:00,930
- Hey, dude.
Hey.

1136
01:21:00,998 --> 01:21:02,498
- You don't need
to jam it,

1137
01:21:02,565 --> 01:21:04,066
Or else you'll just
bust the coil again.

1138
01:21:04,134 --> 01:21:05,434
Guess you don't know
your own strength.

1139
01:21:05,502 --> 01:21:06,969
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

1140
01:21:07,037 --> 01:21:08,437
- Roy fixed
the hot water.

1141
01:21:08,505 --> 01:21:09,639
- Awesome, Roy.

1142
01:21:09,706 --> 01:21:11,941
- Hi.
- Hi.

1143
01:21:12,009 --> 01:21:14,810
- Everything okay at work?

1144
01:21:14,878 --> 01:21:17,179
- Yeah, yeah.
It was another banner day.

1145
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,547
Hey, Roy?
- Yeah?

1146
01:21:18,615 --> 01:21:19,715
- Let me walk you out,
buddy.

1147
01:21:19,783 --> 01:21:22,384
- Oh, sure thing.
See you tuesday, janice.

1148
01:21:22,452 --> 01:21:24,153
- Thanks, Roy.
- Bye, matty-Man.

1149
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,989
You be a good boy.

1150
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:30,092
- Hey, man.
- Yeah?

1151
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,494
- You got a family
of your own, Roy?

1152
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:35,230
- No, no.
Maybe someday.

1153
01:21:35,298 --> 01:21:38,367
- Yeah. Look, thanks for fixing
the hot water and all, but--

1154
01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:39,902
- Oh, my pleasure.

1155
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:41,904
It must be tough out there
for a single mom, right?

1156
01:21:41,972 --> 01:21:43,973
- Yeah. Yeah.

1157
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:49,011
Look, she's not single
anymore.

1158
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:52,748
Tomorrow, you're gonna ask
for a new route

1159
01:21:52,816 --> 01:21:55,617
And you're never gonna
stop by this house again.

1160
01:21:55,686 --> 01:21:59,254
- So I'm starting a new route.
Guess this is good-Bye.

1161
01:21:59,322 --> 01:22:04,626
- Yeah, it is.
Bye, Roy.

1162
01:22:04,695 --> 01:22:07,229
- Gotcha.

1163
01:22:58,715 --> 01:23:01,984
- Jump, push, fall.

1164
01:23:30,147 --> 01:23:31,713
Huh.

1165
01:23:31,782 --> 01:23:35,184
I guess she did
kill herself.

1166
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,718
- You had me worried.

1167
01:24:09,786 --> 01:24:11,520
- Sorry,
getting the compass back

1168
01:24:11,587 --> 01:24:14,190
Was a lot harder
than I thought.

1169
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:15,624
I met an impasse.

1170
01:24:20,197 --> 01:24:22,631
- Did you talk to him?

1171
01:24:24,634 --> 01:24:27,837
Didn't really get
a chance.

1172
01:24:27,904 --> 01:24:31,207
Lydia says you found
another time traveler,

1173
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:34,276
Someone to replace arnold.

1174
01:24:34,344 --> 01:24:38,180
- I don't like that word.

1175
01:24:38,248 --> 01:24:41,350
You can't replace family.

1176
01:24:41,417 --> 01:24:43,252
- But the chinese guy?

1177
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,955
- Japanese.

1178
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:54,263
They put him
on a righteous path,

1179
01:24:54,331 --> 01:24:56,498
But he'll come back
to us.

1180
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:01,603
- So what's next?

1181
01:25:01,671 --> 01:25:05,174
- We gather the rest.
