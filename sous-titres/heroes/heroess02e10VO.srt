1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,300
Previously on heroes...

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,200
You're going to die!Here!Tonight!

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,100
This is my fate then

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,500
I can't save him.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,100
But I can learn who killed him

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,200
Kensei takezo.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,200
When I get back, we'll be together.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,700
You came here to get control of your life.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,600
It's another strain of the virus.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,000
My blood's no longer a cure.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
I'm going to die?

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,100
Claire is the key

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,400
That could cure the virus.

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,200
And he has asked you to give us Claire.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,600
You touch my daughter and I'll kill yours.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,700
Then I'll kill you.

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,300
Please don't let them take me.

18
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,100
I'll get us home, I promise--no, no!

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,700
Peter.

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,200
I remember everything.

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,300
Takezo Kensei

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,500
I don't trust him, Maya.

23
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,100
See, when I get my ability back,

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,600
I'm gonna kill you and your sister.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,900
we should put our faith on him

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
Caitlin!

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,100
Caitlin!

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,600
Caitlin!

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
Caitlin!

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,700
No need to shout.

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,000
Adam, I was there. I saw her.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400
You haven't gone anywhere, Peter.

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,900
You were telling me about time travel

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,000
And how you were going to save some girl

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,100
From some deadly virus,

36
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,600
And then you began shouting her name.

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,400
No, no, I was in new york city a year from now.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,000
I saw Caitlin.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,900
I was calling at her to come back with me.

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,100
Look.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,300
Evacuation Notice  June 14th 2008

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,900
I have to keep trying.

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,200
I can't just leave her there to killed by the virus.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
What do you know about this virus?

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
I know that it kills over 93% of the world's population.

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,500
Peter, do you know what the virus is called?

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,800
Shanti virus.

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
That's what the guy at homeland security called it.

49
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,200
Does that mean something to you?

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I knew a woman at the company.

51
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,800
Victoria Pratt.

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,900
She was a biological engineer.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,700
On valentine's day 1977, she recovered a deadly virus

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
From a sick indian girl named shanti.

55
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,700
Under company orders,

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,100
She tried to manipulate the virus into a weapon.

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,700
I'd heard the program had been shut down.

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Clearly I was misinformed.

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,100
Those are my parents.

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Linderman, Charles Deveaux. what--

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,300
Those are the company founders, Peter.

62
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,800
The virus is their crime.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,500
They're responsible for this.

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,600
Parents sin, children suffer.

65
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
That is Victoria.

66
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
We need to find her, Adam.

67
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,100
We need to find her.

68
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,700
Make her tell us everything that she knows.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,600
That's the only way to stop the virus and save Caitlin.

70
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,500
It's the only way we can save the world.

71
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Get the hell out of my house.

72
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,900
Noah Bennet was a loyal employee of our company,

73
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,800
And for many years a true friend.

74
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
I offer my deepest condolences.

75
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
Are those my dad's ashes?

76
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
You had my husband cremated?

77
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Yes, his personnel file was very clear

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,100
What gives you the shit right?

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,200
We were only trying to help Claire

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,800
Use her abilities for the greater good.

82
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,900
But Noah's aggression forced our hand.

83
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,900
He was trying to protect me.

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
In the wake of this tragedy,

85
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I feel it's only fair to honor Noah's wishes.

86
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,900
You will be left alone to lead a normal life.

87
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,200
My father is dead.

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,100
There is no normal.

89
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm sorry for your loss.

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,200
Pack your bags. we're leaving tonight.

91
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,800
The next 24 hours are critical.

92
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
I want you to keep an eye on Claire.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
It'd be easier without this thing on my arm.

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,600
It itches like a mother!

95
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
And I thought my little girl was tough.

96
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,000
I am, dad, but I was shot.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And my body doesn't heal itself.

98
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,500
I'm sorry you're in pain,

99
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,600
But none of this would've happened

100
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,700
If you hadn't lowered your guard.

101
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,300
How was I supposed to know that Bennet teamed up

102
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,700
With West, the flying boy?

103
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,900
Excuses don't change outcome, Elle.

104
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,800
You need to accept responsibility

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
For what's happened.

106
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
Can you do that?

107
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,600
Can you regain my trust?

108
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,900
Sure, daddy.

109
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,100
I'll watch the cheerleader.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Mohinder.

111
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,600
Take it easy.

112
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,900
Last thing I remember...

113
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,600
You were...

115
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Did you shoot me?

116
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,100
I didn't have a choice.

117
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Why am I not dead?

118
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,100
You would have been,

119
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,600
If you not for an infusion of your daughter's blood.

120
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,700
You took Claire's blood?

121
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,200
It saved your life.

122
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,700
You betrayed me. you went after my family!

123
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,900
You told me this company had to be brought down

124
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,400
From the inside out.

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,700
Thank god I came to my senses

126
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,000
Before I'd done any real damage.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,100
What have you done with Claire?

128
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Claire's at home,

129
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,700
Grieving the loss of her father.

131
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,200
They think I'm dead.

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,500
You put us on this path.

133
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,900
With your violence, your paranoia.

134
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
You have nobody to blame but yourself.

135
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,700
What are you doing with that?

136
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,600
Your recovery has proven

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,000
This blood has tremendous regenerative properties.

138
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
I believe it holds the key

139
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,700
To saving an innocent woman from a deadly virus.

140
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,400
That's what this company does.

141
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,600
We save lives.

142
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Everything they've told you is a lie.

143
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,700
The company made that virus.

144
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,900
They've been experimenting with it for 30 years.

145
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,700
You can't trust them, Suresh!

146
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,800
Get back here, you son of a bitch!

147
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,500
600 bucks for a comic book?

148
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,700
In mint condition.

149
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,400
But that's not why I collect them.

150
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,900
I just like the stories.

151
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
How about this for a story?

152
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,700
Once upon a time, we cash these in

153
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,700
And live happily ever after, the end.

154
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,500
Hey, if St. Joan's a good guy,

155
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,300
Why is she wearing a hood?

156
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, every superhero has to have a secret identity.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,700
How else could they live a normal life?

158
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Who wants normal?

159
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,200
Pssh, I'd be rolling large.

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,400
Let everybody know who I was.

161
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,900
But if your enemies knew who you really were,

162
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,500
Then they'd be coming after you at home,

163
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,700
Maybe even taking revenge on your family.

164
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,200
That's why Clark Kent wears those glasses.

165
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Right.

166
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,900
Micah?

167
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
Mom, you came back!

169
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,900
I told you that I would.

170
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
I missed you every day.

171
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, I missed you every minute, every second.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
What's that even smaller one?

173
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
A nanosecond.

174
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,100
I missed you that one too.

176
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,600
So where were you, mom?

177
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,100
I went to a place that helps people like us

178
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,400
When we're sick.

179
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Is it Jessica again?

180
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,400
No, Jessica's gone. they all are.

181
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
This is about something else.

182
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,400
What is it?

183
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,300
I have a virus.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,600
You don't have to worry.

185
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,200
I can't make you or anybody else sick.

186
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
What's gonna happen to you?

187
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,300
Do you remember dr. Suresh?

188
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,300
He is working really hard

189
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
To find me a cure.

190
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,800
And when he do, I'll get better.

191
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,500
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

192
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,400
He will.

193
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,000
I am going to get better, Micah.

194
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,100
We are going to have normal life.

195
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,500
I promise you.

196
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,000
I've got something to make you stronger.

197
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,200
Oh, yeah? what's that?

198
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Dad's medal.

199
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
The one that the mayogave him

200
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
For saving that girl from the fire.

201
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
It's in my backpack.

202
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,500
We can't waste another nanosecond.

203
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,800
What's wrong, bud?

204
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,700
It's my backpack. it's gone.

205
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
It's beautiful here, Gabriel.

206
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,600
Thank you.

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,600
I almost feel normal.

208
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,100
After you see dr. Suresh, you will be.

209
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,100
And then Alejandro and I can go back home.

210
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,500
What if Alejandro could go home now?

211
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,200
But I need my brother.

212
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,900
He's the only one who can stop me

213
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,000
From hurting anyone else.

214
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,100
What if you could learn...

215
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,100
To control your own power?

216
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,800
I've seen people's powers grow.

217
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,900
Do you love your brother enough to let him go?

218
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,000
Of course.

219
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,100
It's...

220
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,100
It's just not possible.

221
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,700
Well, you'll never know...

222
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,000
Unless you try.

223
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,100
We should get back.

224
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,400
You put him through enough, Maya.

225
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,500
Me?

226
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,100
He gave up his entire life for you

227
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,900
Even after you killed his wife.

228
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
It was an accident.

229
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,900
You really think he's forgiven you?

230
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,300
She was cheating on him.

231
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,500
So she deserved to die?

232
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,100
That's not what I meant. it's just--

233
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,700
Buyou wanted to kill her, didn't you, Maya?

234
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,500
Stop it. let me go.

235
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,600
Where? back to your brother?

236
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,800
He hates you.

237
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
Don't do this.

238
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
Please!o this.

239
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,000
If you can control your power,

240
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,700
No more innocent people have to die.

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,600
Ahh! I can't!

242
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,600
Help. you're killing me.

243
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
Help...please.

245
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,600
You were right.

246
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,000
I did it.

247
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,400
My father looked good in a suit.

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
I must find Takezo Kensei...

249
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,200
and avenge my father.

250
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,500
Are any of these Kensei?  No.

251
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
But you're sure he did it?

252
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I saw him on the roof of the Deveaux building.

253
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,300
Just before he pushed my father off.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,500
You said Kensei died in White Beard's camp.

255
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,900
Even if he didn't...

256
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,600
how could anyone still be alive after 400 years?

257
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Kensei could heal from any wound.

258
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Maybe he could survive time as well.

259
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,600
You mean he could live forever?

260
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,500
If he did...

261
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,200
he would leave a trail.

262
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,100
I don't think we should go in there guns blazing.

263
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,600
Let's just tell Victoria the truth.

264
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,300
Ask her straight out where to find the virus.

265
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
This woman can't be trusted, Peter.

266
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,700
She worked for the company. she locked me up.

267
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,000
One glance at me on her garden path

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Is liable to affect her mood.

269
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,700
Fine. I'll go alone.

270
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,200
No.

271
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,000
You lost?

272
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,100
Hope not.

273
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,100
I'm looking for victoria Pratt.

274
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,200
Never heard of her.

275
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,400
You worked for the company.

276
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,700
In 24 hours, the Shanti virus is released.

277
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,300
A year from now,

278
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,000
93% of the world's population is dead.

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,800
How can anyone know what happens a year from now?

280
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
I've been there.

281
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,900
I've seen it.

282
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,300
A time traveler.

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You created a virus that kills billons of people.

284
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,100
I don't know how it gets out or where,

285
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,000
Only that it does.

286
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,600
Unless you help me.

287
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,400
Inside...now.

288
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,300
Ando, be more careful.

289
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,300
You are like...

290
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,100
a hamster making a nest.

291
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,300
Takezo Kensei and my father.

292
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,600
Kensei was calling himself ADAM MONROE.

293
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,100
Adam Monroe.

294
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
I saw that name.

295
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,500
From November 2, 1977.

296
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,000
It's a singed order to lock up Adam Monroe. Signed by my father.

297
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,600
This is it, Ando!

298
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I must go back to this day.

299
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,000
But, Hiro.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,700
You said you would never again travel in time.

301
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,100
That you wouldn't risk changing history.

302
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,200
The memo came from PRIMATECH RESEARCH in Hartsdale,New York.

303
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,700
I must do this.

305
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,300
Not again.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,200
Containment breach in bio-research.

307
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,900
Evacuation protocol in full effect.

308
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,400
You have betrayed everything we stand for.

309
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
No, Kaito, I tried to save the world.

310
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,000
By releasing a virus

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,800
That could kill billons of innocent people?

312
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,600
When you're been around as long as I have,

313
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,800
The patterns become clear.

314
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,500
Constant war. disregard for the environment.

315
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,700
Famine. and it's only getting worse.

316
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,200
Someone had to make the hard choice

317
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,400
For the greater good.

318
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,500
Take him down to lockup.

319
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
And throw away the key!

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Are you all right, Victoria?

321
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,900
He was looking for Strain 138.

322
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,900
If he'd been successful,

323
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,500
This place would've been ground zero

324
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
For a global pandemic.

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,100
Thank you for saving us.

326
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
You need to shut down the program, Kaito.

327
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Give it to me.

328
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,600
This will be taken

329
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,900
To the primatech facility in odessa.

330
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,500
With Adam locked away, it will be safe.

331
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,300
Look, with something that dangerous,

332
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,600
There is no safe.

333
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,000
That virus needs to be destroyed.

334
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,500
The other founders would never allow that.

335
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,500
Doesn't that concern you?

336
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,900
Adam had help, Kaito.

337
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,000
It's the only way he would have known what to look for.

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
I suggest you take a few days off

339
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,900
Before resuming your work.

340
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,200
I won't be a part of this. not anymore.

341
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,800
After Kaito and the others were killed,

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
I figured that sooner or later

343
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,100
Someone would come after me.

344
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,300
You look like your mother.

345
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,600
I don't know anything about this.

346
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,400
The last time I saw my mother was a year from now,

347
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,700
In a future where the world had already been devastated

348
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,000
By the shanti virus.

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Forgive my paranoia, but I don't know you.

350
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I only knew your parents and what they were capable of.

351
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
There was a woman.

352
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,300
Caitlin.

353
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,300
She trusted me to protect her.

354
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,200
Now...

355
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,000
Somehow I took us into the future,

356
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
And now I can't get back.

357
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,000
So if you just tell me where to find the virus,

358
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,000
I know that I can save her.

359
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,400
You're looking for a mutated strain.

360
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,600
138.

361
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,700
If it were ever released,

362
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,000
It would kill us all.

363
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,900
She tell you where to find the virus?

364
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,900
Company storage facility in new mexico.

365
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,800
New mexico?

366
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,200
Company never had a facility--

367
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,000
Wait, you don't understand.

368
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No, you're working with him now.

369
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's all I need to know.

370
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,100
I knew blowing your head off was the only way to be sure.

371
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,500
Better late than never.

372
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,900
Thanks, Peter.

373
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,900
Let's get her up to the house.

374
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,300
Alejandro!

375
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,000
I can control my power!

376
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
On my own!

377
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,300
It's all thanks to Gabriel

378
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,700
What did Gabriel do?

379
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,800
He showed me what I am capable of.

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Isn't..

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,800
this wonderful news?

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,800
Maya

383
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,200
I looked up Gabriel Gray on the computer in the office.

384
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,100
He is a murderer.

385
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,800
The police say he killed his own mother.

386
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,700
I don't believe it.

387
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,000
It's not true.

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,900
We need to leave before...

389
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Maya?

390
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,900
Did you tell your brother the good news?

391
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
I know what you are!

392
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,800
Is something wrong?

393
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
This...

394
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,800
Says you murdered your mother.

395
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,800
But I know you didn't. you couldn't.

396
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
It's te.

397
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,700
I did it.

398
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,800
I killed her.

399
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,600
He admits it?

400
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,300
When my mother found out what I could do,

401
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,800
She didn't understand.

402
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Shtold me I was a monster.

403
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,200
My own mother tried to kill me, Maya.

404
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,300
And as I defended myself,

405
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
There was an accident.

406
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,600
I understand.

407
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,500
What are you doing Maya? Get away from him.

408
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,700
He's a murderer!

409
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,500
I am a murderer!

410
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,800
Gabriel understands exactly what I'm going throught

411
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,200
exactly how I feel.

412
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,200
We're leaving...now!

413
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,600
Alejandro no!

414
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,900
I'm staying with gabriel

415
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,900
We will go see Doctor Suresh without you.

416
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,900
I can control my own ability now.

417
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,500
I am not leaving you alone with him

418
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,000
I know you hate me.

419
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,500
I killed the woman you loved.

420
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,500
That wasn't your fault.

421
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,900
Yes it was.

422
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,400
In my heart, I wanted her dead.

423
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,100
Everything's gonna be okay, Maya.

424
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,000
I'll take care of you.

425
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,800
Why did you lie to me, Victoria?

426
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,200
You're with him.

427
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,300
You're helping Adam release the virus.

428
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,500
Release the virus?

429
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm trying to find the virus so I can destroy it.

430
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,800
30 years ago, Adam broke into my lab.

431
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,700
I stopped him from releasing the virus

432
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,100
So he couldn't kill everyone.

433
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,900
And now he's trying to do it again.

434
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,400
I broke into the lab to prevent you and company

435
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Fr putting the world in danger.

436
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,200
You killed Kaito, didn't you?

437
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,900
And the others. and now it's my turn.

438
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,100
We're trying save lives, Victoria, not take them.

439
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,600
Adam's a killer.

440
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,500
And I guess since you're helping him, you're one too.

441
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,200
Just like your parents.

442
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,700
Adam helped me escape the company.

443
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
He saved my brother's life.

444
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,700
But what you did, what you were a part of,

445
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,500
That will bring an end to the world.

446
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,100
Tell me where I can find the virus so I can stop it.

447
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,700
Go to hell.

448
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,800
Where is it, Victoria?

449
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,300
Primatech paper, odessa, texas.

450
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Texas. no!

451
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,200
Thank you.

452
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
I am not gonna let you do this!

453
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,000
Get away from me!

454
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,100
We're not hurting you. we're letting you go.

455
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
What are you doing?

456
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,700
Wait!

457
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,900
You didn't have to kill her.

458
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,300
She was about to take your head off.

459
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,200
There's no coming back from that one.

460
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm gonna get the car.

461
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,900
If anyone survives,

462
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,100
I'll tell them...

463
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,700
I couldn't have done it

464
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,300
Without you.

465
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,200
Well?

466
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,500
There was this kid on third street

467
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,400
Who said he can tell me how much

468
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,700
Your comics were worth.

469
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,900
I figured if you knew how much we'd get then maybe--

470
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,800
Where are they? where's my backpack?

471
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,600
It was a setup. I got jacked--

473
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,800
Micah! Damon!

474
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
My dad's medal was in that bag!

475
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,300
I'm sorry! I'll get you a new one!

476
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,200
You gonna get me a new dad, too?

477
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,200
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,400
I don't care! I hate you!

479
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,000
We're gonna get you all cleaned up.

480
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,400
And then I'm gonna call the police,

481
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,800
And you're gonna tell them everything that happened.

482
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,700
Come on.

483
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,900
We need to get it back.

484
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,200
Nana's calling the police.

485
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm not talking about the police.

486
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,500
I'm talking about us. we could get it back.

487
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,200
We have talked about this.

488
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,800
We need to be heroes. like dad.

489
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,600
Being a hero is what got your father killed.

490
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,300
Medals gone, I am sorry.

491
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,800
You all packed, Maya?

492
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,000
You're not taking my sister with you.

493
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,100
I tried to let you go the easy way.

494
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,100
But you had to be persistent.

495
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,800
I'm taking my sister.

497
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Gabriel.

498
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,900
Gabriel!

500
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
I didn't hear you with the water running.

501
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,700
Is everything okay?

502
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,700
I have to talk to you.

503
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,400
Yeah?

504
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
You were right.

505
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,800
About everything.

506
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,600
About me. about Alejandro.

507
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,300
I never meant to come between you two.

508
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,100
He's my brother.

509
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,700
I have to do what I can to protect him.

510
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,600
In time, he will understand.

511
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
Of course he will.

512
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,500
And without you,

513
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,700
I would still be somewhere in mexico.

514
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,400
I just want to help you.

515
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,500
You have done that.

516
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,600
And some much more.

517
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
Your mom said you're leaving tonight.

518
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,400
I've fallen 20 stories.

519
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,800
Been stabbed in the head.

520
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,900
Crashed a car at 70 miles an hour.

521
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
I've even been on fire.

522
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,100
But this hurts...

523
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,200
More than any of that.

524
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,100
And it's not getting better.

525
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,500
I've always gotten better no matter what,

526
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,000
But this just keeps getting worse.

527
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,700
I can't stand to see you hurt like this.

528
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,900
I won't be. not for long.

529
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,000
There's a man who used to work with my dad.

530
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,500
He has the ability to erase people's memories.

531
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,200
These are a signal

532
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,700
So that he knows to come.

533
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,800
Are you gonna hang those in the window?

534
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,600
How do you know he's gonna see them?

535
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,600
I don't know, but I have to do something.

536
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,400
You don't want to forget your dad.

537
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,300
Forgetting isn't the answer.

538
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,200
I just wish I could tell him how sorry I am. 

539
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,400
Micah.

540
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,300
Why are you dressed like that?

541
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,100
I know what it's like to lose someone you love.

542
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,400
To wish that you had a piece of them,

543
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,300
Something solid to hold onto.

544
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,600
Anybody tried to steal my mom's piano,

545
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,300
I'd feed 'em their teeth.

546
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,900
Look.

547
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,700
I know where those kids live.

548
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
The ones who stole your backpack.

549
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,200
You're gonna help me get back my dad's medal?

550
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,800
Long as you stay out of the way.

551
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,800
Anything crazy happens, I need you safe.

552
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,200
Okay, I promise.

553
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,100
Shh, we still gotta sneak you out.

554
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,200
Come on.

555
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,200
It's as we'd hoped.

556
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Claire's blood has fortified my antibodies.

557
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,500
They're strong enough to defeat

558
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,900
The mutated virus now.

559
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,800
Congratulations, doctor.

560
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,700
You promised Niki Sanders you'd find a ce,

561
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,800
And you have.

562
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,000
And you promised me

563
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
This company's viral research would end.

564
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,700
In working up this cure, I've been pouring over records

565
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,500
That reveal the full extent of your program.

566
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,300
And you of all people should understand

567
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,600
What it would mean to find a safe way

568
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,500
To remove the abilities of dangerous individuals.

569
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,500
Here, Strain 138.

570
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,300
If even the smallest amount were released,

571
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,200
It would wipe out all of human civilization.

572
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,400
This strain is locked safely away

573
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,100
In our facility in texas.

574
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,500
And I can assure you, doctor,

575
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,000
This company is vigilant about security.

576
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,700
Really?

577
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,400
For weeks I operated as a spy

578
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,500
Within your ranks undetected.

579
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,200
God knows what someone with experience

580
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,700
And ill intent could achieve.

581
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,400
What can I do for you?

582
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Help me hunt down every strain of virus

583
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,800
Within this company and destroy them.

584
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Hello.

585
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,900
Niki? it's Mohinder Suresh.

586
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,000
Are you still in new orleans?

587
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
Yes.

588
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,800
I think I found the cure, Niki.

589
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,800
I'll bring to you on the next flight.

590
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,900
You're nightmare's over.

591
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
I don't know what to say, doctor.

592
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,300
Thank you.

593
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,900
Micah.

594
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
There's no one home.

595
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,900
You should have plenty of time.

596
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,100
You know how to get up there yet?

597
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Almost.

598
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,400
Got it.

599
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,000
I just wish it wasn't so bright.

600
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,100
I don't want people thinking I'm robbing the place.

601
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,400
Okay.

602
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,100
How did you do that?

603
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,900
I told the lights I need them to be off for a while.

604
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,300
You told 'em.

605
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,400
Yeah.

606
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
What?

607
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,200
You're st. joan!

608
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
You really have to stop reading those comic books.

609
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,600
Stay here.

610
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,200
I'm sorry, dad.

613
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,200
Who cares?

614
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,900
As long as he come with that cash

616
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,700
 
620
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,100
I love you,dad.

617
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,700
I'm sorry I didn't listen.

618
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,000
I should've done everything you told me to.

619
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,000
If I hadn't been so selfish, you'd still be here.

621
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,900
You'd better say good-bye.

622
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,100
We gotta be in salt lake by morning.

623
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,100
Come on.

624
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,900
This is all happening so fast.

625
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm losing everything I care about.

626
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,100
Claire!

628
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,100
What the hell are you doing here?

629
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,100
I came to watch the sunset.

630
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,700
Liar! ugh!

631
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,100
Watch who you're shoving, pompom.

632
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,500
Claire, don't.

633
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,100
This isn't fair.

634
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
Welcome to life.

635
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,900
Come on, Claire, we've gotta go.

636
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,300
No, mom, we don't.

637
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,700
We can tell the world what they did.

638
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,900
How they kidnapped me and murdered my father.

639
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,500
You have no proof. no one would believe you.

640
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,900
You're probably right.

641
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
I guess I'm just gonna have to show 'em.

643
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,800
I'll show everyone exactly what I can do.

644
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,200
Once the secret's out,

645
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,700
You wot be able to touch me or my family.

646
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,100
You'll be the ones running.

647
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Hello.

648
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,300
Hello, Mohinder.

649
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,400
Sylar?

650
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Where are you?

651
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,600
I convinced the babysitter to take the night off.

652
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,900
Don't worry.

653
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,500
I'm taking good care of the little one.

654
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,600
If you touch Molly--

656
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,700
We won't want to wake her.

657
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,400
I brought someone to see you.

658
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,600
She needs your help.

659
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,500
We both do

660
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,500
See you soon, Mohinder.

661
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,100
Ando,wake up.

662
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,500
Hiro!You're back!

663
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
I know what Adam wants!

664
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:09,800
What is it?

665
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,900
A virus.

666
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,700
At a place called Primatech.

667
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,800
It's in Texas, Ando!Back in Odessa!

668
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,600
Where we tried to save the cheerleader?

669
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Yes!

670
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,100
Adam wants to release this virus!

671
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,000
If I don't stop him,they'll die!

672
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,600
Who?

673
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,400
Everyone!

674
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,400
But Adam is invincible.

675
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,000
How can you stop a man like that?

676
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,600
I must try.

677
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,800
I must avenge my father's death...

678
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
and save the world.

679
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,300
Why is saving the world always your reponsibility?

680
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,600
This doesn't look like the sort of place

681
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,900
Where they'd store a virus that could destroy the world.

682
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,500
Paper company's just a front.

683
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,400
The good stuff is three floors down.

684
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,800
Laboratories, jail cells--

685
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,900
Hiro?

686
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Peter petrelli?

687
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,200
What are you doing here?

688
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,800
Adam monroe killed my father, and for that he must pay.

689
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,500
I can't let you do that.

690
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,400
Then you have chosen the wrong side.

691
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,500
No!

692
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,200
I can't let you hurt him.
