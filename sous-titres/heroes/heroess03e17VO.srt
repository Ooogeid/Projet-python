1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,080

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,670
I don't like this, Matt.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,190
Oh, you got any better ideas?

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,960
It's a huge risk being out in the open.
We should be laying low.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,140
And what? What?

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,620
Run forever?

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,820
I don't know.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,420
Yeah, that's my point.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,140
We're being hunted,
and we have no idea by who.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,520
How, why?

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,430
Noah Bennet has all the
answers we're looking for.

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,760
Hey, did you get it?

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,650
Amobarbital. One dose of this,
he's knocked out cold.

14
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,390
What? What's wrong?

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,660
Can't you just read his mind?
Get what we need that way?

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,170
No, we've been over this.

17
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,910
Noah is too well trained,
and he's never off his guard.

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,710
Guys, look, I was a cop.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,920
You're a scientist, a nurse.

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,210
We did nothing wrong,
and they turned us into fugitives.

21
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,070
Yeah, but drugging and kidnapping people?

22
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,590
I don't like it either,
but this way gives us answers.

23
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,620
Yeah, straight-up interrogation
isn't gonna work.

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,140
Not with Bennet.

25
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,490
We'll need to get creative.

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,320
- Staying at the hotel?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,380
Just for a little while.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,510
I'm actually looking
for an apartment in town.

29
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,430
You know anything?

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,260
Uh, no.

31
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,670
Welcome to Costa Verde.

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,220
Looks like our friend here
had about three too many.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,390
Don't worry, we'll get him home safe.

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,700
Well?

35
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,240
It's working.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,010
It's working.

37
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,080

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,730
Ten people died last night in Ohio
when a house spontaneously caught on fire.

39
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm thinking we should
investigate sooner rather than later.

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,930
It's over, Noah. It's all over.

41
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,440
Primatech may have burned to the ground,

42
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,620
but that doesn't change anything.

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,160
We have a lot of work to do.

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,370
Primatech should have been
shut down a long time ago.

45
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,960
The company had a good run,
but its time has passed.

46
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,000
No, we got the job done.

47
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,350
Yes, you certainly did.

48
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,390
And I appreciate it.

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,270
What is this?

50
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,220
For your years of service.

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,330
Pension, severance.

52
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,430
And this is from me.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
Why are you doing this?

54
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,170
Bag and tag. One of us, one of them.

55
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,360
It's an antiquated system
desperately trying to remain relevant.

56
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,810
So we adapt and we get it right.

57
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,280
I don't think we can.
I don't think we should.

58
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,030
I am tired, Noah.

59
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,020
I have told so many lies.

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,290
Maybe it's not to late
to cobble my family back together.

61
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,110
It's a good thing.

62
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,090
You get to go home to Claire.

63
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,500
This is everything you've
ever fought for, and you've won.

64
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,650
This is all I've ever known.

65
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,010
What am I supposed to do now?

66
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,820
Take care of Claire.

67
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,300
Take care of yourself.

68
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,730
All right, so I'm gonna be able to get
to these memories that we're looking for.

69
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,090
I'm gonna find out exactly
how this whole thing happened,

70
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,230
who's behind it, how they work.

71
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,080
We're gonna find out how to
stop hiding and start fighting back.

72
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,800
And how far are you willing to push?

73
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,640
As far as I need to.

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,310
This better be good.

79
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,370
Face time at state dinners is hard to come by.

80
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,510
You heard from Bennet?

81
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,290
No, why?

82
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,370
He's off the grid going on three hours.

83
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,485
Standard orders are to
check in after duty. He didn't.

84
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,415
How 'bout Claire, she okay?

85
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,940
Yes, your daughter's fine.

86
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,160
I want every inch of
surveillance on Noah Bennet.

87
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,580
Everywhere he's been,
everywhere he might go.

88
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,650
You're spying on your own men?

89
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,540
Nobody's above scrutiny,
myself included.

90
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,180
You and Bennet are both compromised.

91
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,290
What's that supposed to mean?

92
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,180
Your brother Peter,
your daughter Claire.

93
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,590
Peter gets treated like everyone else.

94
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,700
Yeah, and Claire gets a free pass.

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,680
That makes both yours and
Bennet's choices tarnished.

96
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,210
Are you spying on me?

97
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,990
You barely touched your prime rib.

98
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,050
Everything okay out there?

99
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,090
Still feels like we're
sitting ducks in here, come on.

100
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,630
You can't rush an interrogation.

101
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,960
This isn't an interrogation,
it's torture.

102
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,720
You're straining his entire system.

103
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,030
What, do you think
I'm hurting him on purpose?

104
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,970
I think you have a
personal vendetta, yeah.

105
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,940
I don't think you know
what the hell you're talking about.

106
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,760
- They killed Daphne, Matt.
- Daphne...

107
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,800
This isn't about Daphne.

108
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,020
This is about me helping everybody.

109
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,560
Well, you're not helping him.

110
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,900
He has done much worse to me.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,470
You're better than him, Matt.

112
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,690
- That's my point.
- No, the point is, he's in pain.

113
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,770
Does he have to be?

114
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,530
Look, the drugs are-- 
It's not gonna be comfortable.

115
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,790
- I'm digging through his brain--
- To find a memory.

116
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,960
Can we really trust this?

117
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,720
I mean, who knows what information's
been tainted by time and perception?

118
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,340
We know nothing--
He knows everything that we need to know.

119
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,290
He's right.

120
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,710
Do I have your permission to go back in now?

121
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,020
Let's find out how this whole thing began.

122
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,510

123
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,760
Need any help?

124
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,850
Um, four letter word...

125
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,860
"Thin man dog.

126
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,030
" Asta.

127
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,320
Asta.

128
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,780
I'm gonna go get changed.

129
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,360
If you're gonna shower, you should go.

130
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,610
We have dinner in an hour with the Pierots.

131
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,750
Who?

132
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,010
Jenny and ken?

133
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,420
We're on the pta with them at
Lyle's school. They're nice.

134
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,950
Oh, right.

135
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,850
You didn't make any other plans, did you?

136
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,310
No, no. Sounds great.

137
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,500
It's nice to have you around.

138
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,370
Noah.

139
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,950
Nathan.

140
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,910
Claire's, uh...

141
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,690
I have no idea, actually.

142
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,340
At the mall, maybe.

143
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,890
She's at the library.

144
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,060
- Secret service thing.
- Ah, of course.

145
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,300
I didn't want her to see me here.

146
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,440
I wanted to talk to you alone.

147
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,360
You have a-- a minute?

148
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,790
Yeah, yeah, sure.

149
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,130
Come on in.

150
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,820
What's going on?

151
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,390
I've set some things in motion.

152
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,360
Things...

153
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,910
Everything's gonna change, and I just
want you to know Claire's gonna be safe.

154
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,560
What do you mean "safe"?

155
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,310
What have you done?

156
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,710
You know, I got into
politics so I could...

157
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,200
help people, make the big impact.

158
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,170
What have you done?

159
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,750
I'm certain that you involved yourself
with the company for the same reason.

160
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,000
You sensed there was a need.

161
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,780
Well, that need still exists.

162
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,390
People with abilities are a threat.

163
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,690
Primatech is closed.

164
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,300
Primatech?

165
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,710
With all due respect, Primatech never
did the job that was required of them.

166
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,270
Then you have the solution.

167
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,130
The united states government
has the resources

168
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,350
and the authority
to contain this problem.

169
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,650
Wait a minute, what are you talking
about here, rounding people up?

170
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,080
For starters, yeah.

171
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,620
Incarceration's the only way
to make sure everybody's safe.

172
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,100
Everybody.

173
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,820
Yourself included.

174
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,190
Certain exceptions need to be made.

175
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,020
Is Claire an exception?

176
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,830
She could be.

177
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,670
But I need your help.

178
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,530
What do you plan to do
once you have everybody?

179
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,720
We find an answer.

180
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,260
Get the best team of scientists,

181
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,970
and we find a way to eliminate
these abilities forever.

182
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,260
And if that's not possible?

183
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,220
I refuse to accept that.

184
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,300
My abilities were given to me.
They can be taken away.

185
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,530
You know you're
gonna be seen as a villain.

186
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,430
Locking people away.

187
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,710
I'll play whatever role I need to.

188
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,870
Claire will never look
at you the same way again.

189
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,880
Claire never needs to know.

190
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,570
But she will. They all will.

191
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,720
And they will blame you.

192
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,940
They won't understand.

193
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,340
I have gone so far off the rails
with this, so far around the bend...

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,240
I nearly killed my own brother.

195
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,240
And I just want a chance
to make things right.

196
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,170
What do you want from me?

197
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,090
You spent 20 years
tracking these people.

198
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,770
I want to know how you did it.

199
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,030
What is all this stuff?

200
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,150
This is the last 20 years of my life.

201
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,320
And you kept it.

202
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,490
It's hard to throw this stuff away.

203
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,070
Noah, I am the U.S. Government.

204
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,880
We have loads of...

205
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,480
weapons and...stuff.

206
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,380
I realize you don't need weapons.

207
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,080
But you need perspective.

208
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,420
And you need to control information.

209
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,340
In 30 seconds, you undid a secret
that we've kept for over 30 years.

210
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
I can't un-ring that bell.

211
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,150
I know you can't.

212
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,710
Look, I joined
the company for a reason.

213
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:49,010
And that reason doesn't disappear
just because your mother decides to turn off the lights.

214
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,120
I thought you'd enjoy the
extra time with your family.

215
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,340
There's only so many
crossword puzzles I can do.

216
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,980
He planned it all...

217
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,210
with Nathan.

218
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,800
They did it together.

219
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,020
Did you hear what I just said?
Your brother is to blame for all of it.

220
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,180
Yeah, I know.

221
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,160
- So?
- So?

222
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,620
So what?

223
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,990
I tried to stop him. It didn't happen.

224
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,420
Okay, but what are we gonna do, nothing?

225
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,950
Well, we can't do
anything from memories, can we?

226
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,930
I've never done this before.
It's not an exact science.

227
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,220
It's not science at all, Matt!

228
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,330
If you want to go, just go!

229
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,230
That's now what I'm saying.

230
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,270
But it's what you're thinking huh?

231
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,940
You think you deserve this,
to be hunted, after all that you've done.

232
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,980
You're reading my mind?

233
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,180
I don't have to read your mind!

234
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,540
You're an open book.

235
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,890
Look, you wanna get caught?
Fine, turn yourself in.

236
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,970
But we're not lugging your baggage.

237
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,300
I could say that same thing about you!

238
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,080
I told you this is not about Daphne!

239
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,780
Stop! Both you!

240
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,860
We're supposed to be on the same side.

241
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,920
You don't think what
I'm getting here is real, huh?

242
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,840
Fine.

243
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Storage unit combination lock.

244
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,370
In here--
It is filled with things we need.

245
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,200
Guns, money. Go.

246
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,060
Go!

247
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,360
I'll go.

248
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,290
Try not to kill one another.

249
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,010
Jackpot.

250
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,190
Sir, I think I have something.

251
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,180
Where?

252
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,010
Gotcha.

253
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,590
Where is he?

254
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,510
Costa verde, breaking into
Bennet's storage facility.

255
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,780
Is it a live feed?

256
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,300
We've got a local team
on the move to apprehend him.

257
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,810
How does he know about
Bennet's storage facility?

258
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,820
They working together?

259
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,530
I'm reserving judgment.

260
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,000
I want him caught.

261
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,600
He's in a room stocked full of guns.

262
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,460
Am I clear?

263
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,820
You're risking your own men's lives.

264
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,560
I want Peter caught.

265
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,740
No bloodshed.

266
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,720
You gentlemen hear that?

267
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,410
Tasers on stun.

268
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,530
Yes, sir.

269
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,990
We lost visual. Go, now!

270
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,050
Peter should have been back by now.

271
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,980
Yeah, just, uh...

272
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,280
just give him some more time.

273
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,550
I'll tell you why Peter isn't here.

274
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,360
He's been captured or killed.

275
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,260
Shut him up.

276
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,240
I never checked in.

277
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,880
They'll be looking for me by now.

278
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,330
- Come on, do it!
- Mohinder knows I'm right.

279
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,680
My storage unit is under surveillance.

280
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,730
You sent Peter right
where they wanted him.

281
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,090
You'd say anything
to get the hell out of here.

282
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,380
Doesn't mean I'm lying.

283
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,660
You know me well enough
to know that's true.

284
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,430
- Matt, we should go.
- He's right.

285
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,500
Your only hope is to let me go,
and escape while you can, Matt.

286
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,710
Wait a second. We're not finished.

287
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,570
You said--you said you-- you check in...

288
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,360
with who?

289
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,270
Who else are you working with?

290
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,570
Show me.

291
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,200
I am not letting you in my head.

292
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,820
You can't stop me.

293
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,350
Who is it? Come on, who is it?

294
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,370

295
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,840
Welcome to building 26.

296
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,150
I see the government spares no penny.

297
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,580
Not on equipment, not on personnel.

298
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,870
We are building an elite team.

299
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,550
Well, I'm glad to be part of it.

300
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,280
Now, there are a few ground rules
that I would like to implement.

301
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,980
Primatech had a system.

302
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,170
One of us, one of them.

303
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,270
Working alongside people with abilities.

304
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,400
It helps to even the odds.

305
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,700
Yes, I read your file.

306
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,940
I think we'd be better served
with one of us and one of us.

307
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,940
I'm sorry?

308
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,170
Or 10 of us...

309
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,520
12 of us...

310
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,200
and none of them.

311
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,370
A lot of the people you're
targeting are good people.

312
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,640
They're useful people.

313
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,550
Well, this isn't about ethics.
It's about trust.

314
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,890
About us...and them.

315
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,800
By your own admission,
your way didn't exactly work.

316
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,410
Prisoners escaping, loyalty issues... 
It was a mess.

317
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,160
A mess.

318
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,510
For 20 years,
I was successful at making sure

319
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:42,280
that people like you never knew
people like them even existed.

320
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,760
You don't presume to
know anything about me.

321
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,790
I thought I was running this operation.

322
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,270
Well, the situation's become
a little bit more complex, Noah.

323
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,530
It's important that we look at
everything from as many angles as we can.

324
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,090
Okay?

325
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,360
Glad to see you got your old job back.

326
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,560
How else would I randomly
bump into old acquaintances?

327
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,010
Something big is happening.

328
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,890
I need your help.

329
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,790
Why would I believe anything you say?

330
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,720
Because it's true.

331
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,980
I realize we haven't always
played nice with each other, but...

332
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,870
you have a unique perspective.

333
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,530
You've been ordinary and extraordinary,
so you understand our fear.

334
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,950
What exactly is happening?

335
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,690
A government program.

336
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,350
And it is going to blow up in their face.

337
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,990
I need you, Mohinder.

338
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,780
I need your brain. I need your strength.

339
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,900
Together, we can help people.

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,920
We can save lives.

341
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,830
What do you say?

342
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,260
He came to you.

343
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,840
What?

344
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,420
I just saw you and him in a cab.

345
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,470
You knew about this.

346
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,870
You didn't tell him?

347
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,720
All right Matt, let me explain.

348
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,300
Why didn't you tell him?

349
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,790
I wasn't talking to anybody.

350
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,320
I thought it was the safest thing.

351
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,110
That's why you didn't want me in his head.

352
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,680
You didn't care about his health.

353
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,400
You were afraid of what I'd find.

354
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,300
No.

355
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,490
Yes, he approached me.

356
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,790
But I said no.

357
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,790
You should have told me about this.

358
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,490
Why didn't you tell-- Uhh!

359
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,260
What could I have done?

360
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,860
Tied up on an airplane too!

361
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,370
You think I don't regret any of this?

362
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,460
You're my friend.

363
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,870
You could have warned me!

364
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,990
You could have warned all of us!

365
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,210
I didn't know what to do.

366
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,150
I didn't believe him.

367
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,040
Even after the plane, the leash-- 

368
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,100
What told you that I
could've stopped all of this?

369
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,330
That I could have maybe
prevented Daphne's death?

370
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,060
If I had, I'd probably be
the one tied up in that chair.

371
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,610
All right, check back there.
I got over here.

372
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,030
Hi.

373
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,790
We gotta hurry. They found me.
They're gonna find us.

374
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,430
We're gonna get all the answers
we're looking for without the drugs.

375
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,390
I want him to feel everything.

376
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,250
How do we fight back?

377
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,820
You always have a plan,
now you're gonna share it with us.

378
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,860
Listen to Peter and get the hell
out of here while you still can.

379
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,280
How much time do you think you
have, Matt, before they find us?

380
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,220
Maybe we should just take
what Peter has and run.

381
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,090
You don't get a vote!

382
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,060
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

383
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,820
Mohinder knew that we were gonna
get attacked by the government.

384
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,140
Is that true?

385
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,290
Bennet came to me, yes.

386
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,480
But I didn't believe him.

387
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,650
He manipulated me before,
and I didn't think I could trust him.

388
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,210
Why didn't you say something?

389
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,530
As if any of you would
believe me after what I've done.

390
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,590
Yeah, it's better that we didn't.

391
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,620
You're a coward!

392
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,340
Can you get anything more out of him?

393
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,230
I was just about to do that.

394
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,140
Who's the guy you were taking orders from, huh?

395
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,100

396
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,380
Wait, wait, what guy?
I thought he was in charge.

397
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,720
Turns out he's still middle management.

398
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,580
Who is he?

399
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,030
Who?

400
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,570

401
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,960
You.

402
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,570
You got a minute?

403
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,840
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

404
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,020
I was hoping we could talk.

405
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,890
What are we gonna talk about?

406
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,060
We're gonna be working together.

407
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,640
I thought maybe it'd
be a good idea if we, uh...

408
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,990
What?

409
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,050
Got to know each other better?

410
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,580
Understood where the
other guy was coming from.

411
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,050
I already know where you're coming from.

412
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,490
And where is that?

413
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,660
You got a family at home.

414
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,220
A wife, a boy.

415
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,950
And your daughter Claire, right?

416
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,910
She's the special one with the soft
spot in the center of her soft heart.

417
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,520
That's right.

418
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,700
You're a dime a dozen.

419
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,890
And 11 of the 12 are unreliable.

420
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,240
You don't know anything about me.

421
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,050
That's the whole point of this.

422
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
All that time you
worked at your company,

423
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:52,010
you danced the fine line
between company man and family man.

424
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,770
I'm not much for dancing.

425
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,180
You're oversimplifying it.

426
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,000
I think you're overcomplicating it.

427
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,680
Hunting them or harboring them...

428
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,610
To win this war for good,
it takes focus.

429
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,690
And yours is just
a little split right now.

430
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,080
I've read your files too, Mr. Danko.

431
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,090
I've known men like you.

432
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,580
- Is that right?
- Sure.

433
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,300
Simple, unconnected.
Take your work home with you.

434
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,240
You're never off the job.

435
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,580
You think that makes you perfect.

436
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,370
Not perfect, just better than you.

437
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,580
These aren't terrorists you're hunting.

438
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,650
They're people.

439
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,470
They're targets.

440
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,520
This job is about
understanding their humanity,

441
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,950
not their ability.

442
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,830
But you have to be human to do that.

443
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,420
You're a valuable asset.

444
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,700
But once we begin engagement,
I have to know:

445
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,260
Are you gonna take orders,

446
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,780
or continue undermining
me with every glance?

447
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,200
You're the boss.

448
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,920
Matt, don't do this.

449
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,320
Don't push this any further.

450
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,910
Peter, I got another address for you.

451
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,510
- No...
- What did you see?

452
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,100
No, you go after
this guy and you're dead.

453
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,690
You're all dead. You can't undo it.

454
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,970
This guy's in charge.

455
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,940
Don't listen to him.

456
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,190
This is why we came.

457
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,040
We want to cripple them.
We want to hurt them.

458
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,430
This is the guy.

459
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,960
No, Peter, you're making a big mistake.

460
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,790
You're unraveling things
you don't understand.

461
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,840
Peter!

462
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,990
Peter!

463
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,180
Secure all the exits.

464
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,320
Wait for my order before moving in.

465
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,150
I want eyes on the scene.

466
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,440
You really should lock your windows.

467
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,060
Sir, we have a situation.

468
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,370
Tell me you found Bennet.

469
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,630
No, sir, not Bennet.

470
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,600
Did you already mobilize the unit?

471
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,800
I was waiting for your order, senator.

472
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,130
So you're the one that's driving all this.

473
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,450
Making us run, hide.

474
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,470
Peter, right?

475
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,580
You're the good brother.

476
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,140
Compassionate one.

477
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,940
You want me dead?

478
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,930
Do it.

479
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,770
You wanna die?

480
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,520
No. But you came here
with a mission, right? So...

481
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,510
get it over with.

482
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,490
You think you're innocent?

483
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,860
That you're the good guy?

484
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,940
You broke into my house,
put a gun to my head.

485
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,260
You are the one who's hunting us.

486
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,950
With good reason.

487
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,070
And it's not ever gonna stop.

488
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,430
'Cause if you kill me,
I'll get exactly what I want.

489
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,980
And what is that?

490
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,870
They'll see what I've been telling them.

491
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,590
They'll know just how
dangerous you people are.

492
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,560
He's right, you know.

493
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,140
Hello, Nathan.

494
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,570
Don't do it, Pete.

495
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,480
How the hell'd you get here so fast?

496
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,630
I know you might think I'm
the bad guy here, Pete, and maybe I am.

497
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,450
- But you've gotta believe me when I tell you--
- I don't.

498
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,320
I'm done believing in you.

499
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,780
This isn't you.

500
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,780
All right...

501
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,780
if you kill him.

502
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,850
The order will come down to kill you all, 
and I won't be able to contain-- 
Just shut up!

503
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,060
Shut...up!

504
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,850
Let 'em figure a way out of this.

505
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,400
I was right.

506
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,720
You can't trust either of them. 
Not really.

507
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,680
They're moving in on Matt
and Mohinder right now.

508
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,730
You pull the trigger,
you're signing their death warrant.

509
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,840
Why did you tell him
about Parkman and Suresh?

510
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,360
I just saved your life.

511
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,470
You're welcome!

512
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,900
Move in.

513
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,070
Take 'em now!

514
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,180
They don't know which room we're in.
We should make a break for it.

515
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,570
You're never gonna stop hunting us.

516
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,100
Even when you had the
chance to stop, you didn't.

517
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,140
Daphne's alive, Matt.
They have her, alive.

518
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,950
- You're lying to me.
- No, no, no, no.

519
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,610
See for yourself. I won't fight you.

520
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,760
I go back inside your head
right now and we get caught.

521
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,860
Go in.

522
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,810
Find out.

523
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,780
I'll hold them off.

524
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,340
It's what you've wanted.

525
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,820
All right, go.

526
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,650

527
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,020
This one's alive.

528
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,840
Gunshot wound to the shoulder.

529
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,750
Get a sedative.

530
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,460
It's gonna take three times the
normal amount to keep this one down.

531
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,800
Daphne's alive, Matt.

532
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,630
Come on.

533
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,380
I said come on, all of you!

534
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,580
Matt, listen to me. You're not a killer.

535
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,140
This is only gonna get worse for you.

536
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,880
You're gonna have to escalate
beyond anything you could ever imagine!

537
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,320
You should have just taken
the damn watch and stayed home.

538
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,180
Drop it.

539
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,400
Don't hurt him.

540
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,220
Is there anyone else here?

541
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,660
No, just me.

542
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,260
Let me walk him out.

543
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,060
Just...

544
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,250
let me walk him out.

545
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,780

546
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,550
Take a hard look at yourself
before you judge me.

547
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,880
It wasn't too long ago
you had me tied up.

548
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,810
Don't use me to
rationalize your actions.

549
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,940
What I did,
what you're doing is wrong!

550
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,140
The curtain is up.

551
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,850
The government is involved in this now.

552
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,110
What you did-
What Peter, what Matt did-

553
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,790
it got in the way of what
I'm trying to accomplish.

554
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,840
And what's that, exactly?

555
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,010
The plane you were on.

556
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,750
That was taking you to a facility
that was meant to contain you.

557
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,010
Well, your actions
supported the hard-liners,

558
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,110
who believe you should all be executed.

559
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,500
Me...

560
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,950
I still believe containment can work.

561
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,670
You're gonna round us up
and imprison us forever?

562
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,740
That's your plan?

563
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
That's the first part.

564
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,360
Then we're gonna find a way
to control these powers.

565
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,940
To eliminate them, so we can go back
to living what's left of our lives.

566
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,110
But I need your help.

567
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,830
That's not gonna happen.

568
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,880
You believe science has
all the answers, right?

569
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,910
Why don't you start with her?

570
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,500
Daphne!

571
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,550
She is alive.

572
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,900
For now.

573
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,490
But I'm losing that battle.

574
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:16,730
And unless you help me, I can assure
you that my associates are gonna kill her.

575
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,770
And then they're gonna kill you.

576
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,580
And then they're gonna kill my brother...

577
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,080
and Matt.

578
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,160
You'll all be dead.

579
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,950
Protocol after a man's taken prisoner
is to grant him shore leave.

580
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,360
Maybe you ought to take a few days off.

581
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,850
Matt, my wife kicked me out of the house.

582
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,120
My daughter is scared to death of me.

583
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,470
What am I gonna do with time off?

584
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,290
You were right before.

585
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,710
When you said I was weak
because of my split focus.

586
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,030
That's not gonna be a problem anymore.

587
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,910
The job is all that's left.

588
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,460
You have my complete dedication.

589
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,130
You still think I'm compromised?

590
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,160
They found your storage unit.

591
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,420
Which, unless I'm mistaken,
led you right to them.

592
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,580
You're the one that let 'em get away.

593
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,690
Yeah, I admit...

594
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,650
I underestimated them.

595
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:31,630
They got away because senator Petrelli
let his personal interests cloud his judgment.

596
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,420
Kid gloves are standard issue in this outfit.

597
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,730
You had I have to change that.

598
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,460
You agree?

599
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,680
Absolutely.

600
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,490
So?

601
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:36,260
All things considered, it went pretty well.

602
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,090
I think he trusts me.

603
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,270
Don't be foolish, Noah.

604
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,210
That man trusts no one.

605
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,560
He will continue to test you.

606
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,250
I'm prepared to be tested.

607
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,350
Because he's got it all wrong.

608
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,810
And so does Nathan, for that matter.

609
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,830
There's no halfway anymore.

610
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,870
You're gonna have to play the role.

611
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:03,700
Make tough choices to prove your
loyalty to them, to their cause.

612
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,840
You know me.

613
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,980
I've always been comfortable
with morally gray.

614
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,150
No...no, no.

615
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,400
This can't happen.
All I wanted to do was find Daphne.

616
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,420
This is why I didn't
want to paint the future.

617
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,030
Matt!

618
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,570
You're not capable of this, okay?

619
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,600
You are not a murderer.

620
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,520
How the hell do you explain this?
