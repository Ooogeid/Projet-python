10
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:15,919
you're different.

11
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,320
you're special.

12
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,901
my name is daphne, and why
are you two following me?

13
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:21,233
i want my father's
formula back.

14
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,700
there's supposed to be some sort

15
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,066
of exchange going down
at this theater.

16
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:25,720

17
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,033
you were right.

18
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,500
i am just a killer.

19
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:32,834
i guess you were
wrong about me.

20
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:34,600
we'll see.

21
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,932
you wanna tell me
that's not you?

22

23
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,433

hey!

25
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,101
my name is tracy strauss.

26
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:47,299

27
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,233
know you?

28
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,800
i created you.

29
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,281
i came to find you.

31
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:54,091
i need to show you.

32
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,367

balance.

34

the same in every way.

36
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:04,607

51
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,700
there are few
adverse reactions.

52
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:50,600
the one exception being
an unusual rash.

53
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,667
a byproduct of the formula,
an allergy-

54
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,213
<i>oh, no, please don't!</i>

55
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:57,549

i'm sorry to intrude,

58
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,834

and i wanted to make sure

59
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:05,367
everything was-
everything's fine.

60
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,867

61
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,506
are you sure?

62
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:10,000
'cause it looks

64
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,867

76
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,926
i just need some answers.

77
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,100
what did you do to me?

78
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:51,583
dna manipulation.

79
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:55,001
<i>a formula that would
make you incredible.</i>

80
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,333
speed, strength.

81
00:02:57,922 --> 00:03:00,870
is it something like that?

82
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,764
why?

83
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,767
why would you do this?

84
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,433
what gave you the right?

85
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,946
<i>we had no right.</i>

86
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:19,300
we were arrogant
and selfish and...

87
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,333
human.

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,967
who?
who wanted this?

89
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,734
i think i've said
too much already.

90
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,990
they would not like that.

91
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,597
give me a name.

92
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:31,990
<i>someone!</i>

93
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,467
there was a company.

94
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,300
a company that-

95
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:39,095
um, i don't remember.

96
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,115
i can't remember.

97
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,600
you're lying.

98
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,767
they made us forget.

99
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:46,400
well, then you have
to take it away.

100
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,267
this... thing that i can do.

101
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,433
i can't.

102
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,166
no, you don't understand.

103
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,867
this ability...

104
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,800
i've hurt people.

105
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,227
it is part of you now.

106
00:03:58,227 --> 00:03:59,901
no, i never asked for it.

107
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,700
you need to take it away.

108
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:02,700
i can't.

109
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,800
tell me how to take it away.

110
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:06,267
ah!
tell me.

111
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,643
i'm so sorry.

112
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,500
what have you done?

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,467
who is she?

114
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:20,200
<i>what happened to her?</i>

115
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:21,975
it's your future, parkman.

116
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:23,708
not mine.

117
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,367
yeah, it is, okay.

118
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,033
so that means i can stop that
from happening, right?

119
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,426
do you really want to know?

120
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,276
this stuff is supposed
to show me my future?

121
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,660
i don't think this is working.

122
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,500
here.

123
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:52,166
try this.

124
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:30,691
come on.

125
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,233
where are we?

126
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,901
<i>when are we?</i>

127
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,771
<i>this is the future
i came back to stop.</i>

128
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:36,444
why?

129
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:37,634
it looks just like today.

130
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:42,800
with one big difference.

131
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,100
how is this possible?

132
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,333
<i>an injection.</i>

133
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,807
abilities are available
to anyone.

134
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,297
for sale if you
can afford it.

135
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,967
for grabs if you're
desperate enough.

136
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,400
now all these people
with abilities

137
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,986
are gonna destroy the world.

138
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,534
how could you know that?

139
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,700
how would you?

140
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:10,700
i painted it.

141
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:11,867
dreamed it.

142
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:13,634
it's going to happen-
here, look.

143
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:17,001
all the crime, murder,
all abilities.

144
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,200
people can't be trusted.

145
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,113
we're weak,
jealous,

146
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:20,965
violent.

147
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,467
there's always
good people, always.

148
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:23,934
how could i be so naive?

149
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,100
when abilities are
the new weapon of choice-

150
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,600
people will
control themselves.

151
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,667
it's not safe for me
to be out in the open.

152
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:32,949
they'll be looking for us.

153
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:34,222
i needed you to see.

154
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:35,238
who are "they"?

155
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:36,619
what did you do?

156
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,967
they think i'm an extremist.

157
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,208
a villain.

158
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,819
i had to stop it.

159
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:42,927
maybe they're right.

160
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,068
you shot nathan.

161
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:44,953
you killed him.

162
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:45,820
he was gonna tell everyone

163
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,834
the truth about us.

164
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,166
but he d didn't die.

165
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,233
and now he
doesn't have to.

166
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,233
so why hasn't
everything changed?

167
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,447
someone from your time
is putting together a formula

168
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:57,087
that gives people abilities.

169
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:58,421
you have to stop him.

170
00:06:58,421 --> 00:06:59,094
why me?

171
00:06:59,094 --> 00:06:59,943
why can't you do it?

172
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:01,642
because i made
terrible choices.

173
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:04,834
stepped on
too many butterflies.

174
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:05,967
what does that mean?

175
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,303
you can't make
the same mistakes as me.

176
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:10,834
we need to find sylar.

177
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:11,967
with his ability,

178
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,367
you won't make
the same mistakes.

179
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,353
sylar, what the hell
are you talking about?

180
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:17,634
i wanna see nathan,
claire, suresh.

181
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,433
they're not the people
you think they are.

182
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,800
why not?

183
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,967
not all of us were born
with abilities, okay?

184
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:24,700
some of us were made.

185
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:25,992
a line was drawn.

186
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:27,817
sides were chosen.
it tore us apart.

187
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,265
well, you actually did it.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
you killed peter.

189
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,300
no.

190
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,299
he's still alive.

191
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,633
<i>looks plenty dead to me.</i>

192
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,933
there were two of them.

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,199
this one and a younger one
from the past.

194
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,288
this is bad, right?

195
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:30,099
bad-bad.

196
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,132
yeah, we have orders.

197
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,741
kill petrelli.

198
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,800
it's obviously easier said
than done.

199
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:36,507
we need to use molly.

200
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,733
she can find peter
anywhere in the world.

201
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,266
you know i can't
just do that.

202
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,566
it's not that simple.

203
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:45,700
<i>it is.</i>

204
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:48,466
if you won't ask her,
i will.

205
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,199
i'm not afraid of you.

206
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,505
no, but you are
afraid of peter.

207
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:57,266
and you know he won't stop,
not ever.

208
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,633
<i>until we find him...</i>

209
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,519
and we kill him.

210
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,739
let me out!

211
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,733
i must save the world!

212
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,511
the future depends on it!

213
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,531
we have to get  out 
of here,ando.

214
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,123
there must be 
another way...

215
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,279
ah! the vent!

216
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:29,106
but, it's too high.

217
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:31,015
ando,come on and give me a hand.

218
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,231
i'm not talking to you.

219
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,441
what?
what did i do?

220
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,478
you said you 
didn't need me.

221
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:42,185
you said you don't know
why you take me along!

222
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,954
you're so powerful.
help yourself.

223
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:49,403
i followed you 
around the world.

224
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:54,253
risked my life for you because i
believed we were friends.partners.

225
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:57,140
you know what i think?

226
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,608
i think you're still upset that
future me murders future you.

227
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:03,921
and what if i am....?

228
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,982
i knew it!

229
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,473
i can't help it.

230
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,861
every time i look at you i see it
over and over again.

231
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,133
how could you kill me ?

232
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:16,620
i would never hurt you.

233
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,105
but i'm starting to 
understand why i might.

234
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,299
senator petrelli?

235
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:30,166
senator, you need
to make your choice.

236
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:32,199
there are a lotta
historical desks available.

237
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,732
<i>where's tracy?</i>

238
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,766
isn't it her job
to make these decisions?

239
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,099
well, ms. strauss
isn't answering her cell.

240
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:40,778
take the john foster dulles.

241
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:42,700
it sends the right message.

242
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:43,700
which one
would you pick?

243
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:47,083
uh, robert kennedy's.

244
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,299
kennedy it is,
thank you.

245
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,933
you know, i thought you'd
be enjoying this.

246
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,566
you're a senator back
in the seat of power

247
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,254
where you belong.

248
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:04,900
able to do god's
work here on earth.

249
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:05,967
god's work?

250
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,099
i'm picking out desks.

251
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:11,467
what's the real
problem here, nathan?

252
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,235
you.

253
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:13,800
you're the real problem.

254
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:15,616
y- you don't trust me?

255
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:17,099
i'm hurt.

256
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,800
i'm the only one
who can see you.

257
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,600
that's a problem.

258
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,967
don't play me, okay?

259
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:24,067
i've been around people
who can do amazing things.

260
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:25,232
what are you?

261
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:26,232
what, are you a telepath?

262
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,866
no.

263
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,366
nothing that obvious.

264
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,833
you know what it is?

265
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,266
it's brain damage
from the shooting.

266
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,833
the shooting that you so
miraculously survived.

267
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,132
come on, nathan.

268
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,366
i mean, healing, flying.

269
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,666
i mean, isn't that
the work of angels?

270
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,933
you saying you're an angel?

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,166
you're a murderer.

272
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,900
<i>you wanted to destroy
new york city.</i>

273
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,666
kill millions
of people.

274
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,199
if i remember correctly,

275
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:52,266
you did too.

276
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,366
what exactly do
you want from me?

277
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,299
i want to help you.

278
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,299
first, a senator.

279
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,132
then president.

280
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,141
president.

281
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,666
the greater the fall,
the grander the ascension.

282
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,033
<i>isn't that what
you've always wanted?</i>

283
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,132
trust me.

284
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:19,166
this is the path
to salvation.

285
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,987
it's not my path.

286
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,299
not if you're
leading the way.

287
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,566
this place is disgusting.

288
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,929
the milk's gone bad.

289
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,053
didn't you notice?

290
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:38,235
look, i don't need you
cleaning up after me.

291
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,139
well, obviously you do.

292
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,440
ugh.

293
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,099
you don't look well.

294
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,943
i'm just tired.

295
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:48,888
no wonder.

296
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:50,843
working all hours.

297
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,099
no food, no fresh air.

298
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,733
i have lots to do.

299
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,212
come on,
let's get outta here.

300
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:57,314
i can't.

301
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:02,222
but it's a beautiful
day outside.

302
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:04,433
and you've been
cooped up in here-

303
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,533
working for you.

304
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,942
trying to find some way
to take away your ability!

305
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,914
isn't that
what you want?

306
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:16,067
i came because
i care about you.

307
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:17,582
you want me to go?

308
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:18,399
fine.

309
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,933
wait.

310
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,020
i- i-i didn't mean to yell.

311
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:27,166
i- i'm just tired.

312
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,533
i will find the answers...

313
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,166
for you.

314
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:32,749
i promise.

315
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,800
journal entry 13.

316
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,166
the rash is spreading.

317
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,666
i don't know what it is

318
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,266
or its connection
to my aggression.

319
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:01,358
the formula is
transforming me, and i fear...

320
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:05,124
i fear what i'm becoming.

321
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,466
<i>the formula is transforming me.</i>

322
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,766
<i>i fear what i'm becoming.</i>

323
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,891
<i>the formula is transforming me,
and i fear...</i>

324
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:19,818
<i>i fear what i'm becoming.</i>

325
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,125
mohinder?

326
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,933
<i>what do you want?</i>

327
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,385
i need your help.

328
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,566
i need you to tell me
everything you know about sylar.

329
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,866
sylar?

330
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,666
<i>i have to find him.</i>

331
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,900
he's supposed to...
help me.

332
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,287
but why?

333
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:10,600
why sylar?

334
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,533
<i>mohinder, are you okay?</i>

335
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,200
what happened to you?
what's going on?

336
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:16,533
mohinder!

337
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:21,827
do not repeat my mistakes.

338
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,663
what happened to you?

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,700
i wanted abilities.

340
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,299
impetuous.

341
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:36,800
selfish.

342
00:15:36,866 --> 00:15:39,000
<i>i got the formula wrong.</i>

343
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,533
so wrong.

344
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,700
let me help you.

345
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:46,633
tell me about sylar.

346
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,633
sylar's power is dangerous.

347
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,466
you don't understand it.

348
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,766
i need to understand.

349
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,299
where is he?

350
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,132
<i>where's sylar?</i>

351
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
costa verde, the bennet house.

352
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,067
don't go!

353
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:28,768
hey, uncle peter.

354
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,731
<i>dad's making waffles.</i>

355
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,433
what's up, champ?

356
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:35,933
how you doing, man?

357
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,663
good to see you.

358
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,566
raa!

359
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,273
who wants some waffles,
huh?

360
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:42,866
<i>who else should
get some waffles?</i>

361
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:43,967
<i>mr. muggles.</i>

362
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,833
<i>okay, a little piece
of waffle.</i>

363
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,166
but just 'cause
you're such a good boy.

364
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,466
yes, you're so good.

365
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,266
<i>always such a good dog.</i>

366
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,366
yes, you're a very good doggy.

367
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,272
peter, it's so good
to see you.

368
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,366
i haven't seen you
in so long.

369
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:03,426
if you told me you were coming,
i would've made extra.

370
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,026
what's the magic word?

371
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:23,932
abracadabra.

372
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:28,194
<i>well, that's a magic word,
so that's close enough.</i>

373
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,787
where's your scar,
uncle peter?

374
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:36,633
you know what?

375
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,589
grown-ups need to have
a little chat in the other room.

376
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:40,766
so i'm gonna get you
started on your waffle.

377
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:41,955
<i>all right,
there you go.</i>

378
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:43,140
you gonna be okay?

379
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:44,793
yes.

380
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:45,964
yes, i know you are.

381
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,034
we're just gonna be
in the other room, all right?

382
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,233
you're not from
around here, are you?

383
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,499
no scar.

384
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:09,033
the past, right?

385
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,833
<i>which means, to you,</i>

386
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,559
i'm the boogeyman.

387
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:15,733
it's a hell of a thing.

388
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,000
you coming here to find out

389
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,133
that you and i
are brothers.

390
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,599
brothers?

391
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,285
oh, i'm sorry that you've come
all this way, peter,

392
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:23,523
but i can't help you.

393
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:24,482
can't?

394
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,762
i won't.

395
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:27,996
why?

396
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:31,503
i'm not gonna give it to you,
my ability, i'm not.

397
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:33,665
then i'll just take
what i need from you.

398
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,067
as if you could.

399
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,200
peter is dead.

400
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:44,700
they killed him.

401
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:45,900
and now they're after me.

402
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:48,067
i am not leaving
without your ability, sylar.

403
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,140
my name is gabriel.

404
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,982
and you don't realize...

405
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:59,309
my ability is not just
understanding how things work.

406
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,671
there's a hunger

407
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:01,913
<i>that comes with it.</i>

408
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:03,846
<i>to know more,
to have more.</i>

409
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:05,400
i couldn't control it.

410
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:07,238
it had turned me
into a killer.

411
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:09,508
a monster.

412
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,475
every day is a struggle.

413
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:13,887
every hour.

414
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:15,629
<i>but i fight it...</i>

415
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,765
for him.

416
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,680
<i>and i am not...</i>

417
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,819
going to willingly
condemn you to hell.

418
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:23,882
if i have your ability-

419
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,162
if i can understand
the variables, then i-

420
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:27,599
can save the world.

421
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:31,113
the world always
needs saving, peter.

422
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,574
you're all gonna die.

423
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,888
your family.

424
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,367
your son.

425
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:39,434
this world is gonna end.

426
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:40,833
you don't believe me?

427
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,900
here.

428
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,133
paint it.

429
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,967
see for yourself.

430
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,267
paint the future.

431
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:50,972
don't let him see me.

432
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,233
not like this.

433
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,037
do you understand?

434
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:10,345
no, no way.

435
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:12,146
no, we're not dragging
molly into this. what?

436
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:13,807
<i>well, we're both
raising her.</i>

437
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:15,367
<i>yes, to be
a normal little girl.</i>

438
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:17,000
not to be your bloodhound.

439
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,833
no, it's just this once.

440
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,136
we use her ability
to find peter.

441
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,280
peter petrelli is a murderer
and a terrorist and-

442
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,235
and he's the villain,
not me.

443
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,666
this is our chance
to stop peter now.

444
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,432
forever.

445
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:32,519
i just-i-

446
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,555
i don't understand
why you would risk your life

447
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,475
when you've got
this beautiful baby girl

448
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:38,287
waiting for you at home.

449
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,689
you are beautiful.

450
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,025
this is everything to me.

451
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:49,977
you, this family-

452
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:52,205
and this is the part where
the "but" comes in, daniella.

453
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:54,372
but i was a cop.

454
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:56,143
and i know what it's like
to have a spouse who's worried

455
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:57,434
if you're ever gonna
come home alive.

456
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:59,060
i'm gonna be fine.

457
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,487
nothing can touch me.

458
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:01,197
right.

459
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:03,197
you're a wife and a mother.

460
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:05,391
it's time for you
to slow down.

461
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,114
we find peter.

462
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:12,350
we catch him and then
you can consider me settled.

463
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,793
you're not gonna
let this go, are you?

464
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,007
and miss a chance
to stop peter

465
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:19,410
and all the pain
and misery he's caused?

466
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:21,759
we have to.

467
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,200
molly.

468
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:34,233
you guys done arguing?

469
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,800
uh, we-we weren't-

470
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:40,706
your mother needs
to talk to you for a second.

471
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,473
everything's gonna be fine.

472
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,267
peter's in costa verde.

473
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,837
sylar.

474
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:01,434
sylar, yeah.

475
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:04,414
<i>you're afraid.</i>

476
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,365
don't act like i don't know
what i'm talking about.

477
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:08,751
you stink of it.

478
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,037
so what if i am?

479
00:22:10,114 --> 00:22:12,442
so claire bennet
isn't afraid of anything.

480
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,167
i just killed my uncle

481
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,400
<i>and i have to do it again.</i>

482
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:17,866
give me a second
to be a human being.

483
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,067
you see, the problem is,
claire,

484
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:24,434
unlike you,
daphne and i can die.

485
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:26,600
so get your
head on straight.

486
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:47,045
sylar?

487
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:49,092
it's a scar.

488
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,037
<i>a reminder of what i was.</i>

489
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,800
<i>of what i can be.</i>

490
00:22:52,866 --> 00:22:54,454
fix it.

491
00:22:54,454 --> 00:22:55,966
i don't know a thing
about watches.

492
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,771
if you wanna learn how
to access my ability,

493
00:22:57,771 --> 00:23:00,085
fix the watch.

494
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,929
listen to it.

495
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,639
like a symphony,

496
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,367
every piece has its part.

497
00:23:06,434 --> 00:23:08,598
all coming together
in perfect harmony.

498
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:10,986
<i>if you can understand
the complexities of a watch,</i>

499
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,692
<i>you can understand anything.</i>

500
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,233
everything.

501
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,599
cause, effect,

502
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,664
action, reaction.

503
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,690
<i>how to change the future.</i>

504
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:31,050
you have it now.

505
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,599
i'm so sorry.

506
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,037
<i>daddy!</i>

507
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,300
not now, noah.

508
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,621
<i>yes, now.</i>

509
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,100
noah, stay where you are,
buddy.

510
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:50,197
<i>noah.</i>

511
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:53,974
it's gonna be okay, buddy.

512
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,226
let's not make
this any harder

513
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,931
than it already is, peter.

514
00:23:57,931 --> 00:24:00,908
<i>just come quietly,
and we'll leave them alone.</i>

515
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:01,793
<i>don't do it, peter.</i>

516
00:24:01,793 --> 00:24:02,912
<i>teleport out now.</i>

517
00:24:02,912 --> 00:24:03,730
i'm not leaving you.

518
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,233
i brought this
into your house.

519
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,756
no.

520
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:07,207
this was my house.

521
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:08,700
you took everything from me.

522
00:24:08,766 --> 00:24:10,783
claire, i never meant
for you-

523
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,010
shut up.

524
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,887
what's it gonna be?

525
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:17,032
<i>the boy or you?</i>

526
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,560
you don't want anyone
to get hurt, do you?

527
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,011
just, first,
let the boy go.

528
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,000
not until you're dead.

529
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:27,161
you're gonna kill me?

530
00:24:27,697 --> 00:24:30,335
<i>one bullet in the back of
the head should do the trick.</i>

531
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:34,092
then i'll let the boy go.

532
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:35,733
i'm not the guy that you killed
this morning, claire.

533
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
look, this is me.

534
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:42,533
you're not gonna kill me.

535
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,422
yes, i am.

536
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,471
what happened to you?

537
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,633
how'd you get this way?

538
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:51,811
i learned how
to take care of myself.

539
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,414
noah!

540
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:58,511
daddy!

541
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:00,177
go hide over there.

542
00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:01,040
go now.

543
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,308
i understand your power.

544
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,766
you get stronger with fear.

545
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,310
i'm not afraid of you.

546
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,566
but he is.

547
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,067
noah, run!

548
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,436
run!

549
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,973

or my father speaking?

654
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,291
both.

i'm not ignorant.

659
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:56,130
i've seen the paintings.

660
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,310

everybody with abilities.

666
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,546

because of costa verde.

670
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:24,719

00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,654
people can't be trusted.

673
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:32,553
that we're all greedy.

674
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:34,111
power hungry.

675
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:36,919
but we were created
in god's image, pete.

676
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,029

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,300
you never left.

737
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:09,940
you were asleep.

738
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:12,300
dreaming.
dreaming?

739
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:13,867
no, no, no.

740
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,734
no, it was real.

741
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,834
it was.

742
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:18,001
i was there.
she was there.

743
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,679
<i>everybody had abilities.</i>

744
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,367
the bomb.

745
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,133
the baby.

746
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,200
it was real.

747
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:43,509
<i>her name's daphne.</i>

748
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:44,867
i gotta find her.

749
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:46,333
it's a big world.

750
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,867
lots of people.

751
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:49,656
you sent me
on this journey.

752
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:50,400
come on.

753
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,367
you must find your totem.

754
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:55,700
a spirit guide that attaches
to your subconscious.

755
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:58,233
it will lead you
on your journey.

756
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,734
what is that, some african,
mystical, mojo thing?

757
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
carl jung.

758
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,467
analytical psychology.

759
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,500
you don't read much, do you?

760
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,333
all right.

761
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,367
what is this totem supposed
to look like anyway?

762
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:14,901
usually an animal.

763
00:40:16,073 --> 00:40:18,137
think about your dream...

764
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,668
and you'll find your guide.

765
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:50,267
where is kaito's
part of the formula?

766
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,267
what's so important
about this formula?

767
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:55,901
it can turn people like you
into people like us.

768
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:58,244
<i>and that will lead to disaster.</i>

769
00:40:58,244 --> 00:40:59,767
so the formula is gone.

770
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:01,667
stolen.

771
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:04,267
there were two parts
to that formula.

772
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,287
they have both
and we have lost.

773
00:41:07,934 --> 00:41:09,949
your father
loved you dearly, hiro.

774
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:13,139
he had faith you would grow up
to be a great man.

775
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,934
but he was mistaken.

776
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:18,267
and his folly will be
the downfall of us all.

777
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,827
i am sorry.

778
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:22,467
no, you're not.

779
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:23,534
i'm not?

780
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,912
<i>don't apologize to her.</i>

781
00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:26,129
this is hiro nakamura.

782
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:28,800
he will not rest until
that formula is safe.

783
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:30,800
what he said.

784
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,967
someone is manipulating us.

785
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:37,600
<i>someone powerful.</i>

786
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,166
<i>hidden.</i>

787
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:40,934
and they must be stopped.

788
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:43,104
i will find them
and stop them.

789
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:45,657
actually,
you're the only one who can.

790
00:41:45,657 --> 00:41:48,727
you have the key to unlocking
this entire mystery.

791
00:41:48,727 --> 00:41:49,800
i do?

792
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:50,867
hmm?

793
00:42:01,234 --> 00:42:05,223
if i knew i had the key-- 
i wouldn't have buried it so deep.

794
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:08,682
are you sure this is a good idea?

795
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:13,264
no. but there's no turning back now.

796
00:42:24,186 --> 00:42:26,263
hiro, you son of a-
