00:00:00,728 --> 00:00:02,184
<i>Previously, on</i> Heroes...

2
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:03,875
I've no idea how
you're pulling this off,

3
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:06,932
but I swear to God I'm not gonna stop
until I figure it out, get it?

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,527
I'm just trying to figure out how
to take care of our family...

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,830
I don't have a job, Jan!

6
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:17,232
They're gonna pay for what
they did to me, what they did to us.

7
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:19,661
There is no pulling
this whole thing behind you,

8
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:22,163
we gotta find out
what they did and make them fix it!

9
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:24,364
You wanted to know why
I was invisible all these years,

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,691
it was because of them.

11
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:29,062
And you throw the bastards
right to my door!

12
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,925
Tell me Claire,
can you keep... a secret?

13
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:35,425
I think I know how I survived the fire.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,516
Please say something.

15
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,020
Some family, that's how I survived it.

16
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,663
Your mother has a subdural hemorrhage.

17
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:53,740
It's like a bruise on her brain,

18
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:56,007
specifically the area
that controls memory.

19
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:57,587
You erased her mind.

20
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:59,334
Claire, that's ridiculous...

21
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:01,042
You tried to erase mine!

22
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:02,681
What you know is dangerous.

23
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,794
Why did you do this to mom?

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,215
I only wanted to protect my family...

25
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,888
I've had enough of that!

26
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:48,178
Don't, don't, don't!

27
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:50,258
I'm not gonna nuke the dog!

28
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,233
I wouldn't hurt...

29
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:54,847
- Mr. Muggles, would I?
- You know what,

30
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:57,273
if you wanted to hurt this guy,
that'd be the way to do it.

31
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:59,026
There are more pictures
of dogs around here

32
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,278
than there are of his kids.

33
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:04,141
You don't really think that
he's stupid and/or sloppy enough

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,144
to leave incriminating evidence
around the house.

35
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:07,828
He did just get raided by the FBI.

36
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,501
We couldn't get
a warrant for the house,

37
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:14,214
so in the off chance that
he is a little sloppy or stupid,

38
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:16,668
- I wanna poke around.
- So now we're jacking his computer?

39
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:18,768
You wanna sit around
all day and download files?

40
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,372
- I don't.
- If we don't find anything on his PC,

41
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:23,608
there's is somewhere else we can look.

42
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,889
- Inside his head!
- I plan on that.

43
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:28,734
We're gonna bag the smug
son of a bitch at his paper factory.

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,056
See how he likes it.

45
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:40,908
Maybe we can bag him here.

46
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,673
Oh, God. He's with his family.

47
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,762
Family's a pretty good motivator.

48
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,315
No, no.
I am not taking any hostages.

49
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:47,715
We bag him at the paper factory.

50
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:48,966
No, no, no.
That was Plan A.

51
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,261
Plan B is much better.

52
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,521
There is no Plan B. We leave... now!

53
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:55,868
How many times you gonna let
this guy slip through your fingers?

54
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:17,091
Lyle, help your mother.

55
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,342
Claire, talk to me!

56
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,472
What's the point?

57
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,278
Am I even gonna remember
this conversation?

58
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:30,767
Would you keep your voice down?

59
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:35,965
Lyle, take your mother
and get out of the house right now!

60
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:41,751
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

61
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:43,062
We all do.

62
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:45,013
Honey, what's happening?

63
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,576
Yeah dad, what's happening?

64
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,179
<i>Stay calm.</i>

65
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:55,151
Yeah,
let's just everyone stay calm.

66
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,851
Okay, everyone stays calm,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

67
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:01,016
This is Officer Parkman of the LAPD.

68
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:03,279
Formerly of the LAPD thanks to you.

69
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,089
What do you want from me?

70
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:06,797
You come into my house with guns?

71
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:07,798
Not guns.

72
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,007
Gun.

73
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:11,662
I don't need a gun, do I, Mr. Bennet?

74
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,368
Not after what you did to me.

75
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
I don't know you.

76
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:18,116
If you insist on lying,
you're gonna upset me.

77
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:20,439
And you know what happens
when I get upset,

78
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,299
I get very bright...

79
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:24,111
and very hot.

80
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,191
Ted is gonna do us all a favor,

81
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,479
right, Ted--

82
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,048
and he's not gonna get upset.
But you gotta help.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,188
I'm not who you think I am.

84
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,701
I'm just a paper salesman.

85
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:39,196
No... you're not.

86
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:48,207
So tell me.

87
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:50,676
How do you feel about paper?

88
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:53,621
- Widly enthusiastic. - Good.

89
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,169
'Cause as far as
friends and family are concerned,

90
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,354
it's your life.

91
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:58,571
Congratulations.

92
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,242
You are the new regional manager
for Primatech Paper.

93
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:03,586
Nice cover.

94
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:07,141
Sorry to make a liar out of you.
But it's part and parcel of what we do.

95
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:09,853
Nobody outside the organization knows.

96
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:11,317
Well, they can't know.

97
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,959
People are fragile... like tea cups.

98
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,330
All around them, the world is changing

99
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,974
and they simply don't wanna deal
with it.

100
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,857
They don't wanna know
what's happening to us as a species.

101
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:24,294
And they certainly don't wanna know
the measures we take

102
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:25,497
to keep them safe.

103
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:29,554
Now you'll be asked to do things
that fall into morally grey territory.

104
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,756
Things that most would find cruel...

105
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:36,410
but men like you and I
know to be necessary.

106
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:39,317
I'm comfortable with morally grey.

107
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,396
Good.

108
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:41,722
You will have a partner.

109
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,530
One of them.

110
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,384
That's how we do it here.
Keeps us all honest.

111
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:48,454
Great! When do I meet him?

112
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:50,694
He's already here.

113
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:54,484
Is this a test?

114
00:05:57,434 --> 00:06:01,902
How did-- how did-- how is that--

115
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,823
It's a brave new world, friend.

116
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,635
Go ahead. Tell 'em what you do.

117
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:17,684
What goes on at that "paper factory"
of yours, Mr. Bennet?

118
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:19,067
He abducts people!

119
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,876
He-- he drugs us!

120
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,472
He injects us with I don't know what.

121
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:30,534
I lost my job

122
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,952
and I am trying not to lose my wife.

123
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:36,292
But you don't care about that?
You don't care about what you did to me.

124
00:06:36,293 --> 00:06:37,988
All you care about

125
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,250
is that we think that nothing happened.

126
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:41,402
Makes us forget.

127
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:44,544
How can he make you forget?

128
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:46,859
<i>The Haitian.</i>

129
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,454
That's right. The Haitian.

130
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:52,571
She knows?

131
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,837
<i>This is your fault.</i>

132
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,088
She knows this is his fault.

133
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:03,738
He's got 'em all fooled except for her.

134
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:07,334
Just when you thought
plausible deniability

135
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:08,992
was gonna save your ass.

136
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,169
<i>The Haitian...</i>

137
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,085
<i>He made my mother forget.</i>

138
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,801
... made her mother forget...
and her brother but not...

139
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:23,440
Why didn't he make you forget?

140
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,024
What is he talking about, Claire?

141
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:27,995
I don't know anything.

142
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,070
You wanna put a stop to all this?

143
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,686
All you need to do
to keep your family safe,

144
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:35,574
to keep us all safe,
is just tell the truth.

145
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:36,835
I am telling the truth.

146
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,247
No, this... is the truth!

147
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,629
Oh, my God!

148
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,022
This is what you did to me.

149
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:48,995
Settle down, Ted.

150
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:52,961
I just wanna be normal again.

151
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:58,903
He's not a paper salesman.

152
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,973
Guess she's not
Daddy little girl anymore.

153
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:16,306
Subtitles: www.swsub.com

154
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,419
What are they doing?

155
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:37,548
He's getting
inside your daughter's head.

156
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:41,185
<i>I can run. Get some help.
They can hurt me.</i>

157
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,389
I know you're thinking about
being a hero-- don't!

158
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:44,907
Don't! This guy is serious.

159
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,970
And he's really dangerous
and I need your help

160
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,500
to make sure that nobody gets hurt.

161
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,926
You can read my mind.

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,692
Yeah, that's something
your dad did to me.

163
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:55,382
It didn't just happen?

164
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,931
I wouldn't be here right now
if it just happened.

165
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,504
Has my dad done this to other people?

166
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:04,362
As far as I can tell,
it's different with everyone.

167
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,751
I've seen some weird things.

168
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,438
I'm sure you have too,
like that stuff at your school.

169
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:12,308
<i>Peter Petrelli.</i>

170
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:16,867
Peter Petrelli?

171
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:20,903
He can do what I can do.
What do you know about him?

172
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:22,406
<i>He can do what I can do.</i>

173
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,563
He's different... like you.

174
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,825
Save the cheerleader.

175
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:33,561
I read his mind, he read mine.

176
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:36,344
He told me to protect you...

177
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:39,337
from someone
who was killing people like me.

178
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:43,390
Are you different, Claire?

179
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:51,662
Your blood
was all over that crime scene.

180
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:54,474
You didn't have a scratch on you.

181
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,765
Why didn't you have a scratch on you?

182
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:03,807
<i>I can heal.</i>

183
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:08,636
Did my dad make me this way?

184
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,485
What are they gonna do with the baby?

185
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,586
I don't know.

186
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:23,907
I wonder if they knew
about little orphan Annie

187
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:26,411
before they sent us over there
to bag a bloody fire starter.

188
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,588
They would've told us.

189
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:41,247
Claude... a word, please.

190
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,784
Did you make me this way?

191
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:20,370
Is that why you adopted me?
Am I some sort of experiment?!

192
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:21,870
Don't talk to your father like that.

193
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:22,988
He's not my father.

194
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,636
They have nothing to do with this.

195
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:26,657
- He's the one who got 'em involved.
- No, we did,

196
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,746
when we didn't leave this house
when they came home.

197
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:31,138
No one's been hurt.
What's he gonna do, call the police?

198
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,371
We can get out of here now.

199
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:34,433
We didn't get what we came for.
We came for a cure.

200
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:35,649
What if there isn't one?

201
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:38,597
<i>I'll kill us all.</i>

202
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:45,588
Just get inside his head
and get some answers

203
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:47,914
or we're all gonna have
a really bad day.

204
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,504
That son of a bitch is thinking
in Japanese.

205
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:56,636
Why are you thinking in Japanese?

206
00:12:57,868 --> 00:12:58,868
We want answers!

207
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:01,373
Who are you?

208
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:02,917
And what did you do to us?

209
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:07,107
<i>In the den... the safe in the bookcase.</i>

210
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:09,175
Ted, there's a safe in the bookcase.

211
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:30,375
Enough! We're done.

212
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,426
We are not done! I'm calling your bluff.

213
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:38,190
Mom.

214
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,493
Put the gun down.
That's not gonna help anybody.

215
00:13:42,494 --> 00:13:44,237
He killed my wife. Only fair I kill his.

216
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,599
And with his own gun too.

217
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,817
Kinda poetic, don't you think?

218
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,705
Tell him what he wants to know!

219
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,490
Come on! He's willing to kill us all.

220
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,292
Leave her alone. She didn't do anything.

221
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:56,333
Claire, sit down.

222
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:58,212
Shoot me if you're gonna shoot someone.

223
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:03,345
<i>Parkman, you have to trust me.
Shoot Claire.</i>

224
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:05,452
I'm telling you someone's gonna die.

225
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:07,026
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bennet.

226
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:08,998
<i>Shoot Claire now. She can heal.</i>

227
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:11,629
<i>Shoot me!</i>

228
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,138
You brought this on yourself.

229
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,587
What did you do?!

230
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:36,856
What did you do?!

231
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:39,724
What did you do that for?

232
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:43,162
<i>Get his trust.</i>

233
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:45,634
Now he knows how far we'll go.

234
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,593
<i>Right hook. Right hook coming.</i>

235
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:49,875
Bastard!

236
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:51,323
You killed my little girl!

237
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,296
You-- you did!

238
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,176
Tell me it's not true.

239
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:08,468
Don't leave her here!

240
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:10,336
<i>Move Claire's body before it heals.</i>

241
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:14,333
They don't need to see her like this.
We gotta move the body.

242
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:18,181
I had no idea it was gonna go this far.

243
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:20,330
Believe me.
He was going to kill your wife.

244
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:22,418
I actually heard him pull the trigger
in his mind.

245
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:23,897
Thank you for shooting first.

246
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:41,287
Oh my God.

247
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,767
- Where's mom and Lyle?
- Downstairs.

248
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:46,826
- Are they safe?
- No.

249
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:48,271
Wait, you made her indestructible?

250
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:51,118
I didn't make anyone.
You don't have all your facts straight

251
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,969
and I don't appreciate
your confusing my daughter.

252
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:55,875
The facts are
you work at some freak factory

253
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,382
where you ruin people's lives.

254
00:15:57,383 --> 00:16:00,238
You've been misled. I will explain
everything later. But right now,

255
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,367
you have to do exactly
what I tell you to do.

256
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:03,681
<i>I'm going to the police.</i>

257
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,595
Wait, wait.
Do not make the same mistake I did.

258
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:09,008
Don't put your family at risk.

259
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:19,744
Yeah, coming!

260
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,484
The people I work for
don't know about you.

261
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:27,290
If they did,
you wouldn't be here right now.

262
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,787
They would've taken you months ago

263
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,964
and we never would've seen you again.

264
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:35,796
You said you want a normal life.
That's what I've been fighting for.

265
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,261
He's telling the truth.

266
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,405
Hate me all you want,

267
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:45,840
but right now, this has to be contained.

268
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:48,494
Which means you have to stay put.

269
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:51,312
You want me to play dead?
I'm sorry. I'm not Mr. Muggles.

270
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,412
That man downstairs can generate
a chain reaction

271
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:56,056
which would be like dropping
a nuclear bomb on this house.

272
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,979
And he'll do it too.
Come on, we gotta go now.

273
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:00,864
Just do what I say so nobody gets hurt.
And you.

274
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:02,405
Do what I think.

275
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:16,864
- Enough!
- No!

276
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:19,836
That's enough!
We already got their attention.

277
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:25,436
We're not gonna find anything here.
What we want is at the paper factory.

278
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:26,477
- Really?
- Yeah.

279
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:29,996
Did he tell you that or think it?

280
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,077
There are records of the abductions--
what they've done.

281
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:34,926
In exchange for his family's safety,

282
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,325
he'll get them for us.

283
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:38,988
I don't want anybody else to die
because of what I've done to you.

284
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:41,439
Why do all words coming out
of your mouth sound like lies?

285
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
He's not lying.

286
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,337
We'll have proof.

287
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:48,743
No surprises at the factory.

288
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:49,744
Just the truth.

289
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,782
I'll stay with the family. You go.

290
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,576
I'll stay with the family.

291
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:58,633
I can do more damage here.

292
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:01,100
Whatever you say. You're in control.

293
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:02,815
Sandra--

294
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,505
I'm gonna get us out of this.

295
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:10,491
It's 7:00 AM.

296
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,068
If you're not back in an hour,

297
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,065
look for the mushroom cloud.

298
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,016
I think my wife suspects something.

299
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,702
She went through my bag.
She found a gun and a sedation kit.

300
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:30,879
That's a particular kind of stupid
on your part

301
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,782
- for letting her find them.
- I know, I know.

302
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,688
The baby's been keeping me up for days.

303
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,689
It was sloppy.

304
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:38,642
I think Sandra thinks
I'm some sort of a serial killer.

305
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:40,642
She's better off thinking
you're a serial killer

306
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:41,995
than knowing the truth.

307
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:43,950
I don't know what to do.

308
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,229
That a new sensation for you, Bennet?

309
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,093
Is my wife in danger?

310
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:54,167
If I said yes,
what would be your next move?

311
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,915
Would you pack up Sandra
and little Claire

312
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:56,918
and make a run for it

313
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,013
or would you turn her over?

314
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,774
I'd do what I've always done.

315
00:19:02,276 --> 00:19:03,276
What I'm told.

316
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:05,886
But you didn't answer the question.

317
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:06,887
Is she in danger?

318
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:08,891
Relax.

319
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,981
Nothing's gonna happen to your wife

320
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,532
because she's not gonna remember
finding anything.

321
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,293
There's a boy we discovered in Haiti.

322
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:18,115
He can make her forget?

323
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,271
He's really something. He's mute.

324
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,121
When we asked him about his ability,

325
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:25,836
he drew a picture of himself
pulling memories

326
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,121
like little grub worms
out of someone's head.

327
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,711
The one I put * of my fridge.

328
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,379
When he's done,

329
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:36,879
make sure you thank him
for saving Sandra's life.

330
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:54,174
She's upstairs.

331
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,696
We don't have time for this.

332
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,562
In about 38 minutes, Ted's going nuclear

333
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:14,372
unless we bring him back
some hard evidence.

334
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:17,023
The only thing we're bringing Ted
is a tranquilizer.

335
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,267
He deserves to know the truth.

336
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:22,719
He doesn't want the truth.
He wants his wife back.

337
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:23,989
Short of that, he wants revenge

338
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,741
of the good old-fashioned
Biblical variety.

339
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:26,785
No, actually he doesn't.

340
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:29,407
You said yourself he already pulled
the trigger in his mind.

341
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,868
Okay, so that's it for him?
What about me?

342
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:34,355
You're gonna send me back to LA

343
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:36,256
with my family
and no idea this ever happens

344
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,212
so you can pretend
to have a happy family again?

345
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,696
I'm not sending you anywhere.

346
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,722
You're the only one I can trust.

347
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,854
Look, here's the deal.

348
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:46,874
I'll be honest with you.
You be honest with me.

349
00:20:49,827 --> 00:20:51,149
You just try lying to me...

350
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:52,726
I just signaled the Haitian.

351
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:55,348
- You said no one would know we're here.
- Until I need them to.

352
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:24,080
Guess who found out where I live.

353
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,687
What do you think we should do with him?

354
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,363
First, I have another "guess who."
Guess who found out you can talk!

355
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:32,983
Who have you been talking to?

356
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:35,181
Who else knows about Claire?

357
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:39,184
Just you and I. But that will change.

358
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,312
She wasn't supposed
to remember any of this.

359
00:21:44,163 --> 00:21:45,856
I gave you specific instructions.

360
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:48,542
I answer to someone whose instructions
supersede yours.

361
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,718
In this company?

362
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:51,733
In your daughter's life.

363
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:09,691
What's the mission?

364
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:11,706
Looking into a security breach.

365
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:14,129
That's all I know.
That's all they told me.

366
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:15,904
That's all they told you to tell me.

367
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:18,082
But what you know is considerably more.

368
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:20,146
You're not as good liar as you think.

369
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:25,023
You're the security breach.

370
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,570
Is that what they're calling me
behind my back?

371
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,377
I was hoping for something
a bit more subtle

372
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:30,436
or a pun at least.

373
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:32,376
You American are usually good for a pun.

374
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:33,426
Is it true?

375
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,309
Are you hiding one of them?

376
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,207
By "them", do you mean people like me?

377
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:39,603
Is that what you're accusing me
of hiding?

378
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,231
Well, the short answer's yes, isn't it?

379
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,984
You compromised what we're doing.

380
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,295
Sorry.

381
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:46,987
I know we're serving the greater good,

382
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:49,549
but the vivisection started
to keep me up at night.

383
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:52,039
Seeing as you're raising one of us
as you're own,

384
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:53,566
I was hoping for a bit more sympathy.

385
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,508
- Claire's not one of you.
- Not yet.

386
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:56,973
But one day maybe.

387
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:59,922
And don't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

388
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:02,091
If she is, then they'll take her.
It's done.

389
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,249
Oh, just like that?

390
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:05,883
Father of the Year, you are.

391
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,595
- I know who I work for.
- So do I.

392
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:11,151
I was in your office
when they told you to kill me.

393
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:14,219
Then why'd you get in the car?

394
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,218
Evidently, I think you're a better man
than they do.

395
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,479
Get out.

396
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:39,694
It's not the first time
you've been told to kill a man,

397
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:42,041
but is it the first
you've been told to kill a friend?

398
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:43,218
Tell me who it is...

399
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,281
and we can forget about the rest.

400
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:46,745
You're just gonna do it?

401
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:49,308
- You just gonna off me like nothing?
- It's not nothing!

402
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:52,211
We find these people. That's what we do.

403
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:53,329
And you buried one.

404
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:55,776
You acted
against the interest of the company.

405
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:58,122
You ever stop to think
what those interests are?

406
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,979
Who is it?

407
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:04,266
And what if it was Claire?

408
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:07,880
That's why you're so distant from her.

409
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:10,153
You know you're going to turn her in.

410
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,841
You're preparing for it.

411
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:14,573
You used to believe in what we do.

412
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:16,365
I used to believe in the tooth fairy.

413
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:19,057
We made a promise-- both of us.

414
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,984
I will not hunt my own people.

415
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:22,670
This isn't who you are.

416
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,750
You have a choi--

417
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:40,228
Why couldn't you just--

418
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:00,977
She's my daughter.

419
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:03,540
You can't be trusted to put her safety
before company interests.

420
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,830
I've been hiding her for months.

421
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:07,546
That's the sort of thing that'll get you
killed by someone like you.

422
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,299
But it hasn't made
your daughter any safer.

423
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,305
We're running out of time and we're not
exactly dealing with a patient man.

424
00:25:12,393 --> 00:25:14,598
It's in Claire's best interest
that we contain this

425
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,576
- and we keep her off the radar.
- She could run.

426
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:18,666
- She's safer in plain sight.
- Not at the moment.

427
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:21,806
No one is gonna be safe unless
you give Ted what he wants.

428
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:00,321
Thank you, God.

429
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:02,479
I prayed so hard.

430
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,920
Thank you. Thank you, God.

431
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:19,464
I prayed so hard and you came back.

432
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,301
Is it you? Is it really you?

433
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:34,220
Go. Hurry. Run.

434
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,649
Run, Mom!

435
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,022
Come on. Get outta here! Run!

436
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,688
You should've run.

437
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,314
I could never leave you,
not after I just got you back.

438
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:26,769
I always thought you were a miracle.

439
00:27:28,755 --> 00:27:30,709
Didn't know how much of one until no.

440
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:32,109
I'm not a miracle, mom.

441
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:33,252
You were dead.

442
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,413
Any time someone rises from the dead,

443
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:38,435
I'd say that's a miracle.

444
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,118
I don't know what I am.

445
00:27:43,026 --> 00:27:45,822
I don't know if God made me this way
or someone else.

446
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:47,473
God didn't make us this way.

447
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:49,356
God makes us all the way we are.

448
00:27:50,621 --> 00:27:52,393
I walked through fire
and didn't get burned.

449
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:53,871
You were trying to tell me.

450
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:57,972
I was trying not to tell you.

451
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,629
All this forgetting...
why I was in the hospital...

452
00:28:00,878 --> 00:28:02,403
you think your father did that to me?

453
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:03,404
I know he did.

454
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,761
He said he was trying to protect us.

455
00:28:08,158 --> 00:28:09,303
He's your father.

456
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:13,603
He is coming back to get us out of this.

457
00:28:13,797 --> 00:28:15,322
He's lied to you your entire marriage.

458
00:28:15,323 --> 00:28:18,087
What makes you so sure
he'll keep his word now?

459
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:19,225
Faith.

460
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:24,061
What I've seen, what I've witnessed.

461
00:28:27,892 --> 00:28:30,769
I can't pretend
it's the same world it was yesterday.

462
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:34,806
God gave you a second chance.

463
00:28:34,807 --> 00:28:37,401
Find it in your heart
to give your father one.

464
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:41,222
I'm curious about something.

465
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,670
Did Parkman know when he shot you

466
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:46,075
that you wouldn't die?

467
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:48,024
Did your dad tell him that?

468
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:49,433
I don't know.

469
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:52,709
That explains why they were so chummy
when they came down the stairs.

470
00:28:53,724 --> 00:28:55,419
What do you supposed they're up to?

471
00:28:57,996 --> 00:28:59,878
Guess I'll just ask them myself.

472
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:07,054
Am I still in control, Mr. Bennet?

473
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:14,791
You're still in control, Ted.

474
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:18,278
No tricks.

475
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:20,843
Just what you asked for-- the truth.

476
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,830
We have what we want, Ted.
We have the proof.

477
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:25,797
Then why the theatrics
with shooting the girl who can't die?

478
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,687
It's better than shooting one who can.

479
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,832
We didn't come her to hurt anyone.

480
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:33,994
If the people who I work for found out
that I've shown this to you,

481
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:35,339
they will kill me.

482
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:37,213
Since I'm risking my own life,

483
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,566
I would rather not risk my family's.

484
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:45,716
Do you want revenge
or do you want the truth?

485
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:46,907
You can't have both.

486
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:50,661
I want the truth.

487
00:29:53,272 --> 00:29:54,398
Then let them go.

488
00:29:59,753 --> 00:30:00,988
Get them out of here.

489
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:04,967
What is he doing here?

490
00:30:04,968 --> 00:30:07,273
Just making sure my family's safe,
that's all.

491
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:19,628
No, not you, you stay. They can go.

492
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:20,485
Dad!

493
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,277
Go!

494
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,956
Come on, Claire. Let's go.

495
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:30,868
Come on. Come on.

496
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:37,379
- Lyle!
- Mom!

497
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:38,662
I called the police.

498
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:42,065
We didn't make you this way.

499
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:44,881
We took you three months ago...
to identify you.

500
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:48,204
At the time, you were giving off low
levels of radiation. You were harmless.

501
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:50,716
You did nothing to stop it.

502
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:54,822
There's no cure.

503
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:57,275
We can't change the way you are.

504
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,830
The only choice is to kill you.

505
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:01,773
I wish you had.

506
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:05,428
It was my goal.

507
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:08,961
You had a life.
Who was I to take it from you?

508
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:11,448
Because you let me go, my wife is dead.

509
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:16,313
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:17,518
So am I.

511
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:20,986
No, don't! You'll set him off!

512
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:50,684
You gotta stop it!

513
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:55,775
I can't!

514
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:11,336
We gotta get outta here!

515
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,850
Dad.

516
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:28,692
Where's my dad?

517
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,926
He's--

518
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,245
Claire, don't!

519
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:00,784
- Dad!
- Get out!

520
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:03,053
Not without you!

521
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,964
Tranquilizer. Stay down!

522
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:22,992
I can't get close enough.

523
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:24,051
- Give it to me.
- No!

524
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,243
I'll be okay.

525
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:32,943
Get him out of here!

526
00:35:27,747 --> 00:35:29,634
It's a good thing you called me
when you did.

527
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,752
This sort of thing isn't taken lightly.

528
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:34,519
You know well and good
what the policy is on hiding them.

529
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,615
I'm well aware.

530
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:38,880
It's a shame
I have to kill another partner,

531
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:41,323
especially one so useful to the cause.

532
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:43,399
- Has he been located?
- The Haitian? Nah.

533
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:45,629
He must've figured you'd turn him in.

534
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:51,514
How long was he hiding Claire?

535
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,611
In plain sight too.
You must feel like a fool.

536
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:56,631
I take it it's been months.

537
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:58,940
She trusted him over her own father.

538
00:35:59,044 --> 00:36:00,044
Surrogate father.

539
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:10,656
Now that we have him,
we'll keep Sprague sedated.

540
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:13,064
Find out what gives him his spark.

541
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:14,474
And then?

542
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:17,082
What do you think?

543
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:40,837
He was very helpful.

544
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:45,225
Imagine working with someone
like Parkman by your side.

545
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:47,728
Knowing what everyone
around you is thinking

546
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,058
could prove quite resourceful.

547
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,556
Certainly keep everybody honest.

548
00:36:54,524 --> 00:36:55,524
She one of them?

549
00:36:56,683 --> 00:36:57,683
Very promising.

550
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,168
She's gonna help us
clean up the mess you made.

551
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,952
- We done here?
- Just one more thing.

552
00:37:07,188 --> 00:37:09,230
When should we be expecting Claire?

553
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:13,677
I'll bring her in now.

554
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:24,924
Why am I going?

555
00:37:25,146 --> 00:37:26,146
I don't know.

556
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:28,922
Will I see you again?

557
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:34,923
Mom, Lyle?

558
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,458
I don't know.

559
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:41,176
I wanted to protect you.

560
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:46,973
You're my dad.

561
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:52,522
I tried to be the best dad. I couldn't.

562
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:55,941
I know.

563
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,121
Let's see?

564
00:38:13,785 --> 00:38:15,445
Those are grandpa glasses.

565
00:38:16,866 --> 00:38:20,071
Even though I am the same age
my father was when he need glasses.

566
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:21,492
All right. How about these?

567
00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:27,082
Grandma glasses.

568
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:33,159
Am I gonna need glasses too?

569
00:38:33,692 --> 00:38:34,895
I don't know.

570
00:38:36,102 --> 00:38:38,438
Well, if you needed them
and grandpa needed them,

571
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:39,658
won't I need them?

572
00:38:44,245 --> 00:38:47,755
Your mother and I were wondering when
we were gonna have this conversation.

573
00:38:51,426 --> 00:38:53,554
- What's wrong?
- No, no, nothing's wrong.

574
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:55,441
Tell me.

575
00:38:57,595 --> 00:38:59,418
I'm not your biological father.

576
00:39:01,254 --> 00:39:02,254
You're adopted.

577
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,032
- Then who are my real parents?
- We're your real parents.

578
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:08,978
We don't know
who your biological family is

579
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,634
but we're your real family.

580
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:16,865
How can you be my real family
if I'm adopted?

581
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:19,929
Well, what makes us real
isn't where you come from.

582
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,344
It's... how much we love you.

583
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:26,246
And we love you very much.

584
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:28,824
I love you very much.

585
00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:33,258
You didn't grow inside your mother.

586
00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:36,239
You grew inside our hearts.

587
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:40,458
Claire...

588
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:43,514
talk to me.

589
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:51,977
Try these on.

590
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:03,941
How do I look?

591
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:06,501
Like my dad.

592
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,580
This is good-bye.

593
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:51,747
You don't... have to do this.

594
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,327
There's gotta be another way.

595
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:00,594
This is the best way.

596
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:03,741
There can't be any doubt
cast on your father.

597
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:08,033
Right here.

598
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:10,962
Two inches higher and I'm dead.

599
00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:15,522
Claire, turn around. Cover your ears.

600
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:39,528
Dad!

601
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Go deep.

602
00:41:49,411 --> 00:41:51,780
Take anything
that would lead them to her.

603
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:05,497
I love you, dad.

604
00:42:17,427 --> 00:42:18,872
I love you, Claire-Bear.
