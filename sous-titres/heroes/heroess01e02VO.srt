1
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,600
we all imagine ourselves the agents of our destiny,

2
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,970
capable of determining our own fate.

3
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,290
But have we truly any choice in when we rise?

4
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,940
Or when we fall?

5
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,590
Or does a force larger than ourselves bid us our direction?

6
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,660
Is it evolution that takes us by the hand?

7
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,530
Does science point our way?

8
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,200
Or is it god who intervenes,keeping us safe?

9
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,710
Easy,buddy.

10
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,990
Where am I?

11
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,120
You're in a hospital.

12
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,590
What happened?

13
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,860
You don't remember?

14
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,180
No.

15
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,750
nathan and peter petrelli
mid-town,manhattan

16
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,790
You jumped,pete.

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,940
Jumped?

18
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,560
Off the roof of a 15-story building.

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,930
You tried to kill yourself.

20
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,220
You were a little wound up yesterday.But I thought you were just being you.

21
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,890
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,580
I didn't try to kill myself.

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,080
You were  in the alley below.

24
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,050
I jumped,and...

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,470
then you...

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,560
you flew.

27
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,150
I what?

28
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,480
You flew up and you caught me.

29
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,960
You jumped...

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,530
peter.

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,520
25 feet to a fire escape.

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,660
I climbed up and carried you down.That's what happened.

33
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,240
The rest is just crazy talk.

34
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,950
You understand?

35
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,580
train derails,explodes

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,850
Dad...

37
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,200
you mind if I talk to you about something?

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,140
claire bennet
odessa,texas

39
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,520
You pregnant?

40
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,660
What?No.

41
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,080
You doing drugs?
Dad!

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,530
Actually...

43
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,270
I already know what it's about.

44
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,680
You do?

45
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,280
It's about wanting to know who you really are.

46
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,440
Your mother told me that you've been asking about your birth parents.

47
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,270
Well,I think it's time that I knew.

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,220
Well,I have a few questions first.

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
Not the least of which is why now?

50
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm just wondering,that's all.

51
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,610
You know,what they're like,what they can do.

52
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,650
What they can do?

53
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,790
Yeah,like hobbies and...

54
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,690
skills.

55
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,660
You know,I don'T...mean this to be condescending.

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,370
Even though you're gonna say I'm being condescending.

57
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,200
But I really do believe that this is an adult decision.

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,670
You're right.That is condescending.

59
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,260
Claire,there are gonna be issues.

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,230
You're going to have issues.

61
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,320
They're going to have issues.

62
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,870
It's very complex,emotionally.

63
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,960
Yeah,well,so am I.
Well,exactly.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,450
Look,here's my advice,if you'll indulge me.

65
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,720
Just...

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,520
keep things light and fun as long as you can.

67
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,480
Like cheerleading.

68
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,350
Being a cheerleader is hard work.

69
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,530
Hard, treacherous work.

70
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,770
Of course it is,sweetheart.

71
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,160
I don't wanna be late.

72
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,220
I just don't want you to be in such a hurry to grow up,okay?

73
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,850
Trust me.

74
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,500
I actually know a few things.

75
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,500

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600

Sorry,sorry!

77

Easy,easy.

78
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,480
Your super let us in.

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,350
We're doing the whole building today.

80
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,250
I just got done  with the lady with the dog  and the cough.

81
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,380
Almost done here.

82
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,070
Uh,listen,it looks  like some cockroaches  might have infested  your,uh,uh...

83
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,980
floorboards.

84
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,330
Who are you?!

85
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,570
What did you do to my father?

86
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,970
Let's take a little breather,huh,professor?

87
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,270
I suppose the cockroaches are the least of my problems.

88
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,930
Yeah,no argument there.

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,420
Did you kill my father?

90
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,130
I think  we're done here,don't you?

91
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,620
So I'll tell you what.

92
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,920
Have a really great day.

93
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,800
Hey,look,I'm just the exterminator.

94
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,000
This guy came in and pulled a gun on me.

95
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,550
He is not an exterminator.

96
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,990
He's paranoid.

97
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,790
I was just in there spraying bugs in his apartment.

98
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,770
He came in and freaked out.

99
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,970
If you're the exterminator,why do you have a gun holster?

100
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,750
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

101
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,450
You're welcome.

Nice to meet you.

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,550
I love new york!

112
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,530
Hello!

Pal!

119
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,000
This isn't a library.

120
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,340
No pay,no read.

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,780
Uh,uh,touchy,touch--

Simone-- shh,you had a hard night.

132
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,690
I saw it.

133
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,410
There was A...bright light.

134
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,740
Like an explosion.

135
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,590
It wiped out the whole city.

136
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,080
Like hiroshima-- shh,shh,shh,it's okay.

137
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,000
It was all a dream.

138
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,130
No...

139
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,580
I don't think so.

140
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,060
I shot up last night.I had to.

141
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,210
I painted what I saw.Is it there?

142
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,720
Do you see it?
Yes,I see it!

143
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,180
But you need to rest.

144
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,880
We have to warn them.

145
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,920
Warn who?

146
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,430
F.B.I.,Homeland security.

147
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,420
We need to tell someone.

148
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,020
Isaac,you can't paint the future.

149
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,030
No one will believe you.

150
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,990
I'd hoped you would.

151
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,310
None of it is real.

152
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,440
What is real is,you got a drug problem.

153
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,500
You overdosed on heroin last night.

154
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,710
You're lucky to be alive.

155
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,490
You know,I'm watching my father die.

156
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,820
And I can't watch you die too.

157
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,700
So you need  to make a choice.

158
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,460
Me or this.

159
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,680
It's not about having big hands.

160
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,740
Most guy's hands are too rough to
 pick out the details.

161
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,290
Mine are sensitive.

162
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,450
Feel how soft they are.

163
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,120
But you've got dainty hands.

164
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,040
My mom says my hands are very dainty.

165
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,200
Maybe I should try out for the football team.

166
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,260
Claire,may I borrow your ears just for a minute?

167
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,660
Why?
Hey,zach!

168
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,240
Is it true you got an erection  in the boys'  locker room?

169
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,840
It's really urgent-- not now.Not now.

170
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,700
Claire,jackie.

171
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,480
The sheriff and some firemen would like to have a word with you two.

172
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,080
Okay.

173
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,320
Hi,this is niki.Leave me a message.

174
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,510
mom...

175
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,850
are you there?

176
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,770
When are you  coming to get me?

177
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,580
I hate it here.

178
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,570
You said  you'd be back soon.

179
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,030
Just come pick me up,okay?

180
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,850
Honey,I'm so sorry.I'm on my way.

181
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,200
Baby,I'm only five minutes away,okay?

182
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,830
You know I love you.

183
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,700
come on.

184
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,810
That's the way I like it.

185
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,130
Go ahead,go ahead.

186
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,660
Come on.

187
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,510
What's the problem,baby?

188
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,790
Things just started  getting good here.

189
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,670
I said what's the problem?

190
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,210
Screw you.

191
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,910
Hello?
Mom...

192
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,470
where have you been?I called you,like,four hours ago.

193
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,930
What?

194
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,260
Four hours?

195
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,100
I'll be right there,baby.

196
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,280
What is the matter with you,making him wait like that?

197
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,860
Hon,two seconds.

199
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,890
Okay.

200
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,760
What the hell is going on,niki?

201
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,420
Something terrible has happened.

202
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,620
What?What is it?

203
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,970
Those guys that you said that linderman would send to get his money back...

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,420
Well,he did.

205
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,280
And now they're dead.

206
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,310
On the floor of my garage.

207
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,530
What?

208
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,720
How?

209
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,300
That's just it.

210
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,910
I don't know.

211
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,080
What do you mean you don't know?

212
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,520
I mean I don't know.

213
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,370
I just--I woke up,and they were dead and...

214
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,820
I think that I might...

215
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,240
sometimes I look in the mirror...

216
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,190
and I'm not sure it's me that I'm seeing.

217
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,650
Maybe it was dl,you know?

218
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,150
He's trying to protect you because he still loves you and micah.

219
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,330
Dl wouldn't risk coming back.

220
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,370
The cops are after him.

221
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,040
And once linderman finds out they're dead,it's not gonna matter who killed them.

222
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,380
He's gonna come after me.

223
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,350
Then you need to listen to me.

224
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,620
Niki,you have to call the police.

225
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,910
No,I gotta...

226
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,110
I gotta cover my tracks.

227
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,110
And then I gotta run.

228
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,950
I gotta go.

229
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,300
why would anybody wanna tap papa saresh's phone?

230
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,850
Papa saresh?

231
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,800
Yeah,he told me to call him that after I butchered his name a couple times.

232
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,730
I don't know why someone would want to tap his phone.

233
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,790
Back in madras,I found a man in his apartment stealing his research,and now this.

234
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,930
Why don't you just ask your dad?

235
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,130
I mean,he must have some idea who it is.

236
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,150
My father died four days ago.

237
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,710
What?

238
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,390
I'm sorry,I...

239
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,880
you didn't know?

240
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,460
He was murdered in his cab.

241
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,250
Oh,my god.How awful.

242
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,040
You were close?

243
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,890
Yeah...

244
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,110
I mean,I hate cooking for one.

245
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,600
So I used to make extra and bring it over,and we would...eat together,

246
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,500
and he'd tell me about his theories and the map.

247
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,310
We were friends.

248
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,130
Well...

249
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,830
then you were closer to him than I was.

250
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,430
I'm happy to hear he had someone to talk to.

251
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,730
I'll get you some water.

252
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,730
I had no idea anything was wrong.

253
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,980
I...

254
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,580
I knocked on the door a couple of times.

255
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,020
I just...

256
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,920
I thought he was out,and we were missing each other.

257
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,940
I had this book I wanted to show him.

258
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,510
What book?

259
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,320
Darwin's origin of species.

260
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,270
Thank you.

261
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,320
It's a true first edition.

262
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,890
I work at this antique book store,and I found a copy,and I just...

263
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,600
thought he'd get a kick out of reading it.

264
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,810
Well,he most definitely would have gotten a kick out of it.

265
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,980
That's very thoughtful.

266
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,390
You know,he told me he was being watched.

267
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,270
I thought that he was just eccentric.

268
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,520
I like that you didn't use the word "paranoid.

269
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,760
" Do you think that they're watching you now?

270
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,990
They could have killed me,if that's what they wanted.

271
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,590
For the time being,it seems I'm more important to them alive.

272
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,560
You said that he talked to you about his theories and the map.

273
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,600
I need you to tell me everything he said to you.

274
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,820
Everything you remember.

275
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,660
Everything.

276
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,870
girls!

277
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,640
This isn't A...

278
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,570
criminal investigation.

279
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,770
Nobody here is in any kind of trouble.

280
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,070
Quite the contrary.

281
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:48,110
There just happens to be  a very grateful man  lying in the hospital who'd like to thank one of you for...saving his life yesterday.

282
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,330
I've never seen anyone so  reluctant to be called a hero.

283
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,270
You're sure it was one of our cheerleaders?

284
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,180
The uniform said union wells high.

285
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,490
I'd have to say it was...

286
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,690
her on the end.

287
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,680
That's claire bennett.

288
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,700
claire...

289
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,850
where'd  you go yesterday after cheerleading practice?

290
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,430
I,uh...
it wasn't her.

291
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,580
It was me.

292
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,340
I was taking a shortcut home from school,and...

293
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,930
I saw the wreckage of the train...

294
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,540
wreck.

295
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,300
And...

296
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,580
I just had to help.

297
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,690
Why didn't you say something?

298
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,080
I guess I didn't want all the attention,you know?

299
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,930
That's not why I did it.

300
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,390
Well,on behalf of the odessa fire department,I'd like to congratulate you as an honorary firefighter.

301
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,970
thank you.

302
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,360
How is he?

303
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,820
Who?

304
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,430
The man jackie pulled out of the train.

305
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,400
He's got some pretty bad burns.

306
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,030
Smoke damage to his lungs,but...

307
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,440
he's alive.

308
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,010
Happy to be so.

309
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,020
Thanks to jackie.

310
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,170
Claire!

311
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,220
I'm glad I finally got you alone.Look,we have to talk.

312
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,770
Did you hear they asked jackie to be the grand marshall of the pioneer day parade?

313
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,880
They're gonna put her on the top of the fire truck.

314
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,160
They should put her  under the fire truck.

315
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,580
It's about the videotape.

316
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,480
What?

317
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,210
The videotape!

318
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,160
The tape where you're,like,killing yourself like 20 times.

319
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,860
Oh,yeah,that.Can we just keep it under wraps?

320
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,170
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

321
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,960
It was in my backpack,and now it's not.

322
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,550
What?

323
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,090
It's gone.

324
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,400
What do you mean,it's gone?

325
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,640
Oh,my god!

326
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,360
Claire!

327
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,920
I'm so sorry.Are you all right?

328
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,640
Yeah.

329
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,790
I'm okay.

330
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,340
I'm all right.

331
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,450
You just caught me off guard.

332
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,420
I thought I heard something snap.

333
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,730
Nope.

334
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,540
I'm okay!

335
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,390
I'm fine!

336
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,380
I'm okay.

337
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,090
all right,that's it!

338
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,150
Show's over!

339
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,710
Yeah,not a scratch on me.

340
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,350
Guess you're not so dainty after all.

341
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,930
I'm dainty enough.

342
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,750
We have got to find that tape.

343
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,080
what if I don't want to go on vacation?

344
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,000
You don't have a choice.

345
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,280
You have to.

346
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,580
Why are we doing this,mom?

347
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,250
Why won't you just tell me what's going on?

348
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,900
I wish that I could,baby.

349
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,280
But you are just gonna have to trust me,okay?

350
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,350
Now go in and pack up your stuff.

351
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,030
I have to take care of something in the garage.

352
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,330
Mom...

353
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,270
what happened to our house?

354
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,140
Mikey,you're just gonna have to trust me,okay?

355
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,530
Now go in  and grab some stuff.

356
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,930
Go.

357
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,140
in the trunk
follow the map

358
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,480
Help me understand what you were doing on that roof.

359
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,800
I can'T.

360
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,780
Not yet.But I will.

361
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,990
You just have to trust me.

362
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,070
There's something you need to know about your father's death.

363
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,860
He committed suicide.

364
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,900
What?

365
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,280
He committed suicide.

366
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,240
I found him on the floor of the bathroom.

367
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,580
You said he had a heart attack.

368
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,090
I lied.

369
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,010
For his reputation,his heart was fine.

370
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,130
But he'd had two others before that.

371
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,020
Well,I lied about those too.

372
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,290
Suicide attempts,both of them.

373
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,030
He finally got what he wanted.

374
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,670
When he was 23,he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

375
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,150
He couldn't help it.It was just who he was.

376
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,270
Why didn't I know about any of this before?

377
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,960
Your father and i decided not to tell you since the disorder can have a genetic link,

378
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,790
and you were always so sensitive.

379
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,300
We didn't want you to worry about it.

380
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,610
But you're telling me now.

381
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,160
It can start with delusions of grandeur.

382
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,750
Thinking you're invincible or indestructible.

383
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,660
They are irrational thoughts that then turn suicidal.

384
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,960
It's time you took a hard look at your life.

385
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,830
And if there are changes to be made,I want to be here to help you.

386
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,570
Because there's something else I never told you.

387
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,800
You were always my favorite.

388
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,460
I cannot lose you.

389
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,850
Mr.Isaac mendez?

390
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,170
Hello?

391
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,800
Mr.Isaac?

392
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,330
Mr.Isaac?

393
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,010
Mr.Isaac?

394
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,310
Freeze!

395
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,320
Drop your weapon.

396
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,180
Get your damn hands up.

397
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,140
serial killer strikes  in the middle of los angeles,abducts a little girl,and here I am.

398
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,180
100 feet away.

399
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Might as well be in siberia.

400
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,410
That's all right.

401
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,470
They don't pay us enough to be where the action is.

402
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,850
What are you gonna do,anyway?

403
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,270
What do you mean?I just wanna help.

404
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,220
You wanna help?

405
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,090
Help me get more tape.

406
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,280
What do you think--  C.I.A.Or F.B.I.?

407
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,090
Nah,she's dressed too nice for F.B.I.

408
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,970
I saw the test scores got posted this morning.

409
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,980
Don't worry about it,man.Not everybody's a test taker.

410
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,990
Who wants to be  a detective,anyway?
please don't hurt me.

411
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,820
Gotta spend half your salary  buying suits.

412
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,150
please don't hurt me.

413
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,440
Nine of out  ten of these guys...Won't live to see their pension plan.

414
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,320
he stole them.

415
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:03,220
please don't hurt me.
You all right,man?

416
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,860
my back is killing me.

417
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,110
there's a bullet out there  with my name on it.

418
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,850
your ass is on the line.

419
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,430
please.

420
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:26,070
please don't hurt me.

421
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,250
You know,we don't  have any idea  what happened in here.

422
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,920
I've got a theory.

423
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,940
You always do.

424
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,910
This is barstow all over again.

425
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,350
It's sylar.

426
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,800
There isn't a sylar.

427
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,130
Last words of a dying victim.

428
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,700
It didn't mean anything.

429
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,190
And look at her.

430
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,550
Must have taken three guys to lift her up that high.

431
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,500
What about the daughter?

432
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,300
No sign.

433
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,440
We checked the house and surrounding,issued an amber alert.

434
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,580
You've seen what happened to the father.

435
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,140
Frozen solid,skull sawed off.

436
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,260
We need to find out how.

437
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,820
The little girl's the priority.

438
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,880
please don't hurt me.

439
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,900
Please don't--  please don't hurt me.

440
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,930
please.

441
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,220
You are not supposed to be in here.

442
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,540
please...

443
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,120
please don't hurt me.

444
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,900
it's okay.

445
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,220
You're safe now.

446
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,530
Look,I'm a cop.

447
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,950
I'm one of the good guys,okay?

448
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,910
He hurt my mom and dad.

449
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,310
Please don't hurt me.

450
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,440
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

451
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,780
No,no,no.

452
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,560
Come on,takake my hand.

453
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,330
It's okay,come on.

454
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,770
It's okay.

455
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,770
Come on.

456
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,570
For years,he'd been working on a mathematical theorem using human genomes and dna migration patterns.

457
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,600
He thought he could find a way to identify these people,the ones who were special.

458
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,560
I never believed it was possible.

459
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,440
We fought about it constantly.

460
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,540
It's the reason we grew apart.

461
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,880
you've reached chandra saresh.

462
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,480
Please leave a message.

463
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,650
He's got messages.

464
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,680
Chandra,this is emi.

465
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,990
You forgot to turn in  your trip sheet for last week.

466
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,690
Where is your head,man?
Oh,my god,mohinder.

467
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,980
Yes?
No...

468
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,590
the other mohinder.The lizard.

469
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,660
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

470
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,620
Hi,I'm nathan petrelli.

471
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,700
It would be an honor  to represent  new york's 14th district.

472
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,850
When the time comes,vote petrelli.

473
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,870
hello,chandra.

474
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,830
Why won't you talk to me?

475
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,720
You can't leave me like this.

476
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,340
hello,mr.Sylar.

477
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,920
I asked you not  to call here anymore.

478
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:52,340
the hunger,it's--  I can't control it.

479
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,100
I don't want to.

480
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,900
You made me this way.

481
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,940
I made you a murderer?

482
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,470
you helped me  to discover my potential.

483
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,390
You wanted to see what  I could do as much as I did.

484
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,130
And now you want it to stop.

485
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,170
it's over.

486
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,610
Goodbye.

487
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,310
I found a tape of a conversation my father had with a man names sylar.

488
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,520
A man he believed was patient zero.

489
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,820
Come here,you.

490
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,730
Mohinder,this is mohinder.

491
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,630
You wanna give him a kiss?

492
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,500
what is it?

493
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,560
It's a portable hard drive.

494
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,760
My god,he did it.

495
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,840
He actually came up with a way to find them.

496
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,780
You wondered why someone would want to kill my father.

497
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,990
The reason for his death.

498
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,970
It's this!

499
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,160
I'm going to finish what he started.

500
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,140
Hey,parkman.

501
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,700
How the hell did you know that little girl was in there?

502
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,080
I don't know.

503
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,680
I don't know,I just-- I heard her whispering,and,um...

504
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,410
house full of cops,but you're outside,and you just  heard her whisper?

505
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,240
I can't explain it.It was...

506
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,480
I thought everybody could hear her.

507
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,210
You guys couldn't hear her?

508
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,650
You got someplace better to be?

509
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,700
It's my wife.

510
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,700
I'm meeting her at A...

511
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,410
a therapy session.

512
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,670
Couples counseling.

513
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,570
We're having some problems at home.

514
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,460
This guy's worthless.

515
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,800
Worthless...

516
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,140
cut him loose.

517
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,890
He got lucky.

518
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,650
Not yet,parkman.

519
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,090
Your captain says you've taken the exam to advance to detective three times?

520
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,210
Right.

521
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,920
You really think you're detective material?

522
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,540
Yes,ma'am,I do.

523
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,280
So how does it make you feel?

524
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,710
Flunking out so many times.

525
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:17,650
I don't know.

526
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,280
Embarrassed,I guess.

527
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,250
A little angry.

528
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,730
A little angry?

529
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,780
Angry enough to do something about it?

530
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,530
Maybe set yourself up to look like a hero?

531
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,630
Wait,what,you think I killed these people?

532
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,200
I didn't kill these people.Sylar did.

533
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,390
How did you know that name?

534
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,640
How did you know that name?

535
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,720
Six people assigned to this case know the name of sylar.

536
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,490
How the hell did you know that?

537
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,070
I heard it.

538
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,350
From you.

539
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,490
Like you heard  the girl whisper.

540
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,570
Yeah.

541
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,940
Then hear this one.

542
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,920
You're under arrest.
What?

543
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,290
Claire bear!

544
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,520
Hi,dad.

545
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,330
How was school?

546
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,490
Very school-like.How was work?

547
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,930
Very work-like.

548
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,480
Listen,I,um...

549
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,050
I made a couple of calls today.

550
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,340
I spoke to a very nice woman at the adoption agency.

551
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,500
And she said they were going to try to get in touch...

552
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,810
with your birth parents.

553
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,560
And,uh...

554
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,620
and request a meeting.

555
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,380
I thought that was an adult decision.

556
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,000
You seemed pretty adult this morning when you told me you wanted to do it.

557
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,440
Thanks.

558
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,840
She said it was a lengthy process.

559
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,910
And it could take weeks.

560
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,350
I'm hoping...years.

561
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,780
That way,you'll be my little girl for a while longer.

562
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,020
I'm not done protecting you from the world.

563
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,620
You're my dad.

564
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,100
You'll never not be my dad.

565
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,130
I promise I'll...

566
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,620
be your little girl for as long as I can.

567
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,080
But you can't protect me forever.

568
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,530
I know.

569
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,900
And it breaks my heart.

570
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,520
I love you,dad.

571
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,590
I love you too,sweetheart.

572
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,450
Go get ready for dinner.

573
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,460
This is claire bennett.

574
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,910
And that was  attempt number six.

575
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,190
It really does break my heart.

576
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,050
I've been looking all over for you.

577
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,500
Did you know about dad's depression?

578
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,300
Yeah.

579
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,880
Why didn't you ever tell me?

580
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,200
Because everyone's entitled to their secrets,peter.

581
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,910
I was so sure when it happened.

582
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,120
Now it turns out I'm just...going crazy.

583
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,540
Look,hey...

584
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,070
we've been through this before.We've played this game,okay?

585
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,800
Let's just...

586
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,540
let's just go.

587
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,710
Tell me what happened,nathan.

588
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,030
When I jumped.

589
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,920
Tell me you flew.

590
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,210
I wanna hear you say that you flew.

591
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,250
Tell me,or I'll jump again.

592
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,480
Hey,good luck on your campaign...

593
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,940
when I'm splattered all over the ground below.

594
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,990
All right.

595
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,800
You want the truth?

596
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,920
Yeah.

597
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,800
We both flew.

598
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,980
Pete...

599
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,630
I caught you,and I lost control.

600
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,290
You're too heavy.

601
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,830
We both started falling to the ground.

602
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,390
And just before we--

603
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,560
just before we hit,you flew.

604
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,440
You.

605
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,850
Are you lying to me?

606
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,640
You are.

607
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,240
You're trying to tell me what you think I wanna hear.

608
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,160
You're lying to me again!

609
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,130
Did you see that?

610
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,660
Did you see that?I flew?

611
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,770
Yeah,I--I know.

612
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,040
You're one sick son of a bitch,you know that?

613
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,150
Very sorry.

614
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,750
I not speak much english.

615
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,070
What I wanna know is what did you do with the man's brain?

616
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,430
You flush it down the toilet,you eat it,what?

617
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,650
We got a live one here.

618
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,090
No english,no passport,no american money,no I.D.

619
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,340
Except for this here.

620
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,660
"An honorary member of the merry marvel marching society.

621
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,320
" Let's start by asking him how he got to new york.

622
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,980
He says he teleported himself here.

623
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,340
Teleported?

624
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,330
What the hell is that?

625
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,750
Like star trek.

626
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,320
He says he can bend the space-time continuum.

627
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,380
Funny,I've seen all the star treks.

628
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,110
I don't remember you from the show.

629
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,820
How long ago did he do this?

630
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,850
Yesterday.

631
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,160
Yesterday.

632
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,850

Teleport--

637
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,620
Your friend says he was  with you yesterday.

638
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,580
Yesterday?

639
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,840
That's not correct?

640
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,110
I have not seen hiro nakamura in five weeks.

641
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,970
We look for him everywhere.

642
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,530
His buddy hasn't seen him for five weeks.

643
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:28,520

for all his bluster,it is the sad province of man that he cannot choose his triumph.

He can only choose how he will stand when the call of destiny comes.

Hoping that he'll have the courage to answer.
