<i>Previously on</i> Heroes...

2
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:05,812
Camera's ready for whatever.

3
00:00:06,317 --> 00:00:07,320
What are you doing?

4
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:10,198
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,222
<i>When we embrace what lies within,</i>

6
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,787
<i>our potential has no limit.</i>

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,630
As far as you know,
that was attempt number one.

8
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:19,861
<i>The future is filled with promise.</i>

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,694
<i>The present, rife with expectation.</i>

10
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:25,786
<i>But when we deny our instinct...</i>

11
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,427
<i>and struggle
against our deepest urges...</i>

12
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:30,907
Are you on the list?

13
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,394
<i>... uncertainty begins.</i>

14
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,135
My dad obviously doesn't work
in a paper factory.

15
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:36,844
I don't know what he does.

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,809
Where is he? Where's Sylar?

17
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,854
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

18
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:45,382
<i>Where does this path lead?</i>

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,390
I've no idea how you're pulling this off

20
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:48,751
but I swear I'm not gonna stop

21
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,468
until I figure it out.
You understand me?

22
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,085
<i>When will the changes end?</i>

23
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:54,323
<i>Is this transformation a gift?</i>

24
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:55,975
- I just wanna see my son!
<i>- Or a curse?</i>

25
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:57,699
You don't know anything about power.

26
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:02,043
<i>And for those who fear
what lies ahead...</i>

27
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:04,773
- I can't control it!
- Let me help you, Peter.

28
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,223
<i>... the most important question of all--</i>

29
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:10,480
<i>Can we ever really change
what we are?</i>

30
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,598
What are-- What are you doing?

31
00:01:28,492 --> 00:01:29,515
You--

32
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:30,980
You can see me!

33
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:32,196
You--

34
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,144
Nobody can see me!

35
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:36,172
I'm invisible!

36
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:40,976
Who are you? How can you see me?

37
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:43,365
I don't know, I just do
what you can do.

38
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:47,802
Fantastic. One of those.

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,404
One of those?

40
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:52,340
What do you mean,
you know someone else like me?

41
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:55,032
Hey wait, where are you going?
You need to explain this.

42
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:57,336
Look--I saw you. I saw you in my dream.

43
00:01:57,394 --> 00:01:59,606
- Who are you?
- Me? I'm no one.

44
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:01,514
I'm the Invisible Man. I'm Claude Rains.

45
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:03,655
Now get away from me.
Forget you ever saw me.

46
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:04,893
Yeah, but you know.

47
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:06,633
What's happening to me?

48
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:08,678
What is this? What--

49
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:11,133
Listen, I found you.
I need you to help me.

50
00:02:11,343 --> 00:02:12,346
Why'd I want to do that?

51
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:13,658
Because we're in danger.

52
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:15,713
This entire city is in danger.

53
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,835
It was in my dream.

54
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:22,169
People die. We die.

55
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:23,867
I don't know when, but it happens.

56
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,765
Then you'd better leave town.

57
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:27,849
Where are you going?
You can't hide from me.

58
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:29,081
I'm the Invisible Man.

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,339
I could walk around the corner
and disappear forever.

60
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,601
Yeah, but I can see you.
I'm gonna follow you.

61
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,263
Smarter men than you have tried
and have paid for it.

62
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:37,768
You stay away from me.

63
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:40,988
And don't follow me.

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,212
Red elephant with blue stripes?

65
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,376
Pin stripe or plaid?

66
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:34,630
Honey, I can't see your thoughts.
I can only hear 'em.

67
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:38,384
I have a good one.

68
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:42,532
Wait, the ratty curtains
in our old apartment?

69
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:46,116
How do you do that?

70
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:04,324
I'm not sure what's happening.

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,697
His vitals are extremely irregular.

72
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,263
After all we've done to him,
I'm not surprised.

73
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,673
Keep him stabilized.

74
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,313
There is another option.

75
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,887
Our instructions are to keep him alive.
Do whatever it takes.

76
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,077
If he crashes, you bring him back.

77
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:23,720
Again and again.

78
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:28,464
When he dies it'll be on my terms,
not on his.

79
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:30,818
Clear?

80
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,030
But I'm only two minutes over.

81
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:41,173
That'll be 48.50.

82
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:42,851
For one-day parking?

83
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:45,147
Hey, you want your car back or not?

84
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:02,958
Help, there's a man chasing us!

85
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,673
Transcript & synchro: swsub.com

86
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:35,107
Dr. Suresh?

87
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:37,833
Do you remember me?

88
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:39,453
Nathan Petrelli.

89
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,486
You yelled at my car.

90
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:43,995
Yes, we met under
unfortunate circumstances.

91
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,425
I believe I came off
as a deranged lunatic.

92
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:48,180
You mind if I come in?

93
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,053
I'm looking for my brother, Doctor.

94
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:54,596
That makes two of us.

95
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:55,978
I'm sorry?

96
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:58,736
I've been leaving messages
for him for two days now.

97
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:00,638
Guess I'm at the wrong place then.

98
00:07:01,015 --> 00:07:03,735
I need to find him.
The last time I heard, he was in Texas.

99
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:05,095
He made it home barely.

100
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,368
Barely alive,
and now he's run off again.

101
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,085
Afraid that he's gonna somehow...

102
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,419
hurt people.

103
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,913
Doctor--
possibly you could explain to me.

104
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,613
What the hell's happening to him?

105
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:23,975
Before his death,
my father compiled a list.

106
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:27,303
36 individuals who carry
a genetic marker

107
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,784
which he discovered.

108
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:30,559
A marker which he theorized

109
00:07:30,597 --> 00:07:33,141
gave these people certain abilities.

110
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,798
And my brother's one of them?

111
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,071
As are you.

112
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:42,311
I didn't come here to talk about me.

113
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:43,411
Fair enough.

114
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,679
Peter's specific DNA allows for a blend.

115
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,390
Like colors in a mosaic.

116
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,210
Resequencing itself to mimic
the abilities of those around him.

117
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:51,386
Like a chameleon?

118
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:52,480
More like a sponge.

119
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,583
It's precisely why
I've been studying him.

120
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,638
Could his condition become
dangerous to himself

121
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:57,738
or to other people?

122
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,956
If he absorbs too much,

123
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:01,234
or comes into contact
with an unstable ability,

124
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,797
then most definitely yes.

125
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,150
Can you fix it?

126
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,031
Alter his genes somehow?

127
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,186
Theoretically, it is possible

128
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:12,002
to develop a specific site inhibitor.

129
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,211
But look, I will know more
when we find him.

130
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:15,297
We?

131
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,966
Doctor, the last thing my brother needs

132
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:20,924
is somebody feeding into his paranoia.

133
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:23,010
But thank you.

134
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,298
Mr. Petrelli.

135
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:29,800
Of all the people on that list

136
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:31,845
your brother may be the most important.

137
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,271
If I can find him, study him,

138
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:36,845
then I can do more than help him.

139
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:39,199
I can help all of you.

140
00:08:41,534 --> 00:08:44,119
Now, give me a minute,
and I'll get my coat.

141
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,595
I told you not to follow me.

142
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,015
I need help.

143
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:56,855
You live up here?

144
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,769
You're not a fast learner, eh, mate?

145
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,371
I took care of a man
who owned this building.

146
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,205
His name was Charles Deveaux.

147
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:05,743
Never heard of him.

148
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,260
You don't think that's strange?

149
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:09,588
I worked here.

150
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:11,910
The place where you live
and keep your birds.

151
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:13,482
I don't keep anything.

152
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:16,049
I let 'em out once a day,
they come back.

153
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:18,277
Sounds like free will to me.

154
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,178
I need to learn how to control this.

155
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:22,361
Like you do.

156
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,498
What are you talking about?
It can't be controlled.

157
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,638
There has to be some way.

158
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,702
If I don't, New York explodes.

159
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:29,722
Okay? I explode.

160
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,625
An exploding man,
where'd you get that idea?

161
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,392
My dreams.

162
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:37,263
This place.

163
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,521
I found you for a reason.

164
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:43,193
I think you're the one that has
to teach me how to stop this.

165
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:45,446
There's no such thing.

166
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:48,381
No teaching.
No Sunday school for the special.

167
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,015
What I can do, you can't learn.

168
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,757
You wake up in the morning, it's there.

169
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,455
If you've got thin soup,
then that's your supper.

170
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:56,727
Sorry, mate, that's the way it is.

171
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,104
I'm trying not to die.

172
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,039
There's got to be something you can do.

173
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:02,577
I can kill you myself right now.

174
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:04,544
Solve your exploding problem here.

175
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:06,983
Maybe that's why you dreamt me.

176
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:09,525
Don't bother looking for me.

177
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,495
You won't find me here again.

178
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,927
So what exactly am I looking for here?

179
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:26,773
Anything my dad doesn't want us to find.

180
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,978
You said you're good with computers.

181
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,344
I make movies on my laptop.

182
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:34,503
No, you're good at finding those holes

183
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:37,877
in that internet password-protected
nanny blocker stuff.

184
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:40,531
Shouldn't you be watching
the doorway if your dad walks in?

185
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:41,828
He's at work.

186
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:44,607
It's just you, me, and Mr. Muggles.

187
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,809
There's nothing.

188
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:51,713
- There's not even any porn.
- Gross.

189
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,713
I'm serious,
this thing is totally clean.

190
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,411
My dad lied to me about my entire life.

191
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,950
My biological parents. My ability.

192
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,799
You can't just hide things like that.

193
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,691
There's gotta be something on there.

194
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,844
If your dad's the guy you're describing,

195
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:08,684
I don't think he's gonna keep
his secrets on the family computer.

196
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:14,672
Shut it down.

197
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:27,780
I thought you were at work.

198
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,737
Forgot my cell.

199
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:33,717
Zachary.

200
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:35,695
What a nice surprise to see you here.

201
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,276
Yeah, it's biology class.

202
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:39,922
We're lab partners now.

203
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,298
We were just doing
some research on the internet.

204
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,168
We have a presentation on--

205
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,394
The manatee.

206
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,908
Also known as the sea cow.

207
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:57,188
Do you mind if I talk to Claire
in private for a moment?

208
00:11:58,395 --> 00:11:59,771
You can wait in my room.

209
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:03,519
It's upstairs. Second door on the right.

210
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,454
So. You and Zach?

211
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,523
Ms. Gomez stuck us together.

212
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:14,154
Must be some social experiment
or something.

213
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:16,283
Worst day ever.

214
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:21,109
What?

215
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:24,990
You two used to be friends.
You might find you actually get along.

216
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,665
Nice save.

217
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:39,901
Thanks.

1
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,818
So what now?

2
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,611
I need to talk to someone
who has some answers.

3
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:50,195
He said if I needed him,
I should hang these outside my window.

4
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,172
What the hell are you talking about?

5
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,517
Okay, wait.

6
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:02,201
You're saying that the guy
with the glasses actually...

7
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:03,900
abducted you?

8
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,076
Yes.

9
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:08,786
And he--he did this to you?

10
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:10,248
Yeah!

11
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,698
Yeah, and I gotta figure out
how he did this.

12
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:16,187
And I'm gonna take him
and everybody with him down.

13
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:17,945
That Haitian guy, all of 'em.

14
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,787
Matt, I--I'm sorry.

15
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,533
I've gotta say,
this is all a little nuts.

16
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:28,743
I mean, first the whole
psychic thing. And now...

17
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,368
Come on, you're telling me
you're about to run off

18
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,998
and chase some guy
who works in a paper factory in Texas.

19
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,224
They did this to me, Janice.

20
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:37,871
I need to find them.

21
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,258
I have to figure out
what this is all about.

22
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:43,462
<i>Maybe you could call the FBI.</i>

23
00:13:43,548 --> 00:13:45,301
No, I can't.
I can't go to the F.B.I.

24
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:46,656
They think I'm crazy.

25
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:51,951
I--I gotta get ready.
I got a review hearing this morning.

26
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,219
I'm about to get my ass
handed to me by three captains.

27
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,184
Yes, I will call the plumber today.

28
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,656
Are you always gonna be in my head?

29
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,345
Well, I can't control this thing.

30
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,033
You can't or you won't?

31
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,886
Who are you?

32
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,736
Who are you? Hiro!

33
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:42,691
Let me go!

34
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:45,701
I am very special.

35
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:47,762
I offer myself in trade.

36
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:50,902
Release un-special Ando,

37
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:52,256
and I go with you.

38
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:53,654
Okay?

39
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:58,569
Good deal, yes?

40
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:01,150
What are you doing?

41
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:03,431
You no like the deal?

42
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:24,600
Who are you?

43
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,545
Why did you take that off me?

44
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:32,331
I'm Dr. Witherson.
I'm a psychiatrist.

45
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:34,799
And I've been assigned to your case.

46
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,511
No, you shouldn't be in here.
It's not safe.

47
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,090
If it makes you feel more comfortable,

48
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,084
we can put
the restraints back on while we talk.

49
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:43,309
You don't understand.
The drugs keep her weak.

50
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:45,975
That jacket can't stop her.

51
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,250
- Give me a shot.
- You mean Jessica?

52
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,014
How do you know her name?

53
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:51,885
I read your file.

54
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:53,864
I know all about your past.

55
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,224
Your marriage.
Your website. Your sister.

56
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:57,880
Her accident?

57
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,250
Her name was Jessica too,
isn't that right?

58
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:04,325
Give me another shot.

59
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,739
You know, I haven't made
an official diagnosis yet.

60
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:10,147
But it seems like we're dealing with

61
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:13,284
a classic case
of multiple personality disorder.

62
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:15,336
You're wasting your time.

63
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,271
Just go.

64
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,594
You know-- It's okay.

65
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,836
It makes sense, facing the kind
of sentence that you're facing,

66
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,084
that you want to give up.

67
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,343
You think your life is over,
but it's not.

68
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,332
You can still make
something of yourself in here.

69
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,632
People do it all the time.

70
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:39,804
But you gotta want help.

71
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:44,188
And yeah, it can take years
to integrate a multiple personality,

72
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,021
but if you let me,

73
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,247
I can help you.

74
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,876
What I am, you can't fix.

75
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:55,488
Just give me another shot and go away.

76
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,025
No.

77
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:14,433
Aww, man.

78
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,455
I'm trying to pay this rent.

79
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,837
You know, it would really help if you--

80
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,714
No, it's-- it's cool, it's cool.

81
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:25,844
I know you would if you could.

82
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:28,824
Thanks anyway.

83
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,910
So have you seen my lunchbox or not?

84
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,674
I don't know.

85
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:38,267
It's wherever you left it.

86
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,869
- I left it in the car.
- Then that's where it is.

87
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,353
Okay, so where's the car?

88
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,227
Car's in the shop, Micah.

89
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:46,818
So you lost my lunchbox?

90
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:48,668
I didn't lose anything.
It's in the car.

91
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,238
Fine, you make bad lunch anyways.

92
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,038
It's not my fault
you can't keep track of your own stuff.

93
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:04,070
Mom always put my lunch
in my backpack every single morning.

94
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:05,410
Well, I'm not your mom.

95
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:06,700
Yeah, that's for sure.

96
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:09,216
Micah, this isn't easy.

97
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,474
Well, it wasn't easy for mom either.

98
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:14,908
But she always found a way
of making some money, Dad.

99
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:16,653
I'm late for school.

100
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,871
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

101
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:36,791
You said if I had an emergency,

102
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,676
to hang the chimes outside my window.

103
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:40,784
Is your father becoming suspicious?

104
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,289
No.

105
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,511
And it's kind of a problem.

106
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,189
Every word out of my mouth is a lie.

107
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,834
I have to laugh, and smile,

108
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,576
and look him in the eye.

109
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:55,716
My own father, it's breaking my heart.

110
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:58,191
Would you prefer I took your memory?

111
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:03,850
I need to know
that one thing in my life is real.

112
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:09,659
Do you know who my real parents are?

113
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,021
Of your father, I know nothing.

114
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:24,505
And my mother?

115
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,689
Only that she died in an explosion

116
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:32,067
here in Texas 14 years ago.

117
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,214
My mother died?

118
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:39,709
Are you sure?

119
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,451
Your father told me many years ago.

120
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:43,031
He had no reason to lie.

121
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,069
This is the last conversation
we have about this.

122
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:54,080
Now you need to go back home,

123
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:57,327
and forget about your real parents.

124
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:18,092
The groomer missed
one of Mr. Muggles' nails.

125
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,608
I'm gonna run him back
by the shop before they close.

126
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,838
Don't want you scratching up
my wood floors.

127
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,473
No, we don't.

128
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,935
Where's Claire?

129
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,697
She's at the library getting books
for some biology report.

130
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:32,794
I cannot believe how many projects
they lay on these kids.

131
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:35,257
I don't know how she holds
everything in that head of hers.

132
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,664
No, I don't.

133
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:40,901
You're still
worried about her, aren't you?

134
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:42,629
She's had a rough couple of weeks.

135
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:44,865
Well, besides a little memory loss...

136
00:21:45,424 --> 00:21:47,693
I'd say she's doing just peachy.

137
00:21:48,553 --> 00:21:49,865
Do you really?

138
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:52,463
It's Lyle you need to worry about.

139
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:56,850
That boy is getting
so absent-minded lately.

140
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,614
Yes, he is. We'll be back.

141
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:06,975
Yes.

142
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,480
I did everything I could.

143
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:10,502
He's dead.

144
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:13,814
Well, that's less than ideal.

145
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:16,986
What do you want me to do with the body?

146
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,061
Get it ready for shipping.

147
00:22:21,018 --> 00:22:22,266
I'll be in later.

148
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:50,942
There was a fire in an apartment house

149
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:53,157
14 years ago in Kermit, Texas.

150
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,504
Kermit, why does that sound so familiar?

151
00:22:57,321 --> 00:22:58,697
'Cause of the frog?

152
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,742
Check it out.

153
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,193
A 21-year-old woman
was killed in the explosion.

154
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,644
Meredith Gordon.

155
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:07,500
Oh, my God.

156
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:10,554
Also killed in the fire
was her 18-month-old daughter.

157
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,873
Claire, I think that's you.

158
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,293
But I didn't die.

159
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:18,756
Somebody thought you did.

160
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:21,805
What am I supposed to do with all this?

161
00:23:21,934 --> 00:23:23,783
You may still have
a real family out there.

162
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,578
Maybe you got an aunt or
a rich, eccentric uncle.

163
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,064
Great, an uncle.

164
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:34,762
Who knows, one of them
might even know who your real father is.

165
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:50,534
Surprised you left out
the flying saucers.

166
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,638
Officer Parkman,
is this really the statement

167
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:54,915
you want entered
into your public record?

168
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,990
That a paper salesman from Odessa, Texas

169
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,581
is currently harboring

170
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:01,710
a super-powered serial killer,

171
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:04,818
and that you raided
his warehouse on a hunch?

172
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:08,646
Sir, all I've ever wanted to do
was protect and serve.

173
00:24:09,691 --> 00:24:11,069
To help my fellow man.

174
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,336
I'll ask you again.

175
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,566
Do you want
your future as a police officer

176
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:18,340
to be decided
by what you've written here?

177
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:22,536
<i>Just say "Yes,"
so I can flush you down the toilet.</i>

178
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:28,924
At this time, I'd like to recant
my previous written statement.

179
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,746
I made the whole thing up.

180
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:33,810
Why did you do that?

181
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:36,443
I failed to make detective
three times, sir. And, uh...

182
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,748
Quite frankly
I was sick of directing traffic,

183
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,490
handing out speeding tickets, and I--

184
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:43,662
I wanted to look like a hero.

185
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:48,483
I am sorry for any shame
that I may have brought this department.

186
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,818
<i>Great, a liar, not a nutcase.</i>

187
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:58,739
Officer Parkman,
pending review of your case

188
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:02,110
by a civilian ombudsman
and union representative,

189
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:04,690
we're enforcing a six-month suspension

190
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:06,244
of your active duties.

191
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:09,578
We're gonna need
your gun and your badge.

192
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:25,376
Janice.

193
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,558
Matt, will you come upstairs?

194
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:31,923
Oh, Matt!

195
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,879
What?

196
00:25:34,223 --> 00:25:35,965
Now are you gonna fix the pipes?

197
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:38,095
Get me a wrench.

198
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,904
Where are you taking us?

199
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:57,867
Tell your boss
I'm on very important mission.

200
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:03,439
I know all about your so-called mission
to save the world, Mr. Nakamura.

201
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,422
You think you have a power,

202
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,095
and that you can use it
to make a difference.

1
00:26:34,316 --> 00:26:35,757
Two first class tickets.

2
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:37,628
Non-stop to Tokyo.

3
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:39,025
First class?

4
00:27:30,144 --> 00:27:31,801
You aren't answering your cell phone.

5
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:33,758
We've been looking everywhere for you.

6
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:35,350
What's he doing here?

7
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,834
Making up for past mistakes.
I'd like to help you.

8
00:27:41,403 --> 00:27:42,994
- You're leaving town?
- Yeah.

9
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:45,919
Yeah, think I'd get away
for a little while.

10
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:48,905
What, be a danger to somebody else?

11
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:50,669
There's gotta be another way, Peter.

12
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,045
- Let me help you.
- You can't.

13
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:53,419
- But maybe I can.
- How?

14
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:54,838
We can find that answer together.

15
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,333
If you allow me to test you,

16
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:57,688
with more research--

17
00:27:58,483 --> 00:27:59,731
You can cure me?

18
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,627
You're gonna fix all of this?

19
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:03,670
It'll take study and time--

20
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:06,228
Time--I don't have time
to be your guinea pig.

21
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:09,159
- I have a plane to catch.
- I'm not letting you run away, Peter.

22
00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:11,589
So what, you gonna
call the cops on me, Nathan?

23
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
You gonna tell them
your brother's going nuclear?

24
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:16,625
I could have my mentally ill
brother detained

25
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:19,001
for his own safety.

26
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,345
I know you want to help me.

27
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:34,754
You're my big brother.

28
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,146
And you fix everything.

29
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:39,071
But you can't--you can't fix
this one this time.

30
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:40,404
I can.

31
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:43,367
Look, let's just sit down,
and we can figure this out.

32
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,760
- Okay.
- Okay?

33
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,318
- Where'd he go?
- Who?

34
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,253
You're supposed to watch the door.

35
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,565
My God, did he just...?

36
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:04,653
Get down to the airport, and make sure
he doesn't get away this time.

37
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,106
Thanks. Help yourself.

38
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:29,123
- This your place?
- Yeah.

39
00:29:29,295 --> 00:29:31,962
Guy with family connections
like yours could do a lot better.

40
00:29:32,578 --> 00:29:34,750
Left the family business.
I'm a nurse now.

41
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:36,653
Nurse who's an empath, very cute.

42
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,562
"Empath," what's that mean?

43
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,584
Means you're a pain in my ass, mate.

44
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:43,584
Yeah, but you followed me.

45
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,264
Well, I'm not very much
of a people person,

46
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:48,704
but I'm certain I'm not
gonna let you kill 'em all.

47
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:51,290
You seem pretty sure
about that pending apocalypse of yours.

48
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,343
Yeah, not unless you help me control it.

49
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,560
You don't know what you're asking
and have to go through.

50
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:58,259
You might want to reconsider dying.

51
00:29:58,434 --> 00:29:59,510
Hell of a lot easier.

52
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:00,692
I can handle it.

53
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,542
Yeah, that's what they all say.

54
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:04,713
"They"?

55
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:08,324
How many--how many people
have you taught before me?

56
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:13,960
Come on, mate, I'll steal us a cab.

57
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:19,078
You coming or not?

58
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:46,248
So they suspended me for six months.

59
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,334
Oh, Matt.

60
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:53,780
I actually thought this ability
was gonna be a good thing.

61
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:55,565
And now I'm unemployed,

62
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:58,008
and about to lose my marriage.

63
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:03,642
You haven't lost that.

64
00:31:04,653 --> 00:31:05,814
Not yet anyway.

65
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,590
Thanks, that's encouraging.

66
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:11,009
Look, we--

67
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,265
We just have to trust each other.

68
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:18,739
I can do that.

69
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:27,531
Now...

70
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,810
So I'm gonna give you
one more freebie.

71
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:36,857
What am I thinking?

72
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:43,952
We're having a baby?

73
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:51,054
We're having a baby!

74
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:01,871
Nik, what have they done to you?

75
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:06,479
- If they catch you--
- They won't.

76
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:10,414
Come closer.

77
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:11,993
What is it?

78
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:14,982
Your shirt.

79
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:18,129
It smells like home.

80
00:32:20,602 --> 00:32:22,000
How's Micah?

81
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,402
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

82
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:30,241
It's just...

83
00:32:32,112 --> 00:32:33,595
I can't do this, Nik.

84
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,504
Not alone.

85
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,152
I thought
I could handle everything, but I--

86
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,894
D.L, you can't do this to me.

87
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,797
I gotta find a way
to get you outta here.

88
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:46,559
This is crazy.

89
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:48,387
I can walk in here
any time I want, right?

90
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:49,785
I should be able to get you out.

91
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:51,742
I am gonna be in here for a long time.

92
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:54,156
The rest of my life maybe.

93
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:56,995
You need to get used to that.

94
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:58,475
Your son needs you.

95
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,629
Damn it, D.L, that is not fair.

96
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:04,178
I am counting on you.

97
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:08,074
You know that I need to stay in here.

98
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:09,730
I need you, Nik.

99
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:13,072
We need you.

100
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,545
He's having such a hard time
without you.

101
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,319
You need to talk to him.

102
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:24,122
You need to be honest.

103
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:28,441
He needs boundaries and a strong hand.

104
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,065
It's not too late.

105
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:42,101
You need to go.

106
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:45,714
Go.

107
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:45,871
There's only 12 people in Kermit
with the last name "Gordon."

108
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:49,311
So far, only three.

109
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:52,518
None of them
have ever heard of Meredith.

110
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:56,239
Hold on.

111
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,733
I'll call you back.

112
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:03,102
Sorry, I was just, uh,

113
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,924
talking to Zach about our report.

114
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:11,511
Well, Molly in accounting
is married to a marine biologist,

115
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,252
and he said that--

116
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:15,922
You're already on top of it.

117
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,911
Did you know that
all three varieties of manatee

118
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:21,524
are vulnerable to extinction?

119
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,105
No, I didn't.

120
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,587
Is everything all right?

121
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,974
We haven't talked in a while.

122
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:37,350
Actually, there is something.

123
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:39,587
Yeah?

124
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:43,774
The bears.

125
00:35:44,505 --> 00:35:45,731
My stuffed bears.

126
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:48,924
I think it's time for them to migrate.

127
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:55,010
I'm almost 16, Dad,
bears and talks can't last forever.

128
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:59,698
Whether you're 16, or 32, or 64--

129
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,085
- When I'm 64, you'll--
- I will be there for you.

130
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:06,098
Always.

131
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,266
Don't you think it's time I learn
how to deal with my own problems?

132
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,530
Well, dinner's in an hour.

133
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:29,789
And, uh, do me a favor.
No--

134
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:32,133
No extinction talk at the table.

135
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,025
You know how sensitive your mother is.

136
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:56,751
You have a change of heart?

137
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:58,772
My son.

138
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:05,107
- My family needs me.
- So--

139
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:08,629
I want you to understand
that there are no guarantees.

140
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,876
I don't care.

141
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:12,276
I need to get rid of Jessica.

142
00:37:14,104 --> 00:37:15,722
So you know what might help?

143
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:20,410
If I could talk to her.

144
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,322
- All right?
- Isn't there another way?

145
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:25,500
No.

146
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:27,651
I'm afraid in cases like these,

147
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:29,866
it is imperative that I have interaction

148
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:32,485
with all aspects
of the patient's personality.

149
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,560
Honey, let me talk to her.

150
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:39,608
You can't.

151
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,490
So let me put it to you this way.

152
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:43,888
Either I speak with Jessica,

153
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:47,385
or you may not see your little boy
for a very, very long time.

154
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,610
But...

155
00:38:03,706 --> 00:38:04,846
Wait.

156
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,817
Micah, where have you been?

157
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:18,407
I was worried to death.

158
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,053
I was just out walking around.

159
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,655
Sit down!

160
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:32,763
Micah, we gotta figure this out.

161
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,096
'Cause the truth is
your mom's not coming home,

162
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:38,540
and I'm having a really hard time here.

163
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:40,823
I can't get a job.

164
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,451
I can barely pay the rent.

165
00:38:44,182 --> 00:38:45,494
I've never felt much

166
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,530
like a man in my life.

167
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:51,970
My papa nerver taught me,

168
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:56,000
but I want to be a good dad to you.

169
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,957
I'm gonna need your help.

170
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,664
We gotta pull together
and make this work.

171
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,277
'Cause it's just you and me.

172
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:04,868
I'm sorry, Dad.

173
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,361
I can try harder.

174
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:15,205
Maybe this will help.

175
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:25,685
Where'd you get--

176
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:27,857
Where'd you get this from?

177
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
You know how you and Mom have a secret?

178
00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:34,781
Well, I have a secret too.

179
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,086
That's up to the boss.

180
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:05,108
Hi, I'm looking for someone
related to Meredith Gordon.

181
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,631
She died in an explosion 14 years ago.

182
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:10,074
<i>I've been calling everyone in Kermit</i>

183
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:12,302
<i>with the last name of "Gordon."</i>

184
00:41:12,623 --> 00:41:14,709
<i>Any chance that you're related to her?</i>

185
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:16,371
Who is this?

186
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:19,274
My name's Claire Bennet,
I'm calling from Odessa.

187
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,002
What--

188
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:22,483
What is this about?

189
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:24,742
And how do you know
the name "Meredith Gordon"?

190
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,021
I think she was my mom.

191
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:29,623
Is this some kind of joke?

192
00:41:30,564 --> 00:41:31,769
No, ma'am.

193
00:41:33,898 --> 00:41:36,263
Well, Meredith only had one daughter,

194
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:38,736
and she died in the fire.

195
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:42,704
That's kind of what
I'm trying to say is...

196
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:44,624
I didn't die.

197
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:47,893
I think I'm her
and I'm looking for any information

198
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:49,400
I can find about my mom.

199
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,486
Well, then you made the right call.

200
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:56,072
This is her.

201
00:41:57,685 --> 00:41:58,803
Mom?

202
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,799
Yeah.

203
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:45,127
How's Claire?

204
00:42:50,397 --> 00:42:51,408
