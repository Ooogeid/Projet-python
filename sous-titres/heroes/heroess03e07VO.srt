00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,390
Previously on Heroes:

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,430
Peter,I'm your brother.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,550
You gave me this hunger. You made me a monster.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,480
Now ican't control it. I'm just like you.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,330
They want to create a world filled with dangerous people.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,120
They will destroy everything.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,670
Dad.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,470
Come give your father a hug.

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,480
You don't have your powers anymore,Peter...

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,520
Because I have them now.

11
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,110
You are a monster...

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,860
iwish you hadn't said that.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,640
We need your help.

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,650
We can be of great assistance to each other.

15
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,240
And you're sure there's no side effects?

16
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,530
We came to you for help.

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,750
What'd he done to us?

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,000
We have not finished yet.

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,590
Pull the triger.

20
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,710
You can't fight him.

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,800
That was fun.

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,870
Show's over.

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,310
What is it?

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:03,810
I'm not sure...

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,350
But I've definitely seen this card before.

26
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,860
You're going to Africa.

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,800
Precog.

28
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,100
He can see the future.

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,520
Whatever he paints comes true.

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,880
My boss can't have someone like that out there.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,890
Evil forces gather.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,790
The dark sun rises.

33
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,960
Soon it will be too late.

34
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,530
Will you choose your own path

35
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,400
Or will you have it chosen for you?

36
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,210
You've ruined everything.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,240
Don't come any closer.

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,350
What the hell happened in here?

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,590
I'm trying to help Maya to remove her ability.

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,420
So you knock us out?

41
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,190
You experiment on us?

42
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,360
Your abilities are synthetic.

43
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,060
They may hold the key to creating a cure.

44
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,560
If I could have one more sample

45
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,430
No,it's finished.

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,700
We're done.

47
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,950
Dad's dead.

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,220
He had a heart attack.

49
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,520
Your father,he was deeply flawed

50
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,060
In ways you will never know.

51
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,360
I can't believe he's gone.

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,400
Dad's dead.

53
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,870
Dad?

54
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,510
You're dead.

55
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,740
Dad's dead.

56
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,770
He had a heart attack this morning.

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,410
Come give your father a hug.

58
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,380
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,490
No!

60
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,690
Take it easy,Peter.

61
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,660
Your body is still in shock.

62
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,500
You took my abilities.

63
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,940
You gave me no choice,son.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,140
Are they gone forever?

65
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,270
Yes.

66
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,780
How am I supposed to believe any of this?

67
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,180
You've been dead for over a year.

68
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,450
Then I find you preaching to some supervillian gang?

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,680
I'm sorry that I lied to you and your brother,

70
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,520
But I've had to make hard choices for the greater good.

71
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,060
Giving everyone on the planet an ability.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,030
That's really your idea of the greater good?

73
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,190
That's not what I want.

74
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,430
That's what happens.

75
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,100
I've seen the future,dad.

76
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,230
I've seen the whole neighborhood get nuked.

77
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,930
You can help me.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,300
Together we can make sure that the future you saw

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,470
Never happens.

80
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,600
Once you understand what I'm doing...

81
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,670
I'm not interested in what you're doing.

82
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,980
With or without my powers,

83
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,210
I'm going to find a way to shut you down,

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,280
And I'm going to make you pay for everything you've ever done.

85
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,620
Son,

86
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,160
until you change that attitude.

87
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,160
You're grounded.

88
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,110
You okay?

89
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,350
I think so.

90
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,050
Is that weird?

91
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,380
We just starred in a human puppet show.

92
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,120
My dad is working with a serial killer.

93
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,190
And I can't feel pain.

94
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,060
Claire,the things you deal with.

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,690
The demons you face,I can't imagine...

96
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,630
How you handle them.

97
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,730
That you stay strong in the face of it all.

98
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
That makes me proud.

99
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,740
Thanks.

100
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,880
What's wrong with the lights?

101
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,050
I'm going to check the circuit breakers.

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,290
Lyle!

103
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,160
Oh,my god. What happened?

104
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,890
Are you okay?

105
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,730
Bitch is back.

106
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,870
Elle?

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Hey,cheerleader.

108
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,830
What the hell are you doing here?

109
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,460
Get out of my house.

110
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,330
Not until I get what I came for.

111
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,870
Fine.

112
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,000
Then I'll throw you out!

113
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,380
Leave me alone!

114
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,860
Why are you here?

115
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,730
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,200
I need help.

117
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,440
And I didn't know where else to go.

118
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,300
I apologize for keeping you waiting,doctor.

119
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,700
I'm Arthur Petrelli.

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,840
Everyone thinks you're dead.

121
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,370
That was the idea.

122
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
What could possibly drive a father

123
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,410
To put his children through such grief?

124
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,050
Have you met their mother?

125
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,680
How is our patient?

126
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,590
Terrified.

127
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,820
She thinks I'm a monster

128
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,490
And has no idea where she is.

129
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,920
Nor do I,for that matter.

130
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,930
You're among friends.

131
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,230
I promised Maya

132
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,060
I would remove her abilities and end her suffering.

133
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,730
I will do anything to keep that promise.

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,500
All you have to do is watch.

135
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,730
Get away from me.

136
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,500
Get him out of here.

137
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,980
You're telling me all traces

138
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,810
of Maya's ability have been removed from her system.

139
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,980
I take it all

140
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,890
and leave nothing behind.

141
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,620
Could you do the same to me?

142
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,490
Is that what you want?

143
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,120
To be normal again?

144
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,630
I injected myself with an unstable formula.

145
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,160
Its side effects are changing me into something else,

146
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,370
something I don't understand.

147
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,400
I need to find a way to reverse the changes

148
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,740
and retain my abilities.

149
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,860
This isn't my formula.

150
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,690
The cytologies are similar,

151
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,000
but these protein links are enmeshed.

152
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,360
Has it been successful?

153
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,730
We've taken it as far as we can.

154
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,000
That's why we need you.

155
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,040
If you can make our version of the formula successful,

156
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,580
a fresh injection might be exactly what you need.

157
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,710
I've been down this road before.

158
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,710
There is always a hidden agenda.

159
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,450
A self serving motivation behind it all.

160
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,960
If you don't want to be here,leave.

161
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,730
I'll need test subjects.

162
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,740
Gabriel.

163
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,270
Momma.

164
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,970
How are you here? You're sick.

165
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,740
Peter needs your help.

166
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,340
Peter doesn't want anything to do with me,

167
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,880
he thinks I'm just a killer.

168
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,380
This isn't about what he wants.

169
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,950
This is about what I am telling you to do.

170
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,190
Now stop feeling sorry for yourself

171
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,020
and get out of this cell.

172
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,220
This is where I belong...

173
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,530
In a cage.

174
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,460
I couldn't escape even if I wanted to.

175
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,060
They're blocking my abilities.

176
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,460
Then how do you explain my being here?

177
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,670
Oh,Gabriel...

178
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,410
You don't know the half of what you're capable of.

179
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,510
Show them.

180
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,650
Show them all why you're my favorite.

181
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,580
Make mommy proud.

182
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,770
Don't worry,mom.

183
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,270
I'll save Peter.

184
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,210
Are you going to be okay?

185
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,210
Yeah,fine.

186
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,580
I'm leaving.

187
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,860
Is... there something wrong with you?

188
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,500
I can't control it anymore.

189
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,870
I keep overloading.

190
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,100
And I can't eat,

191
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,040
I can't sleep...

192
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,410
This girl found me,

193
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,550
said I should go to this company,Pinehearst.

194
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,780
That they knew what was wrong with me

195
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,980
and how to get me better.

196
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,720
But I've never heard of it.

197
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,020
I didn't want to go there

198
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,150
without knowing what the deal was.

199
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,920
And your dad,

200
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,420
your dad always seemed to be the one

201
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,230
with the answers.

202
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,930
So home invasion time.

203
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,670
What if there's something wrong with all of us

204
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,940
and they can fix it?

205
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,340
You're fine.

206
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,110
You're perfect.

207
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,780
No,I'm not.

208
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,280
Whatever's happening to you,

209
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,020
it's happening to me,too.

210
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,620
You're still healing,aren't you?

211
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,190
Yeah.

212
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,260
But I can't feel pain.

213
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,430
And I think it's only a matter of time

214
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,660
before I can't feel anything at all.

215
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,630
You can't feel pain.

216
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,760
I wish I had your problems,

217
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,430
cheerleader.

218
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,440
My body is screaming.

219
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,670
I'm in agony.

220
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,710
Go with me.

221
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,080
If there's a chance that these people

222
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,820
at Pinehearst can help us,we'll go together.

223
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,190
All right,Dorothy.

224
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,530
Then we're off to see the wizard.

225
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,470
Daphne.

226
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,440
You have a mess to clean up.

227
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,440
I do?

228
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,810
You were supposed to recruit my son,Matt Parkman.

229
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,950
Yeah,I gave him the pitch,but he wasn't buying.

230
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,050
I mean,the guy's a mind reader.

231
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,190
Were you thinking something

232
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,760
which would discourage him from joining us?

233
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,930
That's not what I meant.

234
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,130
She's lying.

235
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,070
I am not.

236
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,400
Then why are you so scared?

237
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,910
How can I fix this?

238
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,180
Revisit Mr.Parkman.

239
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,250
But I don't think he's going to take the deal.

240
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,110
You're not going there to offer him anything.

241
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,220
You're going there to kill him.

242
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,220
What?

243
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,790
I just asked her to kill your son,

244
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,490
Maury,is that a problem?

245
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,890
You're damn right.

246
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,090
My loyalty for his safety.

247
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,490
That was the arrangement.

248
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,630
I'm a thief.

249
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,730
I steal things.

250
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,030
There's no way I could kill anybody.

251
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,270
I'm not going to let you do this,Arthur.

252
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,200
You're not in a position to give me orders.

253
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm Matt's father.

254
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,270
Without me,you'd still be lying...

255
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,710
Thank you,Maury,

256
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,280
For all your sacrifice.

257
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,890
Please.

258
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,890
There has to be another way.

259
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,820
But you don't know anything about this place.

260
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,620
Look,Elle needs help and so do I.

261
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,790
This Pinehearst place could be our best shot.

262
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,220
Pinehearst,sounds like a dishwashing liquid.

263
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,560
I gotta call your dad.

264
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,930
Mom.

265
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,230
Please don't.

266
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,230
Claire,he loves you.

267
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,930
I know.

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,430
But there's something inside of me,

269
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,770
and it's broken.

270
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,870
And he can't fix it.

271
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,710
I think I'm the only one who can.

272
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,980
Do you understand that?

273
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,350
Do you really think you can trust Elle?

274
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,650
No.

275
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,320
But we both want the same thing.

276
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,960
We need our abilities under control.

277
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,190
If she gives you any lip,

278
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,300
You just toss a glass of water on her...

279
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,730
Lyle style.

280
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,070
This is Dr. Mohinder Suresh.

281
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,500
I am not available.

282
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,040
Please leave a message,and I'll call you back.

283
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,110
Mohinder,it's matt.

284
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,410
Where the hell you been,man?

285
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,810
I just got back from the craziest week of my life.

286
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,550
Uh,do me a favor,give me a call as soon as possible,okay?

287
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,020
Put down the phone.

288
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,020
Daphne.

289
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,590
What are you doing?

290
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,920
They think that I told you not to come to Pinehearst.

291
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,830
That I warned you away.

292
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,490
They don't believe I'm one of them.

293
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,060
- Well,you're not.  - Shut up.

294
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,630
If I don't kill you,they'll kill me.

295
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,940
Shoot.

296
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,540
- What?  - Shoot me.

297
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,010
Go ahead.

298
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,640
If it's the only way that I can save your life,do it.

299
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,980
You think you know me,

300
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,910
That I'm worth saving,but I've done some bad things.

301
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
You make up for all that in the future.

302
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,420
I don't have a future...

303
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,150
Unless I kill you,so... turn around.

304
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,860
Do it.

305
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,840
We get married.

306
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,310
We start a family together.

307
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,310
Stop it.

308
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,280
We're going to love each other.

309
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm sorry,Matt.

310
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,700
It happened so fast,there was nothing I could do.

311
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,440
My dad?

312
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,800
So I guess you're not going to help.

313
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,030
Don't do this,dad.

314
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,340
Please,you're going to destroy the world.

315
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,670
I don't see it that way.

316
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,640
You think you're better than everyone else?

317
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,210
That you have the right to do whatever you want?

318
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,040
Hurt anyone that gets in your way?

319
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,140
I am better,Peter.

320
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,680
It's not a belief,it's a fact.

321
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,780
And one way or another,you will help me get this done.

322
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,330
Suresh.

323
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,740
Hello,Peter.

324
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,570
So you're helping my father.

325
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,640
I prefer to think he's helping me.

326
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,270
And what is that?

327
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,980
Your metabolism is primed to accept abilities.

328
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,950
Which makes you the ideal test case

329
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,620
For a new version of the formula.

330
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,850
I need to perfect it.

331
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,080
Wait,wait,wait,when I saw you in the future,

332
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,990
You said that manipulating abilities was wrong.

333
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,220
That this was all a mistake.

334
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,360
Did I?

335
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,560
You were trying to help me,Mohinder.

336
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,760
You need to tell me something,

337
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,760
In this future of yours...

338
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,930
What do I look like?

339
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,570
There was something wrong with you.

340
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,970
You changed.

341
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,440
You looked like a monster.

342
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,980
Then you're too late.

343
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,620
Suresh,no.

344
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,490
Hello,Mohinder.

345
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,170
You came for me?

346
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,130
That's what brothers do,Peter.

347
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,500
They look out for each other.

348
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,470
Even after I locked you up?

349
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,240
Let's get out of here.

350
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,380
Stop,leave him alone!

351
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,280
He deserves to die.

352
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,750
Peter.

353
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
This is for killing my father.

354
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,260
That's enough.

355
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,420
Enough!

356
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,790
Do you know who this man is?

357
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,760
Do you have any idea

358
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,800
how many innocent people he's killed?

359
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,030
I do. But he's also my son.

360
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,970
And I've been waiting for him for a long time.

361
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,850
It's been hours.

362
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,150
Who'd you talk to over there?

363
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,950
Some guy from the company.

364
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,290
He can keep a secret,right?

365
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,090
I hope so.

366
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,690
Do you think they're alive?

367
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,730
Do you think they're human?

368
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,930
What if they can't breathe?

369
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
Tracy...

370
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,240
We need to help them.

371
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,110
Be careful.

372
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,480
Oh,god.

373
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,880
It's too tough.

374
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,930
I told you not to touch anything.

375
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,500
You.

376
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,530
Meredith.

377
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,970
Nathan.

378
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,770
Well,I see you've still got a weakness for blondes.

379
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,250
Everything all right?

380
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,490
I'm what some people would refer to

381
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,030
as an anxious flyer.

382
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,170
Big tough company agent can't handle being 30,000 feet up?

383
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,640
Yeah,well I was never a very good agent.

384
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,270
So I read.

385
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,740
You,uh,let all those villains escape level five,right?

386
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,580
Shut up.

387
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah,I caught Doyle.

388
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,150
I helped clean up your mess.

389
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,620
Doyle?

390
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Yeah,the freak with the puppets.

391
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,920
This agent thing isn't so hard.

392
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,350
You know,my father pushed me

393
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,520
into this life.

394
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,860
I wanted no part of it.

395
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
And if you do,you're an idiot.

396
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,960
Elle.

397
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,060
You have no idea how good you have it.

398
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,830
This is your captain speaking.

399
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,000
We'd like to remind our passengers

400
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,970
to turn off all electrical equipment.

401
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Thank you.

402
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,710
- I think he's talking about you.  - Shut up!

403
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,440
Seriously,calm down.

404
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,910
You have to turn it off or we're going to crash.

405
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,050
If I knew how to do that,

406
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,480
I wouldn't be here in the first place.

407
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,100
Take my hand.

408
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,330
Let me help you.

409
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,600
Dump your electricity into me.

410
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,200
Do it!

411
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,330
We did it.

412
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,000
Do you mind?

413
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,050
My dad and I weren't even close.

414
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,180
To think that he would ever put himself

415
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,690
in danger to protect me...

416
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,420
Well,he didn't do it,so you can sit

417
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,450
around here and wait to get killed.

418
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,620
What do you mean?

419
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,620
Pinehearst.

420
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,230
They'll be sending someone after me

421
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,460
to make sure you're dead.

422
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,730
Let them come.

423
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,530
Mm,yeah. Great.

424
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,130
You're going to use your brain mojo thingy.

425
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,170
Perfect.

426
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,000
If you need to go,I understand.

427
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,470
But I can't let them get away with this.

428
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,840
I wanna help you. I'm just scared.

429
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,340
So am I.

430
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,510
But we can't let our fears stop us from doing what's right.

431
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,720
I knew you couldn't kill him.

432
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,320
I'm sorry,Matt.

433
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,660
No,stick to the plan.

434
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,530
Your fear is making me strong,girl.

435
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,560
I can't.

436
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,760
No.

437
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,260
No!

438
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,600
Stop.

439
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,740
You think you can hold me

440
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,040
with a power?

441
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,970
Not only can I hold you,I can kill you.

442
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,010
I'm going to dig inside your head,

443
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,950
Find your worst fear,and make it eat you alive.

444
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,150
I'm not the one that's scared.

445
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,920
You are.

446
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,120
And your fear just makes me strong.

447
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,580
Matt...

448
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,980
That was amazing.

449
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,980
Yeah,well you know,

450
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,980
I got inside his head with my brain mojo thingy.

451
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,690
My dad could do the same thing.

452
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,090
Now that they think that we're dead,

453
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,220
we have time to get away.

454
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,360
No.

455
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,930
I told you,I'm not running.

456
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,030
What are you going to do,Matt?

457
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,730
Fight them?

458
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,060
Trick them into killing each other?

459
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,000
That's not going to bring your dad back.

460
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,300
But it will probably get you killed.

461
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,500
I'm a cop.

462
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,540
Stopping guys like Knox,that's what I do.

463
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,640
You can't bring them down by yourself.

464
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,870
There's no way.

465
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,040
Even with me at your back,we still need help.

466
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,180
There's a company,Primatech.

467
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,580
They know how to deal with situations like this.

468
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,820
If anybody can help,they can.

469
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,520
Building sealed up tight.

470
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,360
If Peter's still here,he ain't getting out.

471
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,330
Peter's long gone.

472
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,700
If I find him,do you want him crispy or well-done?

473
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,130
Alive,please.

474
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,400
I sent somebody to recruit you,

475
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,610
When you refused her offer,I didn't expect to see you here.

476
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,310
My mother's in a coma. Did you do that?

477
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,510
Angela's not the woman you think she is,Gabriel.

478
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,880
She's done terrible things.

479
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,320
So have I,and I'm going to do them all to you.

480
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,490
Has Angela forgiven your sins?

481
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,960
My mother accepts me for who I am.

482
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,220
I wonder if you'll be so generous.

483
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,830
What are you talking about?

484
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
She sent you here,didn't she?

485
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,330
To save her favorite son.

486
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Did she tell you that you were all

487
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,470
Going to live happily ever after?

488
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,840
She's using you,son,as a weapon.

489
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,910
A blunt instrument

490
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,880
To be manipulated and then discarded.

491
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,480
My mother loves me.

492
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,880
When you were born,she had one of her dreams.

493
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,310
A vision of the future.

494
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,420
She saw what you would become...

495
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,450
Yeah,I know this.

496
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,480
She told me I'd become a hero.

497
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,350
Did she?

498
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,490
Angela was so terrified of what she saw,

499
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
So frightened of her own flesh and blood,

500
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,590
That she tried to kill you.

501
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,160
Imagine that,a mother wanting to murder her own child.

502
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,500
I got to the bathroom just in time.

503
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,070
She was holding you at the bottom of the tub.

504
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,350
It's time you learned the truth about your mother.

505
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,180
That's...

506
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,540
Far enough.

507
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,380
I was told you were leaving.

508
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,220
Maybe one day I could forgive you,

509
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,390
But after everything that's happened,

510
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,860
I just... I don't think I could ever trust you.

511
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,390
I know it's hard to believe,

512
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,430
But I was trying to help.

513
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,430
My feelings for you were real.

514
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,800
Those feelings are still there.

515
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,600
What you did in my name was wrong.

516
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,040
I wish I could take it all back.

517
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,840
I've done bad things,killed people...

518
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,480
Not by choice,but still...

519
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,980
I did them.

520
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:52,520
I need to make amends.

521
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,420
And so do you.

522
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,090
Get well,Mohinder.

523
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,340
- Ah!  - Hold on.

524
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,750
We're almost there. You all right?

525
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,450
Thank you.

526
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,080
For what?

527
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,490
For helping me.

528
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,750
I've been nothing but a bitch.

529
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,850
And you've been nothing but sweet.

530
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,590
Really just makes me hate you more.

531
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,830
No,I should be the one thanking you.

532
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,160
Why?

533
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,800
Because I was ready to give up.

534
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,030
Stay home,deny everything that's been happening to me.

535
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,070
I was scared.

536
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,470
Scared of what?

537
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,710
What I would find out about who I really am.

538
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,380
It's just...

539
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,180
It's nice to know that you're as messed up as I am.

540
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,050
Peter,you stayed?

541
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,590
I wasn't going to leave you.

542
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,650
What are you doing sitting here?

543
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Did he take your powers?

544
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,860
No,he told me the truth.

545
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,890
You can't listen to him.

546
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,360
But he's our father.

547
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,060
He's my father. I grew up with him.

548
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,260
Oh,and I didn't,so I don't get the right to know him.

549
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,400
Is that what you're saying?

550
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,030
He can't be trusted.

551
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,930
You've seen what he's done.

552
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
He hurt mom.

553
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,140
He's manipulated abilities,

554
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,300
I know where that leads.

555
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,470
The world you saw

556
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,410
Doesn't exist.

557
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,710
We won't let it.

558
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,280
I'm sorry,Peter,this is something I have to do.

559
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,510
You help him,and you're proving

560
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,780
all the worst things I've ever said about you.

561
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,350
Just kick his ass and let's get out of here.

562
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,820
No,I'm not going anywhere,Peter.

563
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,690
You are.

564
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,290
Oh,my god. Peter.

565
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,730
What are you doing here?

566
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,360
Why are you bleeding?

567
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,030
He's not healing.

568
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,330
He took my ability. We need to go.

569
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,170
Elle,help me

570
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,670
Get him in the car.

571
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,570
Claire...

572
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,670
Did you hear what he said?

573
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,680
That they took his ability.

574
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,040
That's what we came here for.

575
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,450
You don't know what happened up there.

576
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,920
I'm sorry,Claire.

577
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
Elle!

578
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,920
If you can't heal,

579
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,520
How did you fall that far and not die?

580
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,460
I don't know.

581
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,460
Okay,let me get this straight.

582
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,130
She's the biological mother

583
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,470
Of your illegitimate daughter,

584
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,100
And he's her adopted father.

585
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,840
That sounds about right.

586
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,310
Did Suresh inject you with anything?

587
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,010
Yeah,a tranquilizer,why?

588
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,750
What's he doing in there?

589
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,620
Building a nest.

590
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,120
Laying eggs. Who the hell knows?

591
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,620
You're both going to have to come into the company

592
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,960
- To be tested.  - For what?

593
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,930
Just to be sure you're still normal.

594
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,810
So you're working with him?

595
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,250
For now.

596
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,920
Excuse me.

597
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,020
Petrelli.

598
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,990
I'd watch out for that one.

599
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,390
Oh,we're not together.

600
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,260
Oh.

601
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,900
Claire?

602
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,670
Slow down,slow down.

603
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,600
Where are you?

604
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,600
No,I won't tell anyone.

605
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,280
Peter's never going to give up,you know.

606
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,910
I would expect nothing less of a Petrelli.

607
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,580
Revenge is in our blood.

608
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,380
We're just gonna wait for him to come after us.

609
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,820
No,son.

610
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:00,320
We're going to take our fight to the enemy.

611
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,260
How do you suppose Peter survived that fall?

612
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,500
Seven stories without the ability to heal.

613
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,400
Hell of a thing.

614
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,440
I don't know.

615
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,510
Hello?

616
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,940
It worked.

617
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,680
He thinks I'm on his side.

618
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,010
Good job.

619
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,210
If he reaches out to Primatech,

620
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,950
I'll let you know what they say.

621
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,150
Screw this up,

622
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,990
and I'll put you right back where I found you.

623
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,210
I keep thinking about that fall.

624
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,620
How I didn't hit as hard as I should have.

625
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,220
What if Sylar didn't want me to die?

626
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,250
What if...

627
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,820
He wanted to get me out of there alive?

628
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,760
By throwing you out of a window?

629
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,130
No,he could have used his ability to slow me down.

630
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,270
I'm telling you he saved my life,Claire.

631
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,740
Claire.

632
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,480
It's all right. She's good.

633
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,340
What happened?

634
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,480
Why aren't you healing?

635
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,690
I don't have my powers anymore,Nathan.

636
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,630
Dad took them.

637
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,690
Dad's dead.

638
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,530
He's not,he's alive.

639
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,360
I was there,Pete. I saw it...

640
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,130
He's alive,Nathan.

641
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,300
And if we don't do something to stop him,

642
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,270
He's going to kill us all.

643
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,820
That's just... that's impossible,Pete.

644
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,990
Dad died over a year ago.

645
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,960
He's the one who put mom in that coma.

646
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,100
Pete,this is our dad we're talking about here.

647
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,510
Believe me,dads aren't always what they seem.

648
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,580
- Where is he?  - Stay away from him.

649
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,480
He's dangerous,Nathan.

650
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,050
Look what he did to me.

651
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,750
If our father's alive,

652
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,950
I need to know where he is.

653
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,990
What's the name of the company?

654
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,190
Pinehearst.

655
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,230
Pinehearst,the bio-tech firm?

656
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,670
No,I'm not going to let you do this.

657
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,730
Nathan...

658
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,370
Trust me.

659
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,970
- Please.  - Okay.

660
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,210
We'll do it your way.

661
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,880
There's a lot of ways to shut Pinehearst down.

662
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,980
I'll go call somebody up from the justice department.

663
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,680
We'll get some help.

664
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,100
You're not going to listen to a word he just said,are you?

665
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,260
Nope,

666
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,630
I'm going to see my father.

667
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,300
How do you know about Pinehearst?

668
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,500
I've been taking a consultant fee

669
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,970
from them for over a year.

670
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,840
I'm coming with you.

671
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:30,680
I know the players there,I can open doors.

672
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,150
I don't need any doors opened.

673
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,050
I plan on kicking them down.

674
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,760
Is that food?

675
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,990
It's a recipe.

676
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,860
It's been in my family for thousands of years.

677
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,630
You refuse to go back in time.

678
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,170
Even if it means saving the world.

679
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,900
I cannot risk changing history.

680
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,240
If only there is some other way

681
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,810
of learning about my enemies.

682
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,710
Uncovering their weak spots,so I can defeat them.

683
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,610
For thousands of years,my family

684
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,350
have taken spirit walks.

685
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,050
Following destiny's path

686
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,220
into the realms of the unconsciousness.

687
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,600
Delicious.

688
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,440
Spirit walk sounds much safer

689
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,610
than time traveling.

690
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,980
Okay...

691
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,810
I'm ready to begin my journey.

692
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,210
How do I start?

693
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,780
You eat a disgusting paste

694
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,620
made from the roots of a tamboti tree.

695
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,150
And the dung of hyena.

696
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,230
And then?

697
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,200
You wait.

698
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,640
Hiro!

699
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,480
Hiro!

700
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,550
You tricked him.

701
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,020
I warned him.

702
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,150
If he did not choose his path,

703
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,920
it would be chosen for him.

704
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,020
Hiro.

705
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,220
Hiro.

706
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,390
He's going to wake up,right?

707
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,290
He's going to be okay?

708
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,660
Hiro... Hiro,Hiro!

709
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,800
Hiro!

710
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


711
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
