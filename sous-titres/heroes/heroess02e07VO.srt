00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,100
It All Points To Montreal.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
What Is This Place?

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,600
"We Were Right
About The Company.

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,500
The World Is In Danger.
Adam."

7
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,900
Please Tell Me Who I Am.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,200
What The Future Holds.

9
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,600
We'll Figure It Out.

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,500
We're In New York.

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Where Is Everyone?

12
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,800
It's An Evacuation Order.

13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,600
<I>June 14, 2008.</I>

14
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,800
This Is Next Year.

15
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,000
<I>This Thing We Could Do,
It Only Begins</I>

16
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,000
At Reading Minds.

17
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,800
And Then
It Becomes So Much More.

18
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,800
My Dad Can Put A Thought
Into Anyone's Head.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
Now We Know Why Molly
Calls Him The Nightmare Man.

20
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,700
(Nathan)
It's Bob.

21
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,500
(Matt)
He Runs The Company.

22
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,700
<I>(Nathan)
Looks Like He's Next.</I>

23
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,400
You Sure You're Gonna
Be Able To Cure Me?

24
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,600
In Exchange,
We're Going To Want

25
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,300
A Little Something From You.

26
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,800
Hello, Dr. Suresh.

27
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,100
So You're...

28
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Your New Partner.

29
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,700
Claire!

30
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,800
<I>Oh, My God!</I>

31
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,100
<I>Did You See Her Face?</I>

32
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,400
Somebody Could Have Seen Us!

33
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,600
Relax!

34
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,500
Just Think Of It
As A Lesson

35
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
In Humility.

36
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,200
At's On Your Neck?

37
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,100
<I>Last Thing I Remember,
This Man</I>

38
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,700
Stepping Out Of The Bushes,
Calling My Name.

39
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,200
What Are You Talking About?
What Man?

40
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
The Guy With
The Horn-Rimmed Glasses.

41
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,800
<I>Wait, It's The Warehouse
Nearhe Train Yard.</I>

42
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,700
You Will Find
Your Paintings There.

43
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,300
I Saw You, Hiro.

44
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,000
And You, Friend,
Betrayed Me.

45
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,100
You Can't Stop Time With Your
Nose Stuck In A Dollop Of Opium.

46
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,900
Please.Let Him Go.

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm Sorry,"My Love."

48
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,700
I Can't Do That.

49
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,100
Why Are You Doing This?

50
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,100
White Beard Offered Me Anything
I Wanted To Capture Hiro.

51
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,700
I Asked For Half The Country.

52
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,100
And For You.

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,400
As My Princess.

54
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
You Will Never Have Me.

55
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,300
I Love Hiro.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
You Hear That, Carp?

57
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,100
She Thinks She Loves You.

58
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,100
Poor, Pitiful You.

59
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,100
You Are Supposed To Be A Hero.

60
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,200
After I Lead White Beard's Army
To Victory,

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,300
I Will Be The Greatest Leader
Japan Has Ever Known.

62
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,700
I Will Change History.

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,300
<I>(Mr. Bennet)
Have They Given You A Gun?</I>

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,600
What Are You Talking About?

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,900
A Gun.
Company Issue.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
Where Have You Been?
I Need To Talk To You.

68
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,500
<I>I Found The Paintings.</I>

69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
The Series That Leads Up
To My Death.

70
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,500
<I>(Suresh)
Where? How?</I>

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,700
Uk
E.Rain

72
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,300
An Old Friend
Helped Me Find Them.

73
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,600
And I'm Looking At One Of You
Holding A Company Gun.

74
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,700
I Don't Have A Gun.

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,200
These Paintings Are Al.Om

76
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,700
I Need You
To Help Me Make Sense Of Them.

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,300
<I>I'm Gonna Forward Them
To You Right Now.</I>

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,500
Don't, That's What I've Been
Trying To Say.

79
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
They've Given Me A Partner.

80
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
<I>That's Just Standard Protocol.
It Isn't.</I>

81
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,300
<I>She's Here To Watch</I>

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,100
Moev My Ve Iake.

83
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
They Don't Trust Me.

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
My Family Is In Danger.

85
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,700
So That Makes Me Expendable?

86
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,200
We Were Supposed To Take
The Company Down Together,

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,400
But You--I Don't Know What
Your Agenda Is Anymore.

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,100
<I>(Niki)
Dr. Suresh.</I>

89
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,900
I Have To Go.

90
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,500
Bob Needs To See Us.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,500
I Get It.

92
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,300
You Don't Want A Partner.
But That's Not My Call.

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,600
So You Admit It.
You're A Guard Dog.

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,700
Where's Everyone Going?

95
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm Evacuating The Facility.

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,800
<I>(Suresh)
Why?</I>

97
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,400
I'll Let Them
Explain It To You.

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Officer Parkman.
Mr. Petrelli.

99
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Matt?

100
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,600
I Thought You
Were Gonna Find Your Father.

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,400
I Did.

102
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,000
<I>He Attacked Angela Petrelli.</I>

103

104
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,200
<I>My Father Killed
Kaito Nakamura.</I>

105
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,200
He's Killing Them All.
And Now He's Coming To Kill Bob.

106
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,000
(Peter)
Hello!

107
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,800
Hello!

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,000
Hello!

109
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,000
(Caitlin)
There's No One Here, Peter.

110
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,500
They've All Gone.

111
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Evacuated
By Homeland Security.

112
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,700
Peter, What Did You Do?

113
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,900
Me?
I Didn't Do Anything.

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,300
Are You Sure?

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,200
We Were In Montreal.

116
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
I Picked Up A Note
From Some Guy Named Adam

117
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,400
Who Says The World
Is In Danger.

118
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,600
Next Thing You Know,
We're Here.

119
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
One Year In The Future.

120
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,800
I Mean, How Is That
Even Possible?

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Over There.

122
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,400
Get On The Ground!

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
Get On The Ground Now!

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
Do You Have Any Symptoms?

125
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,600
Are You Sick?

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Sick?
What The Hell Is Going On?

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
Take Them
To Decontamination Now!

Mom, Did You Make Waffles?

131
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,000
Nope.
West Did.

132
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
I Wanted To Bring You
Breakfast.

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,500
I Hope You Don't Mind.

134
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
Why Would She Mind?

135
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Uh, Because He Wasn't Invited,

136
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,700
And Some People Think
That's Rude?

137
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,800
Nonsense.

<I>Sadly, No.
His Business Trip Was Extended.</I>

Lyle, Get Your Butt

He's Adorable.

144
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,300
Why Would You Come Here
When I Told You Not To?

145
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,100
I Had To Show
You Something.

146
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,600
Check It Out.

147
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800

154

It's No Big.

155
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,100
It Is Big.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,800
You Can't Just Do Whatever

No.

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,600
Matt's Right.

164
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700

That's What Linderman

It's Always These Half-Truths.

176
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,400
No Straight Answers.
Constant Manipulation.

How, Bob?

179
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,300
<I>What The Hell
Did You People Do?</I>

180
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,000
Why Is Maury Coming Here
To Kill You?

181
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,500
Now Is Not The Time
To Recount The Past.

182
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,800
<I>But To Focus</I>

183
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,900
On The Task At Hand.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
All Right!
Fine, So We Stay Here.

185
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,900
How Do We Stop
My Father?

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Dr. Suresh,
I Need You And Niki

187
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,800
To Inject Maury
With The Virus.

188
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Virus?
What Virus?

189
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,700
<I>The Virus Takes Away Abilities.</I>

190
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,100
It's Also Potentially Lethal.

191
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,300
You Said
We'd Never Use It Again.

192
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,800
Circumstances Have Changed.

193
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,600
I Will Not Knowingly Spread
This Virus.

194
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Maury Is A Killer.

195
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,600
He Knows Your Thoughts,
Your Nightmares,

196
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,800
And He Could Turn
Your World Inside Out.

197
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,700
We Take Away His Abilities,

198
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,000
And Then You Can Cure Him

199
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,500
With The Antibodies
In Your Blood.

200
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,900
No One Dies Here Today.

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,700
He's Not Gonna Exactly Volunteer
For A Shot.

202
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,300
I Can Be Persuasive.

203
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,700
I Appreciate The Thought.

204
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,300
But This One
Goes To You, Matt.

205
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,500
What? Me?

206
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,700
All I Can Do
Is Read Minds.
No, No, No, No.

207
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
You Have The Same Abilities
As Maury Has.

208
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,800
Anything The Brain Controls,
You Control.

209
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,300
No.

210
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,000
Senses, Actions, Thoughts--

211
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,300
No!

212
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,100
No, I Can't.
I-I--

213
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
I Can't Do Any
Of That Stuff.

214
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,900
Well, Then
You Better Learn Fast

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
Because You're The Only One
Who Could Stop Your Father.

216
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
I Should Never Have Forged Those Guns.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,300
White Beard Will Conquer Japan.

218
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,200
It Is All My Fault.

219
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,500
We Are Not Finished Yet.

220
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
They Always Underestimate Women.

221
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,300
Their Folly.

222
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
I Am A Sword-Smith's Daugtter...

223
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,200
Hiro! Hiro!

224
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,700
You Must Concentrate!

225
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,200
You Have To Get Us Out Of Here.

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,400
Why Is Everything So Purple?

227
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,800
Get Back To Your Post.

228
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,800
White Beard Doesn't Tolerate Laziness.

229
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,000
Please...Please.

230
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Please...Please.

231
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
<I>Ca Itlin!</I>

232
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,600
Ca
Caitlin!

233
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,600
Caitlin!

234
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Peter Petrelli?

235
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,800
According To These Files,
You're A Dead Man.

236
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,300
What?

237
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,400
I Got Your Death Certificate
Right Here.

238
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,200
So...

239
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,400
You're Gonna Have
To Explain To Me,

240
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
How's A Dead Man Walk
Around New York City

241
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,700
<I>With No Sign Of Infection?</I>

242
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,300
Infection?

243
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,700
I Don't Know
What You're Talking About.

244
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,200
Where's Caitlin?
I Need To See Her.

245
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
She's From Ireland.
All Foreigners Are Deported.

246
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
You Can't Do That!

247
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
<I>Who The Hell
Are You People?</I>

248
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,100
What's Going On Here?

249
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,600
You Really Don't Know.

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,200
On March 20th, 2007
The First Case Was Reported.

251
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,000
After That The Shanti Virus
Spread

252
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,700
Across The Globe.

253
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
A Pandemic.

254
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,300
It's Killed 93% Of The World's
Population To Date.

255
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,700
The Rest Of Us Live
In Quarantine

256
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,100
Praying To Find A Cure.

257
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,800
This Can't Be Happening.

258
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
I Wish It Wasn't.

259
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
All These People Died
From The Virus?

260
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,700
Yeah, It's Been
A Tough Week.

261
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,600
<I>(Matt)
I'm Supposed To Be
Out Hunting Down Maury,</I>

262
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
<I>But I Needed To See You.</I>

263
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,800
<I>I Never Should Have Asked You
To Use Your...</I>

264
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,500
Ability To Find My Dad.

265
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,700
You Were Just Tryin'
To Make Me Happy.

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,700
I Know That Feeling.

267
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,400
When My Dad Left I...

268
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
I Blamed Myself.

269
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,400
I Thought That I Was...

270
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,900
Too Slow...

271
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,200
Too...

272
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,000
Fat.

273
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,300
Too Stupid.

274
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,900
I Thought That
If I Was...

275
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,000
Better, Or If I Was Smarter,
He Woulda Stayed.

276
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
And Now They Want Me--

277
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
They Think That
I Can Stop Him,

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,500
That I've Got This Power.

279
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,900
And I Don't.

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
<I>I Don't.</I>

281
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,100
I Need You To Hear.

282
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
I Need You
To Know That I Love You.

283
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,700
Did You Just Hear Me?

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,300
<I>Molly?</I>

285
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
[Matt's Thought]
I Love You, Molly.

286
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,900
What's Left Of The Virus Is
In The Lab.

287
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,500
Each Syringe Contains
Only One Dose, So Use It Wisely.

288
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
You Don't Trust Bob,
Do You?

289
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,400
Did He Put You Up
To This?

290
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,700
I Put Me Up To This.
I Wanna Hear Your Side.

291
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,200
Bob Is Morally Gray At Best.

292
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,900
And The Virus?

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,100
He's Toying
With A Death Sentence.

294
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,000
You Have The Cure.
No One Dies.

295
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Just Because He's A Safety Net
Doesn't Make It Ethical.

296
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,300
So You Would Make
A Different Choice?

297
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,000
Morally Un-Gray?

298
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,400
I Killed A Lot Of People...

299
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,600
Brutally Ripped Them In Half.

300
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,600
They Could Have Given Me
The Virus, But They Didn't.

301
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,800
They've Made Me Right,
So That I Could Have A Life.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
Go Home To My Son.

303
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
<I>You're Never Gonna Have A Life.</I>

304
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,200
You're Not Cured.

305
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,100
<I>You're A Killer.</I>

306
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
<I>And Before This Day Is Over</I>

307
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,800
You're Gonna Kill Everyone.

308
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,500
<I>(Suresh)
Niki?</I>

309
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,300
Go On.

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
Tell Him What You're Seeing.

311
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,600
He'll Think
You've Gone Crazy Again.

312
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,700
And Then You'll
Never See Micah.

313
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,500
Is Everything
All Right?

314
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Let's Go.

315
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
<I>(Nathan)
I Know These Other Families.</I>

316
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,200
<I>Linderman, Nakamura,
Pratt, Deveaux.</I>

317
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,300
<I>Everyone Who's Been Killed.
But I Don't Know This One.</I>

318
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
<I>Who Is He?</I>

319
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,900
Who's Adam Monroe?

320
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
Adam Is...Complicated.

321
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,900
So Un-Complicate It.

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Adam Convinced Us
That We Belonged Together.

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,900
That We Could Make
The World A Better Place

324
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,300
For Our Children...

325
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
For You.

326
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,500
<I>"Snow Falls On Miami."</I>

327
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,600
I Don't Get It.

328
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,100
That Headline Could Have Read

329
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,000
"Tsunami Wipes Out
Eastern Seaboard."

330
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,500
What Does Any Of This
Have To Do With The Murders?

331
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,000
Adam Is The One
Who's Trying To Kill Us.

332
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,900
I Thought Maury Parkman Was--

333
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Maury's The Weapon.
He's The Blunt Instrument.

334
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,600
Adam Was The Visionary.

335
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,700
But With These Abilities,
Sometimes People Tend

336
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,900
To Think Of Themselves
As Gods.

337
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,300
<I>Did You Ever
Think That, Nathan?</I>

338
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,200
Adam Did.

339
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,900
And He Began To Talk
About Holocausts, Plagues.

340
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,200
<I>Punishing Humanity
In Order To Save The World.</I>

341
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,700
Sounds A Lot
Like Linderman.

342
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,600
Linderman Was Adam's Disciple.

343
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,400
<I>Adam Was Dangerous.</I>

344
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,400
So We Locked Him Up.
We Threw Away The Key.

345
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,900
Two Weeks Ago He Escapes.

346
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,300
And Now He Wants Revenge.

347
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,200
It Sounds Like You're Reaping
What You Sow.

348
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,200
Why Should I Care?

349
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,600
<I>Because Of Peter.</I>

350
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,100
Listen, Pal,

351
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,700
You Wanna Talk
About My Brother,

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,300
You Better Be Very Careful
What You Say Next.

353
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,200
Peter Is Alive, Nathan.

354
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,300
<I>Your Brother Is Alive.</I>

355
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,700
I'll Leave
You Two Alone.

356
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,500
Do I Know You?

357
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,400
They Brought Me Here
To Help You, Peter.

358
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,600
You Need To Remember
Who Yoyou Are.

359
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I Need
To Find Caitlin.

360
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,900
You Need To Focus.

361
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,900
You Can Move Objects
With Your Mind, Heal,

362
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,300
You Can Paint
The Future.

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,100
How Do You Know
About That?

364
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,100
You Absorb Abilities
From Other People.

365
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
You Are The Most Powerful
Of Us All.

366
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,700
You're A Kind
And Caring Soul.

367
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,500
Selfless.
Always Thinking About Others.

368
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,400
But Now You Need To Think
About Yourself

369
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,300
And Fly
Into The Face Of Danger.

370
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,900
Just Like Your Brother.

371
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,300
I Have A Brother.

372
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,200
He Died
In The First Outbreak.

373
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
But You--

374
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,300
You Can Change That.

375
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,100
How?

376
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,600
I Was In Montreal In 2007.

377
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,200
The Next Thing
I Know, I'm Here.

378
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,600
You Met A Man
Named Hiro Nakamura.

379
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
He Can Travel In Time.
So Can You.

380
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,700
You Can Change History.

381
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,900
-I Can't.
-You Must!

382
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,300
I Can't Control These Things
That Are Happening To Me!

383
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,900
Then This Virus
Will Kill Us All.

384
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,900
<I>Peter, You Need To Remember.
Focus.</I>

385
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,000
<I>O  You Need Tremember.</I>

386
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,200
Mom?

387
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Do The Marks Hurt?

388
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,600
No.

389
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,400
They're Kinda
Just There.

390
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,800
Painless Souvenirs

391
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Of My Alien Abduction
From The Guy

392
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
With Horn-Rimmed Glasses.

393
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,700
If You're
Gonna Be Dropping In,

394
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,300
There's Something
I Need To Tell You.

395
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,200
I Get It.

396
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Get What?

397
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,700
I'm Moving
Too Fast.

398
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,400
We Don't Have To Go Any Further
If You Don't Want To.

399
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,000
You Know What I Want?

400
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,800
Popsicles.

401
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,600
Popsicles.
Awesome.

402
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Raspberry Or Blue?

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,100
He Found Us.

404
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,700
Who?

405
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,000
The Man Who Abducted Me.
We've Gotta Get Outta Here.

406
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,000
Come On.

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,500
No, Wait.

408
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,700
That's What I've Been Trying
To Tell You.

409
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,200
The Guy In The Glasses
Is My Father.

410
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,000
What Is This?

411
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
Some Sort Of Trap?

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,500
No, Just Listen To Me.

413
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,400
Back Off.

414
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,100
Wait.

415
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,800
<I>Claire!</I>

416
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,900
Who Are You Talkin' To?

417
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,100
No One.

418
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,900
You've Got Two Popsicles.

419
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,700
Welcome Home.

420
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,800
There's Nothing You Can Do Now.

421
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
We Lost.White Beard Has Won.

422
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,200
We Must Go On While We Still Can.

423
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,000
I Can't.

424
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,700
White Beard's Army Is Preparing To March.

425
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,300
But How?Even With Your Ability,
What Can You Do Against An Army...

426
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,000
Destroy Their Guns.

427
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,200
Without Them White Beard Is Nothing.

428
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,500
And What About Kensei?
You Cannot Stop Him.

429
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
Nothing Can.

430
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
His Heart Is Broken.

431
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,400
Pain Has Made Him Cruel.
But,He Is Good Inside.

432
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,900
You Would Risk Your Life
For Your Faith In Him?

433
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,600
It Won't Be Safe For You Here.

434
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,200
Meet Me Under The Cherry Blossoms.

435
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,000
Wait For Me.

436
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,200
All This Trouble
Over One Drop Of Liquid.

437
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,600
This Virus Could Kill
An Entire Species.

438
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,000
Or It Could Stop Maury
And Save Our Lives.

439
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,400
Poor Niki.
So Vulnerable.

440
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
You're Perfect.
Show Me Your Nightmares.

441
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,300
Show Me Your Thoughts.
Show Me Your Soul.

442
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
How Do I Turn You
Into A Killer?

443
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
Nothing's Going
To Save You.

444
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,500
This Company Is Bad.

445
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,700
You're Not Making Up
For Your Sins.

446
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,900
You're Diggin' Deeper
Into Hell, And Worse,

447
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,100
You're Gonna Drag Micah
Right Down With You.

448
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,500
You're Wrong.

449
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,500
They Said
That They Would Help Me.

450
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,300
Niki, What Are
You Talkin' About?

451
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,600
<I>I Was Sick.</I>

452
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm Still Sick.

453
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,200
How Can You Say That?

454
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,300
Because You're Dead.

455
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,900
<I>No, I'm Not.</I>

456
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,200
They Don't Want Me Talkin'
To You.

457
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,900
<I>They're Using You, Nik.</I>

458
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,100
<I>Just Like Linderman.
Just Like Jessica.</I>

459
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,500
You Can Still
Do The Right Thing.

460
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,900
You Have To Kill Him.

461
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,000
That's The Only Way
You Can Save Micah.

462
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Niki, You're Talking
To Yourself.

463
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,000
I Think It's Maury.
We Need To Call Bob.

464
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,700
I Thought You'd Come Here.

465
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,800
This Many Guns In Japan,
They Will Crush History.

466
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
I Cannot Let
White Beard Win.

467
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,700
Sll Ctoth Stop This...

468
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,000
Together.

469
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,800
We Did Make A Good Team,
You And I.

470
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,200
<I>You Showed Me How
To Be A Hero.</I>

471
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,200
How To Love.

472
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,800
And Then...
You Took It All Away.

473
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,700
Do It, Hiro.
Stop Time.

474
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,300
Kill Me.
Cut Off My Head.

475
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,900
I Will Not Do It.

476
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,800
I Still Have Faith In You.

477
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,500
The Honorable Hiro Nakamura.

478
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,000
He Won't Kill You.

479
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,900
He'll Just Lie,
Cheat, And Steal.

480
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,800
I Wanted To Help You
Become A Hero.

481
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,000
I Never Claimed To Be Anything
More Than A Happy Drunk.

482
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,400
Do Not Punish Thi Only Want
For To Punish You, Hiro.

483
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,900
<I>Yaeko Was Right.</I>

484
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,000
She's Not Destined
To Be My Princess.

485
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,200
She's Destined
To Die.

486
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,300
No!

487
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,000
Ah!

488
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,100
Yah.

489
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,500
Take My Hand.
We Must Get Out Of Here Now.

490
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,300
Never!

491
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,400
<I>As Long As I Have Breath,</I>

492
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,500
Anything You Love,
I Will Lay To Waste.

493
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,800
<I>I Swear.</I>

494
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,400
You Will Suffer.

495
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,000
Peter's Alive, Nathan.

496
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,500
This Was Taken Three Months Ago
Right Here.

497
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,200
Is He Here Now?

498
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,300
No.
He's Gone.

499
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
Gone Where?

500
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,500
<I>What Is It
You're Not Telling Me?</I>

501
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,800
I Need To Know Everything.

502
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,100
He Was In Cork, Ireland,

503
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,300
And Then We Lost Track Of Him.

504
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,600
Lost Track Of Him?

505
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
How Do
You Lose Someone?

506
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,000
<I>How Do You Lose Someone?</I>

507
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,400
Dad!

508
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Matt!

509
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,700
Molly.

510
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,100
What Are You Doing In Here?
Where Are We?

511
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
This Is Where He Keeps Me.

512
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,900
What?

513
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,200
When I Tried To Find Your Dad,
He Locked Me In Here.

514
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,200
Now We're Both Trapped.

515
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,400
No.
No, We're Not.

516
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,700
Dad!

517
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,300
Dad!

518
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,100
<I>Matt?</I>

519
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,200
Did You Bring Me Here?

520
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,300
I Think...
I Think I Did.

521
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,800
Step Back, Nathan.

522
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,900
I Got It.

523
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,900
<I>Don't Do It, Niki.
This Isn't You.</I>

524
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
Don't Do It.

525
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,500
How Can You Defend Him?
He Killed D.L.

526
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,200
I Didn't Kill Anyone.
It's Maury.

527
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,500
He's Gotten
Inside Of Your Head.

528
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,700
Listen To Me,
This Is A Nightmare.

529
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,600
This Isn't You.

530
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,400
Don't Be His Puppet!

531
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,700
You're Stronger Than This.

532
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,000
<I>You Came Here
To Get Control</I>Of Your Life.

533
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Don't Let Maury
Undo All Of That.

534
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,800
Listen To Me.
Listen To Me.

535
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,400
Think Of Your Son.
Think Of Micah.

536
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,900
Think Of Your Boy.

537
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,600
I Couldn't Get
The Nightmare Out.

538
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,900
I Didn't Know What Else To Do.

539
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,100
I Had To Stop Myself.

540
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:03,900
Matt.

541
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
Don't Be Scared, Molly.
We're Gonna Get Out Of Here.

542
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
Do You Recognize
This Room?

543
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,900
Yeah, Of Course.

544
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,600
This Is Our Old Place
On Parthenia.

545
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,700
Brisket And Potatoes.
This Is The Night You Left.

546
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,300
I Never Apologized.

547
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,200
You Weren't Sorry.

548
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,300
You Walked Out That Door,
You Never Even Turned Back.

549
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,900
You Think
This Didn't Hurt Me?

550
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,500
This Broke My Heart.

551
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,700
I Love You, Matt.

552
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,500
Then Turn Yourself In.

553
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,200
That's Not Gonna Happen.

554
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,200
There's No Prison
That Can Hold Me.

555
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,400
I Think There Is!

556
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,100
I Think I Can Trap You

557
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,500
In Here Just Like
You Trapped Molly.

558
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,000
How Are You Gonna Do That?
Look Around, Pop.

559
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,300
This Isn't My Nightmare!
This Is Yours!

560
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,600
I Can Walk
Right Out That Door.

561
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,500
No, You Can't.

562
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,300
I Have To.

563
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:49,900
Come On.

564
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,100
<I>You Can't!</I>

565
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,900
<I>Because You're
Not Strong Enoug</I>

566
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,300
Because You're Still
That Scared Little Boy!

567
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,600
No!

568
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,500
I'm Not Scared
Of You Anymore!

569
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,100
I'm A Good Man!
I'm A Good Cop!

570
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,500
I'm A Good Father,
Which Is Something

571
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,300
You Know Nothing About.

572
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,400
You Don't Know What It's Like

573
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,100
To Fight
For Someone That You Love.

574
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,400
You Left.
You Left.

575
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,200
All You Have
Are Your Nightmares.

576
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,700
Let's Get Out Of Here.

577
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,300
Don't Leave Me.

578
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,700
Don't Leave Me Alone!
No!

579
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,700
Matt?

580
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,700
Oh, God.

581
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,400
Molly,
The Nightmare's Over.

582
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,900
He's Never
Gonna Hurt You Again.

583
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,100
Ever.
I Promise.

584
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,400
Oh, God,
I Love You.

585
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,500
I Heard.

586
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
So What Happens Next?</I>

587
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,700
Where Do All
These People Go?

588
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,700
Same Place We Are,
Home.

589
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,900
<I>Peter!</I>

590
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,000
Peter!

591
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,900
Caitlin!

592
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,500
Peter!
I'm So Scared!

593
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,800
Please Don't Let Them
Take Me Away From You.

594
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,900
I'll Get Us Home.
I Promise.
Please, Peter.

595
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,300
Don't Let Them Take Me.
Don't Let Them Take Me.

596
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,800
No.
No!

597
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,400
No!

598
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,800
???

599
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,200
The Army Has Scattered.

600
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,800
White Beard Is Defeated.

601
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,900
You Have Save Us All.

602
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,600
At What Price?

603
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,800
He Was My Friend.

604
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,200
I Betrayed Him.

605
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,800
Everything Kensei Accomplished...

606
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
You Did All These Things.Not Him.

607
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,800
As Sure As I Live,You Are Takezo Kensei.

608
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Perhaps Now You Can Live Happily With His Princess.

609
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,900
That's Not How The Story Ends.

610
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,200
It Is The Last Trial."Kensei And The Dragon."

611
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
My Father Told It To Me.

612
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,800
The Dragon Who Taught Kensei
The Way Of The Sword...

613
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,500
Demanded His Love In Return.

614
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,200
What Did Kensei Do?

615
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,900
He Cut Out His Own Heart To Save Her.

616
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,000
To Save Japan.

617
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,700
Is That What You Must Do Now?

618
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,300
Cut Out Your Heart?

619
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I Nearly Destroyed Time By
Staying When I Should Have Left.

620
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,100
I Must Go Back.

621
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,100
As Long As I Have A Voice,
All Shall Know The Story...

622
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,900
Of Noble Takezo Kensei.

623
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The Boy Hiro Nakamura Will Have
Tales To Help Him Sleep.

624
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,300
The Boy Hiro Nakamura Will Have
Tales To Help Him Sleep.

625
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,500
And He Will Dream Of The Princess.

626
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,800
Farewell.

627
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,000
<I>The Antibodies In My Blood</I>

628
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,900
<I>Will Eradicate Any Traces Of The Virus</I>
<I>In Your System.</I>

629
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,600
Your Nose, Does It Hurt?

630
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,500
Only When I Breathe.

631
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,300
I'm Sorry.

632
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,100
It's Not Your Fault.

633
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,200
You Weren't In Control.

634
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
This Can't Be Right.

635
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,000
What's Wrong?

636
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
The Antibodies Aren't Working.

637
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,000
This Isn't Possible.
Not Now.

638
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,600
<I>It's Another Strain Of The Virus.</I>

639
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,100
It's Immune.

640
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,100
My Blood's No Longer A Cure.

641
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm Going To Die?

642
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,700
I Had To Get You A Souvenir.

643
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Hiro!

644
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,600
You're Alive!You're A Samurai!

645
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I Was Scared You'd Never Come Back.

646
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,200
Has It Been Long?

647
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,900
Months!I Haven't Seen You
Since We Saved The World.

648
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,200
Then We Did?

649
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,800
No Bomb?

650
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,500
No Boom?

651
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
We Saved The World!

652
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,300
There Is So Much To Catch Up On.

653
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,700
Where Is My Father?

654
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,800
I Want To Tell You Both Everything.

655
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,300
Hiro...Your Father.

656
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,400
He's Dead.

657
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,000
Murdered.

658
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,000
<I>This Strain Has No Cure.</I>

659
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,900
Are You Certain Of These Results?

660
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,600
We'll Keep Maury Sedated.

661
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,800
We'll Destroy Every Last Vial.

662
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,700
I Promise.

663
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,100
What Is This?

664
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,700
It's A Chance To Save Niki.
We Got A Police Report.

665
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,600
<I>A Girl Walks Away From A 
50-Foot Fal</I>Without A Scratch.

666
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,100
Cellular Regeneration?

667
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,400
Her Name Is Claire Bennet.

668
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,400
<I>You Remember Her Father,
Noah?</I>

669
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,200
He Worked For Us.

670
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Of Course.

671
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,900
He's Not Exactly Gonna Let Us
Take His Daughter, Is He?

672
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,900
Are You Saying We Should Kill Him?

673
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,500
I'm Saying We Should Be Prepared.

674
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,800
This Is Ivan Spector.

675
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,300
Our Man In The Ukraine.

676
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,500
He Was Bennet's Friend,
His Mentor.

677
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,900
<I>Bennet Killed Him.</I>

678
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,900
When Was This?

679
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,500
<I>Last Night.</I>

680
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,900
Are You Sure It Was Him?

681
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,300
<I>He Left Fingerprints.</I>

682
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,900
Bennet Is Getting Sloppy,

683
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,800
Emotional...
And That Means Dangerous.

684
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,600
I Have Something I Need To Tell You.

685
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,900
I Have Been Working With Bennet
To Take Down This Company.

686
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,400
Why Are You Telling Me This Now?

687
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:02,100
Because...I Am Unsure Of
Who's Right And Who's Wrong.

688
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,400
And It Is Time
To Stop Playing Games.

689
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,100
There's A Storm Coming,
Dr. Suresh.

690
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,500
Claire Is The Key.

691
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,400
<I>Her Regenerative Abilities,</I>

692
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,400
<I>They Could Cure The Virus.</I>

693
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,800
She Could Save Niki.

694
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,300
I Want To Do The Right Thing Here.

695
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,700
For Niki.

696
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,300
For Everyone.

697
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,200
So Did You Meet Him?

698
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,600
Meet Who?

699
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,100
The Boyfriend, West.

700
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,800
<I>He Was Here Today.</I>

701
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,200
Claire Has A Boyfriend?

702
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,400
I Checked Him Out,
He's Fine.

703
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,700
You Cannot Be The Only Man
In Her Life Forever.

704
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,400
No, I Suppose Not.

705
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,400
<I>We Knew This Day Would Come.</I>

706
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,400
You Wanna Tell Me About This?

707
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,200
<I>It's Nothing.
Nothing.</I>

708
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,900
"The Cheerleader Claims She Saw Her Teammate

709
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,000
Fall 50 Feet To Her Death."

710
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,100
That's Nothing.

711
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,200
<I>I Asked You To Do One Thing, Claire.</I>

712
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
I Asked You To Keep Your Nose Clean.

713
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,900
Debbie Was Drunk.Nobody Believes Her.
