1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,660
Chapter Three  Building 26

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,160
It is so nice

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,000
to have everyone under the same roof again.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,230
Noah, I hope this new job will keep you home for a while.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,200
Absolutely.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,600
- What does? - A consultant do exactly?

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,160
Well, it's complicated.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,780
Mostly I meet with various

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,330
business and government people

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,815
They explain their all strangedy and tractive

11
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:35,230
Need your help. Must warn target. -Rebel

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,060
and consult.

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,930
Honey, do you have to do that at the table?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,630
Sorry.

15
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,460
No. Can't.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,630
So I have yet to hear word one about your trip.

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,200
Claire?

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Nothing much to tell.

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,000
You visited five

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,400
Of the best colleges on the east coast

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,200
And you have nothing to tell?

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,760
Which ones did you like, Noah?

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,760
Brown.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,230
I liked brown.

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,960
Claire?

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,860
Come back here.

27
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,860
I think all this I believe to talk

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,460
might be a little intimidating.

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,900
Maybe community college would be a better fit for now.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,530
I'll go talk to her.

31
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,130
What the hell was that?

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,860
I can't lie to her anymore.

33
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,900
Your new job!

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,830
Our father/daughter college tour.

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,130
We can't risk her knowing anything right now.

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,160
The last time she knew, she almost got herself killed.

37
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,530
Your mom and lyle are safer this way.

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,300
Dad, you've been telling me that since I was 15.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,530
They're not just watching you, Claire.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
They're watching me.

41
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,600
You brought a plane down out of the sky,

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,630
federal agents are dead,

43
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
and a lot of people want to see you pay.

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,860
If either one of us strays from the script,

45
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,430
I won't be able to stop them.

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,160
There won't be any paper trail. No trial.

47
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,160
One day, you'll just be gone

48
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,860
And nobody can find you.

49
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,500
And now's the part where you tell me

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,700
how everything you do, you do to protect me.

51
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,560
No.

52
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,860
Now's the part when I tell you

53
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,860
exactly what you're going to do next.

54
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,430
Start classes at costa verde community.

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,400
You're already enrolled.

56
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,860
History, English Lit, Spanish.

57
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,200
And come monday morning,

58
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,600
You better be parked in that front row

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,600
With a sharp number two pencil

60
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,100
Or there is going to be hell to pay.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Warn Alex. Sam's comics. On Buford. Go now. -Rebel.

62
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,160
Wires are up.

63
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,630
Accounts are frozen.

64
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,560
We have traffic cam feeds from all 50 states.

65
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,060
Patriot act gives us a lot of leeway here.

66
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,460
What's our status on the Bennet girl?

67
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,830
Eyes only.

68
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,860
We look, but we don't touch.

69
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,100
Senator Petrelli

70
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,900
has granted Ms. Bennet a probation for now.

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,230
Should the terms of that arrangement be compromised,

72
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,400
I will certainly bring it to his attention.

73
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,710
Assuming he finishes his latte

74
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,960
and decides to show up for work.

75
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,860
Double espresso.

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,230
And Claire Bennet is still off-limits.

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,130
Now I know a lot of you lost friends

78
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,600
on this crash.

79
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,700
You want payback. I understand that.

80
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,700
Not all of these individuals

81
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,930
out there are dangerous.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,100
Some of them are just plain scared.

83
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,230
Now that they know they're being pursued,

84
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,500
They're gonna be even that much harder to catch.

85
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,800
Which is why I put in a request

86
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,330
to the white house this morning to double our funding.

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,960
We need to show progress.

88
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,660
These are our targets.

89
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,260
Know them, hunt them,

90
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,200
Track them, and bring them home alive.

91
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,800
This is so cool.

92
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,800
Road trip.

93
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,660
My mom never took me anywhere.

94
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,800
Ooh, we should stop at some skanky dinner somewhere

95
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,200
And get some pie

96
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,460
And some milkshakes.

97
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,500
We're not stopping.

98
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,330
Sure?

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,660
It's a long way till we get to your dad.

100
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,800
Where is he?

101
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,330
I told you, "just keep heading west."

102
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,030
Yeah, you told me to keep heading west.

103
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,430
Now I want to know exactly where he is.

104
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,400
Okay, uh, he told me

105
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,130
that if he ever had to disappear,

106
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,230
I could find him in minnesota.

107
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,660
He's got a cabin in the woods

108
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,400
About 28 miles west of--

109
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,730
You're lying.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
It's amazing how you can do that.

111
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,160
Tell me where he is.

112
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,330
Okay, okay.

113
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
He has an ex-wife who's a flight attendant.

114
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,130
She lives in Des Moines.

115
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,830
They had a kid that was born with some sort of...

116
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,830
Bone dis--

117
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,100
Stop.

118
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
I can tell when people are lying

119
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,830
Because I saw open their skulls

120
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,930
and rip their abilities out

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,460
from their brains.

122
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,530
So you're like a serial killer.

123
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,100
I'm not a serial killer.

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,730
But you've got a pattern.

125
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,500
You go after specific victims.

126
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,660
You collect mementos.

127
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,030
Okay, technically, I'm a serial killer.

128
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,600
Now that we've established that,

129
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,930
give me one good reason

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,260
Why I shouldn't tear open your head right here.

131
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,760
Because you'll never find your dad.

132
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,560
It's not a road trip. Do you understand?

133
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,900
Sir!

134
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,560
Are you Alex?

135
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,060
You're a girl.

136
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,130
Yeah, I am.

137
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,800
No, it's just we don't normally get a lot of girls in here.

138
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,260
You know?

139
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,260
Listen, I'm just here to deliver a message.

140
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,730
You're in danger.

141
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
You need to get out of here immediately.

142
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,130
Victor.

143
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
What? oh, come on.

144
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,160
A hot blonde in a comic book store?

145
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,800
Please. Victor sent you, right?

146
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,660
This is payback for the whole birthday thing, right?

147
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,830
Wait, let me guess.

148
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,830
Is this all gonna end with you giving me

149
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,630
Like a lap dance or something?

150
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,460
You have to listen to me, all right?

151
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,730
This is not a joke.

152
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,730
There are people out there who are after you.

153
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,200
They will come in here and take you away.

154
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,800
Yeah! in here?

155
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,900
Oh, come on.

156
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,500
You gotta do a better job convincing me.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,130
Your life

158
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Is in danger.

159
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Move,now

160
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Move,now.

161
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,040
You wanna tell me what the hell is going on?

162
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,240
There's a man in here.

163
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,370
He's looking for you,

164
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,100
And he's very, very dangerous.

165
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,770
Do you have your car here?

166
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,070
Yeah, yeah, but it's out back.

167
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,640
Alex working today?

168
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,940
Come on.

169
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,240
Alex woolsley.

170
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,570
I'm from the county clerk's office.

171
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,040
Afraid we have a situation

172
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,270
With some outstanding parking violations.

173
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,740
Um, would you rather just go talk outside?

174
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,770
Sorry.

175
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,470
Uh, this isn't a really good time. is it important?

176
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,440
Look, dad, I just--

177
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,470
I was thinking about what happened this morning...

178
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,700
Uh, sweetheart, I'm gonna have to call you back.

179
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,870
Go!

180
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,700
We're gonna need a team down here.

181
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,770
Come on. come on. come on.

182
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,540
Come on.

183
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
Hello,destiny

184
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
This is it,Ando

185
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
The same towers,the same wedding canopy...

186
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
The exact spot from Matt Parkman's drawing.

187
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Now all I need to do is save the bride,and stop the wedding

188
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
This is crazy.

189
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
If there is one thing I've learned

190
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
It's that when destiny calls,

191
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,840
You answer the phone

192
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
I'm going to check what time the wedding starts.

193
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
So I won't be late to stop it.

194
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Stop a wedding...makes no sense.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,200
Hello.

196
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,000
Hi. my name is Ando.

197
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm sorry. I'm Annapura.

198
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,630
Annapura.

199
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,800
Your name is familiar.

200
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,100
Are you a guest of the groom?

201
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,930
No, not exactly.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,100
Are you okay?

203
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,400
Just a little sad. that's all.

204
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,430
On your wedding day?

205
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,570
But this is supposed

206
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,930
To be the happiest day of your life, isn't it?

207
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Yes, that's what they say.

208
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,770
Then you must call off the wedding.

209
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,770
This is incredible.

210
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,830
I've been feeling so lost and confused.

211
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,630
I've asked the heavens for a sign

212
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,800
Telling me whether I should marry or not.

213
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,300
A sign.

214
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,330
Uh, yes, a sign.

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ando? What are you doing?!

216
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,170
You are the sign!

217
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,700
You're the one I've been waiting for.

218
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,300
Sign. no, no, no, no.

219
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,630
It's not him. it's me.

220
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,770
I'm the sign.

221
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,370
That's it.

222
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,130
The wedding is off.

223
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,930
Do we have any response from The white house?

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,770
nothing yet.

225
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,800
So these are the bad guys.

226
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,800
Abby collins. homeland security.

227
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,630
Nathan petrelli. nice to meet you.

228
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,030
The white house has transferred

229
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,630
Oversight of your operations to DHS.

230
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,770
I'm here to kick the tires

231
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,970
And find out what it is we bought.

232
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,670
Just what we need.

233
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,670
Another bureaucrat.

234
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,400
Can I give you a tour?

235
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,630
I don't know how fully briefed you are

236
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,530
On what's happened here for the last few days.

237
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,070
I made it clear that eagle rock prison is

238
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,530
Woefully inadequate for our needs.

239
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,800
The reason I've asked for such a large funding increase

240
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,430
Is to reinforce the facility

241
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,100
So I can deal with these prisoners.

242
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,770
Right, because they're all magic.

243
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
You don't believe any of this, do you?

244
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,200
Who put you on this assignment exactly?

245
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,770
People close to the president

246
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,270
Are concerned about his exposure on this.

247
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,200
Time travelers, mind readers.

248
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,000
We are dealing with a threat the likes of which

249
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,530
This country has never seen before.

250
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,470
We need better containment.

251
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,470
I can barely handle the one detainee i...

252
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,330
Are you telling me that you're keeping a prisoner here?

253
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,470
Without warrant or miranda rights?

254
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm gonna need to speak with the president directly.

255
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,070
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen.

256
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,900
I'm your new boss,

257
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,600
And I want to see your prisoner now.

258
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,370
This is what I'm talking about.

259
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,470
Place like this,

260
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,600
Worse food, the better.

261
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,970
Luke.

262
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,430
You really got to stop trying to be my friend,

263
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,430
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

264
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,770
Do you like birds?

265
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,530
What?

266
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,070
Well, now, I'm just wondering if it's genetic.

267
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,030
I mean, your dad, he's way into birding.

268
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,630
I went with him sometimes.

269
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,300
He'd come get me up about 4:00 a.m.

270
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,870
And we'd be out walking a trail by dawn.

271
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,970
We'd see goldfinch and cormorants, woodcocks.

272
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,130
He'd always be pulling this old, rusty wagon

273
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,070
Behind him, carrying all his bird books.

274
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,030
Red wagon?

275
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,200
Yeah, it had these--it had these big, big rubber wheels.

276
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,430
He used to pull me in that wagon.

277
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:53,200
I remember laying in a red wagon...

278
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,770
All wrapped up in blankets.

279
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,970
It was still dark

280
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,530
And the silhouettes of the tree branches...

281
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,500
I remember thinking they looked like...

282
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,270
Snake fingers.

283
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,470
He sold you for money, you know.

284
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,430
Told me once he had a little boy

285
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,170
A long time ago, but he needed cash,

286
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
So he sold him.

287
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,340
What kind of man sells his own son?

288
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,440
Why would he even tell you something like that?

289
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,270
Maybe I reminded him of you.

290
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,140
Oh, my god.

291
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,170
I know. it looks harsh.

292
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,970
We tried insulated gloves,

293
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,440
But she shattered right through them.

294
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,370
The constant heat is to ensure...

295
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,270
abby.

296
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,670
This is tracy strauss.

297
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,040
You know her.

298
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,540
She used to lobby for a defense contractor.

299
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,900
Abby, they won't let me out of here.

300
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,200
You have to do something.

301
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,740
What is this insanity?

302
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,240
This woman is extremely dangerous.

303
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,740
Abby, he's lying. you know me.

304
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,640
This woman is tracy strauss,

305
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,270
And you have her shackled to a chair.

306
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,440
That's why we need better funding.

307
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,470
Funding?

308
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,770
I am shutting this operation down today,

309
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,600
And then I'm going to the a.g.'s office

310
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,370
And I'm filing human rights violations

311
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,170
Against you, senator.

312
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,370
This is torture. you're through.

313
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,700
Abby.

314
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,770
Abby!

315
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,940
I can't believe it.

316
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,470
They're just locking people up?

317
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,140
Believe it. it's happening.

318
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,140
Somebody sent me to warn you.

319
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,170
You must be on a list Or something.

320
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,040
A list? why is he after me?

321
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,040
Do you have a power?

322
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,470
Like a special ability or something?

323
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,240
I can breathe underwater.

324
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,240
You mean like--

325
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,040
Like a fish. yeah.

326
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,170
I was on the swim team in high school.

327
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,640
One day, I noticed I just didn't have

328
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,600
To come up for air anymore.

329
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,340
Never told anyone.

330
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,300
I didn't know there were others.

331
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,100
You think I'd be proud of it or something, but...

332
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,570
Instead, I just...

333
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,270
Feel like a...

334
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,540
Like a freak?

335
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,170
Look, don't go home.

336
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,140
Don't use your credit cards or your cell phone.

337
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,050
If he can find you at work,

338
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,900
he can find you anywhere.

339
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,540
What am I gonna do?

340
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
I don't know. we'll figure something out.

341
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,240
What?

342
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,240
That car that drove past.

343
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,370
Second time it went by.

344
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,400
Is this car registered under your name?

345
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,070
Get out.

346
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,670
Car's still warm.

347
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,170
Believe me now?

348
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,200
Let's go.

349
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,340
The house specialties--

350
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,100
So this is your place?

351
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,270
With shyla.

352
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,840
Yes.

353
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,500
We open two years ago.

354
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,170
Against my grandfather's wishes.

355
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,270
Your grandfather?

356
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,670
He believes in tradition.

357
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,670
Thinks women should be at home

358
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,700
Raising the children.

359
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,870
That's why he arranged my marriage to deepak.

360
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,800
But you don't love deepak.

361
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,800
He is a powerful and dangerous man.

362
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,300
Above the law.

363
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,240
My grandfather was too frightened to deny

364
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,940
His request to marry.

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,970
You must be hungry, my hero.

366
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,240
Let me bring you more.

367
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,750
what`s the matter with you?

368
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,510
We came all this way.

369
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,440
and you stole my chance to get my power back

370
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,600
I only stopped the wedding, like the drawing said.

371
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,410
The drawing wanter me to stop the wedding

372
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,750
Hiro,I have a power now.

373
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,290
I saw a way to help that girl, so I did

374
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,990
well you did it wrong

375
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,310
No,I did it my way.

376
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,810
And that`s what really bothers you.

377
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,990
That I have powers,and you don`t

378
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,690
You can`t stand the fact that now you`re my sidekick

379
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,500
Deepak. the groom.

380
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,040
Go on ,hero

381
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,670
save the day

382
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,740
excuse me.

383
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,900
Is everything okay in here?

384
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,300
Who the hell is this?

385
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,470
Ando. he is my friend.

386
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,700
I see.

387
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,740
So you canceled the wedding because of him?

388
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,600
No, no, sorry, you're mistaken.

389
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,600
I am just a guest. sir!

390
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,400
Calm down, sir. no!

391
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,700
Put the pot--

392
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,970
Ando!

393
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,670
Deepak hit him with this.

394
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,770
Ando collapsed.

395
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,170
And then?

396
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,470
Deepak carried him off.

397
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,600
Ando.

398
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,940
We found his car.

399
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,640
He abandoned it about a half a mile away.

400
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,240
Yeah, for a local kid, he's pretty good at this.

401
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,970
If you're telling me it doesn't smell right,

402
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
I noticed.

403
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,240
Did you know your daughter's car

404
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,340
Is parked a half block south of your location?

405
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, I saw that.

406
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,740
She mentioned she had some errands to run.

407
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,840
It's a small town.

408
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,900
We'll talk.

409
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,940
At least tell me how long this is gonna last.

410
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,740
Are we driving for another hour?

411
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,740
Another week?

412
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,470
Hey, check out zz topp.

413
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,470
Oh!

414
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,640
Ah, god!

415
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,640
Stop it.

416
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,740
What? I'm just messing with him.

417
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,900
Not here.

418
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,200
We don't need the attention.

419
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,240
Our powers are not

420
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,900
For amusement, luke, you understand that?

421
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,940
I mean, I don't know.

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,570
I've never really talked to anyone about it before.

423
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,100
My mom thinks I'm enough of a freak as is.

424
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,940
So what, you only use your powers for a reason?

425
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,970
Usually.

426
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,700
Sometimes I disappoint myself.

427
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,670
Always have an objective.

428
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,670
Know your end game before you lift a hand.

429
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,700
What else?

430
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,700
Keep a clear head.

431
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,970
Emotions make you sloppy.

432
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,440
The most important thing

433
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,540
Is that you understand your motivation.

434
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,800
Always know what it is that you want.

435
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,800
What is it that you want?

436
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,300
For me, um...

437
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,240
It's mostly been about acquiring abilities,

438
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,470
But lately...

439
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,640
Lately, all I want to find is my father.

440
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,170
I want to meet the man who made me.

441
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,500
Look him in the eyes.

442
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,370
What are you hoping to see in there?

443
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Where I came from, I guess.

444
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,700
Why I turned out the way I did.

445
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,240
I'm just thinking he'll have some answers.

446
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,500
That's all.

447
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,770
This is the address. it's a two-day drive.

448
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,370
You shouldn't have done that.

449
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,600
Now there's nothing to keep me from killing you, is there?

450
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:15,270
Well, I guess I'm just hoping that you won't.

451
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,300
Emergency exit-- walk,

452
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,470
Don't run. what?

453
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Move.

454
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,270
There's only two.

455
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,340
We can take 'em.

456
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,570
they're the scouts.

457
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,100
Gotcha.

458
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,700
Right on the sweet spot.

459
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,700
Everyone on the floor, now!

460
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,940
Please don't let him hurt me anymore.

461
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,670
Don't let him hurt me anymore, please.

462
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,670
Please, just don't let him hurt me anymore.

463
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,500
I want to go back to my mom.

464
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,500
Please, I just want to go back.

465
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,540
Stand back.

466
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,040
That was frickin' awesome!

467
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,240
Hey, sylar!

468
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,470
Sylar! thanks for the address.

469
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,940
What?

470
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,270
Sylar, wait! stop!

471
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,670
Sylar!

472
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,100
Deepak willet ando   g

473
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,440
If I honor my commitment to marry him.

474
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,470
And if you don't?

475
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,240
I must prepare for the wedding.

476
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,270
Wedding sermon in hindi]

477
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,270
stop!

478
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,370
This wedding cannot go on.

479
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,800
Annapura cannot get married

480
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,100
To this man.

481
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,240
She's being forced into this

482
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,600
Against her will.

483
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,500
You are making a mistake.

484
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,700
You have kidnapped my friend.

485
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,840
I want him back.

486
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,100
He's being held hostage.

487
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,200
It is not I who broke our agreement.

488
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,000
She does not want to marry you.

489
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,240
All my life, I've tried to please you, grandfather.

490
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,270
But if I marry deepak,

491
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,740
I will be giving up everything

492
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,300
That matters most to me.

493
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,300
Perhaps a traditional marriage is not my destiny.

494
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,600
We had a deal.

495
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,070
The woman and the bakery belong to me.

496
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,800
You leave her alone.

497
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,140
Give me back my friend.

498
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,140
That's it. the wedding is off.

499
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,440
You're too much trouble. I don't want to marry you.

500
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,170
And you can have your lousy friend back.

501
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,770
This is it.

502
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,070
The moment in the drawing.

503
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,500
This is me being the hero.

504
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,270
So how was your day?

505
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,570
Dad.

506
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,240
Wanna tell me what the hell you're doing here?

507
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,440
I was just applying for a job

508
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,440
At the coffee house.

509
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,470
Stop it, claire.

510
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,700
What? they posted a "help wanted" online.

511
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,740
I know you're lying.

512
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,740
Well, I did learn from the master.

513
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,270
You think you're invincible, but you're not.

514
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,440
Just because you can't be injured

515
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,870
Doesn't mean you can't be caught.

516
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,570
Do you have any idea what happens

517
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,940
If they think I can't control you anymore?

518
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,670
That's the thing, dad.

519
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,300
You can't.

520
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,840
Reports are in from the diner.

521
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,170
They brought down the kid, luke campbell.

522
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,140
Sylar?

523
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,440
Dhs is trying to take us down,

524
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,670
And all we have is a 17-year-old boy.

525
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,670
From the office of the secretary.

526
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,100
You are hereby notified

527
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,600
To cease and desist this operation

528
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,600
In its entirety.

529
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,600
Abby, don't do this.

530
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,840
Give me five minutes.

531
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,600
Let me change your mind.

532
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,000
Just suspend your disbelief for a second

533
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,840
And imagine that these people exist,

534
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,200
People who possess powers.

535
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,300
It still wouldn't justify torture.

536
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,700
I'm talking about people who can slice your head open

537
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,740
With their finger...

538
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,200
Make you think what they want you to think,

539
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,500
Get inside your head.

540
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,740
This is your argument.

541
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,870
That these people are so dangerous

542
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,900
That they have no constitutional rights?

543
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,100
There's no justification for treating people this way.

544
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,870
And american citizens, no less.

545
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,540
You can't pull the plug on a war

546
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,500
When you haven't even been to the front lines.

547
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,470
People shouting]

548
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,940
'scuse me.

549
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Tracy.

550
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,200
Aaah!

551
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
Fire!

552
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,970
Ah!

553
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,960
I'm really sorry you had to witness that today.

554
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,530
I know how upsetting that must have been.

555
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,630
It's definitely something I won't soon forget.

556
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,960
I wouldn't be doing any of this

557
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,460
Unless I believed in the bottom of my heart

558
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,700
These people are just too dangerous to be among us.

559
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,730
Don't worry.

560
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,430
You'll have all the funding you need.

561
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Don't fill up.

562
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,760
Your dad's bringing home takeout

563
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,960
From that new indian place.

564
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,560
Sounds good.

565
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,030
I didn't mean to pry this morning.

566
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,960
Sounds like your trip was a little--i don't know what.

567
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,000
Disappointing?

568
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,630
Did you guys have any fun at all?

569
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,060
Take in a broadway show?

570
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,100
Dad was a little busy...

571
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,900
Abducting innocent people.

572
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,200
He's not been honest with you, mom.

573
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,530
He's not a consultant.

574
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,430
He's working for a secret program

575
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,930
Imprisoning people with powers.

576
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,930
The company?

577
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,660
No.

578
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,730
No, the company's gone.

579
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,630
This is something else.

580
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,860
Honey, are you sure?

581
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,360
-I mean, maybe -I was there.

582
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,800
I saw it.

583
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,530
They were loading prisoners onto a transport plane.

584
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,530
They had them all hooded.

585
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,760
They were drugged.

586
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,430
It was horrible.

587
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,330
Oh, my god.

588
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,860
It's starting all over again.

589
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,430
No, this is worse.

590
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,830
They're taking everyone.

591
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,160
Not just dangerous people.

592
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,000
Anyone with an ability.

593
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,100
Matt parkman.

594
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,730
Dr. suresh.

595
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,530
Peter.

596
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,230
I'm sorry.

597
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,530
I just can't lie to you anymore.

598
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,260
Indian food?

599
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,360
Go on upstairs, honey.

600
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,560
what's going on?

601
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,900
Noah, I can't take it anymore.

602
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,900
I just can't.

603
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
What are you talking about?

604
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,400
I know what you're doing.

605
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,600
Hunting people down.

606
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,830
You don't know what I've been doing.

607
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,660
Don't lie to me, noah.

608
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,660
You have no idea...

609
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,960
I really wanted to believe...

610
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,930
-How big this thing is. -that you could change.

611
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,130
That you could be someone different

612
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,300
From who you really are.

613
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,960
Do you have any idea how difficult this is?

614
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,130
Maybe I don't have a choice!

615
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,700
there is always a choice!

616
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,730
The government is putting together a list

617
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Of people they are rounding up,

618
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,830
And they have made it very clear to me

619
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,660
That if I am not on board, that claire will be on that list.

620
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,130
don't make this about claire!

621
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,100
Tracy, I don't know how you did it,

622
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,700
But you better get used to the heat

623
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,600
Because you are never getting out of here again.

624
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,000
We both know what you did.

625
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,700
What are you talking about?

626
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,000
Broken chain, unlocked door.

627
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,330
You wanted me to escape.

628
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,160
You know what?

629
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,330
Next time, I will.

630
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,260
Something's wrong.

631
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,730
Team leader,

632
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,430
This is central, please respond.

633
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,100
Team leader, this is central.

634
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,830
Please respond.

635
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,500
Team leader, this is central. do you copy?

636
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,230
Repeat, do you copy?

637
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,500
This is central command. go to channel b.

638
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,500
Please respond. do you copy?

639
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,400
Team leader, this is central.

640
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,200
You were right.

641
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,000
I should have never interrupted the course of destiny.

642
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
No apolpgoes,my friend.

643
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,800
I realize why i was sent to India

644
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,800
and it wasn't to get my abilities back.

645
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,500
It was to learn that i do not need powers to be a hero.

646
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,800
I finally figured out why your names are so familiar.

647
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,870
A fax came in addressed to hiro and ando.

648
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,830
See?

649
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,100
It's from someone named rebel.

650
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,300
Who?

651
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,370
Just an address in los angeles.

652
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,400
And the words, "save matt parkman."

653
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,270
It's a message from destiny.

654
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,630
So you straightened it all out with mom,

655
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,830
And now you're off to a new assignment?

656
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,000
No.

657
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,970
No, your mother wants me

658
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,330
To move out of the house for a while.

659
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,830
She's right.

660
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,270
We keep too many secrets in this family.

661
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,500
So I'm gonna try to be a better person.

662
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,670
Better husband, better father.

663
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,100
And not tell lies.

664
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,030
And if we all work really hard

665
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,030
To be honest with each other,

666
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,530
Then maybe we can...

667
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,270
Heal these wounds.

668
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,930
But I'll be around.

669
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,100
We'll get through this.

670
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,100
I love you, claire bear.

671
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,230
I'll see ya.

672
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,930
Thanks for coming back for me.

673
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,070
I didn't come back for you.

674
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,270
I came back for this. You just happened to be there.

675
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,270
Tracked me twice in less than a week.

676
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,400
I knew if I kept driving, it was only a matter of time

677
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,230
Before they caught up to me again.

678
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,100
I needed to understand how they work.

679
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,200
Still, you could have just left me.

680
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,830
Mark Leggett.

681
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,230
Excuse me?

682
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,570
The analyst who died in the hall today.

683
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,470
That was his name.

684
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,300
Mark Leggett.

685
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,100
Thought you'd want to know.

686
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,430
He left a wife and two kids.

687
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,700
You let her out, didn't you?

688
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,570
You murdered an innocent man.

689
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,530
There are times in war

690
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,830
When someone has to fall on a grenade.

691
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,230
He didn't fall. you threw him.

692
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,370
I saved your ass.

693
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,600
This entire project was about to be flushed,

694
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,100
And I helped us both out, petrelli.

695
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,800
It needed to be done.

696
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,600
I'm sorry that a man had to die.

697
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,300
Why don't you go apologize to his blood stain?

698
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,470
It's still warm.

699
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Staying here at the hotel?

700
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,200
Just for a little while.

701
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm actually looking for an apartment

702
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,700
In town if you know of anything.

703
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,930
Mm-mm.

704
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,130
Welcome to costa verde.

705
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,300
Well, it looks like our friend here

706
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,400
Had about three too many.

707
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,800
Don't worry. we'll get him home safe.

708
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,000
To be continued
