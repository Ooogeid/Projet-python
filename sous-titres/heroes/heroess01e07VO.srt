1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:02,211
Previously on Heroes.

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,130
Ordinary people
across the globe

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,258
discover they have
extraordinary abilities.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,637
The cheerleader searches her
birth-parents for answers.

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,187
She has your mouth and your nose,
doesn't she?

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,848
- But was it real?
- I think that went pretty well.

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,698
- If there's anything else you need...
- I'll keep you posted.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,815
The cop who reads thoughts used
his abilities to save his marriage.

9
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:27,569
Everything I could think of...
You thought of first.

10
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,320
The single mother's outter-ego
revealed a deadly secret.

11
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,991
What do you think D.L. is gonna do
when he finds out what we've done?

12
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:38,003
- What we've done?
- We framed him.

13
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,553
And in a battle
with her husband...

14
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:42,250
- I'm taking the money.
- You're not taking anything.

15
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:46,830
...lost her son.

16
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:48,960
The brother who could fly

17
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:51,491
fell in love with his
patient's daughter...

18
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,850
- Everyone runs into each other sooner or later.
- Maybe it'll be sooner.

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,683
...and is still
uncertain of his powers.

20
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,430
And now, Heroes continues.

21
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,640
Chapter Seven - Nothing to Hide

22
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:09,110
M-Core's holding steady,
but Yamagato

23
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:10,523
Yamagato is down

24
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:12,732
to 215 and an 1/8.

25
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:15,281
- I think that's a good bargain.
- Oh, really?

26
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:16,993
And what do you know?

27
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,701
- You saying I couldn't pick a stock?
- Ah, Darwinian.

28
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,541
Look at your sorry ass.

29
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,910
Barely able to
make minimum wage.

30
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,421
Now you look at me

31
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,790
living in a penthouse.

32
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,343
- Central Park West.
- Correction.

33
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:34,803
It's dying in a penthouse
in Central Park West.

34
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:41,141
Right you are, my boy.

35
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:43,022
Right you are.

36
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:46,143
Teach you to mess with me.
Take a breath.

37
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:49,482
In the end,
all that matters is love.

38
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:54,280
I love you, Peter.

39
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:57,151
I love you too, Charles.

40
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:59,571
You speak your mind.

41
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,071
You know who you are.
You know what you want.

42
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:03,201
That's your power.

43
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:05,162
That's your strength.

44
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:07,860
Mind if I let you in on
a little secret, Charles?

45
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:10,020
You can say anything to me,
you know that.

46
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:15,921
I can fly.

47
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:19,933
Really?

48
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,722
Well, if you can fly,
then show me.

49
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:27,812
All right.

50
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,650
Watch this.

51
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,102
Simone.

52
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:09,983
What's wrong? Come in.

53
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,191
It's my dad.

54
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:19,743
That's so weird. I was

55
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:21,781
just having a dream about him.

56
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,912
He passed away
about an hour ago.

57
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,423
I really needed to see you.

58
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:44,150
You know,
I get that you're sort of socially slow,

59
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:46,732
but you know you're supposed to
call someone before you come over.

60
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,242
This you're gonna want
to hear right away.

61
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,602
- I found the tape.
- What tape?

62
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:54,031
The tape of you trying to kill
yourself 20 times. I found it.

63
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:57,511
Look, I was looking for my PSP under
my bed, right? And there it was.

64
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:58,782
You're safe.

65
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:02,021
I thought this was
supposed to be good news.

66
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:04,251
Well, I can't believe you
had it this entire time!

67
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,842
- Why didn't you look there before?
- I did.

68
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,411
I tore the whole room apart.

69
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,662
I must've checked the bed,
like, 50 times.

70
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:13,172
Good morning, Mrs. Bennet.

71
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,833
Good morning, dog.

72
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:17,212
How are you, Zachary?

73
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm all right.
Claire keeps punching me, though.

74
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:24,980
Your dad's plane's gonna be late.
I won't be home until 8:00 or so.

75
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:26,771
I am trusting you to
hold down the fort.

76
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,812
Because Lyle never
listens to me.

77
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,651
Well, he will
listen to you today

78
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,380
because he knows what a big
day it is for Mr. Muggles.

79
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,840
Thank  you.
And he doesn't want to stress us out.

80
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:38,571
- Whew, does he?
- Sure.

81
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:41,281
Will you two help
me out to the car?

82
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:44,282
Your dad left on the
sprinklers last night.

83
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:47,073
And I don't want to
get his paws all soggy.

84
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,281
Here we go.

85
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,913
Wish Mr. Muggles good luck.

86
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:22,991
Micah?

87
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:26,363
Micah?

88
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,623
Micah!

89
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:48,930
Help me.

90
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:06,460
Now, things have been
really good between us

91
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,491
these last couple days.
Don't you think?

92
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,572
I know. I like it.

93
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:15,682
I just... I feel like we've been
really honest with each other.

94
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,043
- And that's good, right?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,880
There's something that
we need to talk about.

96
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,671
Something that I discovered.

97
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:27,801
I thought I'd been so careful.

98
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,513
Well, what?

99
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:31,933
What is it?

100
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:33,223
I don't...

101
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,311
Oh, God, he knows.

102
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:40,733
What?

103
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:42,561
What did you want to say?

104
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,570
It can wait, actually.

105
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,153
I gotta...

106
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:49,860
I gotta get to work.

107
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,661
Matt.

108
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:09,510
Niki?

109
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:12,393
I was knocking, like, forever.

110
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,303
What is it?

111
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,223
Micah.

112
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:21,981
Theo came back.

113
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:25,940
He... He took him.

114
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,283
I tried to protect my son.

115
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,823
But I couldn't.

116
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:35,780
I failed him.

117
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:46,172
Landlord said Isaac's gone.

118
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,090
He took his paintings and...

119
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,970
Did you know he was leaving?

120
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:55,223
No.

121
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:59,060
I can't believe he
would just go like that.

122
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,040
I thought we were just starting
to make sense of his paintings.

123
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:06,361
I wanted to tell him
what happened in person.

124
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,571
Isaac sketched it for
my dad's 70th birthday.

125
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,471
You know, I've been trying
to get him clean forever.

126
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,620
The one time I need him.

127
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:22,250
Feels like everybody's
leaving me.

128
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,041
I'm not going anywhere.

129
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,252
He was still in a coma.

130
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,510
And then,
like it was any other day,

131
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:32,010
he  started talking.

132
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:35,591
He said he'd been flying
all over the world.

133
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,903
But that it was a world
he didn't recognize.

134
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:40,031
There was so many people
filled with pain.

135
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:42,050
Nobody looking out
for each other.

136
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,562
He worried for them.

137
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,732
And for me.

138
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:51,111
Until you told him
everything would be okay.

139
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,331
- What do you mean I told him?
- I know. It doesn't make any sense.

140
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,172
But he said that you
were flying with him.

141
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:59,302
And you told him it
was all gonna be okay.

142
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:01,130
That there were
people who cared.

143
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,870
Who would make a difference.

144
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,081
That you would save the world.

145
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,003
After that,
he just put his head down and...

146
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,213
He was gone.

147
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,882
Like he was falling asleep.

148
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,891
I never had that conversation
with your father.

149
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:20,230
But it sounds like
something you would say.

150
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,723
Those messages you left
on my answering machine.

151
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:26,941
You said you wanted one
of Isaac's paintings.

152
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:30,732
Because it would help
you save the world.

153
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,402
It's hard to explain.

154
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,702
But if you had that painting...

155
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:43,753
I could save the world.

156
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,293
Linderman.

157
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:48,962
What?

158
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,632
The painting you want.

159
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,511
I sold it to a guy
named Linderman.

160
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:55,761
He lives in Las Vegas.

161
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:04,392
Linderman gave you $4 million,
and you're spending it on postcards.

162
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:09,523
- I take it I'm supposed to choose.
- Mmm.

163
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:15,573
- That one.
- Well, that isn't a red flag.

164
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,403
You two agreeing on something.

165
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:19,923
All right, gonna go to the
office and have this printed up.

166
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:21,833
Don't you want to
hear about how

167
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:24,622
the  New York Journal wants
to do a cover story on you?

168
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,460
I've invited Oliver Dennison
to come for family brunch

169
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:30,580
- and do an interview.
- You're kidding.

170
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:32,843
No, I never kid
about family brunch.

171
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:34,891
That's because we never
have family brunch.

172
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,670
Nathan, this could be great.

173
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:38,383
I don't know.

174
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:40,672
Dennison could go
anywhere for a bagel.

175
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,521
He comes here,
he's gonna want something.

176
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:45,252
Nothing wrong with taking
advantage of an opportunity.

177
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,311
Mandy...

178
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:51,373
Kids, why don't you go finish that train
set we started this morning, all right?

179
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:52,773
Take them upstairs.

180
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:58,823
- I am not gonna use my family for political gain.
- Tell that to Peter.

181
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:02,413
Nathan, you've been trying to
protect me since this happened.

182
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:05,543
It's sweet in theory,
but in practice, it's insulting.

183
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,912
- I'm not made of glass.
- I know.

184
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,122
But we don't need this.

185
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,961
Four points behind says we do.

186
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,000
I've been hiding in this
house for the last six months

187
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:21,762
because your polling was
afraid I'd make you look weak.

188
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:25,012
But now I can help
by coming forward.

189
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,272
Let me.

190
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:30,351
You sure about this?

191
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:33,271
Set it up.

192
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,443
Chef's been cooking
all morning.

193
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,280
Oliver will be here in an hour.

194
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,033
- Then I better get ready.
- Yeah.

195
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:53,212
Good idea.

196
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:03,391
Feeling okay, Matt?

197
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:04,973
Hey, Tommy.

198
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,313
Yeah, I'm, uh...

199
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:07,563
I'm good.

200
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:10,862
Come on, buddy. We rode in the
same car together for three years.

201
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,640
I can practically
read your mind.

202
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,930
Dude, I don't know
where to start.

203
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:18,900
How about we go get a beer?

204
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,281
- Dodger game at 7:00.
- Yeah.

205
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:24,322
Yeah, I like that. Thanks.

206
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,030
Hey, lady!
Would you look at that!

207
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,723
What's  going on?
What are you doing here?

208
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,543
Sylar, he's killed again.

209
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,512
I'll brief you on the
way to the morgue.

210
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:35,833
Sylar? Who's Sylar?

211
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:38,311
- I gotta talk to my watch commander.
- Taken care of.

212
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:39,802
I'll be outside.

213
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:42,052
Put on some real
person clothes.

214
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,763
Lyle, you better not think
I'm cleaning up after you.

215
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:48,753
We just got rid of
all those ants.

216
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:51,180
Such a dork.

217
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,652
Okay, I'm good.

218
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,530
Oh, my...

219
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:01,280
Oh, my God!

220
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:03,540
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God! Claire!

221
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:04,783
Shut it off!

222
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,453
Lyle, give it to me!

223
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,491
Give it to me!

224
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:13,831
Claire!

225
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,551
It's amazing what you can do with
special effects these days, huh?

226
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,513
That was all special effects?

227
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:27,930
Yeah, what else would it be?

228
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,192
Ow!

229
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:38,652
What the hell is
wrong with you?

230
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:59,461
Lyle, give it to me! Lyle!

231
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,462
Lyle, get back here!

232
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,053
Lyle! Don't let him get away!

233
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:07,510
L yle!

234
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:10,051
Lyle!

235
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:11,513
Get back here!

236
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,140
Hey!

237
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,203
Why would you want
to kill him again?

238
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,821
Because he found the tape
and then he stapled me.

239
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:25,612
Help! Somebody help me!
My sister's a freak!

240
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:29,530
Found him in a parking
lot in Brentwood.

241
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:30,912
Name's Robert Fresco,

242
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,333
an oncologist at
UCLA medical center.

243
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,080
Okay, so we figure out the M.O.

244
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,923
Well, the M.O.
is there is no M.O.

245
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,502
Sylar's victims are random.

246
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:43,171
Eight deaths I have no
clue how to explain.

247
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:45,030
Trust me.
This one's number nine.

248
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,811
Yeah, but there's nothing out
of the ordinary here, right?

249
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,733
Doesn't this guy look like
any other burn victim?

250
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,971
He's putting out 1800
curies of radiation.

251
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:55,143
Hazmat teams scoured the scene
but didn't find any incendiaries.

252
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,560
No plutonium,
no uranium... Nothing.

253
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,611
They did however
find a fingerprint.

254
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,902
Seared to the bone
like a brand.

255
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:03,902
Seared to the bone?

256
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,981
We're running it through CODIS.

257
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,581
Now, if we get a match and
we can get close to him,

258
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:10,632
I'm gonna need you to
get inside his head.

259
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,420
Pick him out of a crowd,
find him in a building...

260
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,873
Right, about that, um...

261
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:16,052
Lately it's been harder for
me to filter the voices.

262
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,333
And

263
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,570
hearing what they're
really thinking...

264
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,461
It can be ugly.

265
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:23,791
What's going on, Matt?

266
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,893
Theodore Sprague. AKA Sylar.

267
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:35,433
We got you.

268
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:41,942
So you're just gonna sit there
all day and not say a word, huh?

269
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:43,772
I want to go home.

270
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:46,451
Like I told you,
it's not safe there with your mother.

271
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,613
- Is she dead?
- No.

272
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:53,032
- She's gonna be fine.
- How do you know?

273
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,201
- Dad, we left her on the floor.
- We didn't have a choice.

274
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,831
Heroes don't run away.

275
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:01,121
- Micah...
- Bad guys do.

276
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,172
Heroes help people, Dad.

277
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,631
You know what?

278
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:09,092
- You're a bad guy.
- I'm not a bad guy, all right?

279
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:12,551
Do you remember when
I told you that

280
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:15,801
six months ago I started
having these bad dreams?

281
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:17,971
We all have bad dreams, Niki.

282
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,390
I don't think that
they were just dreams.

283
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,770
When they started,
I thought that...

284
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:29,943
Maybe somebody was
following me or something.

285
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:35,030
And I would catch
my reflection.

286
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,910
But it wasn't my reflection.

287
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:47,593
It was another me.

288
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:49,960
She has a name.

289
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:55,721
- Jessica.
- Jessica?

290
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,263
When someone tries to hurt me,

291
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,521
it's like she comes out.

292
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,100
There is no Jessica.

293
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:03,892
It's just you.

294
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,521
No, I see her in the mirror.

295
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:10,111
And she tells me that she
wants to come out again.

296
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:14,531
The part of me that
needs Micah back

297
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,582
wants to let her do it.

298
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:23,371
It's just complicated
with your mom and me.

299
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,002
What's up ahead?

300
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,132
Stay there.

301
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:39,761
Dad, don't!

302
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,233
Get out! Quick!

303
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:51,653
What has happened?

304
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:55,990
He'll never get
her out in time.

305
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,742
Lady, you gotta get up!

306
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:03,373
You gotta get out of there.

307
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:18,182
You no worry. I help.

308
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:27,232
- Dad!
- Hiro!

309
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,020
Why couldn't I have
super strength too?

310
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:29,620
Dad!

311
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:32,462
Micah!

312
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,050
Dad...

313
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:46,390
I thought you were dead.
What happened?

314
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:48,602
I don't know.

315
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:06,542
We're usually in our pajamas
around the breakfast table.

316
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,090
You can't blame us for
cleaning up for the Journal.

317
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,212
Not when the hollandaise
is made fresh.

318
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:17,172
- You seem to be adjusting well.
- To the wheelchair?

319
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:19,212
You can say it, Mr. Dennison.

320
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,261
I lost my right to be sensitive
when I married Nathan.

321
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:26,972
I'm not saying I didn't have my
darker moments during rehabilitation.

322
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:29,062
I was angry for a long time.

323
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,190
At your husband?

324
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,232
- Wasn't he driving?
- At God.

325
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:40,783
But we seem to have
made our peace.

326
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:48,703
Oh, hello, Peter.

327
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,292
- What's this?
- It's brunch.

328
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:56,882
- We always have brunch.
- Since when?

329
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,590
Will you excuse me?

330
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:02,633
Peter, how good to see you.

331
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:07,053
Nice of you to drop by, Peter.

332
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:09,062
Whatever this is about,

333
00:21:09,397 --> 00:21:11,141
now is not the time.

334
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,442
Charles Deveaux
died this morning.

335
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:15,812
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,860
- Were you there?
- No, I wasn't.

337
00:21:18,115 --> 00:21:20,253
I stopped working for him so I could
figure out what was going on with us.

338
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,372
I told you to drop all
this "I'm special" crap.

339
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,121
I can't, all right?
I need your help.

340
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:26,050
That man out there
is Oliver Dennison.

341
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:28,172
He's working for the
Journal doing a story on me.

342
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,263
Everything I've worked for is
riding on our family being able

343
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:32,303
to sit through a single
meal together and smile.

344
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:35,213
- So I'm not family enough for you now.
- No, you're not.

345
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:38,041
Not when you're gonna
ruin an election for me.

346
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:42,710
I need you to get me a painting,
all right? Linderman bought it.

347
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:44,173
Whoa, whoa...

348
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:46,693
We're not exactly advertising that
family connection around here.

349
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:50,363
All right, great. So just get him on
the phone and ask about the painting.

350
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:52,563
Peter, I'm sorry.

351
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:54,730
But you're gonna
have to go, okay?

352
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:55,983
Hey, you know what?

353
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:58,033
I'm just gonna fly
off the terrace, yeah?

354
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:00,361
No? Hey, I can fly.

355
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,032
Nathan, so can you.

356
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:03,610
I'll tell you what.

357
00:22:03,996 --> 00:22:06,333
Why don't we just race around the
Statue of Liberty real quick, huh?

358
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,663
Give this tweedy guy
something to write about.

359
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:12,583
- You wouldn't.
- Ah?

360
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:16,923
Peter.

361
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:19,210
Peter.

362
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,550
Sorry,

363
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,512
Nathan gave me an earful
about showing up in cords.

364
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,682
I told him I'm trying
to stay grounded.

365
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:33,221
Good to have you back.

366
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,601
How'd you get this?
The issue isn't even out yet.

367
00:22:37,818 --> 00:22:39,912
I got it in the future.
It's a story about me.

368
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:40,943
Hiro.

369
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:42,440
Um, see...

370
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:43,781
All the same.

371
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,150
Hiro...

372
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:48,820
Even same car! Nissan Versa!

373
00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:51,621
I teleported.
New York City. Yataa!

374
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,411
I freeze time too.

375
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,753
Stop the explosion.
Saved your dad!

376
00:22:57,508 --> 00:23:00,421
- Hey, didn't you visit my mom?
- Hmm?

377
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:03,253
We should get them to a hospital.
Can you drive?

378
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:06,382
Don't worry. Help is coming.
I call the police.

379
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:08,050
Time to go, Micah.

380
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,891
Dad, you saved her.
Like a real hero.

381
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:13,260
Now we can go back
and save Mom.

382
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,100
I wish it were that easy.

383
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:17,312
Well, it is, Dad.
We just go back.

384
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:19,023
No, Micah...

385
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:21,192
It's not.

386
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,982
I'm sorry. We can't go back.

387
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,860
We can never go back.

388
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:32,822
Come on.

389
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:45,553
- Bye-bye!
- Take care!

390
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:58,732
Come on,
you can't stay in there forever!

391
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:03,811
Then just give me
the damn tape.

392
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:06,913
I'm gonna put this thing on YouTube.
Make, like, a million bucks.

393
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:10,072
-  YouTube's free, you idiot.
- You're not helping.

394
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:14,200
Lyle, no one can see
what's on that tape.

395
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,120
Are you an alien or something?
Is he an alien too?

396
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:20,160
Yeah, yeah. We're gonna...
We're gonna anal probe you!

397
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,923
Zach! Stop scaring him.

398
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:25,432
I'm not coming out until
Mom and Dad get home.

399
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:28,840
No, no, no.
You cannot tell them.

400
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,972
Lyle, please.

401
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:34,222
- They cannot find out about this.
- Why not?

402
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:37,181
Don't you get it?
If they found out,

403
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,692
Mom and Dad would think it was
a mistake to ever adopt me.

404
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:46,231
We wouldn't be a
family anymore.

405
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,371
Please.

406
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,542
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

407
00:25:13,808 --> 00:25:14,800
Argh!

408
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,813
Wait a minute.

409
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:21,893
Wait a second.
We're going in here without backup?

410
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:24,131
No one even knows we're here,
do they?

411
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,273
What is this all
about with you?

412
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,440
You in my head, Parkman?

413
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,070
No, I'm just...
I'm asking a question.

414
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,070
It's about Sylar.

415
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,320
I'm not letting him
get away this time.

416
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm taking him down.

417
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:50,093
Something's burning.

418
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,763
- Radiation?
- Curie levels are safe.

419
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,060
What the hell is this?

420
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:02,723
What...

421
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:05,353
Hang on,
I'm getting some spikes.

422
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:12,531
Hey.

423
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:18,370
Check this out.

424
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,951
Their faces are all burned off.

425
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:59,621
What the hell happened in here?

426
00:27:00,876 --> 00:27:03,540
1800 curies of radiation.

427
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,622
Come on, let's get out of here.

428
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:12,933
Of course I'm gonna
vote for Nathan.

429
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:15,301
If Nathan

430
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:16,711
takes care of the people

431
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:19,381
half as much as he takes
care of his brother,

432
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,353
it's gonna be an
interesting city.

433
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:25,223
- Pretty special family.
- You have no idea.

434
00:27:26,356 --> 00:27:28,691
This is all very inspiring.

435
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,320
I was surprised to learn the Linderman
Group recently invested in
your campaign.

436
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:34,950
I don't know why
you'd be surprised.

437
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:36,913
Mr. Linderman was a good
friend of my father's.

438
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:40,343
So you don't deny going to Las Vegas
to meet with a reputed mobster.

439
00:27:43,376 --> 00:27:44,701
Is that why you're here?

440
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:47,592
I spoke with a former member
of your security detail.

441
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,420
It seems there was
a bit of a scare.

442
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:53,843
You disappeared from the
casino for several hours.

443
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,421
And there was a
blonde involved.

444
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,721
It's all right, Nathan.

445
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,140
You can tell him.

446
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,732
- Right, um...
- Look, um...

447
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,611
I'm sure that you've

448
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:17,820
recently heard about my
mental health issues.

449
00:28:18,746 --> 00:28:20,900
I quit my job because of it.

450
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:25,163
My brother basically
saved my life.

451
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,160
And he's convinced me to
get the help that I needed.

452
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:33,251
There's a private
clinic outside Vegas.

453
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:34,790
Nathan went,

454
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:37,750
spoke to a doctor...
A woman doctor.

455
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,630
I made him promise that
no one would know.

456
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,010
Not even the family.

457
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,973
But I just don't

458
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:49,560
care who knows anymore. Okay?

459
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,523
I didn't want to say anything
until I cleared it with you.

460
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,651
That's Nathan.

461
00:28:56,947 --> 00:28:58,911
You know,
right in the middle of an election,

462
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,993
he still has time to help out
his messed-up little brother.

463
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:03,492
Oh, well...

464
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:09,043
What's this?

465
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:12,003
- They counteract radiation poisoning.
- Oh, thanks.

466
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:14,331
One second.

467
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:18,592
Who keeps calling you?

468
00:29:19,095 --> 00:29:21,842
Uh, nobody. It's my wife.

469
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,722
Since when is your wife nobody?

470
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:25,771
Listen, I don't think
this guy's Sylar.

471
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,851
Yeah? Well, we'll see.

472
00:29:28,107 --> 00:29:29,751
Look what I found
in the bedroom.

473
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:31,393
Look at this. Methotrexate.

474
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,483
This is chemotherapy in a pill.

475
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:36,690
This is prescribed to Karen
Sprague and it's current.

476
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:39,611
- She has cancer?
- Check out the doctor on the label.

477
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:41,860
- Dr. Robert Fresco...
- Right.

478
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:43,572
- The oncologist.
- Mmh.

479
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:45,451
Karen Sprague's room?

480
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:57,581
Take it easy, Ted.

481
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,790
We just want to ask
you some questions.

482
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:01,710
I didn't mean to kill him.

483
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,180
Dr. Fresco said there was
nothing he could do to save her.

484
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:07,172
I tried to convince him,
you know?

485
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:09,932
There must be something
else that he could do.

486
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:11,221
Anything.

487
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,601
And we argued.

488
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,311
And I lost control.

489
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:18,523
We can talk about
this downtown.

490
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,401
- Hey, let her go.
- If you let me stay with my wife.

491
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,193
No, you let her go or I shoot.

492
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:27,133
Do you have any idea what
would happen if you did that?

493
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,963
Because I don't.
Maybe I'll explode.

494
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,751
Maybe I'll take out
this whole hospital.

495
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:33,122
Maybll wipe out this city
like an atomic bomb.

496
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:35,172
- Just leave me alone!
- We can't do that!

497
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:36,871
Stop, Teddy, stop!

498
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:43,170
Karen wants you to stop.

499
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,260
- How could you say that?
- She says you need to listen.

500
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,182
Ted, you never listen.
You're too damn stubborn.

501
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:51,220
But you're still
her teddy bear.

502
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,612
Gimme a break.
You think you can hear her?

503
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,891
He's telling the truth, Ted.
Listen to him.

504
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:08,200
What's she saying?

505
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,241
She's saying she...

506
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:16,162
She doesn't blame you...

507
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,460
For all the pain and the worry.

508
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:23,712
She's saying it's
not your fault, Ted.

509
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,382
She shouldn't be here.

510
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,473
It's not fair.

511
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:30,340
She's saying it never is.

512
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,850
She said that was
the best date.

513
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:36,430
The picnic on the beach.
And it poured sheets and sheets of rain.

514
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,310
We sat in my car...

515
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:43,072
And listened to the whole
American Beauty album.

516
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:44,903
She remembers it all.

517
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:48,153
She always will.

518
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:57,160
What's she saying now?

519
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:22,310
Hi, this is Niki
Sanders from Las Vegas.

520
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:24,612
I need your help.

521
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:28,741
I know that I'm probably the last
person that you want to talk to.

522
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:31,151
You should not have
called me here.

523
00:32:31,155 --> 00:32:33,282
I know that I have no right to.

524
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,583
But I need your help.

525
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,910
My husband took my son.

526
00:32:41,178 --> 00:32:43,171
I have nowhere else to go.

527
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:45,341
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

528
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,842
You have the wrong number.

529
00:32:47,848 --> 00:32:49,633
- Hi, Hon.
- Hi.

530
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:52,842
- Where are the boys?
- In the play room.

531
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:58,473
- Do you still love me, Nathan?
- Of course I do.

532
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:03,101
I know what this chair
means to us as a couple.

533
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:06,770
But I need you to know that
I'm going to walk again.

534
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,482
The doctors say
it's a long shot.

535
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:13,492
But I can do it if
I have a reason.

536
00:33:14,418 --> 00:33:16,743
We just need some hope, Nathan,

537
00:33:16,998 --> 00:33:19,083
that our life can
be like it was.

538
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,920
What Peter said

539
00:33:25,715 --> 00:33:29,631
about you checking out a
clinic for him with a doctor.

540
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:32,721
Tell me that's what happened.

541
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,392
If you say it is...

542
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,891
I'll believe you.

543
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:41,061
Just give me some hope.

544
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:43,440
It's true.

545
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:48,940
Come on.

546
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:55,663
- I'm gonna get the kids ready for bed.
- Okay.

547
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:09,170
What the hell happened?

548
00:34:11,678 --> 00:34:14,093
You should just...
You should just go.

549
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:16,760
Niki, what is going on here?
Are you okay?

550
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,761
I said that you can go now.

551
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,893
It's me.

552
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:24,063
I'm just trying to help you out,
girl, okay?

553
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:26,020
She doesn't need
your help anymore.

554
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:28,191
Understand?

555
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:36,612
- Hey.
- Hey.

556
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,170
So they're gonna run Sprague
through decontamination.

557
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,633
And then put him in a special
holding tank downtown.

558
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,173
How'd he cause all that
damage with his bare hands?

559
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:46,501
How do you hear what
people are thinking?

560
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:50,461
You did a great job in there.

561
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:52,503
Well, the guy was
losing his wife.

562
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,092
He just wanted to talk to her,
say goodbye.

563
00:34:55,346 --> 00:34:57,012
You talk to your own wife yet?

564
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:59,300
You've been dodging
her call all day.

565
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,272
Well, I'm gonna head downtown,

566
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:06,812
- cover Sprague's processing.
- Right.

567
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:19,321
Hey, it's me.

568
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:21,990
I actually thought you
might be home by now.

569
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,741
I'm calling just to...

570
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,411
talk, um...

571
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,880
Look, I had this stupid
idea in my head that...

572
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,802
that I'm losing you.

573
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:35,632
And I...

574
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:37,632
I just...

575
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:40,013
I can't help but have
the feeling that

576
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:42,342
there's something
you're not telling me.

577
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:46,020
And I don't want us to
live with any regret.

578
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,640
Or blame.

579
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:52,772
I don't know. I guess I'm just
afraid of things going unsaid.

580
00:35:55,368 --> 00:35:57,073
I love you.

581
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:58,863
And...

582
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:02,451
And I just wanted
to tell you that.

583
00:36:02,957 --> 00:36:05,902
You don't have to call me back.
I'll see you later tonight.

584
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,463
Yes, Mr. Linderman.

585
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:19,840
It seems my brother's developed some
sort of emotional attachment to
this painting.

586
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:23,360
I don't know what'll happen
to him if he doesn't get it.

587
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:25,472
But I'd rather not find out.

588
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:27,520
Directly to the gallery.

589
00:36:28,607 --> 00:36:31,900
Mr. Linderman, I appreciate it.

590
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:33,772
Good night.

591
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:47,122
You need to tell
Heidi the truth.

592
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,251
No.

593
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:52,963
She doesn't need the truth.
She needs hope.

594
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:56,472
- What, is that some kind of excuse?
- I'm not saying what I did was right.

595
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:59,551
That girl in Vegas...
I just needed to be with someone who...

596
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:03,220
didn't make me feel guilty
every time I looked at her.

597
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,393
Did you...
Did you talk to Linderman?

598
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:10,680
- Yeah. Sit down.
- And?

599
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:16,020
He's not gonna let it go.

600
00:37:16,656 --> 00:37:19,571
Hey, come on. Just let it go.

601
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:22,291
- It's just a painting.
- It's more than that, Nathan.

602
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,960
This is about what's
going on with us.

603
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:25,120
All right, this...

604
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:28,120
This painting is the key.

605
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:30,661
With this thing,
we can make a difference.

606
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:33,801
I'm trying to make a difference,
Peter, the best way I know how.

607
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:35,600
Flying around,
how is that going to help anybody?

608
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:36,683
What is that gonna...

609
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,713
What am I gonna do
when I get there?

610
00:37:38,718 --> 00:37:41,643
I don't have a gun. I don't have
a badge. I don't know karate.

611
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:46,180
I guess I could put on a costume and
fly around and pull cats out of trees.

612
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:48,222
How's that gonna
make a difference?

613
00:37:48,607 --> 00:37:51,352
You're not gonna
know until you try.

614
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,020
I'm sorry about the painting.

615
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,821
Listen, something else
happened in Vegas that I...

616
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,452
What?

617
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,701
These two guys,

618
00:38:07,915 --> 00:38:10,580
they tried to pull me out
of my hotel room. They did.

619
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,292
It was like a, um...

620
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:15,252
A kidnapping attempt
or something.

621
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:19,592
- How'd you get away?
- I flew.

622
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:23,382
- So who were they?
- The one who did all the talking

623
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,270
had these horn-rimmed glasses.
The other guy was

624
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,762
a spooky euro dude.
He didn't say a word.

625
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:30,680
Son of a bitch.
You really expect me to believe that?

626
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,183
Yeah.

627
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,643
- I'm not lying to you.
- No?

628
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,270
No. Think about it.

629
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:40,161
What would people do if they
knew what we were capable of?

630
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,901
They'd lock us up and
they'd throw away the key.

631
00:38:43,076 --> 00:38:44,992
Now who sounds crazy?

632
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,243
Be careful.

633
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,492
Yeah.

634
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:12,852
Someone had a good day.

635
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:14,321
It's all over the station.

636
00:39:14,357 --> 00:39:16,161
FBI bust,
Homeland Security collar...

637
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:18,230
- Congrats, buddy.
- Thanks, man.

638
00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:21,360
It really wasn't
anything, though.

639
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,943
It must've been something.

640
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:27,121
Your FBI girlfriend just put in a
request for you to retake the
detective's exam

641
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,780
as a series of interviews.

642
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:31,713
- Can't blame it on the dyslexia this time.
- Wait a second...

643
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,632
Interviews? I didn't even
know that was an option.

644
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,412
She's FBI.
She pulled some strings.

645
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:38,331
And you are gonna pass it,
no problem.

646
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:40,540
Thanks, man.

647
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,210
Wow.

648
00:39:44,388 --> 00:39:45,921
Loser.

649
00:39:46,227 --> 00:39:49,801
I'm nailing you wife,
and she is so fine... So fine...

650
00:39:56,648 --> 00:40:01,230
- Hey, you still want to grab that drink?
- Son of a bitch!

651
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:16,332
You do not choose your destiny.

652
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,503
It chooses you.

653
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:22,630
And those who knew you before
fate took you by the hand

654
00:40:22,677 --> 00:40:25,963
cannot understand the depth
of the changes inside.

655
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,413
- Yeah?
- Mom.

656
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:55,992
Micah.

657
00:40:56,336 --> 00:40:58,412
Hey, baby, I've been worried.

658
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:01,291
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

659
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:03,752
- Are you?
- I'm good.

660
00:41:04,427 --> 00:41:06,671
Are you with your
dad right now?

661
00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:09,130
Uh, yeah.
I just got out for one minute.

662
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,220
Mom...

663
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:15,932
- Mom, is this really you?
- Tell me where you are, baby.

664
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,481
Just put my mom on the phone.

665
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,641
Your mom's not here right now.

666
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:25,900
And she's not coming back until
I take care of a few things.

667
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,372
So, why don't you tell
me where you are.

668
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:30,320
I'll come get you
and bring you home.

669
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:32,702
Your mom needs you.

670
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm in a little motel.
It's right off the Interstate 14.

671
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:39,371
It's called the
Littlefield Motel.

672
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:45,793
You talking to your mom?

673
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:49,091
No. No,
I'm just goofing around.

674
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,841
Come on.
We got some driving to do.

675
00:41:56,187 --> 00:42:00,473
- They cannot fathom how much you stand to lose in failure.
- Micah?

676
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:04,391
But you are the instrument
of a flawless design.

677
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:08,653
And all of life may
hang in the balance.

678
00:42:08,907 --> 00:42:12,153
A hero learns quickly
who can comprehend

679
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,951
and who merely
stands in your way.
