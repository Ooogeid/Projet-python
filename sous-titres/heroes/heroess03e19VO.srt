Chapter Six "Shades of Gray"

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Bennet house Costa verde,california

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,130
You.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,400
Hey, barbie.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,230
I got a message from someone named rebel?

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,770
Said you could help me.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,170
I need your help, barbie.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,730
Rebel promised.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,500
Well, he lied.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,070
Now get out.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,470
Please.

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,830
I can't go back out there.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,770
Claire? You okay?

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,930
Oh, my god.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Mom. it's all right.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,700
Mr. Doyle here was just leaving.

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,270
No, please.

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,400
They'll catch me.

19
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,700
Rebel said you could help me start over,

20
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,830
And that's all I want--

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,030
To go back to being a puppeteer,

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,200
Making people happy.

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,400
And you thought I would help you?

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,900
After what you did?

25
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,885
You should know there are agents

26
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:08,800
Parked outside this house.

27
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,530
Actually, they're not.

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,930
Rebel set a fake call,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,770
Which they'll figure out any minute now.

30
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,770
But if there were agents outside...

31
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,600
Why aren't they kicking in the door,

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,200
Looking to collect a comes-back-to-life barbie?

33
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,170
They gave me a free pass,

34
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,170
But they will come after me

35
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,770
If i try to help anyone.

36
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,870
So you turn your back on your own kind,

37
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,630
While we're all out there being hunted down?

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,530
They burned down my theater while I was still inside.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,470
And you tried to kill us, you--!

40
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,700
You and your free pass.

41
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,030
You have no idea what it's like

42
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,870
To be hunted,

43
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,270
To live on the street,

44
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,830
To break into the home of the last person on earth

45
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,330
You'd expect to help you

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,070
Because she was your only hope.

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,530
I thought...

48
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,570
I'm not gonna force you to help me, claire.

49
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,430
That's not who I am anymore.

50
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,370
Where the hell have you been?

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,170
Dealing with the mess your brother left us.

52
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,370
There wouldn't have been a mess

53
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,630
If you'd released Parkman and Millbrook

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,170
Like I asked you to.

55
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,170
I made the right choice. Peter just got lucky.

56
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,300
Though I have wondered

57
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,400
How many people knew he was on that rooftop.

58
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,800
Petrelli.

59
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,770
What?

60
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,970
Yeah, I'm on my way.

61
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,970
I thought Parkman was in your custody.

62
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,430
He was last time I checked.

63
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,430
Well, what the hell's he doing

64
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,435
In front of the capitol building

65
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:20,370
With a bomb strapped to his chest?

66
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,430
No, no, no.

67
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,070
Deactivate the device now,

68
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,470
Then lie face down.

69
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,700
I don't know if I try and pull this it's g--

70
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,830
I didn't do this. I was set up!

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,170
Senator Nathan Petrelli.

72
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,070
Sir, this is a very dangerous situation. I can't--

73
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,370
Lieutenant, I know that man.

74
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,100
I can get through to him.

75
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,600
You got five minutes.

76
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,600
Parkman!

77
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,800
You son of a bitch.

78
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,430
Don't you come any closer to me.

79
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,230
- Everything gonna be all right. - No, it's not!

80
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,630
You turned me into a terrorist.

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,330
I didn't sanction this. That was Danko.

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,970
He's got an agenda.

83
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,130
- You lie to me. - Believe me, Matt.

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
Use your power. Read my mind.

85
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,070
I'm telling you the truth.

86
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,930
I can't. I can't. They drugged me.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,370
Gonna have to trust me, Matt.

88
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,300
Parkman's vest is ready, sir, but we have a problem here.

89
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,370
Petrelli. How'd he get there so fast?

90
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,970
Is the device armed?

91
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,370
We're all set.

92
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,930
Senator wants to play hero...

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,970
He can be a martyr to his own cause.

94
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,670
Take them out.

95
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,670
Weapon activated

96
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,530
Do it.

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,130
Take him out. Now.

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,517
I don'tnow where this came from!

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm gonna blow up!

100
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,970
We've been kicked out.

101
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,770
Get it back. Now.

102
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,100
...though there are those who believe

103
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:37,130
That he may know the bomber personally.

104
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,270
What's goin' on here?

105
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,630
Come on. We're losin' our window.

106
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,830
I'm routing through a different server.

107
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,030
Matt, if we don't disarm you, they're gonna shoot you.

108
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,500
There are a lot of bomb techs around here.

109
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,930
I'm sure one of them

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,530
Is thinking about how to disarm that.

111
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,400
Get inside his head.

112
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,570
The drugs are starting to wear off, but I don't think--

113
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,770
What's he thinking?

114
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,800
Running out of time.

115
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,870
Red wire.

116
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,330
Red wire.

117
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,630
Doesn't make any sense.

118
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,800
Why would a suicide bomber bother with dummy wire?

119
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,200
- Don't touch red wire. - I'm not touching anything.

120
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,600
We have to take the shot!

121
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,900
Just hang on.

122
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,200
It's all right, Matt, take your time.

123
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,670
Black wire is the key.

124
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,870
- Black wire. - Black wire. Okay.

125
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,570
Do i pull the black wire,

126
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,830
Or is that the one i don't pull?

127
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,200
He's not thinkin' directly about it.

128
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,030
I gotta dig deeper. hold on!

129
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,230
I got it. we're back up.

130
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,700
Weapon armed, sir.

131
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,700
Matt, i'm gonna pull it.

132
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,700
Danko.

133
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,370
I said do it.

134
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,570
Wait!

135
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,130
Damn it!

136
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,200
Sorry, Matt.

137
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,030
I can't have you usin' your power.

138
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,830
It's open.

139
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,430
Almost got the order ready.

140
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,270
You have a lot of pickups today?

141
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,070
I'm not here for a pickup.

142
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,600
No?

143
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,430
It's me.

144
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,270
Gabriel.

145
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,370
Your son.

146
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,030
Is that so?

147
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,070
That is so.

148
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,630
What brings you all the way out here?

149
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,370
I had some questions about myself...

150
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,700
Who i am,

151
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,070
Where i came from.

152
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,200
But then i remembered.

153
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,170
You abandoned me.

154
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,400
You killed my mother.

155
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,600
So?

156
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,600
What now?

157
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,200
Now?

158
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,800
I kill you.

159
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Go right ahead.

160
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,170
You kill me, or the cancer does.

161
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,270
Either way, i die.

162
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,830
I haven't got all day.

163
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,630
Anything?

164
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,900
This guy's good.

165
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,900
There's no sign the system was even breached.

166
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,430
I wanna know how the hell he's getting inside,

167
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,430
And i want a name.

168
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,170
Me too.

169
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,970
So we can thank them

170
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,630
For saving us from this disaster.

171
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,070
Of course,

172
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,700
Since the safety of your friends and family

173
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,770
Evidently trumps national security.

174
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,770
Parkman wasn't a threat

175
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,030
Until you strapped a bomb to him.

176
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,130
Parkman and your brother exposed our operations,

177
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,230
So I handled it,

178
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,330
Put a face to the terrorist threat.

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,370
People could have died.

180
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,000
People have died, senator,

181
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,430
Or don't my men count?

182
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,800
I was brought in to get this job done.

183
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,670
I'd let go of that if I were you.

184
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,970
You're relieved of command.

185
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,700
I answer to the president.

186
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,000
You try to get rid of me, he's gonna want proof,

187
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,070
And right now it's my word against yours.

188
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,130
Good luck getting any of my people to turn on me.

189
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,300
We'll see. excuse me.

190
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,030
Bennet, you have a minute?

191
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,570
I'm not sure how much i can tell ya

192
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,770
About what happened.

193
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,300
I know what happened last night.

194
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,030
I wanna talk to you about putting a team together

195
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,570
Once Danko's gone.

196
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,370
You're one of us, Nathan.

197
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,900
You're one of us!

198
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,000
You're one of us, Nathan.

199
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,930
Do you have a point?

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,530
That maybe this operation

201
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,830
Has been compromised from the start.

202
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,730
The Petrelli family has a lot of skeletons

203
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,830
In their closet, senator.

204
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,700
I think we both know what yours is.

205
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,130
So...looks like we're both building a case

206
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,170
Against each other.

207
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,370
Let's see who gets there first.

208
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,170
You're one of us, Nathan.

209
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,600
You're one of us!

210
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,130
Son of a bitch went over my head.

211
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,230
What do you expect?

212
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,030
You backed a wild dog into a corner.

213
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,430
But you didn't act.

214
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,270
All you did was show Danko your hand,

215
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,700
And, frankly, you put both of us at risk.

216
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,730
I had a plan, though.

217
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,100
Nathan, listen to me.

218
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,400
He's pushing your buttons

219
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,230
So that you'll make a mistake.

220
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,070
Take a play from your mother's book.

221
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,670
Keep your head.

222
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,930
Sorry about all this.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,370
I find that hard to believe.

224
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,930
The man who transferred you back here

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,030
Is gonna come in in a few moments

226
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,270
And ask you some questions.

227
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,970
I was wondering when that was gonna happen.

228
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,600
I know this might seem hard to believe,

229
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,530
Well, that makes one of us.

230
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,930
Come on. you're smarter than that.

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,170
You might not realize it,

232
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,230
But i have been helping you out all along.

233
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,600
You and everyone else.

234
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,670
And doing a fabulous job of it.

235
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,770
You remember when you jumped off the bridge and i was there?

236
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,170
I'm still the same guy.

237
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,630
You sacrificed me for your own personal gain.

238
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,570
You don't have to like me,

239
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,100
But you do have to understand that i am your last hope.

240
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,470
That's my prisoner.

241
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,700
Got a soft spot for this one, Petrelli?

242
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,000
Wanna make sure i don't get too rough with her?

243
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,400
No, no. knock yourself out.

244
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,030
I wanna know everything you know about Nathan Petrelli.

245
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,930
He was lousy in bed.

246
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,970
I wanna know what you meant

247
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,070
When you said he was "one of us."

248
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,270
Does Nathan have an ability?

249
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,600
An ability?

250
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,430
I have no idea what you're talking about.

251
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,500
You wanna talk about it?

252
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,700
Should i have helped Doyle?

253
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,870
That puppet man

254
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,830
Is a sick and twisted individual, Claire.

255
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,370
You did the right thing.

256
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,830
I have a free pass for a reason.

257
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,200
I should be using it to help people.

258
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,870
Rebel seems to think so.

259
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,430
Yes, well, this rebel, whoever he is,

260
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,370
Can't send psychopaths to our front doorstep.

261
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,270
I don't think i can take any more surprise guests.

262
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,500
Right, which is why I was thinking

263
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,200
That I should have a cover job.

264
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,570
I mean, with Alex gone,

265
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,200
They're probably gonna need someone to fill his job

266
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,500
At the comic book store,

267
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,600
And I could help whoever rebel sends,

268
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,630
And no more surprise guests for you and Lyle.

269
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,770
Boy, Claire, I don't know.

270
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,430
I guess so.

271
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,330
If it's what you want to do.

272
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,470
Thanks.

273
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,230
So, you don't have any retail experience?

274
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,500
Um, does a cheerleading bake sale count?

275
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,200
Uh, you're a cheerleader?

276
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,270
Yeah, I was.

277
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,430
All right, so let me as you a few questions.

278
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,870
Can you work wednesdays?

279
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,900
Wednesdays?

280
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,400
Wednesdays are when all the new comics arrive.

281
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,500
Wednesday is good for me.

282
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,630
Flight or invisibility?

283
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,070
I'm sorry. What?

284
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,770
Do you throw caution to the wind

285
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,670
And fly off to save the day,

286
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,630
Or do you take the more calculated approach

287
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,470
And learn the whole picture before you act?

288
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,170
What's the answer?

289
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,770
There isn't one.

290
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,770
That's why it's the question.

291
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,470
Put simply-- what type of hero are you?

292
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,300
I don't know.

293
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,300
Whoa, hey, hey.

294
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,070
You're not gonna cry are you?

295
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,030
It--it's okay, really.

296
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,470
They're only comic books, i mean...

297
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,830
I'm gonna stop bothering you.

298
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,400
Uh, thank you for letting me interview, anyway.

299
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,600
What are you talking about? You got the job.

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I did?

301
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,730
Every guy in the store's been staring at you

302
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,830
Since you walked in.

303
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,930
You will absolutely sell comic books,

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,970
And the other stuff we can work on.

305
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,930
You're still here.

306
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,430
This is pitiful.

307
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,430
What's that?

308
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,570
What you've become.

309
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,830
You used to be a killer. Now look at you.

310
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,830
You're pathetic.

311
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,930
Oh. You want a fight.

312
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,570
Is that what you were expecting?

313
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,130
Son kills his father? Epic battle?

314
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,000
Ah, that's a myth.

315
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,300
No, life--

316
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,230
Life never gives you what you want.

317
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,500
Give me a hand with this.

318
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,400
Maybe i can explain it to ya.

319
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,700
Now, when i open the trap,

320
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,800
He's gonna bolt,

321
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,300
So grab him from the back, all right?

322
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,300
You have an ability.

323
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,800
Got lots of 'em.

324
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,570
Don't know what i got left.

325
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,400
Been years since i used 'em--

326
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,900
Or needed 'em.

327
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,330
You have the same thing--

328
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,900
Taking people's abilities.

329
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,330
Am i right?

330
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,430
Guess the apple didn't fall too far from the tree.

331
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,670
I'm not your apple. you don't know anything about me.

332
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,900
I have some idea.

333
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,230
You and i, we can't be all that different.

334
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
From where i stand,

335
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,270
We have exactly nothing in common.

336
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,130
Yeah, well, we pick easy targets.

337
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,600
Like that rabbit--weak, helpless.

338
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,170
Not fair, really.

339
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,500
Are you really drawing a moral line?

340
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,100
Morality doesn't figure into it.

341
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,030
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly.

342
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,570
You have to kill. It's who you are.

343
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,800
But you do choose your prey,

344
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,670
And yours never had a chance, not against you.

345
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,200
Not really.

346
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,170
Easy pickin's.

347
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,400
Small game.

348
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,930
They had something i wanted.

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,200
It isn't my fault

350
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,030
If they weren't strong enough to fight back.

351
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,270
And those agents

352
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,900
That have been comin' after us recently?

353
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:03,970
I handled them.

354
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,030
No, you ran away from 'em.

355
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
Just like i did.

356
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,830
I could wipe them out with a thought.

357
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,030
But you haven't.

358
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,670
Why?

359
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,830
You know, there'll come a day,

360
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Maybe tomorrow or next week, next year,

361
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,300
When you realize the hunt...

362
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,570
...your entire life,

363
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,500
Was meaningless and disappointing,

364
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,500
cause there's no challenge in it.

365
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,970
You know, all the power in the world doesn't matter

366
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,370
If you've lived an unsatisfied life.

367
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,970
And I think you know that already, don't you?

368
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,000
You wanna know more, or...

369
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,970
You gonna kill me now?

370
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
What do i do?

371
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,000
Gut him.

372
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,900
While you were at Primatech

373
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,970
Did you come across anyone who could fly?

374
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,600
Plenty,

375
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,930
But you know that.

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,030
It's in the files.

377
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
I'm guessing a few were missing.

378
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,370
The facility burned to the ground.

379
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,430
Who knows what was lost?

380
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,170
That must have been tough for you.

381
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,670
20 years on the job.

382
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm sure you've been close to the Petrelli family.

383
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,830
The Petrellis were never exactly

384
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,170
A warm and fuzzy bunch.

385
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,770
You adopted the senator's daughter.

386
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,300
I didn't know she was his at the time,

387
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,670
And neither did he, for that matter.

388
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,330
We both know Nathan Petrelli is hiding something.

389
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,070
You know what question you should be asking yourself?

390
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,630
"Who would want to save Peter?"

391
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,600
His mother? Angela?

392
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,000
You wanna know what's missing from the files?

393
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,230
Who can fly?

394
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,700
She'd never betray her own son.

395
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,830
A long time ago, I gave up trying to figure out

396
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,970
What Angela Petrelli would or wouldn't do.

397
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,700
Go ahead.

398
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,930
We've got a problem.

399
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,770
Nathan's made a power play against Danko.

400
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,300
He's stirred up a hornet's nest.

401
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,600
It's nice to know a mother still has some influence

402
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,700
Over her son.

403
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,030
Things will be better for us with Danko gone.

404
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,730
Of course they will, but Nathan's on thin ice.

405
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,530
He's moving too fast, and Danko's unpredictable.

406
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,270
The man nearly killed Peter.

407
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,470
It had to be done.

408
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,670
Be prepared then,

409
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,330
'Cause I pointed him in your direction.

410
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,430
Be careful. He does his homework.

411
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,330
So do I.

412
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,770
Homework.

413
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,330
Thank you.

414
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,100
See you tomorrow.

415
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,800
- See you Claire. - Bye.

416
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,700
Claire.

417
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,700
You all right? Everything okay at home?

418
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,800
Yeah. That's not what this is about.

419
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,670
I have a question,

420
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,000
And I really need you to answer it.

421
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,370
Okay.

422
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,070
How did you lead two lives for all that time?

423
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,470
I can't always be myself,

424
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,200
And I just don't know who I'm supposed to be.

425
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,500
Honestly, Claire,

426
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm the worst person to ask.

427
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,470
So how am I supposed to decide which path to take?

428
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,570
Which answer do you want?

429
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,700
Do you want the one

430
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,000
That's gonna make you feel better,

431
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,770
Or do you want the truth?

432
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,370
I don't know.

433
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,170
Well, then my answer is "neither do I."

434
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,430
Thanks.

435
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,170
I miss you, Claire bear.


437
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,130
Doyle! Freeze!

438
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,900
Put your hands over your head.

439
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,670
Whatever you say.

440
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,270
When are you gonna learn?

441
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,930
I have this effect on women.

442
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,770
Doyle, I'm giving you a chance to surrender.

443
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,770
I should kill you...

444
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,500
But I just wanna go back to the way life was.

445
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,370
All right, Doyle.

446
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,130
Barbie?

447
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,670
Mrs. Petrelli. My name is...

448
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,330
Mr. Danko.

449
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,970
I was hoping you could help me.

450
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,330
Well, everything I know about the people you're after

451
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,070
Is in the Primatech files.

452
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,430
I'm not interested in files.

453
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,800
Elle Bishop, Hiro Nakamura, Matt Parkman,

454
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,630
All inherited abilities from their parents,

455
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,170
As did Peter and Claire.

456
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,630
Well, genetics

457
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,670
Is an extremely complex topic, Mr. Danko.

458
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,730
Did you know that two blue-eyed parents

459
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,330
Can sometimes have a brown-eyed child?

460
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,670
So Nathan...

461
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,600
Was the misfit?

462
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,400
Sometimes these things skip a generation.

463
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,200
I don't believe you.

464
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,070
I've met many men like you, Mr. Danko.

465
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,230
Our company employed dozens of them--

466
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,900
No family, nothing to hold you back.

467
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,070
You operate in the shadows,

468
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,170
Doing all the awful things other people just refuse to do.

469
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,700
It's what makes you useful.

470
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,970
And expendable.

471
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,270
Really?

472
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,970
That incident in Angola?

473
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,600
1997, I believe.

474
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,670
All those civilians lost. Tragic.

475
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,230
I'm surprised you survived, actually.

476
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,500
You're a very... resourceful woman,

477
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,030
Mrs. Petrelli.

478
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,970
A man needs a hobby,

479
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,630
Somethin' to occupy the hands,

480
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,570
To stop the mind from thinkin' so much.

481
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,600
I fix watches.

482
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,530
Watches?

483
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,800
Thought it would make my father happy.

484
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,030
How'd that work out for you?

485
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,430
You're still clinging to that need for connection, huh?

486
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,130
The only thing people are good for is disappointment.

487
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,800
Is that why you killed my mother?

488
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,000
Why you abandoned me?

489
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,700
I don't even remember.

490
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,300
Didn't matter to me.

491
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,900
So few things do.

492
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,870
Well, now what?

493
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,370
Cut the thread.

494
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,470
How'd you do that?

495
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,970
It's just an ability I picked up

496
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:22,930
From a cheerleader in California.

497
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,470
I guess not everybody gets old.

498
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,370
Not everybody dies.

499
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,100
Then you just have

500
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,400
That much longer to suffer, don't ya?

501
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,800
Get that. It needs to settle.

502
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,100
Over there on that cabinet, if you don't mind.

503
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,400
Sure.

504
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,600
What the hell are you doing?

505
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,600
It's amazing how it comes right back,

506
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,500
That desire, that hunger.

507
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:22,970
You think this is gonna stop me?

508
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,530
You think you can beat me?

509
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,870
I want that power!

510
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,400
I thought you'd given up.

511
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,840
Yeah, well, me too.

512
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,340
Then why bother? What's the point?

513
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,070
Immortality. You're my second chance.

514
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,970
At what? Killing again?

515
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,600
You said it was meaningless.

516
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,670
It was.

517
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,100
Then why make the same mistake twice?

518
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,140
Because i'll get it right this time,

519
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,940
Do more, be more,

520
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Take every challenge,

521
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,640
Fight hard, risk it all,

522
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,200
Take real power, real authority,

523
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,500
Change everything--the world,

524
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,040
Just to see if I can.

525
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,270
You can move.

526
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,540
I can.

527
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,400
You're the hunter.

528
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,600
I thought you would know

529
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,770
When someone was playing possum,

530
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,240
When the prey isn't so weak,

531
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,500
So easy.

532
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,570
Please...I need that power.

533
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,100
I don't wanna die.

534
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,770
No, no, no, of course not.

535
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,770
Of course you don't.

536
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,140
It won't kill you if I take it.

537
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,470
You'll heal. You'll be fine.

538
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,670
Yeah, but so will you.

539
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,800
No. don't...leave.

540
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,140
Like I said, I came here to kill you.

541
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,970
I got the answers I wanted.

542
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,440
Now I know exactly what I need to do.

543
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,870
Kill me.

544
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,170
Oh, you're gonna die.

545
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,970
Slowly...painfully...

546
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,540
And alone with your sickness.

547
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,840
Please...

548
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,400
Don't.

549
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,940
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,200
You're just a small game.

551
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,370
Turns out the president

552
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,740
Didn't really need that much proof after all.

553
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,770
It's a signed document. You're finished.

554
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,340
You lose me, you lose the whole team.

555
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,100
Well, that's a risk i'm prepared to take.

556
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,900
In fact, anyone who's not on board

557
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,970
Can step out now.

558
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,240
You're hitting reset on the whole operation

559
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,970
Just because of me?

560
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,370
Well, I think it's time things were done correctly.

561
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,700
You may have friends now, Petrelli,

562
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,670
But one day you're gonna find yourself all alone.

563
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,000
You went to the president?

564
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,740
Mm-hmm, and he is eager

565
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,000
To meet danko's replacement.

566
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,870
You comin'?

567
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,470
They say you're the man with the plan.

568
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,170
I sure hope you have something good

569
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,640
To share with the president.

570
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,870
It's a bit unorthodox, but it's tested.

571
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,800
Look, it's over.

572
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,240
Just let it go.

573
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,670
When are you gonna understand?

574
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:17,100
Bureaucracy, oversight, rules of conduct,

575
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,440
None of it applies in my world.

576
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,200
I don't know what your world is,

577
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,840
But it ought to be shut down.

578
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,640
Danko, take it easy.

579
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,340
I've seen what these people can do,

580
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,270
And it scares me.

581
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,940
And the thing about you, senator,

582
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,300
Is that through all this,

583
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:43,000
You've never once shown an ounce of fear,

584
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,300
And I wonder...

585
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,040
Why is that?

586
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,770
I don't have time for this.

587
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,800
Tell me you know about this.

588
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,630
This is it-- your new identity,

589
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,000
Everything you need to start over.

590
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,470
Rebel's erased any trace of Eric Doyle.

591
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,570
You saw me spare that agent's life.

592
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,800
Is that it?

593
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,900
Have I earned your help?

594
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,930
This isn't about you.

595
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,470
This is about me,

596
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,400
About who i need to be right now,

597
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,470
And i don't...

598
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,070
Just take it.

599
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,600
Thanks, barbie.

600
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,570
Did you mean all that stuff you said

601
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,130
About how you'd changed?

602
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,500
Hiro & Ando, Los Angeles, California

603
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You sure this is the place?

604
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,000
63 Varna Avenue

605
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Doesn't look like anyone needs to be saved.

606
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,000
Looks can be deceiving, my friend.

607
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Somewhere inside this house, Matt Parkman...

608
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,700
could be in mortal danger.

609
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,370
Finally.

610
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,700
I quit, and it takes the service

611
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,670
Two hours to find a replacement?

612
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,170
Well, don't just stand there.

613
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,270
Come in. I'm desperate.

614
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,530
Excuse me, please.

615
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,330
We are looking for Matt Parkman.

616
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,530
No duh.

617
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,030
Anyway, he's a mess.

618
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,800
Matt Parkman's a mess?

619
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,870
Here you go.

620
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,070
Diaper's clean, but that won't hold.

621
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,600
Take it.

622
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,930
Take it.

623
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,270
No, thank you.

624
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,070
Now.

625
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,930
W--hey, wait.

626
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,670
We are here to save matt parkman.

627
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,970
Uh-huh. You're holding him.

628
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,170
Matt parkman?

629
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,300
Lots of luck. You're gonna need it.

630
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,070
And by the way,

631
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,970
This baby sitting service bites.

632
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,630
Generations unfold--

633
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,930
Father to son, mother to daughter.

634
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,870
Where one leaves off, the other follows,

635
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,470
Destined to repeat each other's mistakes,

636
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,870
Rebel: Your free pass is up. Agents are coming.

637
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,870
Each other's triumphs.

638
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,830
For how do we see the world

639
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,830
If not through their lens?

640
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,670
The same fears, the same desires?

641
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,230
Do we see them as an example to follow,

642
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,200
Or as a warning of what to avoid?

643
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,470
Choosing to live as they have

644
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,930
Simply because it's what we know,

645
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,130
Or driven to create one's own identity?

646
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,470
And what happens when we find them

647
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,370
To be a disappointment?

648
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,900
Can we replace them?

649
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,170
Our mothers, our fathers?

650
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,130
Or will destiny find a way to drive us back?

651
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,170
Back to the familiar comforts of home?

652
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
To be continued...
