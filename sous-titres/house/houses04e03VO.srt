1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,394
It's cold.

2
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:27,960
Good. Thank you.

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,440
There's a new girl at
the ice cream store.

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,720
She doesn't seem too fond
of buttoning her top button.

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,700
Let's go check her out.

00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:48,780
Season 4 - Episode 3
"97 Seconds"

9
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,990
What are we supposed to
be doing... It's almost 4:00.

10
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,580
You got somewhere to be?

11
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:07,490
We know he likes to manipulate
people. He's probably testing us.

12
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:09,308
To find out what?

13
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,125
How long we can look stupid for?

14
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:17,477
He said he'd be here by 3:00.
He's obviously not coming.

15
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,537
- I'm going home.
- Nobody follow her.

16
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,011
She pied pipered nine people
right out of a job last week.

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Would you mind holding
my metaphor for a second?

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,800
New patient.
37 year-old male.

19
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:37,016
Suffers from severe
ascending muscle weakness.

20
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:39,099
- Why are you late?
- To see who'd put up with it.

21
00:02:39,122 --> 00:02:40,780
So if we left, we would have been fired?

22
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:44,890
I was gonna fire whoever stuck around.
But since everyone stuck around...

23
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:52,460
28% curvature of the spine has
caused reduced lung capacity,

24
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:54,400
and has reduced bone mineral density.

25
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,350
Patient has spinal muscular atrophy.

26
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:59,450
It's genetic, incurable.

27
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,350
This is not a diagnostic mystery.

28
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:03,855
You have just given
state secrets to the enemy.

29
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:04,784
What enemy?

30
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,898
New patient. New rules. Today you're
gonna split yourselves into two teams.

31
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:12,086
First to figure out what's threatening
to deprive the patient of the 20

32
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:14,530
or so miserable years
he's got left with SMA,

33
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,570
gets to keep their jobs.

34
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,999
Take off your numbers. You look stupid.
And I think I know who you are by now.

35
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,943
Wait.
How do you want us to split up?

36
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:25,480
Good question, overly
excited former foster kid.

37
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:28,820
There's ten of you. I'm thinking
six against six. No, wait.

38
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:33,250
- How about women versus men?
- Excellent suggestion, fat twin.

39
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,888
More interesting than evens versus
odds, less interesting

40
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,946
than shirts against skins.

41
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,249
If your sex organs dangle,
you're the confederates.

42
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:44,353
If your sex organs are aesthetically
pleasing, you're the yanks.

43
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:47,620
Dr. House... I'd like
to be on the men's team.

44
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:50,578
Do your sex organs
dangle, cutthroat bitch?

45
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:51,671
Not yet.

46
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:54,809
You've never hired more than
one female in your team before.

47
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:56,713
If you're going
to purge an entire gender,

48
00:03:56,797 --> 00:04:00,065
- it isn't going to be the danglers.
- Sounds logical.

49
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:02,662
If you don't think about it
for more than three seconds.

50
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:05,256
But I just told you that if
the danglers lose, they're out.

51
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,613
So I can only assume,
you're hiding the real reason.

52
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:10,670
You don't think the women will be
aggressive enough, or be good enough at

53
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:13,545
- science, they'll be too emotional.
- Can I switch teams?

54
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,899
If the danglers are okay, I'm okay.

55
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:18,505
We're not okay.

56
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,129
I get it. You don't like me because

57
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:22,783
- maybe I'm a little bit competitive.
- Manipulative.

58
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:24,670
Cutthroat bitch is your official title.

59
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,150
It's a game. You can either
play for fun or play to win.

60
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,864
If you want to win, you want cutthroat.

61
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,846
No, thank you.

62
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,800
First thing we have to do
is get inside his head.

63
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:36,086
It's not psychological.

64
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,491
I'm not talking about the
patient, I'm talking about House.

65
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,856
He's insane, but he's not irresponsible.

66
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,789
He wouldn't be playing this game,
if the didn't already know the answer.

67
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:45,553
First thing we do is
gang bang the sucker.

68
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:48,320
There's five of us.
We can run dozens of tests.

69
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,542
We don't need a theory.
We just need brute force.

70
00:04:50,572 --> 00:04:52,109
What about the assist dog?

71
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:55,335
Picks bacteria-infested things up
with its bacteria-infested mouth,

72
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,414
- hands them over to the guy and...
- It's not the dog. It wouldn't be fair.

73
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:01,015
- To who?
- Whom? The men.

74
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:03,027
House knows I used to be a vet.

75
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:05,560
If the dog's the answer,
they'd be at a handicap.

76
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:06,784
What about the dog?

77
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:09,666
Assist dogs put everything
in their mouth, money, door knobs.

78
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:10,521
Great.

79
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:11,920
That's not what I said.

80
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,741
- Why do you think a low sodium...
- I don't

81
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,870
The patient took a trip
to Thailand two weeks ago.

82
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,430
Write bigger and angle the board more
so they can see it.

83
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:19,374
This is wrong.

84
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,524
It's only wrong if they cheat off us,
and if they cheat off us, they're wrong.

85
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:24,970
They're not cheating.
One of them is moving.

86
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,455
Stop playing with your
sutures or I'll have to redo them.

87
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,230
Why do you guys keep a D cell battery
in a urine specimen cup?

88
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,291
Because we pulled it from
a patient's intestine.

89
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,765
Why would somebody swallow a battery?

90
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:42,939
Why do you assume it was swallowed?

91
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,001
Bed five needs a bag
of ringer's lactate.

92
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:47,520
It would have been worse
If he'd used a nine volt.

93
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,780
Who said it was a "he"?

94
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:52,952
False assumptions. You're good. You're
trying to get me to think like him.

95
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:56,207
And you're trying to kiss my ass.
Why are you talking to me?

96
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,880
Because House is turning
patient care into a game.

97
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:02,865
It's dangerous...
The patient's gonna suffer, maybe die.

98
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:12,961
You really need to shave.

99
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,097
See what I did there?

100
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,491
Interesting.

101
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,919
Need a crash cart in here!

102
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:42,395
I didn't do it.

103
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,808
When a person faints,
it's because they're not getting

104
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:50,050
enough blood to their brain.
The act of falling corrects the problem.

105
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:53,820
You faint again strapped into that
power chair where you can't fall...

106
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,108
You might not wake up.

107
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:56,984
Killed by an assistive device.

108
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,720
At least my death would be ironic.

109
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,229
I think when you Went to Thailand
you picked up a thread worm

110
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:03,714
called strongyloides.
They usually go up through your feet.

111
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:06,060
I didn't do a lot of
walking on the beach.

112
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:09,010
But I assume you did have
someone lay you down in the sand.

113
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:13,200
Bare back, bare legs. Increases
exposure tenfold over bare feet.

114
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,742
Two pills.

115
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,222
You'll be all better.

116
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:22,596
Can I have some water for those, please?

117
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:28,302
Hey, take a number.

118
00:07:28,318 --> 00:07:31,224
House didn't say anything about taking
turns. What's she testing him for?

119
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,065
Don't.

120
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,067
They'll spend all day
obsessing over my idea

121
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:36,232
instead of coming up
with one of their own.

122
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:39,477
- And hey, I might be wrong.
- Seriously. I'm worried that if

123
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,930
we don't know what she's giving
you there can be conflicts.

124
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,292
No, you're not. House told me
he's keeping track of all that.

125
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:48,030
Ten doctors. They should
be getting ten cures.

126
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,898
We need blood, hair, and stool.

127
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,903
You poop, and then you use the wooden
sticks to collect the fecal matter,

128
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,573
then you rub it on the green box.

129
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:58,396
Hand it to my dog. Only one of
those things I can do on my own.

130
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,790
And the last couple of days,
I haven't been doing that.

131
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:04,819
Is it all right with you if we...
Carry you into the bathroom?

132
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:07,890
If you want me there, that's the
way you're gonna have to do it.

133
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:18,743
Ready?

134
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:20,406
One, two, three.

135
00:08:20,977 --> 00:08:24,037
Can I get a little head
support, please? Thank you.

136
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:43,825
Why are you here?

137
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:46,749
My offices are being used by my teams.

138
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:49,717
Teams?

139
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:52,149
Which means this is the only
place where you can yell at me.

140
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,650
You have teams?

141
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:56,130
Two of them. I wanted to
deal with the yelling today,

142
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,777
because I noticed what you were wearing

143
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,813
and I wouldn't have to listen
all that closely.

144
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,021
You can't make a competition
out of patient care.

145
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:06,059
Without competition, we'd
still be single-cell organisms.

146
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,310
- Can I go now?
- Not until after the yelling.

147
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:10,339
What's wrong with him?

148
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:13,653
I have seven of the finest minds on it.
Along with three very special...

149
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,876
You wouldn't be doing
this, unless you already knew...

150
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,650
I tell you, you tell them.
Game's over.

151
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,991
If you know, you are obligated to treat.

152
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:22,159
Well, then in that case, I don't know.

153
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,616
Why would a guy...

154
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:29,609
Voluntarily shove a metal
object into an electrical socket?

155
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:32,492
I'm getting closer and
closer to knowing the answer.

156
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,519
What would happen if
I shut down this game?

157
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:38,583
I'd fire them all,
hire 40 new fellowship applicants,

158
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:40,315
start the game All over again.

159
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:43,199
You do know what's
wrong with him, right?

160
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:46,159
It'd be pretty irresponsible
If I didn't, wouldn't it?

161
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,549
Antibiotics aren't working.

162
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,013
Legionella could explain
the lungs, the fever...

163
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,422
If she had legionella,
she'd have low sodium.

164
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:59,628
What can you tell me about her?

165
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,075
She likes body surfing.

166
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:03,415
Maybe picked up a virus
swimming off Jones beach.

167
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:06,229
But she doesn't even have the energy
to finish her crossword anymore.

168
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,218
- Her boyfriend said...
- That's it.

169
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:10,136
- What is?
- Blurry vision.

170
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,827
How do you get blurry vision from...

171
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:15,492
You don't stop a daily ritual that
cures boredom because you're bored.

172
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,032
She stopped doing her crossword puzzle

173
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:18,837
because she's having
a hard time reading it.

174
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:21,534
What causes fever,
boggy lungs and blurry vision?

175
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,535
Fungal.

176
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:26,306
Aspergillus would explain
the pneumonia, which explains the fever.

177
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,153
Start her on amphotericin.

178
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:30,936
Hey, guys?

179
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:32,287
Great job.

180
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:43,629
If you're gonna try
to take yourself out,

181
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:48,610
why choose electricity?
You eat a bullet, jump off a building...

182
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,860
I love the team thing, by the way.

183
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,540
Bury yourself alive in Cuddy's cleavage.

184
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,935
Teamwork, collaboration,
all for the greater good.

185
00:10:57,007 --> 00:11:01,111
It could have been a suicidal gesture,
as opposed to an actual attempt.

186
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,415
Interestingly,

187
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:07,258
the rain in Spain doesn't actually fall
in the plain all that much.

188
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:12,250
But who puts their internal organs
on a skillet just to get attention?

189
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,488
Go ask him.

190
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:17,407
That would be cheating.

191
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,409
- Got a diagnosis yet?
- Get out of here.

192
00:11:23,498 --> 00:11:25,854
- Got a stool sample yet?
- How could you know?

193
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:29,070
I talked to a nurse.
Pretty brilliant, huh?

194
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:30,938
I give you a move House
will love, straight

195
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:32,374
from one of his former fellows,

196
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,729
- and you let me join your team.
- You're too late.

197
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:36,088
We already have our diagnosis.

198
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:38,506
He's lying because he wants
you to go away.

199
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,360
So do I.

200
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,053
How do we know you're not
a double agent?

201
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:44,449
To find out what we're thinking,
then go back to the women?

202
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,169
Because I don't care
What you're thinking.

203
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:49,031
You wanna know why I want to be
on your team? Because you're idiots.

204
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:51,660
If I can get the women out
of the competition, I'm in.

205
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:53,319
And so are two of you.

206
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,024
So... What's the big move?

207
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:11,670
It's called xenodiagnosis.
We let this bugs bite you,

208
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,658
and then we test their
feces for parasites.

209
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,513
Why can't you test my feces?

210
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,142
Because you've been chugging milk
of magnesia for the past hour.

211
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,402
You have a lot going in
and nothing coming out.

212
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:24,128
Testing the bugs'feces is actually
more accurate than testing yours.

213
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:26,973
Smaller haystack,
easier to find the needle.

214
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:31,892
You okay?

215
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,459
Get the bugs off.

216
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,022
- Get the bugs off him!
- Test isn't done.

217
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:40,303
He's choking!

218
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:51,793
Patchy infiltrates on the X-Ray.

219
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:55,687
Patient improved with chest PT
and oxygen, consistent with aspiration.

220
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,052
So now we have another
symptom to explain.

221
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:01,707
Why does his throat think
his lungs are his stomach?

222
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:07,415
- And why are your throats closing up?
- Shouldn't we be In separate rooms?

223
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:10,251
You think I'm gonna run two
differentials this time in the morning?

224
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,588
- Grumpy, you're first.
- I'm not grumpy.

225
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,143
Why would I call
you that if you weren't?

226
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:17,105
It's an unusual combination.

227
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:19,414
Unusual equals exotic,
equals foreign.

228
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:21,269
Has to be connected to
his trip to Thailand.

229
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,854
You practice medicine overseas?

230
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:25,190
I was with doctors without
borders for eight years.

231
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:27,339
It's in my file.

232
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,872
David Blaine hides the six of hearts
in a beer bottle, it's still impressive.

233
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,350
- You like exotic. Why are you here?
- I want this job.

234
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,430
- Parents sick?
- No. I...

235
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,580
- I just...
- This is not the job you want.

236
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:41,400
This is the job in the zip
code you want. You engaged?

237
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,626
Yes.

238
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:46,230
Am I not allowed to grow up
and change my priorities?

239
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,655
You're allowed to,
people usually don't.

240
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:52,370
This is not a new symptom.
Our patient has spinal muscular atrophy.

241
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:55,465
He has documented trouble swallowing.
The choking's not new.

242
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:57,880
So it's nothing's new.
What caused the old?

243
00:13:57,912 --> 00:14:00,215
Strongyloides worms
explain the fainting.

244
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,537
- We already treated...
- So he's all better, woman... Who...

245
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,926
- Thirteen.
- Hasn't got any worse.

246
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,890
It's a pretty passive approach
for the daughter of an alcoholic.

247
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:10,000
Wrong again.

248
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,750
We could stress his system.
Put him on a tilt table.

249
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:15,998
If he stays conscious, means we made
the right diagnosis, and we win.

250
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,695
Then why haven't you?

251
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,047
Six against four.

252
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:25,561
One of the men's gonna have
to join the women's team.

253
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,138
On the other hand,
one of the men isn't an actual doctor.

254
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:31,499
So, I guess it's pretty fair.

255
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,040
Men, you're in the penalty box.

256
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:38,249
- Who's not the doctor?
- I'm glad you asked about that.

257
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,390
Reason I'm penalizing
you is time management.

258
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,244
In diagnostics, you're always
working against the clock.

259
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:46,764
The women came up with a theory
and they treated the patient.

260
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,253
You guys just sat around in a lab,

261
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:51,021
hoping a series of blind tests
would give you a theory.

262
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,965
You wasted the patient's time.

263
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,225
Now I'm gonna waste yours.

264
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,970
- Her gums are turning yellow.
- Whatever it is, it's in her liver now.

265
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:01,760
Fungal fit perfectly.

266
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,195
We were wrong.

267
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:06,267
We're gonna keep being wrong,
until we're right.

268
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,700
Or till she dies.

269
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,810
Yeah, that was very helpful.

270
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:12,542
Need a team to tell me we're mortals.

271
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,292
Look, I'm sorry. You're right.

272
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:21,052
It doesn't hurt to be reminded that
we're dealing with real stakes here.

273
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:25,119
Liver failure is a bad
thing, but it's also a clue.

274
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:27,162
What does it tell us?

275
00:15:35,913 --> 00:15:39,630
I can't let you leave.
I think you're still suicidal.

276
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,557
I wasn't trying to off myself.

277
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,580
No, that's right.
You were just trying to kill a wall.

278
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,258
I check this box,

279
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,056
and your next roommates
are gonna be Jesus and crazy Mcloonybin.

280
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,045
That guy never had a chance.

281
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,272
It's gonna sound stupid.

282
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,036
Suddenly you're shy?

283
00:15:58,146 --> 00:16:00,103
You pooped your pants in front of me.

284
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,771
It's one of the nasty side effects
of dying.

285
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,073
Last saturday, I got in a car crash.

286
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:14,779
A drunk driver came over
the line and hit me head on.

287
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,365
It was like slow motion.

288
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:20,577
I saw these headlights,

289
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:22,207
and...

290
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,765
I saw...

291
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:29,308
The paramedics

292
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,558
said I was technically dead

293
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,553
for 97 seconds.

294
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,355
It was the best

295
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:42,128
97 seconds of my life.

296
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,255
Okay, here's what happened.

297
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,443
Your oxygen-deprived brain
was shutting down.

298
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,329
A flood of endorphins
and serotonin was released

299
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:58,892
and it's what gave you the visions.

300
00:16:58,932 --> 00:16:59,844
No.

301
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:02,447
Believe me.
It wasn't chemicals.

302
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,519
I've done every hallucinogenic there is.

303
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,731
This was way bigger than that.

304
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,239
There's something out there.

305
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:18,282
Something more.

306
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:22,849
Hey, can I have my knife back?

307
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,077
No.

308
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:30,430
- Who the hell isn't a doctor?
- House said we can't talk.

309
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:34,089
- He meant we can't talk about the case.
- House is just jerking us around.

310
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:36,488
- It's what he does.
- You're not curious?

311
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,620
Only one reason you wouldn't be curious.

312
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:40,325
We should talk about the case.

313
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:44,305
He's punishing us for wasting time.
Maybe we shouldn't be wasting this time.

314
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:46,405
Close that door.
You're gonna get us all fired.

315
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,050
We need to find a link between
fainting and trouble swallowing.

316
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:53,390
We need to know If it's dysphagia
or full blown achalasia.

317
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:54,707
Paraganglioma.

318
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:57,866
How would a neoplastic growth
in his abdomen explain...

319
00:17:57,904 --> 00:18:01,361
Not his abdomen, in his neck. A carotid
body tumor causes trouble swallowing.

320
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:04,707
Food presses against the vagus nerve,
and causes the fainting.

321
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,622
So, if this guy has cancer,
we get to keep our jobs?

322
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,060
- If he's healthy, we're fired?
- We need a CT to prove it.

323
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,661
We need the women not to figure
it out while we're sitting here.

324
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:15,741
And does House's computer
have a built-in microphone?

325
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:45,654
There is a potential toxicity
in the experimental treatment.

326
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,139
I was never here.

327
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,280
Blood pressure's remaining
stable through 60 degrees.

328
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:57,942
No pauses on his EKG, no nausea.

329
00:18:57,986 --> 00:18:59,616
Our treatment worked.

330
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:02,470
- I need our patient.
- Syncope's cured, Amber. It's over.

331
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:07,659
You obviously haven't stressed
the system hard enough.

332
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,480
You crank it up high enough,
anyone will pass out.

333
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,057
This is incredible.

334
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:15,870
This is the most I've moved in 40 years.

335
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,572
The tilt table test showed
that the patient's EKG,

336
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,322
BPM pulse remained normal despite...

337
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,096
Who are you, thirteen?

338
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,898
My name's in the file.

339
00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:27,724
Fact that you don't answer my questions

340
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,503
tells me more about
you Than answers could.

341
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:30,468
No, it doesn't.

342
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,093
We turned the thing up to 95 degrees...

343
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:34,137
You don't think that Non-answers
tell me anything?

344
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:37,170
Sure, just not as much as actual answers
That's why they're called Answers.

345
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:40,021
- Tells me you're hiding Something.
- Tells you I'm hiding everything.

346
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:43,770
Tells me you got something worth hiding.
Is it Turkish prison? Gay porn?

347
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:46,376
You killed a man, just because
he was asking too many questions?

348
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:48,655
- Can I finish reporting on the patient?
- No need.

349
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,915
I'll see you in an hour or so.
Got to set some stuff up.

350
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,145
Thank you all for coming...

351
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,785
To tribal council.

352
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,992
A man of your integrity
I feel I can trust.

353
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,111
Big love.

354
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,359
And I don't call you that
because you're a mormon.

355
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,330
Where's your team's sixth man?

356
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,242
She went rogue.
Broke the rules.

357
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:16,020
You also sinned. You have no
right to cast the first stone.

358
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,002
And atheists have no
right to quote scripture.

359
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,410
The rules said no talking.

360
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,440
- I told them not to talk.
- Out loud.

361
00:20:21,493 --> 00:20:23,230
We were trying to save a man's life.

362
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:24,792
Key word being "trying."

363
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:27,958
Tilt table test confirmed,
that you guys were wrong.

364
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:30,001
You're fired.

365
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:36,004
Ah, the prodigal son returneth.
You're also fired.

366
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,675
We thought there was a tumor
on the patient's esophagus.

367
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:41,035
We were right about the area,
wrong about the diagnosis.

368
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:44,414
Turns out the esophagus is just
straightening. It's sclerodma.

369
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,104
Explains the syncope and the choking.
He needs steroids.

370
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:48,854
- You did a CT scan?
- Obviously.

371
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,696
After you were already proven wrong?

372
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,209
Good for you.

373
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:54,637
It's too bad you're wrong.

374
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,271
Straightening indicates weakening,
not hardening.

375
00:20:57,351 --> 00:20:59,801
SMA explains the weakening.

376
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:02,533
Strongyloides infection
explains everything else.

377
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:06,138
You ladies have the honor to
give the patient a feeding tube,

378
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,438
discharge him,
and show up for work tomorrow.

379
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:09,639
The rest of you,

380
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,321
you're a disappointment.

381
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:14,988
You make me want to stop dangling.

382
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,453
It was the best two weeks of my life.

383
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:31,020
I think I will miss you most of all,
ridiculously old fraud.

384
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:41,724
Do you think House could be wrong?

385
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:43,921
- I thought he fired you.
- No. He fired the men.

386
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,801
- I don't think he's wrong.
- If he is, how would I prove it?

387
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,500
I just said I don't think he is.

388
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:56,285
Well, thinking isn't good enough.

389
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,204
You have to run a blood test.
For anticentromere antibodies.

390
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:01,740
Would you mind running the labs?

391
00:22:01,813 --> 00:22:03,719
- You can't.
- Well, I can, but...

392
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,282
No. I was making a statement.

393
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,048
You've been fired,

394
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:10,048
so you no longer have lab privileges.
You weren't coming here for advice,

395
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:12,339
You were coming here to con a favor
to save your job.

396
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:13,766
Sorry.

397
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:16,972
I'm not working for him anymore,
but he can still make my life miserable.

398
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,725
And you have a chance
to make his life miserable.

399
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:26,407
I'm insulted.

400
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,617
You con Cameron by,
appealing to her humanity.

401
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,071
I told her what she wanted to hear.

402
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:33,090
And you told me what you
thought I wanted to hear.

403
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:36,216
If it's any consolation, I think
your motives are more interesting.

404
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:40,185
I cannot believe he fired you.

405
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,858
Go draw his blood.

406
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:44,978
I'll meet you in the lab
when I'm done here.

407
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:53,986
Guess you didn't find your tumor.

408
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,453
The other doctors tell you
that you were fine?

409
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,523
Yeah.

410
00:22:57,902 --> 00:23:00,431
They said it was just
my disease getting worse.

411
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,501
You come to terms with this disease.

412
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,904
You know it's there.

413
00:23:09,896 --> 00:23:11,218
You know it's waiting.

414
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:12,849
And every now and again...

415
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,817
It takes something away.

416
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:18,754
Took my walking.

417
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:20,877
Took my modesty.

418
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:24,336
Now it's taking one
of my last pleasures.

419
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:27,224
Well, there's an outside shot.

420
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:30,423
That something other than the SMA's
causing your eating problems.

421
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:33,511
And if it is, we can fix it.
And remove that tube.

422
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,435
Is that my blood?

423
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:44,946
It's green.

424
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:47,350
What does that mean?

425
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:54,463
It means I'm not fired.

426
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:56,316
Is he a vulcan?

427
00:23:57,556 --> 00:24:00,328
If no, what makes nimoy bleed green?

428
00:24:00,457 --> 00:24:01,634
Are we officially unfired?

429
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,736
How do we know she didn't fake,
the green blood?

430
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:07,090
Because that would be stupid.
And while she may be manipulative,

431
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,860
- Borderline evil, shallow...
- They get it.

432
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:11,008
I'm not stupid.

433
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,080
What contrast did you use for the CT?

434
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,859
- ICM.
- His kidneys aren't working.

435
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:18,499
They didn't filter the contrast,
wich in ICM is green.

436
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:21,027
10 points.

437
00:24:21,064 --> 00:24:23,447
Let's add kidney failure
to our list of symptoms.

438
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:26,032
- What are these points?
- That how you're deciding who to fire?

439
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,663
I'm gonna fire the next person
who asks me who i'm going to fire.

440
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:29,902
Now we're on the point system?

441
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:32,189
- What happened to men against women?
- Forget the game.

442
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:35,057
- What do you mean forget the game?
- I mean forget the damn game!

443
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:37,874
The guy's kidneys are failing.
We need to diagnose exactly...

444
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,090
I thought we were diagnosing.
You were diagnosing. Now I am too.

445
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:44,590
I thought that thirteen,
was right about the strongyloides.

446
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,247
I was obviously wrong.

447
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:50,195
Okay, kidney failure,
aspiration, fainting, go.

448
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,946
Kidney failure could be the result,
of a gram negative bacteria.

449
00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:54,765
Our patient wears a catheter full time.

450
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:56,983
It virtually guarantees,
bacterial infection.

451
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,199
Which could have migrated
up to his kidneys.

452
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:03,047
Infection stresses his already weakened
system, makes his SMA worse.

453
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:05,071
That explains the choking and fainting.

454
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,647
Put him on an IV AMP and gent.

455
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:08,827
Our team's scleroderma
diagnosis still holds.

456
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:11,857
Tests could have been negative because
the blood was tainted with contrast.

457
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:13,249
Do a skin biopsy.

458
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,379
Get a side of lymph node to confirm.

459
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:23,720
I could have you fired.

460
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,299
- You already had me fired.
- Just proves than I can.

461
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:28,726
And were the men wrong?

462
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,390
- No, It doesn't change the fact...
- Why are you yelling at me?

463
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:34,597
Because performing tests for someone
who is not a doctor in this hospital...

464
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:36,187
You're frustrated. You want help?

465
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,159
I'm here.
If you just need to vent,

466
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:39,722
leave a message.

467
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:43,994
I like him better like this.

468
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:45,407
You?

469
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,409
Patient developed pneumonia.
His lungs are filling fast.

470
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:52,600
We started him on antibiotics.
Nothing.

471
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,394
- We were wrong.
- And you're here to say?

472
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:56,590
We were wrong too.
He doesn't have scleroderma.

473
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,630
Biopsy revealed no fibrotic changes.

474
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:00,632
Cervical lymph node has black flecks.

475
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,664
Small areas of necrosis. It's nothing.

476
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:04,709
You say nothing.
I say cancer.

477
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:07,294
It's a bit of a stretch
to jump right to cancer.

478
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:10,067
I'm not jumping. Broad specs
haven't worked, so it's not bacterial.

479
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:12,777
Failing liver despite treatment,
suggests it's not fungal.

480
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:16,751
And her high lactic acidosis points
towards anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

481
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,654
Also suggests Infection,

482
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:20,622
which is a lot easier
and safer to treat.

483
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:22,576
Large cell lymphoma
is incredibly aggressive.

484
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:24,739
She'll be dead in a week
if we follow the textbooks.

485
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:28,135
Unless it's infection, in which case you
radiate her and she'll be dead in a day.

486
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:30,532
I know you have some
experience with that.

487
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,853
I've seen doctors do this before.
Go back to the scene of the crime.

488
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,557
If you're right this time,
you purge yourself of past ghosts.

489
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,639
I know it's contrary to protocol,
but I think it's more likely...

490
00:26:41,678 --> 00:26:43,525
Ghosts are there for a reason.

491
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:46,548
So you don't make
the same mistake twice.

492
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,925
Switch over to third generation
cephalosporin.

493
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:57,747
You want to remove his eye?

494
00:26:58,626 --> 00:26:59,639
Who told you?

495
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,120
You booked the OR.

496
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:02,127
Good.

497
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,500
You can't beat me in a foot race.

498
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:06,919
I thought we were dancing.

499
00:27:09,037 --> 00:27:12,796
Cervical lymph node is a garbage dump.
Very small one.

500
00:27:12,857 --> 00:27:15,090
Just one truck comes in and
only comes from one home.

501
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:16,879
Al Gore would be appalled.
The home...

502
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:18,844
The home is the right eye.
I get it.

503
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:22,160
- Do a biopsy.
- On my way.

504
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:26,290
You're not doing a biopsy.
You ordered an orbital exenteration.

505
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:29,266
Right. Because I don't want to remove
a little tiny piece, sit in the lab

506
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:32,248
and confirm what I already know, while
my patient drowns in his own fluid.

507
00:27:32,335 --> 00:27:34,690
But if you want me to,
I absolutely will.

508
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:36,954
How advanced is the pneumonia?

509
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,710
It's taking college courses.

510
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:42,542
Hey, Wilson,
I'm gonna cut some cripple's eye out.

511
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,009
Wanna come watch?

512
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,102
Good times.

513
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:48,487
We good to go?

514
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:01,780
I thought melanoma,
was skin cancer.

515
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:05,290
Technically it's cancer
of the pigment cells.

516
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,855
The same cells that give
your iris it's color.

517
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:09,527
Cancer?

518
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:13,291
Why not?
What else can God throw at me?

519
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:16,984
Hail, locusts,
smiting of the first born.

520
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:19,135
Of course it all depends
on how evil you've been.

521
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,173
House...

522
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,472
If it's cancer,
it's spread everywhere, right?

523
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:27,684
So it's in my lungs,
my kidneys?

524
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:31,509
There is a chance by removing the eye,
get the primary tumor,

525
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,356
and three courses of radiation.

526
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:36,038
- That could...
- Could... what?

527
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,001
Few months?
Years?

528
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:41,082
More likely months.

529
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:45,681
Any of your other doctors,
have any cheerier diagnoses?

530
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,904
If they do, they're wrong.
This is the answer.

531
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:49,343
It's the only way to help you.

532
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,640
I already can't walk.

533
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:52,907
I can't eat.

534
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:57,698
You're telling me that
the rest of my life.

535
00:28:58,613 --> 00:28:59,897
Is in this bed,

536
00:29:00,843 --> 00:29:02,322
puking and in pain?

537
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:04,338
We can manage the pain.

538
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,752
I'd rather just get this over with.

539
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:12,560
I've been trapped in this useless body,

540
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,171
long enough.

541
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:18,780
It'd be nice to finally get out.

542
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,307
Get out and go where?

543
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,302
You think you're gonna sprout wings,
and start.

544
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:26,537
Flying around with the other angels?
Don't be an idiot.

545
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,644
There is no after, there's just this.

546
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,707
House!

547
00:29:41,316 --> 00:29:44,191
You can't let a dying man
take solace in his beliefs?

548
00:29:44,268 --> 00:29:46,790
- His beliefs are stupid.
- Everybody lies.

549
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:48,259
Some for good reason, some for bad,

550
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,211
this would have been
a fantastic reason to lie.

551
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:51,736
Hi, Greg House.

552
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:54,999
Why can't you just let him
have his fairy tale?

553
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,990
If it gives him comfort
to imagine beaches,

554
00:29:57,037 --> 00:29:59,435
and loved ones,
and life outside a wheel chair...

555
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,053
Are there 72 virgins too?

556
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:02,166
It's over.

557
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:04,437
He's got days,
maybe hours left.

558
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,499
What pain does it cause you if he spends
that time with a peaceful smile?

559
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:09,969
What sick pleasure do you
get in making damn sure

560
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,490
he's filled with fear and dread?

561
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,210
He shouldn't be making,
a decision based on a lie.

562
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,882
Misery's better than nothing.

563
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,584
You don't know there's nothing.
You haven't been there.

564
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:20,290
God, I am tired of that argument.

565
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,801
I don't have to go to detroit,
to know that it smells.

566
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:26,090
Yes, Detroit,
the afterlife. Same thing.

567
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:04,490
You're not getting enough oxygen,

568
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:06,831
so we're inserting a tube
directly into your lungs.

569
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,060
It should help us drain,
some of this excess fluid.

570
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,045
It should make you a
little more comfortable.

571
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:17,978
Sats are still dropping.

572
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:22,209
Fluid's clear, if this was cancer,
there should be blood.

573
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,566
Call House.

574
00:32:26,062 --> 00:32:27,335
He just paged me.

575
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:36,847
Doctor House!

576
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,304
Maybe it was...

577
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:53,404
Just an accident.

578
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:55,115
It wasn't an accident.

579
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:58,199
You think his nihilism got the best
of him? He tried to kill himself?

580
00:32:58,271 --> 00:32:59,891
- He paged me.
- Paged you?

581
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:00,932
Why you?

582
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,029
- I assume because...
- Don't assume anything.

583
00:33:04,128 --> 00:33:05,632
Don't fall into that trap.

584
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,506
Is he okay?

585
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:10,491
Burned his hand pretty good.

586
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:12,425
His heart stopped for nearly a minute.

587
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:15,426
Your cohort managed to restart it.

588
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,921
But he...

589
00:33:17,257 --> 00:33:19,004
Has not regained consciousness.

590
00:33:20,978 --> 00:33:21,865
So...

591
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,274
Since I have you all here, we should
probably talk about your actual patient.

592
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:29,392
Clear fluid from the lungs indicates,
that it's probably not cancer.

593
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:33,304
So it would be nice if we could
come up with a new idea.

594
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:43,519
You're an idiot.

595
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,417
- You nearly killed yourself.
- That was the whole idea.

596
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:49,503
- You wanted to kill yourself?
- I wanted to nearly kill myself.

597
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:51,464
Is he... Better?

598
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:53,422
No.
But he doesn't have cancer.

599
00:33:53,474 --> 00:33:55,404
We think it might be
eosinophilic pneumonia.

600
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:58,356
Maybe you didn't wanna die,
but you didn't care if you lived.

601
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,949
You insisted that I needed,
to see for myself.

602
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,168
- Was he discharged?
- No. He's dying.

603
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:08,607
You've already had two near
death experiences.

604
00:34:08,703 --> 00:34:09,995
Not that guy.

605
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,040
The guy in the car accident,

606
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:13,468
the knife.

607
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,670
I... I need to talk to him.

608
00:34:17,602 --> 00:34:19,647
He, died almost an hour ago.

609
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:23,131
Apparently it's bad
to electrocute yourself.

610
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:26,102
Within days,
of suffering massive internal injuries.

611
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,443
Why did you need to talk to him?

612
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:32,836
Did you see something?

613
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,217
Eosinophilic pneumonia.

614
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,317
House?
What did you see?

615
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:40,067
Nothing.
Whose idea was that?

616
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:41,772
Brennan.

617
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,628
Nothing you don't want to talk
about it, or nothing...

618
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:47,990
Which one is brennan?
Is he the ridiculously old guy?

619
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:49,755
House, you got to talk about this.

620
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:51,589
If it's aggressive enough,

621
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,384
might have gotten past the steroids.

622
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:56,432
Start him on cyclophosamide.

623
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,650
I already did.

624
00:34:58,061 --> 00:34:59,643
Just looking at you hurts.

625
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:03,028
I'm gonna order up some extra pain meds.

626
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:05,350
I love you.

627
00:35:10,397 --> 00:35:13,600
How fast will this work?

628
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:16,490
New meds should start helping
in minutes, okay? Hang in there.

629
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,945
Vacutainer's full.
I need to replace it.

630
00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:21,664
I don't...
I don't think...

631
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,292
- It's working.
- Try and relax.

632
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:30,118
You must...
You must be wrong.

633
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,647
Stop talking.

634
00:35:32,203 --> 00:35:34,113
Hurry up and get that chest
tube working.

635
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:36,451
Okay, I got it.

636
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,015
Could you get...

637
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:39,899
Hoover?

638
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:01,749
I can't...

639
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:03,461
Can you...

640
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:06,887
Put my hand...

641
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:09,827
On his head?

642
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:18,099
It's okay.
Don't worry.

643
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:21,704
I'm not scared.

644
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:38,241
Oh, God.

645
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,427
Time of death?

646
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:04,438
You're looking better.

647
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,788
Stark's dead.

648
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:15,323
What are you doing?

649
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,551
Going to see our patient.

650
00:37:18,055 --> 00:37:19,058
He's dead.

651
00:37:19,234 --> 00:37:21,274
Dead is not a diagnosis.

652
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:24,223
- You really shouldn't be...
- Shut up and give me my cane.

653
00:37:26,927 --> 00:37:28,490
I assume we're all fired.

654
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,440
Should I fire myself too?

655
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:34,231
I thought it was strongyloides,
then I thought it was cancer.

656
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,257
- A little help here.
- Ready? One, two...

657
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:44,477
Why did you call me?

658
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,590
Because if I pooped myself in front of
Wilson, I'd never hear the end of it.

659
00:37:48,615 --> 00:37:51,810
- But why not one of the others?
- Always have that phone in your hand.

660
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,238
We all have cell phones.
That's not the reason. What is?

661
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:56,849
If I died, you'd never get the job.

662
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,601
I knew you wouldn't let that happen.

663
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:01,029
You don't think anybody else
has any reason to care?

664
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:03,907
Think this is starting to come back
to me. It's right, left,

665
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,012
then repeat.

666
00:38:06,357 --> 00:38:07,649
Yeah, that works.

667
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:14,076
- What did we miss?
- If we knew, he wouldn't be dead.

668
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:16,381
That's it?
You're just gonna give up?

669
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:19,023
No, we were defeated.
It's over.

670
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:22,532
Patient presented with syncope.

671
00:38:22,622 --> 00:38:25,110
We thought it was thread worms,
gave him ivermectin.

672
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:26,369
Thank you.

673
00:38:27,286 --> 00:38:28,560
He seemed

674
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:31,269
better, till his blood turned green.

675
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,835
Can we at least remove the body
before launching into a purely

676
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,390
academic exercise?

677
00:38:35,444 --> 00:38:38,531
Patient didn't respond
to antibiotics or steroids.

678
00:38:38,647 --> 00:38:39,669
You okay, boy?

679
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:41,062
What's wrong with the dog?

680
00:38:50,558 --> 00:38:51,581
He's dead.

681
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:56,090
There are only a handful of viruses.
That can cross between dogs and humans,

682
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:58,061
but they may not be connected at all.

683
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,690
The dog was old. I've seen it before.
They hang on way past their normal life

684
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:03,653
expectancy to take
care of their masters.

685
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:05,445
Did you watch him take the pills?

686
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,044
The ivermectin.

687
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:12,092
Did you watch the patient,
put them in his mouth and swallow them?

688
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:14,005
I don't know.
I think so.

689
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:16,239
- What kind of dog is that?
- English Shepherd.

690
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,572
- It's in the collie family, right?
- Not really.

691
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,960
- They share the MDR one gene.
- Yeah.

692
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:25,032
What happens when you give a dog
with the MDR one gene Ivermectin?

693
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:28,137
They don't... I mean,
it's used to treat heartworms in most

694
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:30,244
dogs, but it'd be fatal if the...

695
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:40,088
Look familiar?

696
00:39:41,143 --> 00:39:42,664
I think the last time you saw it,

697
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:44,882
It didn't have that dead dog's
teeth marks on it.

698
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:47,356
I just put it on the bed tray
to get him some water.

699
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,505
When I asked you,

700
00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:52,209
if you watched the patient swallow
the pills, the right answer was "no."

701
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:57,070
Take his body down to the morgue.

702
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:13,968
If you hadn't treated this patient
as a game, he wouldn't be dead.

703
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,670
I'm feeling much better, thank you.

704
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:18,044
I'm supposed to show you sympathy?

705
00:40:19,235 --> 00:40:22,999
He died, while his attending
was lying on a hospital bed,

706
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,638
because he stuck a knife,
in a wall socket.

707
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,280
He died,
because a doctor made a mistake.

708
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:31,277
- She was an idiot.
- You employed her.

709
00:40:32,522 --> 00:40:33,777
You're responsible.

710
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:48,300
Doctor Foreman.

711
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,304
How's she doing?

712
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:54,635
Fever's gone.

713
00:40:54,714 --> 00:40:57,511
AST and ALT are back
within normal range.

714
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,625
She should be out of here in a few days.

715
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,669
Gutsy call.

716
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:02,819
Thanks.

717
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:04,146
It wasn't a compliment.

718
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:06,667
If you were wrong,
she'd be dead.

719
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:09,070
- I was sure...
- No, you weren't. You couldn't be.

720
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:11,159
There's a reason we have rules.

721
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:13,590
If every doctor did whatever
his gut told him was right,

722
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:15,611
We'd have a lot more
dead bodies to deal with.

723
00:41:16,915 --> 00:41:18,324
It won't happen again.

724
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:19,827
Yes, it will.

725
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:22,668
Because you confuse saving,
her life with doing the right thing.

726
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,104
I'm sorry Dr. Foreman, you're fired.

727
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:51,525
As soon as the pathologist cut
into the lungs, we saw the threadworms.

728
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:58,832
You think it's fair that I fired all,
the other members of your team,

729
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:01,529
When you guys actually came
up with the right diagnosis?

730
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:06,241
I keep replaying it in my mind.

731
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,473
Did I drop the pills when
I put them on the bed tray?

732
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:12,657
Did I, knock them over
when I turned to leave?

733
00:42:14,787 --> 00:42:16,234
You know he'd be alive.

734
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,791
- His dog would be alive.
- I know.

735
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,182
You forced us to act,

736
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:25,938
- on a false assumption.
- I know.

737
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,363
Everything we built from that step on...

738
00:42:29,265 --> 00:42:31,396
Every test,
every theory, every treatment...

739
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:34,225
I know. Forget the lecturey.
And fire me already.

740
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,112
If I was gonna fire you.

741
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,431
I wouldn't be giving you the lecture.

742
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,984
I know you're not gonna let anything,
like this ever happen again.

743
00:42:52,426 --> 00:42:53,757
I'll see you tomorrow.

744
00:43:05,705 --> 00:43:07,460
I'm sorry to say,

745
00:43:08,947 --> 00:43:10,201
"I told you so."
