1
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,144
The car's full of gas.

2
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:22,761
You sure?

3
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,012
And if I'm not?

4
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,860
You'll be paying me back
for those damn invitations.

5
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,176
Then never mind.

6
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:32,412
Ted is a wonderful man, Dad.

7
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:34,825
He's the second greatest guy
I ever met.

8
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:40,503
Guess that's us.

9
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:11,654
Into this holy estate,

10
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,525
these two persons present
now come to be joined.

11
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,659
And so if any person
may show just cause

12
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:18,702
why they may not be joined together,

13
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:21,497
let them speak now or forever
hold their peace.

14
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:24,875
That's what I like to hear.

15
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:29,380
Do you, Theodore Philip Taylor,
take Nicole Margaret Murray

16
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,800
to be your wife
and promise before God

17
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,163
and these witnesses

18
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:36,220
to be her loving
and faithful husband,

19
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,762
in plenty and in want,

20
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,349
in joy and in sorrow
in sickness and in health,

21
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,393
so long as you both shall live?

22
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:50,977
This isn't funny, Ted.

23
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:54,724
Are you all right?

24
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,102
.:: La Fabrique ::.

25
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:10,337
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

26
00:02:57,952 --> 00:02:59,252
What time is it?

27
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,305
Happy time.

28
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:05,198
I'm still asleep.

29
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:08,383
Just think of this as a dream.

30
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,410
What about House?

31
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:15,955
- I said a dream, not a nightmare.
- He's in the next room.

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,230
Sound asleep.

33
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:02,783
- I met the neighbors.
- Sir, do you know this man?

34
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:09,335
I don't need a temporary.
I need a permanent.

35
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,028
Yesterday.

36
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:14,655
Please do.

37
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:18,173
- Good morning.
- Hardly.

38
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:20,603
One of my P.A.S quit an hour ago,

39
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,512
and I have to reshuffle
next month's schedule.

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,806
That's nothing.
I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.

41
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:29,100
Any bed you're in is the wrong one.

42
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,304
That's not what your mama said.

43
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:33,674
Snap.

44
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,034
I'll be going now.

45
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,609
To human resources.

46
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,312
He started it.

47
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:43,975
It was the neighbor's kid's bed.

48
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,202
Luckily,
Esteban still likes sleeping with mommy.

49
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,579
How drunk were you?

50
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,047
About yea drunk.

51
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:54,335
Are you okay? You shouldn't be drinking
at all, much less...

52
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,252
You sound just like Esteban's mom.

53
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:58,726
I need you in the clinic.

54
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,151
Sorry, I'm busy.

55
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,636
Tell me you have a case.
You know, even if you don't.

56
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:06,873
- I have a case.
- Sounds interesting. I'll take it.

57
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:10,169
I owe you one.
Now tell me you don't have a case.

58
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:11,730
I really do have a case.

59
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:12,905
We're even.

60
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,237
You guys know how to honeymoon.

61
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,985
This is Dr. House.
Aphasia and syncope.

62
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,445
He can't speak.

63
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,668
"Aphasia" is Greek
for loss of voice.

64
00:05:23,793 --> 00:05:26,283
We've ruled out infection,
vocal cord damage, and stroke.

65
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:28,202
A lot of guys syncope at the altar.

66
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,872
It's Greek for "having the vapors".

67
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,784
We ruled out all the causes of fainting:
low blood pressure, hypoglycemia,

68
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,009
dehydration.

69
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:38,879
Don't say "ah".

70
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,893
Do you know what it is?

71
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:48,054
Roll on your side
and lift up your gown.

72
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,808
There's one thing
they didn't test for.

73
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:52,678
A test for what?

74
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:54,658
Faking.

75
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,927
Test was positive.

76
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:00,678
I can... I can talk.

77
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,365
I wasn't faking.

78
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,072
My voice just came back right now.

79
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,908
I'm not the one
you have to convince.

80
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:10,244
I know he wasn't faking.

81
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:12,871
If she's buying that,
she might just be a keeper.

82
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:14,414
What about the syncope?

83
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:19,420
Is she buying this too?

84
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,338
Why would he fake anything?

85
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,842
<i>Kryo podia.</i>
It's Greek for "duh".

86
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:28,688
Still, you get to keep
the engagement ring.

87
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:33,935
I don't think he was faking.

88
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:36,729
That's because
you're more gullible than I am.

89
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,562
For instance, I don't believe
that you called off your open marriage.

90
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:43,376
I believe your wife called it off,
and you called off telling her

91
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,051
that you weren't calling it off.

92
00:06:45,176 --> 00:06:47,688
A guy doesn't throw
a golden ticket in the trash.

93
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:51,376
The same way a guy doesn't give up
a lucrative practice to work for you?

94
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,501
That's exactly why you dabble.

95
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:55,776
You're compensating
for your professional conquests

96
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,271
- with sexual ones.
- I'm not that predictable.

97
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:02,211
For example, you're not expecting me
to ask you out for dinner tonight.

98
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:03,386
No, thanks.

99
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:06,620
- You won't even consider it?
- I did, just very quickly.

100
00:07:07,215 --> 00:07:09,514
The truth is,
since I called this thing off,

101
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,901
my wife has been very grateful
and I could do with a down night.

102
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:15,673
If I go out with the boss,
nobody can blame me.

103
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:19,467
If you bring your wife.

104
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:22,030
- That's the point. I need a little...
- You're lying.

105
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:24,605
- I'm not lying.
- Then I'm not going.

106
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,581
Fontina at 8:30.

107
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:36,830
You believe me, right?

108
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:39,042
Of course I believe you.

109
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,834
Then let's do it.

110
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,545
We'll tell a cab to take us to AC
right now and get it done.

111
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,408
You're serious? You just walked out
of the emergency room.

112
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,925
Exactly. I walked out.

113
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,244
I feel great.

114
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:53,138
We do have the clothes for it.

115
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,961
What's wrong?

116
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:01,286
Are you... What's wrong?

117
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:03,472
Can somebody help us?

118
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,538
Please!
Please hurry.

119
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:06,813
Just breathe.

120
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,916
There's gotta be a better way
to call off a wedding.

121
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,741
- A tweet, for example.
- Pleural effusion.

122
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,140
You think his lung is faking it?

123
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,706
There's at least 200 ccs
of fluid in there.

124
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,168
Let's say all his symptoms are real.

125
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,073
Explain how one of them
suddenly went away

126
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:27,293
without using the words
"virgin" or "Mary".

127
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:29,857
If the pleural effusion's
caused by something systemic,

128
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:31,918
it could explain
his other two symptoms.

129
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,106
And so whether you believe him or not,
we have to find what caused the P.E.

130
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:39,560
E.R ruled out infection.
Eosinophil count ruled out parasites.

131
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,235
A medication
he's not telling us about.

132
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,734
You really don't trust this guy,
do you?

133
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,659
I don't even trust the E.R.

134
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:48,902
Let's rule out infections ourselves.

135
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,672
Tap his lungs, send cultures,

136
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,360
run cytology for cancer,
and check his blood pressure.

137
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,157
This time,
talk about nuptials while you do it.

138
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:57,883
Check his home for everything else.

139
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,034
He just moved in
with his fiancee three months ago.

140
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,000
Toxic exposure could take
longer than that to manifest.

141
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:05,301
You check his love nest.

142
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,739
You two check
his swinging bachelor pad.

143
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,552
That somebody else now lives in?

144
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:10,777
I assume so.

145
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,131
Not the glass.

146
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:25,813
The place looks like... 1960s?

147
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:30,278
- Could have lead paint.
- You think a 27-year-old has pica?

148
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,898
If it gets us out of here
before the owner comes back, yes.

149
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:38,076
What'd you tell that cute physio?

150
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,083
That I changed my mind.

151
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,622
No, you didn't.

152
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:44,951
You're more nervous than usual.

153
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:48,142
Because this B and E has actual B.

154
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:53,288
That's a suspended ceiling.

155
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,110
What are you doing?

156
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:01,104
- I want to see what's above it.
- More ceiling.

157
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,397
Made of 40-year-old acoustic tile.

158
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:10,317
Asbestosis. I like it.
I'll be in the car.

159
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:12,447
What the hell?

160
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,321
It's okay.

161
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:16,629
We're doctors.
Nobody was home, so...

162
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:18,115
I'm calling the police.

163
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:20,953
Do you know Ted Taylor?
He used to live here.

164
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,122
- What about him?
- He's our patient.

165
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,654
- Is he okay?
- We think he may have asbestosis

166
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,068
from your ceiling tiles.

167
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,754
They're not asbestos.
I had 'em checked when I moved in.

168
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,857
- How sick is he?
- Is he a friend of yours?

169
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:33,982
He was.

170
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:37,372
Actually, he was my boyfriend
for three years.

171
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,850
- I'm not gay.
- Really?

172
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,562
'Cause it would certainly
explain the cold feet.

173
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,771
And the boyfriend.

174
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,689
So you're bisexual?

175
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:51,315
No, I'm straight.

176
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,151
Cotter, the guy you met, he's gay.

177
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,889
He had a crush on me.
I left.

178
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,116
- After 3 years?
- It's possible.

179
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,659
It doesn't mean you're gay
'cause the guy you're sleeping with is.

180
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,412
We weren't sleeping together.
What's this got to do with anything?

181
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:07,257
Lung tap turned up mononucleosis.
E.R doesn't routinely test for it.

182
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:10,145
It explains the P.E.
and can be virtually asymptomatic.

183
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,879
So we got to wondering,
how does a 27-year-old get mono?

184
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,922
You're a little old
for the kissing disease,

185
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,323
unless your immune system
is compromised.

186
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:20,304
If there's been any unprotected sex,
we'll need to test for HIV.

187
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,514
There's been no sex of any kind.

188
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,849
I'll go test your fiancee for HIV.

189
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,061
Is she the curious sort?

190
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:29,938
Wait.

191
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:35,212
There may have been some contact,

192
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:36,695
but I'm not gay.

193
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:37,864
Sodomy,

194
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,532
one of the top ten
most common household accidents.

195
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,180
I did a lot of stupid things,
but I turned my life around.

196
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,785
I'm as straight as any of you.

197
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:48,887
You don't have to believe me.
I'm just saying

198
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,156
you can test me...

199
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,305
As long as you don't tell Nicole.

200
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:55,678
What business is it of hers?

201
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:59,377
There's nothing wrong
with him marrying a straight woman.

202
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,469
How about,
it'll make them both miserable?

203
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:03,263
Just like most straight marriages.

204
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,706
He's got the right to life,
liberty, and unhappiness,

205
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,331
like the rest of us.

206
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:09,061
No reason to look at me.

207
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:12,397
I'm not saying it's a great choice,
just saying it's his choice.

208
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,733
It has to be hers as well,
which it can't be

209
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,234
if she doesn't know he's gay.

210
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,945
It's how it's gonna stay
since we have no right to tell her.

211
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,822
Like you've never bent the rules.

212
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,269
You date guys. You date girls.

213
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,494
I assume at some point,
you're gonna make a choice.

214
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,830
- I don't lie about who I am.
- Patients lying never bothered you.

215
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,041
They weren't lying
about their sexual orientation.

216
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:34,086
So you're only judgmental
when it gets personal.

217
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,273
Does it bother me
that people hurt others

218
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:38,660
because they're too weak
to face the truth?

219
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:41,910
- Sorry about that.
- Tell me she's not looking at me.

220
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,051
He's negative?

221
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:53,188
Looks like being gay
didn't make him sick.

222
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,410
So maybe being straight did.

223
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:00,606
The test was negative. No HIV.

224
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,489
I told you.

225
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,867
What you didn't tell us
is how you turned your life around.

226
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,828
- It can be pretty hard.
- It was.

227
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,871
Downright impossible on your own.

228
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,373
I talked to some people.

229
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:13,667
It was more than just talk,
wasn't it?

230
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:18,718
I know this is personal stuff.

231
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,624
I'm here to help you, not out you.

232
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:27,644
I had therapy.

233
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,632
Conversion therapy.

234
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,978
Went to a camp for three weeks
of intensive rehabilitation.

235
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,670
They injected him with emetics
while he watched gay porn.

236
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,958
Apomorphine?

237
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,483
Or lithium chloride or cyclophosphamide,
he doesn't know.

238
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:44,046
When that didn't work,
they shot him up with male hormones.

239
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,116
A chemical assault
could explain the PE.

240
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,284
And the ECT explains the rest.

241
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:51,329
They gave him electroconvulsive
therapy to make him straight?

242
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,415
To zap the fabulous
right out of him.

243
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,333
Neural damage
accounts for the aphasia.

244
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,085
ECT doesn't cause neural damage.

245
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,703
Unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's
he-man quackery camp.

246
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,029
Run an EEG.

247
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:06,254
See if they straightened him
or just scrambled him.

248
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,458
Sorry.

249
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,083
I completely forgot.

250
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,639
My wife just started
a ceramics class Tuesdays at 8:00.

251
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,199
It's a half-hour drive from here.
She won't be back till 10:30.

252
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:32,138
She's taking it
with her girlfriend Marly.

253
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,703
She hopes to make a tea service.

254
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,209
- You want to call her?
- No need.

255
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,795
I already texted her.

256
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,388
And here she is now.

257
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,478
I think
you're still seeing the physio.

258
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,511
You've got a backup suit
in your car.

259
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:54,476
Don't wanna be bringing home
da stank.

260
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:58,161
You're right about everything.
But please, don't tell her.

261
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,966
I didn't know you'd be here.

262
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,105
Got your text, obviously.

263
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:07,107
I'm just leaving.
I've got a ceramics class.

264
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:09,693
- Really?
- I love it.

265
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,358
Even managed to talk Chris
into signing up for one.

266
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:14,412
Of course,
he's in the beginners' class.

267
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:17,582
- You're in a ceramics class?
- Friday nights, right?

268
00:15:18,457 --> 00:15:19,960
Friday nights. Sounded like fun.

269
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:25,611
- You should join Chris'.
- You know, I should.

270
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Gotta go.

271
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:30,036
Making a tea service.

272
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,757
I must have fallen asleep in the lounge.
What are they doing?

273
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:45,732
- An EEG.
- What's it for?

274
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,579
We're looking for neurological damage
that could have caused his symptoms.

275
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:50,699
Damage from what?

276
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:52,784
A head trauma.

277
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,661
He had an accident?

278
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,779
It wasn't an accident.
It was before he met you.

279
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,232
Wat happened? Was he hospitalized?

280
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:02,877
You should ask him about it.

281
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:07,344
They have the results.

282
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,367
Everything looks normal.

283
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,001
Look at this.

284
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,229
- Beta waves are spiking.
- What's that mean?

285
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,689
I'm not sure.

286
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:24,796
He's coding. Crash cart.

287
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,361
- What's happening to him?
- He's having a heart attack.

288
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,158
Charging. Clear.

289
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:34,852


290
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:36,957
EKG showed no abnormalities.

291
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,121
So what caused the arrest?

292
00:16:39,246 --> 00:16:41,046
Four ways to stop a heart.

293
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,508
Electrical problems,
restricted blood flow,

294
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:46,950
blood where it shouldn't be,
shocks, blocks, or bleeds.

295
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:48,423
That's three things.

296
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,741
And cheating.

297
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,720
Oh, no. Sorry.
That's how you break a heart.

298
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:58,121
I found a ceramics class
in Trenton on Friday nights

299
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:01,169
that was full
so my wife couldn't join me.

300
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,758
EP study ruled out shocks.

301
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,660
Now you just have to find
some pottery by Taub.

302
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,528
The lamer it looks, the better.

303
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:12,947
So we'll do an angio
to see if it's blocks or bleeds.

304
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,765
You should be a doctor.

305
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:25,377
I'm gonna check out
this new lesbian bar tonight.

306
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,671
Your life is awesome.

307
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,421
You wanna come?

308
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:43,978
I was telling a 33-year-old woman
that she has breast cancer.

309
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,446
No, you weren't.

310
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:47,754
- How do you know?
- If you were,

311
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:51,028
you'd need to see the pain in her eyes
so she could see the concern in yours.

312
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,792
Why are you setting me up
on dates with my team?

313
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:55,801
Taub asking me out was quirky,

314
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:57,742
but Thirteen doing it
is a barking cat.

315
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,369
I'm doing it to help you.

316
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,234
By setting me up with a hottie
that I can't sleep with?

317
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:03,623
And Thirteen?

318
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,697
I've been spending more time
with Sam.

319
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:08,321
It's been hard on you.
I figured if you had some company...

320
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:09,796
I don't need your help.

321
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,356
Consider it
helping our neighbor's four-year-old.

322
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,981
I gave him a dollar.

323
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,491
- How much did you have to pay?
- Nothing.

324
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:18,542
I just told them
you might be feeling down

325
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,182
and it was in their self-interest
to keep you company.

326
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,142
100 bucks. Foreman held out for 200.

327
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:27,981
I'm worried about you.

328
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,522
You could have ended up
in jail or worse.

329
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,580
Racking you with guilt.

330
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,488
So I do something really stupid
and you reward me.

331
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,449
Read any parenting manual.

332
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,451
That's not helping me,
that's helping you.

333
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,107
Fine, I did it for me,
for my relationship,

334
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:44,706
out of pure self-interest.

335
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,294
You'll do it?

336
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:50,935
For you.

337
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,741
It's not gonna work, though.

338
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:57,087
Maybe.

339
00:18:57,212 --> 00:19:00,096
But how bad
can a night out at a lesbian bar be?

340
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,419
How are you doing?

341
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,894
Heart attack at 27.

342
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:19,013
They said you had a head trauma.

343
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:24,228
I fell off a stepladder
and hit my head.

344
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,203
It was a stupid accident.

345
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:28,047
An accident.

346
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:34,255
- We need to prep you for your angio.
- Valium will help you relax.

347
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,523
We're gonna run a line
through your femoral artery.

348
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,844
Another heart attack?

349
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,536
I don't think so.
His heart rate seems normal.

350
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,810
Are you okay?

351
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:49,562
You weren't discussing wedding plans,
were you?

352
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,692
I guess I just...

353
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,236
Fainted.

354
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:58,553
POTS.

355
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,829
Postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome.

356
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:04,953
BP plummets when he's upright,
reverts to normal when he's lying down.

357
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,878
He was lying down both times
we took his blood pressure.

358
00:20:08,003 --> 00:20:10,102
Hypotension
could have induced his heart attack.

359
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:12,370
- Also explains the syncope.
- And his aphasia.

360
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,184
He was upright, then you laid him down
on the bed to test him.

361
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,027
BP reverted to normal.
Voice came back.

362
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:19,044
Jabbing him
had nothing to do with it.

363
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:22,146
POTS can be brought on by a viral
or bacterial infection such as mono.

364
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:24,158
Load him up with fludrocortisone.

365
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:27,754
You didn't read your ceramics course
description, did you?

366
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:29,621
You did?

367
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:31,055
As I'm sure your wife did.

368
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,539
So we all know
they're doing a fourth of July theme.

369
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:36,414
She'll be expecting
something star-spangled.

370
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,559
Nicole?

371
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:45,098
Cotter Macklin.

372
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:46,744
I'm an old friend of Ted's.

373
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,040
How's he doing?

374
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:53,168
He had a heart attack.

375
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:00,592
They have him on some new meds.

376
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:02,646
Really knocked him out.

377
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,430
How are you holding up?

378
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:06,869
I'm okay.

379
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,653
I brought this for him.

380
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,481
That's his favorite thing
in the whole world.

381
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:17,232
I know.

382
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,097
You weren't at the wedding,
were you?

383
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:26,336
No, I wasn't invited.

384
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,894
Ted and I had a falling out.

385
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,459
How did you know each other?

386
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:37,738
We met senior year of college.

387
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:40,287
We shared a house for a while.

388
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:41,633
You were roommates?

389
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,347
For three years.

390
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:00,019
I'm sorry. I just miss him.

391
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,612
I think you should leave.

392
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:06,888
- I shouldn't have done that.
- Now.

393
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:08,382
Please.

394
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:19,506
I hope he gets better.

395
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,722


396
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:36,562
How are you feeling?

397
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,379
Don't know yet.

398
00:22:39,504 --> 00:22:42,110
Your numbers look good.
We're gonna keep you on these meds.

399
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:03,860
You had a visitor
while you were asleep.

400
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:05,351
Who?

401
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:07,457
Cotter.

402
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:08,984
Who is he?

403
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,578
I shared a house with him
after college.

404
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:13,903
I don't know why he would show up.

405
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:16,882
That's it?

406
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:20,021
Why? What did he say?

407
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,859
I need to hear it from you, Ted.

408
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,336
One night, I got really drunk

409
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:54,096
and I went to bed.

410
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,544
And he came into my room.

411
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,548
One thing led to another.

412
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:06,673
The whole thing was a mistake.

413
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,822
Are you saying you had sex with him?

414
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,868
- I was drunk and confused.
- You're gay?

415
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:18,351
I thought

416
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,333
I was.

417
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:26,086
I even made up my mind
to tell my family.

418
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,009
I stood in front of the bathroom mirror,
psyching myself up.

419
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,775
All I could see was disgust.

420
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:35,885
And that's when I realized,

421
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:40,067
I didn't hate the thought
of admitting I was gay

422
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:42,280
because I was ashamed.

423
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:45,971
I hated the thought
because I wasn't gay.

424
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:49,294
That was the day I went to get help.

425
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:53,126
So you're not gay?

426
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:55,326
They cured me, Nicole.

427
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:59,664
That's what all the head trauma
is about.

428
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,730
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but it's...

429
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:03,605
It's all in the past now.

430
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:06,963
It doesn't matter anymore.

431
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:14,429
What is it?

432
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:18,038
My head!

433
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:24,352
- He's got severe headaches.
- So do I.

434
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:28,535
Should I call or raise
with a double gutshot draw?

435
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,173
- Infection?
- That's what we're thinking.

436
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:37,729
It would explain the headaches,
could have caused POTS.

437
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:39,787
If it's fungal,
it could have got to the heart.

438
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,655
I was talking about you.

439
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,375
Has the little gent
been wearing a tent?

440
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:48,004
Remind me why
that has anything to do with you.

441
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,923
A distracted person makes
a distracted professional.

442
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,134
And destroying my marriage
will help me focus.

443
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,635
Probably.

444
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:57,365
Do a spinal tap, run the CSF.

445
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:00,417
Still talking about you.

446
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,769
But you can do it on the patient, too,
if you want.

447
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:24,508
- What about her?
- The bartender?

448
00:26:24,691 --> 00:26:27,341
She's the only one
who's not here for fun.

449
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,368
Trust me, she's not straight.

450
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:31,343
If your gaydar is so great,

451
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:33,935
Why you didn't know about the patient
before seeing his lover?

452
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,071
The guy walked in with his bride.

453
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,262
It took me a while
to rotate my dish.

454
00:26:39,324 --> 00:26:41,547
It's unbelievable
what he's doing to her.

455
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:43,590
He doesn't loves her?

456
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:46,187
He may love her, but he needs
to have sex with other men.

457
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,604
Taub loves his wife,

458
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,822
but he needs to have sex
with other women.

459
00:26:49,947 --> 00:26:51,852
Yeah, it sucks
what he's doing to her too,

460
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,359
but it's hardly the same.

461
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:56,322
To be faithful to his wife,
our patient has to deny his identity.

462
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,380
- Taub just needs to...
- To resist a biological imperative?

463
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,954
It is easier to say no to dessert
than to pretend you don't eat.

464
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,122
Says someone
who's never been on a diet.

465
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:08,231
My life's a breeze.

466
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,925
You're successful, smart,

467
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,413
and you attract
everything that moves.

468
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:16,759
If you want to focus on the fact
that you won't be 50, it's your choice.

469
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:19,025
You know what?
I agree with you.

470
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,889
My self-pity's optional.
What about yours?

471
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:32,191
CSF was negative for infection,
and his headaches are worse.

472
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,001
- We were talking about you.
- Please don't.

473
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:37,321
It's not POTS,
so we're back to square one.

474
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:44,634
Not quite.

475
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:46,998
You did a spinal tap,

476
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,584
- <i>but the headaches got worse.</i>
- We're maxing him out on morphine.

477
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,102
He sprung a leak.

478
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:53,296
He's losing CSF from the tap site.

479
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:56,594
- We made his headaches worse?
- <i>Just you, actually.</i>

480
00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:00,307
That still wouldn't explain why he got
the headaches in the first place.

481
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:01,721
The low pressure

482
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,063
caused the POTS,
not the other way around.

483
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:07,101
Patch the leak
and top him up with artificial CSF.

484
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:19,569
There. That should stop the leak.

485
00:28:20,185 --> 00:28:22,193
You should be feeling
some relief soon.

486
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:27,887
I spoke to my parents.

487
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,041
How are they doing?

488
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:32,493
They're still worried.

489
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:34,737
Tell them not to be.

490
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:37,202
Everything's gonna be okay.

491
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:45,056
- What's happening?
- He's stroking.

492
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,018
- Both eyes are responsive.
- Tell me your full name.

493
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:50,644
Theodore Philip Taylor.

494
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,396
- This isn't a stroke.
- Then what?

495
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,191
What's happening to me?

496
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,393


497
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:05,993
It's really not POTS
We're really back to square one.

498
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:08,575
So what's masquerading as a stroke?

499
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:11,374
Voted the worst Halloween costume,
by the way.

500
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:14,075
MRA showed no problems
with blood flow to the brain.

501
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,670
- Rules out TIA.
- Sarcoidosis?

502
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:19,571
Chest x-rays showed no hilar masses.

503
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,218
- Any luck with the pottery?
- Wasn't easy.

504
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:25,854
Bought a suitably cruddy set of fife
and drum napkin rings online.

505
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:27,889
- Scleroderma?
- Skin's fine.

506
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:30,494
ANA was negative.
So what did that set you back?

507
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:33,469
Too much. I got into a bidding war
with some lunatic.

508
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:34,647
Histoplasmosis.

509
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,015
EIA was clear.

510
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,444
Could have gone
a lot higher than $215.

511
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,234
You're kissmyasthma99?

512
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:47,549
What about MELAS?
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy,

513
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:49,787
lactic acidosis,
and stroke-like episodes.

514
00:29:50,003 --> 00:29:51,003
Nillas.

515
00:29:52,144 --> 00:29:55,209
No, idiot.
Lactate levels are stable.

516
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,838
- There's something.
- We've run every logical test,

517
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,716
asked every question we can think of,
gone over his history a dozen times.

518
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:05,888
- We know how reliable is his history.
- If history is written by the victor,

519
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,257
- how do we find out what happened?
- Talk to the loser.

520
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,710
Call the boyfriend.
Put them in the same room.

521
00:30:11,835 --> 00:30:14,301
Or we could question them separately
and not torture them.

522
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:17,356
Or we could get them in the same room
and get the truth.

523
00:30:25,062 --> 00:30:27,800
- Drinks are on me and Foreman tonight.
- Can't. Pap smear.

524
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:30,119
We don't want to do it either,
but Wilson already paid us.

525
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:32,621
- It's gonna suck.
- I know.

526
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:35,696
Where and when?

527
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:38,544
Any incidents of dizziness?

528
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,199
Seizures?

529
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:43,174
Blackouts?

530
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,016
Other than our wedding day.

531
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:48,925
Don't you think I would have told you
if there were?

532
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,710
- My sister's birthday.
- I was drunk.

533
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,558
- You had one martini.
- On an empty stomach.

534
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:58,680
He wassitting on the couch,
and then he fell over and that was it.

535
00:30:58,805 --> 00:31:01,093
Well, once I slept it off,
I was fine.

536
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:05,404
Well, I stayed up that night,
checking on him every 15 minutes.

537
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:07,281
What about sex?

538
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:11,734
Yes, I have sex with my girlfriend,
because I'm not gay.

539
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:14,281
- We have sex.
- Thank you.

540
00:31:15,722 --> 00:31:16,822
No problems?

541
00:31:19,373 --> 00:31:22,129
Well, there have been some...

542
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:23,756
issues.

543
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,130
- Erectile dysfunction?
- Every guy has it sometimes.

544
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,070
We never had that problem.

545
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,601
Gee, that must be
because Ted doesn't like girls.

546
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:37,853
Or it's vascular.

547
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:39,730
I know we did an MRA,

548
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,123
but arterial disease
causing acute ischemia

549
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:44,151
could explain the heart,
neuro symptoms,

550
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,766
and maybe even POTS

551
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:48,665
Might I suggest a diagnostic test?

552
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:53,285
The penile plethysmograph

553
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,667
measures changes in
blood flow in your penis.

554
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,237
Tells us
if there's a circulatory problem.

555
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,643
You just need to be
in the right... state.

556
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:03,394
What's your pleasure?

557
00:32:03,692 --> 00:32:06,841
I feel terrible.
I don't think anything's gonna work.

558
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:10,886
- Then we'll have to give you a shot.
- Where you don't want to get one.

559
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:14,589
Shot it is.

560
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:35,136
- Nobody wants to follow that.
- The night just keeps getting better.

561
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,625
To wilson.

562
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,034
Everything looks fine.

563
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:42,728
You sure?

564
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,622
Medically, that's good news.

565
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:48,692
Are you feverish?
You're sweating.

566
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:52,054
No. I feel lousy,
but I don't know why I'm sweating.

567
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,950
- What is it?
- You're not sweating.

568
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:02,999
You're lactating.

569
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:04,959


570
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:08,204
Can't tell his fiancee he's gay,

571
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:10,328
how is he gonna tell her
he's pregnant?

572
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:14,646
His therapists
loaded him with hormones.

573
00:34:15,525 --> 00:34:17,783
Male hormones
don't make you lactate.

574
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:21,225
- But they could screw up your thyroid.
- That was over three months ago.

575
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,002
We started milking him last night.

576
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,987
So something else
screwed up his thyroid.

577
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:27,022
Graves, hashimoto's.

578
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,261
Nope. TSH was normal.

579
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:31,819
Pituitary tumor.

580
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,488
Could also explain his libido

581
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,006
and heart issues.

582
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,869
And if the tumor's big enough,
his headaches and syncope.

583
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,748
Except we...
We cleared him for cancer.

584
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,566
It didn't say "cancer".

585
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,377
Prolactinomas can be benign.

586
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:54,534
Check his prolactin level,

587
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:56,969
then MRI his pituitary.

588
00:35:09,487 --> 00:35:11,066
Sounds like you had fun last night.

589
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:12,776
You believe Chase?

590
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:14,694
I believe Foreman.

591
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,720
And they had fun with you.

592
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,565
What happened?

593
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:23,839
I realized that they
could be my friends.

594
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,435
- You're serious.
- And then I sobered up.

595
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,673
You weren't that drunk.
You managed to find your way

596
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,209
into your own little bed.

597
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,552
I think I sleep better
in rocket ship sheets.

598
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,972
No, you want to blame this
on the booze, but that's easy.

599
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,355
Change is hard.

600
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,979
And wisdom is knowing the difference
between what you can change...

601
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:54,443
And what you were born with.

602
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,181
And cowardice is labeling

603
00:35:56,306 --> 00:35:58,856
what you don't want
to change as innate.

604
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:01,617
I was winning this argument.

605
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:07,845
- Pituitary MRI...
- Was normal.

606
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,170
How are the headaches?

607
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:14,528
Terrible.

608
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,865
Give me your head.

609
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,306
- What the hell?
- I know.

610
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:21,689
It's the first time you've heard
that sentence with a possessive pronoun.

611
00:36:29,294 --> 00:36:30,494
That's better.

612
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,007
Okay, enough.

613
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,482
How cool is that?

614
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,034
You have a chiari malformation,

615
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:47,881
a narrowing in the base of your skull
that can cut off CSF flow.

616
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:50,969
But it wasn't a problem
until the ECT at breeder boot camp

617
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:53,418
caused your brain to swell
just enough to plug the opening.

618
00:36:54,196 --> 00:36:56,620
And when your brain pressed up
against your pituitary,

619
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:59,145
it signed you up
for <i>la leche</i> league.

620
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:01,797
You still won't be pitching
a tent for your lady,

621
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:04,930
but that's just because,
you know, she's a lady.

622
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,307
Its orthostatic effect
was mimicking POTS

623
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,893
It also does
an uncanny Christopher Walken.

624
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:13,984
Unfortunately, if you treat it
like POTS, it gets worse.

625
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:16,059
So as far as that goes, oops.

626
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:18,694
Proper treatment is surgery.
We'll get you in right away.

627
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,571
So how did I get this thing?

628
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:22,364
Overbearing mother.

629
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:25,444
Kidding.
CM's congenital.

630
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,833
Like so many other things,
you were born that way.

631
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:48,253
I thought you might
be running low, so...

632
00:37:54,115 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm not coming back.

633
00:37:58,044 --> 00:37:59,693
Ted, this is a mistake.

634
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,646
You're hurting, and I'm sorry.

635
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:03,771
I'm talking about hurting her.

636
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:05,616
I love her.

637
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:10,458
Thank you for your support.

638
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,491
We both really appreciate it.

639
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,042
Good luck.

640
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:49,201
You know what I've been thinking?

641
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,080
It's your birthday in three weeks.

642
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:57,709
What do you say we rebook the church
and make it a doubleheader?

643
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:01,088
I don't know, Ted.

644
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,269
Less than a week ago
we were standing at the altar,

645
00:39:04,394 --> 00:39:05,694
perfectly happy.

646
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:07,844
Nothing's changed.

647
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:09,680
Really?

648
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,454
I still love you.

649
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:14,977
Do you still love me?

650
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:21,498
- But...
- Then that's all that matters.

651
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:28,699
But I think that you still love him.

652
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,998
I'm not gay.

653
00:39:33,273 --> 00:39:34,413
I promise you.

654
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,201
How can you promise me that?

655
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,169
Because I believe that we get

656
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,585
to choose how we live our lives,
and I've made my choice.

657
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:49,790
So now I have to make mine.

658
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:05,230
I'm not saying good-bye.

659
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,640
I want to marry you.

660
00:40:11,932 --> 00:40:13,432
I have to marry you.

661
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:25,241
It's Friday night.

662
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,660
I called it off.

663
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:31,887
For real this time.

664
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:34,448
Frees you up for the next one.

665
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:36,602
One day at a time.

666
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,589
Napkin rings.

667
00:40:43,422 --> 00:40:44,816
My way of saying thanks.

668
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:48,904
- For trying to wreck your marriage?
- For trying to save it.

669
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:51,213
And I get napkin rings?

670
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:53,428
Expensive ones.

671
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,810
I hired a replacement.

672
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:12,205
For my PA.

673
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,554
She seems great.

674
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:17,849
- Good work.
- You too.

675
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:20,936
Your patient's going home tomorrow.

676
00:41:21,614 --> 00:41:23,264
He doesn't have a home.

677
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:27,734
You want to grab a bite to eat?

678
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,613
So Wilson got to you too?

679
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:35,101
No. This is just me.

680
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:37,642
- Lucas?
- Working late.

681
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,381
I'm buying.

682
00:41:43,356 --> 00:41:44,856
I'm not that hungry.

683
00:41:57,062 --> 00:41:59,012
I just want us to be friends.

684
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,621
Funny.

685
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:07,963
That's the last thing
I want us to be.

686
