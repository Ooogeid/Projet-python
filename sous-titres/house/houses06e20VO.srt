1
0:0:22,369 --> 0:0:23,519
"Therafy" me.

2
0:0:33,244 --> 0:0:35,181
- You're late.
- You're fat.

3
0:0:38,496 --> 0:0:39,664
It's unusual.

4
0:0:39,832 --> 0:0:42,132
You know how far the parking lot is?

5
0:0:42,685 --> 0:0:44,60
My leg's been hurting.

6
0:0:44,185 --> 0:0:46,873
Anything been on your mind lately,
any particular stress?

7
0:0:48,180 --> 0:0:49,632
Probably just gonna rain.

8
0:0:50,561 --> 0:0:53,282
You like the new Monet reproduction
in the waiting room...

9
0:0:54,122 --> 0:0:55,472
The <i>Water Lilies</i>?

10
0:0:56,500 --> 0:0:57,550
I was late.

11
0:0:57,751 --> 0:0:59,801
I wasn't focusing on the decor,

12
0:1:0,249 --> 0:1:3,17
but it sounds appropriately
bland and calming.

13
0:1:3,436 --> 0:1:5,737
Stress can also
make you absentminded.

14
0:1:5,862 --> 0:1:7,312
I'm not stressed...

15
0:1:8,438 --> 0:1:11,693
Beyond the stress induced
by you telling me how stressed I am.

16
0:1:13,3 --> 0:1:14,531
Just an ordinary week.

17
0:1:20,625 --> 0:1:21,897
Tell me about it.

18
0:1:26,425 --> 0:1:27,725
<i>I had a patient.</i>

19
0:1:30,568 --> 0:1:32,468
Good. I have a case for you.

20
0:1:33,71 --> 0:1:34,71
Beer?

21
0:1:34,649 --> 0:1:35,649
Amnesia.

22
0:1:36,134 --> 0:1:38,636
She was found jogging
in the street, disoriented.

23
0:1:38,761 --> 0:1:40,761
She almost got hit by a truck.

24
0:1:40,886 --> 0:1:43,53
The MRI showed no abnormalities.

25
0:1:43,178 --> 0:1:44,264
No I.D. on her.

26
0:1:44,389 --> 0:1:46,716
Just her jogging clothes
and her heart rate monitor.

27
0:1:47,357 --> 0:1:50,680
- We know absolutely nothing about her.
- We know she has money.

28
0:1:50,805 --> 0:1:52,27
Blaze outriggers...

29
0:1:52,517 --> 0:1:53,654
400 bucks a pair.

30
0:1:53,940 --> 0:1:55,865
People who have money
don't just disappear.

31
0:1:56,34 --> 0:1:58,574
Sooner or later, someone's
gonna show up looking for her.

32
0:1:58,699 --> 0:2:1,928
- Can I have something to eat?
- She just ate 15 minutes ago.

33
0:2:2,541 --> 0:2:4,590
- She keeps forgetting.
- You don't eat

34
0:2:4,715 --> 0:2:6,826
because you remember
it's time to eat.

35
0:2:6,951 --> 0:2:10,454
You eat 'cause you're hungry.
Her metabolism is in high gear.

36
0:2:10,631 --> 0:2:13,160
She is an extreme
long-distance runner...

37
0:2:13,285 --> 0:2:14,935
<i>Why were you in the ER?</i>

38
0:2:16,68 --> 0:2:17,178
That's your question?

39
0:2:18,644 --> 0:2:21,460
You're a psychotherapist. You're hearing
about a great amnesia case,

40
0:2:21,585 --> 0:2:23,349
and all you're asking me
is geography.

41
0:2:23,521 --> 0:2:24,671
Just curious.

42
0:2:29,520 --> 0:2:31,120
I was avoiding Wilson.

43
0:2:33,143 --> 0:2:36,280
It's not something
you couldn't have seen eight miles away.

44
0:2:37,460 --> 0:2:39,10
<i>Wilson's a processor.</i>

45
0:2:39,618 --> 0:2:42,899
<i>I knew there were some things
that he'd want to process with me...</i>

46
0:2:43,334 --> 0:2:44,334
<i>at length.</i>

47
0:2:44,711 --> 0:2:46,11
Sam's moving in.

48
0:2:47,876 --> 0:2:50,151
If it's before Friday,
your assistant wins the pool.

49
0:2:50,276 --> 0:2:53,178
I was just wondering
what your plans were.

50
0:2:54,802 --> 0:2:55,716
Tonight?

51
0:2:55,885 --> 0:2:56,885
In life.

52
0:2:58,845 --> 0:3:0,57
Sam likes you...

53
0:3:0,528 --> 0:3:2,119
But she wants me to move out.

54
0:3:4,339 --> 0:3:5,853
I want you to move out.

55
0:3:7,591 --> 0:3:10,142
I didn't know things with Sam
would happen so quickly.

56
0:3:10,267 --> 0:3:12,900
I didn't...
I don't want to make a mistake here.

57
0:3:13,69 --> 0:3:15,653
- I've made a lot of mistakes.
- By moving too quickly.

58
0:3:15,821 --> 0:3:17,497
Given your usual rate of commitment,

59
0:3:17,622 --> 0:3:19,490
I'm surprised
you're not already re-divorced.

60
0:3:21,711 --> 0:3:23,327
I could help you find a place.

61
0:3:23,612 --> 0:3:26,464
- What's wrong with my old place?
- Nothing. I just thought...

62
0:3:26,848 --> 0:3:30,84
You might want to find
somewhere new, somewhere...

63
0:3:31,971 --> 0:3:34,255
Where I didn't abuse drugs
and hallucinate.

64
0:3:37,826 --> 0:3:38,826
I'm fine.

65
0:3:39,169 --> 0:3:40,269
<i>You're fine?</i>

66
0:3:41,473 --> 0:3:44,181
Your best friend is tossing you out,
and you're fine?

67
0:3:45,102 --> 0:3:46,400
Why wouldn't I be?

68
0:3:49,976 --> 0:3:51,378
.:: La Fabrique ::.

69
0:3:52,945 --> 0:3:54,567
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

70
0:4:24,322 --> 0:4:26,148
You're not feeling a little...

71
0:4:26,434 --> 0:4:27,434
betrayed

72
0:4:28,202 --> 0:4:29,202
and angry?

73
0:4:30,312 --> 0:4:33,800
Wilson bought a two-bedroom condo
so that you could move in with him.

74
0:4:33,925 --> 0:4:35,625
It wasn't that long ago.

75
0:4:35,924 --> 0:4:37,416
You don't feel a little...

76
0:4:37,876 --> 0:4:38,861
jerked around?

77
0:4:40,426 --> 0:4:42,990
He couldn't foresee Sam
coming back into his life.

78
0:4:43,115 --> 0:4:45,492
That's a very rational defense
of your friend.

79
0:4:46,50 --> 0:4:47,865
And I'm not buying it.

80
0:4:48,81 --> 0:4:49,125
Based on what?

81
0:4:49,250 --> 0:4:51,444
Based on the fact
that you were late,

82
0:4:51,569 --> 0:4:53,678
and you didn't notice
the pictures in the outer office.

83
0:4:53,803 --> 0:4:56,120
- Those aren't symptoms.
- They are to me.

84
0:4:56,245 --> 0:4:58,654
And here's another one.
You took the case.

85
0:4:59,394 --> 0:5:1,771
No negotiating, no bargaining.

86
0:5:2,55 --> 0:5:3,989
No clinic hours changed hands.

87
0:5:4,432 --> 0:5:6,472
Were you looking for something
to distract you

88
0:5:6,597 --> 0:5:8,394
'cause your best friend
threw you out?

89
0:5:8,697 --> 0:5:11,142
- Case was interesting.
- It's not organic.

90
0:5:11,371 --> 0:5:12,771
It's not mysterious.

91
0:5:13,122 --> 0:5:16,265
Most likely some psychologically
traumatic event occurred

92
0:5:16,390 --> 0:5:19,550
that made the patient's brain
choose to forget everything.

93
0:5:19,937 --> 0:5:20,937
Or not.

94
0:5:21,622 --> 0:5:22,622
Here.

95
0:5:23,247 --> 0:5:26,333
Loss of differentiation
between gray and white matter.

96
0:5:26,686 --> 0:5:27,811
That's subtle.

97
0:5:27,936 --> 0:5:31,361
It's in the area that controls memory.
Not likely it's a coincidence.

98
0:5:31,671 --> 0:5:33,126
Bacterial infection?

99
0:5:34,313 --> 0:5:35,761
Do I need to know this?

100
0:5:36,609 --> 0:5:38,455
Fine.
I'll give you the cliff notes version...

101
0:5:38,580 --> 0:5:40,626
Chase... M.S.
Taub... Physical trauma.

102
0:5:40,751 --> 0:5:43,566
- I can tell you why we ruled them out.
- Or not.

103
0:5:45,503 --> 0:5:48,131
It's probably a toxin,
we need to find it before it kills her.

104
0:5:48,256 --> 0:5:50,849
- We should search her house.
- Good luck with that.

105
0:5:51,380 --> 0:5:54,378
Her heart rate monitor
has a serial number.

106
0:5:54,605 --> 0:5:57,64
The distributor can match the number
to the store that sold it.

107
0:5:57,233 --> 0:6:0,25
She's a serious athlete.
Maybe someone will remember her.

108
0:6:0,548 --> 0:6:2,736
- Brilliant.
- Did he really say that?

109
0:6:3,444 --> 0:6:4,612
Subtextually.

110
0:6:4,781 --> 0:6:6,532
- Long shot.
- Even if the store clerk

111
0:6:6,700 --> 0:6:9,787
doesn't know who she is,
the store's close to where she lives.

112
0:6:9,912 --> 0:6:11,787
Seeing those surroundings
might spark a memory.

113
0:6:12,9 --> 0:6:14,314
- You want us to take her there?
- No.

114
0:6:15,208 --> 0:6:16,408
I'll take her.

115
0:6:17,325 --> 0:6:18,325
Really?

116
0:6:19,421 --> 0:6:22,262
It's unusual for you
to spend time with a patient, isn't it?

117
0:6:22,387 --> 0:6:23,955
Patients are boring...

118
0:6:24,80 --> 0:6:25,80
as people.

119
0:6:25,389 --> 0:6:29,101
This one I'm sure was no exception,
but her situation was interesting.

120
0:6:29,765 --> 0:6:31,765
Besides,
I was still avoiding Wilson.

121
0:6:32,144 --> 0:6:34,405
And no better way to avoid
than leaving the hospital.

122
0:6:34,530 --> 0:6:35,530
Maybe.

123
0:6:35,947 --> 0:6:37,730
Or were you avoiding going home?

124
0:6:38,345 --> 0:6:41,221
There's a reason they tell addicts
to stay away from old geography.

125
0:6:41,346 --> 0:6:43,736
I wasn't avoiding going home.
I'd already gone home...

126
0:6:44,844 --> 0:6:46,645
Before I came into work that day.

127
0:6:46,770 --> 0:6:48,927
I went straight there from Wilson's.

128
0:6:53,608 --> 0:6:56,248
Take it easy! You're gonna kill me!
God, why don't people knock?

129
0:6:56,723 --> 0:6:59,461
House, it's you! Where you been?
Hold up a second.

130
0:7:0,577 --> 0:7:1,577
Alvie?

131
0:7:2,225 --> 0:7:5,27
Juan Alvarez...
you let him stay at your place?

132
0:7:5,599 --> 0:7:6,699
Not exactly.

133
0:7:11,541 --> 0:7:13,599
I was wondering
if you were ever gonna show up.

134
0:7:13,767 --> 0:7:15,350
<i>Su casa, mi casa.
Casa!</i>

135
0:7:17,542 --> 0:7:18,640
Why are you here?

136
0:7:18,980 --> 0:7:21,210
When I left Mayfield,
I went back to the old neighborhood.

137
0:7:21,335 --> 0:7:23,479
You shouldn't leave
the bathroom window unlocked.

138
0:7:23,604 --> 0:7:26,354
Thanks for the safety lesson.
Why are you here?

139
0:7:26,479 --> 0:7:29,604
When I went back to the neighborhood,
immigration was looking for me.

140
0:7:29,729 --> 0:7:32,143
So I decided to visit
my old buddy House!

141
0:7:32,578 --> 0:7:35,169
And turn his apartment
into a giant prison jumpsuit.

142
0:7:35,294 --> 0:7:38,101
Juan Alvarez is no freeloader.
I do my part, earn my keep.

143
0:7:38,226 --> 0:7:40,667
The first week I made your dinner,
but you never showed up.

144
0:7:40,836 --> 0:7:43,129
The second week
I organized your stuff.

145
0:7:43,672 --> 0:7:45,798
- My stuff?
- But still, you never showed up.

146
0:7:45,984 --> 0:7:48,331
So this week, since I'm a real
good painter, I decided to...

147
0:7:48,456 --> 0:7:49,525
Coffee table...

148
0:7:50,48 --> 0:7:51,326
Where'd you put it?

149
0:7:53,236 --> 0:7:54,486
In the bedroom?

150
0:7:54,611 --> 0:7:57,173
The paint's not cheap, House.
It's a custom color.

151
0:7:57,298 --> 0:8:0,354
A mix of titanium, yellow, and ochre.
Ochre... I don't even like that stuff.

152
0:8:0,523 --> 0:8:3,153
It's like a fruit. It's got hair on it.
But they say it's a vegetable...

153
0:8:3,278 --> 0:8:6,478
You sold my table
to pay for paint that I don't want?

154
0:8:8,927 --> 0:8:11,227
I had to sell some other things too.

155
0:8:15,990 --> 0:8:18,976
- Get out.
- Papa, just give the color a chance.

156
0:8:19,508 --> 0:8:20,992
I'm going to work now.

157
0:8:21,117 --> 0:8:23,992
And when I come back,
the walls will be a less exciting color,

158
0:8:24,117 --> 0:8:25,546
and you will be gone.

159
0:8:27,307 --> 0:8:30,743
So Wilson threw you out,
and you threw Alvie out...

160
0:8:31,121 --> 0:8:32,869
just another week?

161
0:8:32,994 --> 0:8:34,638
Unlike me, Alvie didn't leave.

162
0:8:34,810 --> 0:8:36,576
I took my motorcycle
to work that day.

163
0:8:36,701 --> 0:8:38,558
When I went home to get my car,

164
0:8:38,968 --> 0:8:41,268
he was painting the ceiling magenta.

165
0:8:42,120 --> 0:8:44,356
So I brought him with me
to protect the apartment.

166
0:8:45,62 --> 0:8:46,63
Why?

167
0:8:46,235 --> 0:8:47,985
To protect the apartment.

168
0:8:49,577 --> 0:8:51,196
- Deja vu.
- Tossing him out

169
0:8:51,365 --> 0:8:54,642
or sending him to the movies
or locking him in the bathroom

170
0:8:54,767 --> 0:8:57,240
would also minimize
Alvie's destructive force.

171
0:8:57,365 --> 0:9:0,263
But you chose
his company deliberately.

172
0:9:0,388 --> 0:9:1,175
Why?

173
0:9:1,300 --> 0:9:3,333
Obviously
because he's a Wilson substitute.

174
0:9:3,502 --> 0:9:7,52
There are no difference between them,
when Wilson raps about the hood.

175
0:9:7,177 --> 0:9:10,841
I'm not suggesting Alvie's a substitute,
but he would make a great distraction.

176
0:9:11,10 --> 0:9:12,10
From what?

177
0:9:12,135 --> 0:9:13,969
That's what I'm trying to find out.

178
0:9:16,584 --> 0:9:17,584
Go on.

179
0:9:22,860 --> 0:9:24,711
Maybe the heart rate monitor
was a gift.

180
0:9:24,836 --> 0:9:27,983
- That's why no one recognized her.
- Shut up, Alvie.

181
0:9:28,152 --> 0:9:29,559
Anything familiar...

182
0:9:29,960 --> 0:9:32,28
Church, grocery store?

183
0:9:34,400 --> 0:9:35,573
It's okay, Ms. X.

184
0:9:35,742 --> 0:9:37,563
Maybe she's never been
to this town before,

185
0:9:37,688 --> 0:9:39,822
bought the heart rate monitor
on the store's website.

186
0:9:39,997 --> 0:9:42,53
You know that Puerto Ricans
are U.S. citizens, right?

187
0:9:42,178 --> 0:9:44,262
Instead of working the case,
why don't you contemplate

188
0:9:44,387 --> 0:9:46,460
the inanity of an American
with immigration issues?

189
0:9:46,629 --> 0:9:48,754
I had a birth certificate.
I lost it.

190
0:9:48,922 --> 0:9:50,617
- So get a new one.
- I tried that.

191
0:9:50,742 --> 0:9:53,951
But the town hall had burned down
when I was a kid, destroyed the records.

192
0:9:54,76 --> 0:9:55,219
There's only one copy?

193
0:9:55,844 --> 0:9:58,805
They tried to make me fill out forms
before they'd give it to me.

194
0:9:59,198 --> 0:10:2,78
I decided it would be quicker
and easier to do it myself.

195
0:10:2,203 --> 0:10:4,385
- How'd that go?
- They figured out it was forged.

196
0:10:4,510 --> 0:10:6,762
And now, for some reason,
they don't believe anything I say.

197
0:10:6,887 --> 0:10:9,86
They think
I'm lying about being Puerto Rican.

198
0:10:9,211 --> 0:10:11,970
Told me I had to go
to a special hearing to prove it.

199
0:10:12,95 --> 0:10:14,395
What if nothing ever looks familiar?

200
0:10:17,534 --> 0:10:20,288
Then someone will show up...
a spouse, a friend...

201
0:10:20,413 --> 0:10:23,258
to tell you who you really are
and what you should be feeling.

202
0:10:23,383 --> 0:10:24,581
They always do.

203
0:10:25,536 --> 0:10:27,386
I don't know who that is...

204
0:10:28,161 --> 0:10:29,411
But I miss him.

205
0:10:32,822 --> 0:10:34,562
What did they say at the hearing?

206
0:10:34,687 --> 0:10:35,787
I didn't go.

207
0:10:36,103 --> 0:10:37,219
I lied once.

208
0:10:37,388 --> 0:10:39,675
Your mother is Puerto Rican,
therefore, you are Puerto Rican.

209
0:10:39,800 --> 0:10:42,484
Prove your mom's your mom,
find some documentation...

210
0:10:42,609 --> 0:10:44,979
People like that don't listen
to people like me.

211
0:10:45,104 --> 0:10:46,895
Doughnuts! Let's get doughnuts!

212
0:10:47,63 --> 0:10:48,909
- The hearing...
- Everyone loves doughnuts...

213
0:10:49,34 --> 0:10:51,733
glazed, crullers, elephant ears,
even doughnut holes.

214
0:10:51,902 --> 0:10:54,695
Much better than the sporting store.
I bet Mrs. X went there all the time.

215
0:10:55,43 --> 0:10:56,393
We're not here...

216
0:10:57,16 --> 0:10:58,616
<i>And then I realized...</i>

217
0:10:59,643 --> 0:11:2,536
- You make a good point.
- Really? I was making that up.

218
0:11:3,80 --> 0:11:5,210
Dozen glazed, dozen jelly-filled?

219
0:11:6,295 --> 0:11:7,955
You want the usual, right?

220
0:11:8,733 --> 0:11:11,76
Your old friend,
the fried carbohydrate.

221
0:11:11,508 --> 0:11:14,89
She needed the calorically dense food
to support the running habit.

222
0:11:14,394 --> 0:11:15,684
Do you know her name?

223
0:11:18,302 --> 0:11:19,303
Sandy...

224
0:11:19,471 --> 0:11:20,554
Or Shelley.

225
0:11:20,926 --> 0:11:23,265
I don't know. The guy she's with
called her that once.

226
0:11:23,571 --> 0:11:26,310
- I just work here.
- Do you know where they live?

227
0:11:26,987 --> 0:11:29,987
He left a business card
in our free doughnut jar.

228
0:11:30,222 --> 0:11:31,732
It's up on the wall of winners.

229
0:11:39,990 --> 0:11:40,949
Sidney.

230
0:11:43,393 --> 0:11:45,287
God, I was so worried about you.

231
0:11:48,348 --> 0:11:49,499
What happened?

232
0:11:54,18 --> 0:11:55,505


233
0:11:58,341 --> 0:12:0,398
The police said it was too soon
to do anything,

234
0:12:0,523 --> 0:12:2,747
so I started calling hospitals
on my own.

235
0:12:2,872 --> 0:12:4,838
Princeton Plainsboro
wasn't even on my list.

236
0:12:4,963 --> 0:12:7,517
You really think something around here
could have made her sick?

237
0:12:7,685 --> 0:12:10,395
Here, work,
anywhere she could have been exposed.

238
0:12:10,564 --> 0:12:12,772
Why wasn't Princeton Plainsboro
on your list?

239
0:12:14,126 --> 0:12:16,443
It's a long way to run,
even for her.

240
0:12:17,519 --> 0:12:19,419
What is it I do besides run?

241
0:12:23,339 --> 0:12:24,451
You're a lawyer...

242
0:12:24,754 --> 0:12:26,721
civil rights, class action suits.

243
0:12:27,142 --> 0:12:28,692
It's a stressful job.

244
0:12:29,317 --> 0:12:30,957
Running's the way you deal with it.

245
0:12:32,347 --> 0:12:34,378
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Do you have any idea

246
0:12:34,547 --> 0:12:35,961
what would sound like you?

247
0:12:36,816 --> 0:12:37,866
Good point.

248
0:12:38,66 --> 0:12:40,175
<i>So what were you thinking
during all this?</i>

249
0:12:41,257 --> 0:12:43,807
<i>That it was
a strange position to be in.</i>

250
0:12:44,426 --> 0:12:47,881
<i>At that moment, she was more comfortable
with me than with her husband.</i>

251
0:12:48,6 --> 0:12:49,906
<i>And he was picking up on it.</i>

252
0:12:51,197 --> 0:12:52,447
What about you?

253
0:12:53,278 --> 0:12:54,398
What about me how?

254
0:12:55,196 --> 0:12:56,796
There was a sort of...

255
0:12:57,202 --> 0:12:59,302
artificial intimacy between you?

256
0:13:0,110 --> 0:13:1,664
She'd been dependent on you.

257
0:13:1,789 --> 0:13:3,949
Did you find that
attractive on some level?

258
0:13:5,636 --> 0:13:8,36
- Disturbing?
- Those are my two choices?

259
0:13:9,106 --> 0:13:10,288
None of the above.

260
0:13:11,387 --> 0:13:13,667
She was just a patient.
She was interesting.

261
0:13:17,139 --> 0:13:18,539
So we're really...

262
0:13:19,742 --> 0:13:20,742
married?

263
0:13:21,552 --> 0:13:22,802
For four years.

264
0:13:23,393 --> 0:13:25,330
Ms. X, you lead a lemon fresh life.

265
0:13:25,514 --> 0:13:27,456
Found three different cleansers
under the sink.

266
0:13:27,642 --> 0:13:29,258
Cleaned out
the medicine cabinets too.

267
0:13:29,383 --> 0:13:32,269
She won a settlement for some families
whose housing development

268
0:13:32,516 --> 0:13:34,354
was built on an old methane field.

269
0:13:34,582 --> 0:13:37,149
Toxic exposure to methane
could explain this.

270
0:13:38,143 --> 0:13:39,143
I surf?

271
0:13:39,583 --> 0:13:40,944
You stopped before we met.

272
0:13:41,956 --> 0:13:43,506
You've been too busy.

273
0:13:45,514 --> 0:13:46,741
And we're married?

274
0:13:49,12 --> 0:13:50,579
All right, it's nothing personal.

275
0:13:50,747 --> 0:13:53,988
Bet she didn't think you were her type
back when you first met either.

276
0:13:54,113 --> 0:13:57,156
We'll take her back to the hospital,
test her blood and urine

277
0:13:57,281 --> 0:13:58,600
and start treatment.

278
0:14:0,900 --> 0:14:1,923
I'm all right.

279
0:14:2,676 --> 0:14:4,259
- What happened?
- I don't know.

280
0:14:5,52 --> 0:14:8,102
- My foot suddenly went numb.
- Her pants are wet.

281
0:14:9,464 --> 0:14:11,14
Urinary incontinence.

282
0:14:12,186 --> 0:14:14,636
She's having complex
partial seizures.

283
0:14:15,429 --> 0:14:16,646
This isn't methane.

284
0:14:17,491 --> 0:14:19,466
Leave the bucket.
We need to get her to...

285
0:14:19,591 --> 0:14:20,591
<i>Seizures?</i>

286
0:14:22,8 --> 0:14:23,913
This is the second diagnosis
you've come up with

287
0:14:24,38 --> 0:14:25,655
that has a personal
resonance for you.

288
0:14:26,404 --> 0:14:28,867
I'm choosing my diagnoses
based on personal issues?

289
0:14:29,529 --> 0:14:32,420
She fell down the stairs, peed her pants
'cause Wilson dumped her too?

290
0:14:32,545 --> 0:14:35,184
You're choosing to tell me
about this case, so let's look at it.

291
0:14:35,309 --> 0:14:37,459
First you were fixated
on a harmful toxin from her past,

292
0:14:38,32 --> 0:14:39,747
you're worried
about a harmful toxin...

293
0:14:39,872 --> 0:14:41,481
Chase had the toxin idea.

294
0:14:42,131 --> 0:14:44,799
- Maybe he's obsessed with my past.
- A seizure disorder?

295
0:14:45,54 --> 0:14:46,551
Which is also not a toxin.

296
0:14:46,719 --> 0:14:50,52
But which is most likely caused
by an old injury to the brain.

297
0:14:50,471 --> 0:14:53,405
Why do you see your past
as such a threat?

298
0:14:54,166 --> 0:14:57,20
Not only am I unthreatened by it,
I was trying to get it back.

299
0:14:57,912 --> 0:14:59,64
There's a ding mark.

300
0:15:0,98 --> 0:15:2,790
It's a piece of junk.
It was dinged when it came in.

301
0:15:3,486 --> 0:15:6,136
Sure, the cup marks
and the scuffs and the paint

302
0:15:6,261 --> 0:15:8,353
and those three chips.
This fourth one is new.

303
0:15:8,478 --> 0:15:10,479
I run a pawn shop,
not a storage company.

304
0:15:10,606 --> 0:15:12,6
Do you want it or not?

305
0:15:12,542 --> 0:15:13,891
That should be it.

306
0:15:16,242 --> 0:15:18,543
You said you pawned five books.
There's only four.

307
0:15:18,668 --> 0:15:19,956
That's all there is.

308
0:15:21,122 --> 0:15:23,880
Where's
<i>Approach to the acute abdomen</i>?

309
0:15:26,463 --> 0:15:27,467
Sold it.

310
0:15:28,983 --> 0:15:30,554
- To?
- I can't tell you.

311
0:15:30,723 --> 0:15:32,419
It's a law, and it should be.

312
0:15:32,544 --> 0:15:35,591
Crazy bastards like you
try to hunt down their stuff.

313
0:15:38,719 --> 0:15:40,319
How much for the pile?

314
0:15:43,47 --> 0:15:44,47
$500.

315
0:15:45,422 --> 0:15:46,868
You said it was junk.

316
0:15:47,488 --> 0:15:49,281
It's your junk.
You want it.

317
0:15:49,406 --> 0:15:51,306
$500... take it or leave it.

318
0:16:0,69 --> 0:16:2,294
Why is it so important
that you get your stuff back?

319
0:16:3,553 --> 0:16:5,490
Unlike the rest of humanity...

320
0:16:5,615 --> 0:16:8,83
Who's okay
when their belongings are taken.

321
0:16:8,208 --> 0:16:10,343
Everyone wants their stuff.
That's why it's their stuff.

322
0:16:10,511 --> 0:16:12,387
Everyone doesn't pay
5 times what it's worth.

323
0:16:12,555 --> 0:16:13,855
I like my stuff.

324
0:16:14,578 --> 0:16:16,308
I hate it when Wilson moves it...

325
0:16:17,494 --> 0:16:19,244
This is not about Wilson!

326
0:16:30,682 --> 0:16:31,682
Say it.

327
0:16:39,911 --> 0:16:41,502
I wasn't gonna say anything.

328
0:16:48,26 --> 0:16:49,49


329
0:16:49,813 --> 0:16:51,835
31, 31! Hike!

330
0:16:55,79 --> 0:16:57,641
- First down!
- One more, you get a touchdown.

331
0:17:7,318 --> 0:17:9,252
You can't run for the touchdown.

332
0:17:12,949 --> 0:17:14,49
And... Hike!

333
0:17:15,785 --> 0:17:18,620
<i>Wait, wait... You seriously thought
you were gonna tell me</i>

334
0:17:18,788 --> 0:17:21,164
that Wilson showed up
but not tell me what he said?

335
0:17:21,332 --> 0:17:23,15
Because I thought
you were a smart guy

336
0:17:23,140 --> 0:17:25,542
who didn't need the obvious
spelled out to him.

337
0:17:25,667 --> 0:17:28,14
Wilson noticed
that I didn't come to my office all day.

338
0:17:28,139 --> 0:17:30,448
He came to find me,
wanted to make sure I'm okay...

339
0:17:30,573 --> 0:17:32,198
Boring, boring, boring.

340
0:17:32,386 --> 0:17:35,136
But you thought it was important
to tell me about nerf football?

341
0:17:37,385 --> 0:17:38,473
Sorry. Your story.

342
0:17:39,75 --> 0:17:40,75
Continue.

343
0:17:45,785 --> 0:17:46,856
You okay?

344
0:17:49,802 --> 0:17:52,904
It was my mother's.
She died when I was four.

345
0:17:53,455 --> 0:17:54,876
It's all I have left.

346
0:17:55,327 --> 0:17:56,627
That's very sad.

347
0:17:57,543 --> 0:17:59,265
I set up an immigration hearing.

348
0:17:59,390 --> 0:18:1,954
No, House,
I'm gonna end up in jail or worse...

349
0:18:2,79 --> 0:18:4,456
the Dominican or someplace.
<i>Que se yo. Que no.</i>

350
0:18:5,782 --> 0:18:6,831
<i>Interesting.</i>

351
0:18:7,4 --> 0:18:10,213
You present yourself as not giving
a damn about other people's emotions,

352
0:18:10,381 --> 0:18:12,681
but your actions indicate otherwise.

353
0:18:13,331 --> 0:18:15,833
You dismiss Alvie's story
about his mother,

354
0:18:15,958 --> 0:18:17,887
but you cared enough
to schedule a hearing.

355
0:18:18,55 --> 0:18:19,855
I cared for eight seconds.

356
0:18:20,450 --> 0:18:22,50
Then I got distracted.

357
0:18:28,495 --> 0:18:30,429
<i>We've kept
the patient up for 12 hours now.</i>

358
0:18:30,554 --> 0:18:33,87
<i>No hint of seizure-like activity.
We should shut this down.</i>

359
0:18:33,212 --> 0:18:35,401
Try a strobe light, add more stress.

360
0:18:35,526 --> 0:18:37,198
<i>There's plenty of stress in here.</i>

361
0:18:37,367 --> 0:18:39,397
Don't we ever do anything but work?

362
0:18:40,403 --> 0:18:42,713
- You run.
- That's just more work.

363
0:18:42,838 --> 0:18:44,88
What about fun?

364
0:18:44,778 --> 0:18:46,715
God, how can we be this boring?

365
0:18:46,840 --> 0:18:48,527
Apparently, without her memory,

366
0:18:48,652 --> 0:18:50,547
the patient's personality
has returned

367
0:18:50,672 --> 0:18:53,272
to what you might call
its natural state.

368
0:18:54,154 --> 0:18:57,404
Seems she had a wake-up call
while she was at college.

369
0:18:58,468 --> 0:19:0,155
Her brother died in a car accident.

370
0:19:0,280 --> 0:19:2,98
She decided to make
her life mean something.

371
0:19:2,477 --> 0:19:3,927
Went to law school.

372
0:19:4,908 --> 0:19:6,408
Now that's all gone.

373
0:19:8,344 --> 0:19:10,293
The thing that caused the change
is gone...

374
0:19:10,418 --> 0:19:12,578
So the change itself is gone.

375
0:19:14,153 --> 0:19:17,739
I knew the psychological aspects
of this case would interest you.

376
0:19:17,974 --> 0:19:20,313
Bet you got a theory already.
What is it?

377
0:19:20,787 --> 0:19:22,187
It's not relevant.

378
0:19:22,700 --> 0:19:23,750
What is it?

379
0:19:24,724 --> 0:19:26,655
Why do you care about my theory?

380
0:19:29,601 --> 0:19:30,835
I think he just...

381
0:19:31,3 --> 0:19:32,3
bores her.

382
0:19:32,725 --> 0:19:34,914
She's at an earlier
stage of development.

383
0:19:35,39 --> 0:19:36,284
She's looking...

384
0:19:36,687 --> 0:19:38,883
at her grown-up future,
and it puts her to sleep.

385
0:19:39,288 --> 0:19:40,838
If he just bored her,

386
0:19:41,316 --> 0:19:42,847
she'd hide it to be polite.

387
0:19:43,475 --> 0:19:44,985
Their problem is synchronicity.

388
0:19:45,110 --> 0:19:47,541
Just like you and me, House,
they're not on the same page.

389
0:19:47,666 --> 0:19:50,681
He talks to her
like someone he shares history with.

390
0:19:51,230 --> 0:19:54,688
From her point of view,
he's a stranger forcing intimacy on her.

391
0:19:55,319 --> 0:19:57,480
Of course she doesn't like him.
He's not helping.

392
0:19:57,605 --> 0:19:59,967
He can feel he's losing his wife,

393
0:20:1,75 --> 0:20:2,753
and it makes him come on stronger.

394
0:20:6,704 --> 0:20:8,604
He almost did lose his wife.

395
0:20:35,757 --> 0:20:38,401
The breathing problem was caused
by fluid overload in the lungs.

396
0:20:38,526 --> 0:20:39,870
Diabetes insipidus.

397
0:20:39,995 --> 0:20:42,333
And the D.I. came from damage
to the hypothalamus.

398
0:20:42,458 --> 0:20:44,850
Hypothalamus here,
hence the D.I. and incontinence.

399
0:20:44,975 --> 0:20:46,935
They mingle here.
There's the amnesia.

400
0:20:47,60 --> 0:20:49,848
The motor cortex, that's the paralysis.
What they all have in common?

401
0:20:49,973 --> 0:20:51,958
<i>Now you're just
doing this to mess with me.</i>

402
0:20:52,703 --> 0:20:55,545
What possible relevance does
this differential have to your problems?

403
0:20:55,870 --> 0:20:59,471
It ends with a diagnosis
of spongiform encephalitis.

404
0:21:0,356 --> 0:21:2,809
I convinced the team
to cut out part of this woman's brain.

405
0:21:2,934 --> 0:21:4,512
That's not interesting to you?

406
0:21:4,920 --> 0:21:6,823
Not even if it's the amygdala?

407
0:21:7,531 --> 0:21:9,488
She'll lose
all her long-term memory.

408
0:21:9,613 --> 0:21:12,407
This is where you tell me that being
cavalier with someone else's past

409
0:21:12,532 --> 0:21:14,549
has nothing to do
with avoiding your own past.

410
0:21:14,674 --> 0:21:16,206
The case is irrelevant.

411
0:21:16,331 --> 0:21:18,531
You just found it...
Interesting.

412
0:21:20,160 --> 0:21:22,155
Aren't therapists
supposed to be nurturing?

413
0:21:22,896 --> 0:21:23,896
Nowhere...

414
0:21:24,264 --> 0:21:25,864
Is that in the manual.

415
0:21:27,367 --> 0:21:29,545
Look, you've been in therapy
for a year.

416
0:21:29,670 --> 0:21:32,957
When I ask you to talk about anything,
I mean anything that affects you,

417
0:21:33,206 --> 0:21:35,84
what upset you, what made you mad

418
0:21:35,209 --> 0:21:36,809
or relieved or joyful.

419
0:21:37,202 --> 0:21:40,352
You want me to believe
that this case means nothing?

420
0:21:42,717 --> 0:21:43,717
Then...

421
0:21:47,421 --> 0:21:48,681
Why should I listen to it?

422
0:22:9,667 --> 0:22:11,677
Are you charging me for this time?

423
0:22:15,248 --> 0:22:16,698
This is ridiculous.

424
0:22:19,253 --> 0:22:20,254
What's that?

425
0:22:21,87 --> 0:22:22,439
On the back of your arm?

426
0:22:25,102 --> 0:22:27,136
It's just a bruise.
And I fell.

427
0:22:28,130 --> 0:22:29,555
You remember falling?

428
0:22:32,133 --> 0:22:33,333
I was drunk...

429
0:22:33,733 --> 0:22:35,410
Hence the balance issues.

430
0:22:35,535 --> 0:22:38,882
Well, it looks like you fell
on the tip of someone's boot.

431
0:22:45,653 --> 0:22:48,303
I said something
that someone objected to.

432
0:22:49,380 --> 0:22:51,911
- If you don't remember, then how...
- It's the way it is

433
0:22:52,79 --> 0:22:53,375
when someone hits me.

434
0:22:54,220 --> 0:22:56,223
People who kick
when you're down are jerks,

435
0:22:56,348 --> 0:22:58,842
but they're generally
not irrational jerks.

436
0:22:58,967 --> 0:23:1,571
You got drunk enough to get
into a bar fight and not remember,

437
0:23:1,696 --> 0:23:3,931
and you've been insisting
that everything's fine?

438
0:23:5,757 --> 0:23:7,552
Why go out and get blind drunk?

439
0:23:8,17 --> 0:23:9,629
Were you looking for a fight?

440
0:23:11,183 --> 0:23:12,289
I don't know.

441
0:23:17,970 --> 0:23:19,480
What have you screwed up?

442
0:23:19,889 --> 0:23:20,699
What?

443
0:23:20,824 --> 0:23:22,734
You say
that when you've been hit in the past,

444
0:23:22,902 --> 0:23:25,569
it's because you provoked it
with something that you said,

445
0:23:25,694 --> 0:23:27,709
which means
you're well aware of the risks.

446
0:23:27,834 --> 0:23:28,948
So on some level,

447
0:23:29,116 --> 0:23:31,671
you were in that bar looking
for someone to hurt you.

448
0:23:33,465 --> 0:23:35,163
Logically, people punish themselves

449
0:23:35,496 --> 0:23:38,285
for something they did
or something they didn't do.

450
0:23:40,234 --> 0:23:41,234
So what...

451
0:23:42,435 --> 0:23:43,785
Did you screw up?

452
0:23:51,820 --> 0:23:52,970
I don't know.

453
0:24:3,782 --> 0:24:5,782
Okay, there may be a problem.

454
0:24:8,693 --> 0:24:10,156


455
0:24:12,763 --> 0:24:13,863
All right...

456
0:24:14,845 --> 0:24:16,438
Let's talk about Wilson.

457
0:24:18,590 --> 0:24:21,970
I told him your book
was contaminated with Anthrax spores.

458
0:24:22,95 --> 0:24:23,645
Then I gave him $300.

459
0:24:23,990 --> 0:24:25,639
The address of the buyer.

460
0:24:27,715 --> 0:24:29,675
Maybe I was hasty
in asking you to move out.

461
0:24:30,410 --> 0:24:32,470
Why don't you stay with me and Sam
for a while?

462
0:24:32,638 --> 0:24:34,222
There's no need to hurry things.

463
0:24:35,273 --> 0:24:36,723
What prompted this?

464
0:24:38,268 --> 0:24:39,679
Look, the whole idea

465
0:24:39,804 --> 0:24:42,189
was that after Mayfield,
you wouldn't be on your own.

466
0:24:42,555 --> 0:24:45,288
I can touch base with you
a lot more easily if you're staying...

467
0:24:45,646 --> 0:24:46,943
God's sake, Wilson.

468
0:24:47,462 --> 0:24:50,215
You really span the chasm
from wishy to washy.

469
0:24:51,39 --> 0:24:53,250
If you're gonna be an ass,
be an ass.

470
0:24:53,551 --> 0:24:54,751
Stick with it.

471
0:24:54,876 --> 0:24:56,494
<i>Why were you being so hard on him,</i>

472
0:24:56,662 --> 0:24:58,955
- when he was being conciliatory?
- Come on.

473
0:25:0,15 --> 0:25:1,815
Cuddy played on his guilt.

474
0:25:2,352 --> 0:25:5,44
- She put him up to this.
- How do you know that?

475
0:25:5,212 --> 0:25:7,358
How do you know
this wasn't entirely his own idea?

476
0:25:7,483 --> 0:25:8,830
Two reasons: first,

477
0:25:9,391 --> 0:25:12,176
He wants to create
the perfect environment to be with Sam.

478
0:25:12,601 --> 0:25:15,54
He's been thinking about
asking me to leave for a while.

479
0:25:15,330 --> 0:25:17,674
Finally he does it
and immediately turns around

480
0:25:17,799 --> 0:25:19,976
and changes his mind, no.
He talked to somebody.

481
0:25:21,7 --> 0:25:22,103
Maybe it was Sam.

482
0:25:23,513 --> 0:25:25,363
<i>Yeah, that's a possibility.</i>

483
0:25:26,533 --> 0:25:29,688
I want this to be the last serious
relationship I ever have.

484
0:25:30,420 --> 0:25:31,997
I want this to be the one.

485
0:25:32,306 --> 0:25:33,306
Me too.

486
0:25:37,228 --> 0:25:40,329
Where's House?
It's not as meaningful without him.

487
0:25:42,724 --> 0:25:43,541
Not Sam.

488
0:25:44,158 --> 0:25:46,186
That still doesn't answer why Cuddy.

489
0:25:46,445 --> 0:25:48,212
Because they've been
talking about me.

490
0:25:48,747 --> 0:25:50,840
She called me
to check on the patient,

491
0:25:51,8 --> 0:25:52,981
which she never does
without a reason.

492
0:25:53,259 --> 0:25:54,844
I asked why, and she said...

493
0:25:55,170 --> 0:25:57,231
She's a barracuda attorney, House.

494
0:25:57,356 --> 0:25:59,473
These are the kind of patients
we like to keep happy.

495
0:25:59,641 --> 0:26:3,200
Right now the patient's lucky
if she can spell jurisprudence.

496
0:26:3,325 --> 0:26:6,22
Yeah, but when
she gets that memory back,

497
0:26:6,648 --> 0:26:9,859
which we are trying to make happen,
she'll be able to spell lawsuit.

498
0:26:10,428 --> 0:26:11,937
I'm just touching base.

499
0:26:13,372 --> 0:26:14,572
Touching base.

500
0:26:15,539 --> 0:26:17,825
Wilson used exactly the same phrase.

501
0:26:17,993 --> 0:26:20,411
Colluding about me
is her favorite pastime.

502
0:26:21,872 --> 0:26:23,457
Okay, you think they talked.

503
0:26:26,293 --> 0:26:28,620
How do you think
that conversation went?

504
0:26:32,657 --> 0:26:34,357
I'm worried about House.

505
0:26:36,594 --> 0:26:37,594
Me too.

506
0:26:38,396 --> 0:26:39,722
Couldn't you have waited?

507
0:26:40,245 --> 0:26:42,433
It's way too early for him
to be on his own,

508
0:26:42,750 --> 0:26:44,143
back in the old apartment.

509
0:26:44,383 --> 0:26:47,140
- What makes you think he can handle it?
- I offered to find him a new place.

510
0:26:47,265 --> 0:26:50,814
- You've to let him back.
- Sam and I just got him out.

511
0:26:50,939 --> 0:26:53,611
You know what House is like.
He's self-destructive.

512
0:26:53,779 --> 0:26:57,237
Without constant supervision,
he's gonna slide back into drugs.

513
0:26:57,540 --> 0:26:59,827
If you're not watching him,
I've got to.

514
0:27:3,496 --> 0:27:4,789
So they don't trust you.

515
0:27:5,548 --> 0:27:7,106
They assume you'll fail.

516
0:27:7,600 --> 0:27:9,312
Are these their fears or yours?

517
0:27:12,406 --> 0:27:15,8
Let's turn on the lights.

518
0:27:17,553 --> 0:27:18,753
In your brain.

519
0:27:19,605 --> 0:27:21,831
Maybe they did
talk about you, but...

520
0:27:23,300 --> 0:27:25,757
How do you know
it didn't happen like this?

521
0:27:27,370 --> 0:27:29,540
- I'm worried about House.
- Why?

522
0:27:29,665 --> 0:27:31,830
It's the first time he'll be on his own
since Mayfield.

523
0:27:31,955 --> 0:27:35,486
You're being overprotective. He doesn't
need to be wrapped in cotton wool.

524
0:27:35,654 --> 0:27:38,245
But you know that, or you wouldn't
have asked him to move out.

525
0:27:39,785 --> 0:27:42,302
I guess this is really about me.
It's just...

526
0:27:42,427 --> 0:27:43,877
I feel like a jerk.

527
0:27:44,270 --> 0:27:47,456
Sure, Sam and I are gonna want to be
on our own eventually,

528
0:27:48,258 --> 0:27:50,319
but I kind of sprang this on him.

529
0:27:50,444 --> 0:27:52,345
The right way
would've been to just tell him

530
0:27:52,470 --> 0:27:54,940
to take as long as he needed,
that there's no hurry.

531
0:27:55,607 --> 0:27:58,128
So it's not what you did,
but how you did it.

532
0:27:58,711 --> 0:28:0,481
That matters in a friendship.

533
0:28:1,215 --> 0:28:2,665
I need to fix this.

534
0:28:2,895 --> 0:28:5,873
Why don't you talk to him
about moving back in?

535
0:28:6,818 --> 0:28:7,852
Just touch base.

536
0:28:9,821 --> 0:28:11,957
We're having a consent issue
with the patient.

537
0:28:12,366 --> 0:28:14,358
Wait a minute.
Taub's not here.

538
0:28:14,851 --> 0:28:15,752
Yeah, he is.

539
0:28:15,877 --> 0:28:17,830
We're having a consent issue
with the patient.

540
0:28:17,955 --> 0:28:21,185
What's Taub doing
in my imaginary version of this scene?

541
0:28:21,310 --> 0:28:23,913
Your version needed to be ended,
'cause it's crap.

542
0:28:24,38 --> 0:28:25,759
It's all sweetness and light and...

543
0:28:25,884 --> 0:28:28,90
Faith that I'm gonna
choose the right path.

544
0:28:28,665 --> 0:28:30,326
Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.

545
0:28:33,620 --> 0:28:36,489
I have as much evidence for mine
as you do for yours.

546
0:28:37,257 --> 0:28:38,841
I know Wilson's your friend.

547
0:28:39,125 --> 0:28:41,783
So he could be wondering
if he did right by you.

548
0:28:42,318 --> 0:28:44,80
He wouldn't have
asked you to move out

549
0:28:44,205 --> 0:28:47,96
unless he was convinced
you could handle life on your own.

550
0:28:47,361 --> 0:28:50,108
And I know that he and Cuddy
have gone behind my back before

551
0:28:50,233 --> 0:28:52,553
to strategize
about the House problem.

552
0:28:53,171 --> 0:28:55,274
So there's truth in both versions.

553
0:28:55,442 --> 0:28:58,642
But you choose to focus on the parts
that make you uncomfortable.

554
0:28:58,974 --> 0:28:59,737
So...

555
0:29:6,260 --> 0:29:7,460
Why are you...

556
0:29:8,37 --> 0:29:9,187
and Wilson...

557
0:29:10,765 --> 0:29:11,765
friends?

558
0:29:14,535 --> 0:29:17,513
Do you think this friendship
is the best you can do?

559
0:29:18,748 --> 0:29:20,883
Wilson is not a consolation prize.

560
0:29:21,701 --> 0:29:23,629
There...
You're defending him.

561
0:29:24,282 --> 0:29:26,97
A minute ago, he was skulking around

562
0:29:26,265 --> 0:29:28,473
like some sort of manipulative Iago.

563
0:29:30,448 --> 0:29:31,602
He's my friend.

564
0:29:31,969 --> 0:29:33,687
So what do you value in him?

565
0:29:39,577 --> 0:29:42,764
I can say whatever I want to him,
and he'll never leave.

566
0:29:43,307 --> 0:29:44,634
He's sort of leaving.

567
0:29:45,482 --> 0:29:47,502
At least,
he won't be around as much...

568
0:29:49,671 --> 0:29:52,498
Because he's putting Sam first.

569
0:29:52,907 --> 0:29:53,907
For now.

570
0:29:54,910 --> 0:29:58,146
After the divorce, he'll probably ask me
to move in again.

571
0:29:58,271 --> 0:29:59,713
I take the long view.

572
0:30:1,749 --> 0:30:3,717
- You say that to Wilson?
- Are you kidding?

573
0:30:3,885 --> 0:30:6,247
That's the kind of remark
that leads people to hate you.

574
0:30:11,392 --> 0:30:13,587
Maybe you've been right
from the beginning.

575
0:30:13,936 --> 0:30:15,312
Maybe this isn't about him.

576
0:30:17,798 --> 0:30:19,801
You say
that I finally agree with you?

577
0:30:19,926 --> 0:30:21,944
Do you just argue
the opposite of whatever I say?

578
0:30:22,112 --> 0:30:24,815
I don't mean the Wilson thing
doesn't bother you,

579
0:30:24,940 --> 0:30:28,221
but it sounds like he's the closest
you can come to a safe relationship.

580
0:30:28,346 --> 0:30:30,828
You'd have to do something major
to screw it up.

581
0:30:32,271 --> 0:30:34,457
What else have you
been involved in this week?

582
0:30:36,225 --> 0:30:38,2
What would you want
to punish yourself for?

583
0:30:39,988 --> 0:30:41,788
I told you, I don't know.

584
0:30:44,366 --> 0:30:47,94
Okay, let's approach it
from a different angle.

585
0:30:47,738 --> 0:30:51,116
Have you gotten
any other people angry at you

586
0:30:51,599 --> 0:30:53,100
over anything?

587
0:30:55,896 --> 0:30:58,63
That's why I called it
an ordinary week.

588
0:30:58,682 --> 0:31:0,382
Okay.
Tell me about it.

589
0:31:3,520 --> 0:31:4,737


590
0:31:6,507 --> 0:31:8,432
You'd be losing
a part of your brain.

591
0:31:8,557 --> 0:31:9,767
It is my brain.

592
0:31:9,892 --> 0:31:12,69
Why is it not my right to consent?

593
0:31:12,560 --> 0:31:13,537
I'm sorry,

594
0:31:13,705 --> 0:31:15,508
but I'll take this
to court if necessary.

595
0:31:15,633 --> 0:31:18,395
Sidney's in no position to make
decisions about herself right now.

596
0:31:18,520 --> 0:31:19,892
She doesn't know who she is.

597
0:31:20,17 --> 0:31:21,795
I read your consent form,
I understood it.

598
0:31:21,963 --> 0:31:24,215
- I want the surgery.
- Why wouldn't she?

599
0:31:24,383 --> 0:31:27,384
Of course she's willing to risk
losing her memories permanently.

600
0:31:27,552 --> 0:31:30,232
She has no idea how important
those memories are.

601
0:31:30,537 --> 0:31:32,14
Does she even know what risk is?

602
0:31:32,572 --> 0:31:34,350
She's never lost anything.

603
0:31:34,518 --> 0:31:36,484
Without the surgery,
she'll lose everything.

604
0:31:36,950 --> 0:31:40,212
The prion infection will continue
to advance and destroy her whole brain.

605
0:31:40,524 --> 0:31:42,174
There has to be another way.

606
0:31:43,383 --> 0:31:44,193
Please.

607
0:31:47,229 --> 0:31:48,781
I'm speaking for my wife,

608
0:31:49,265 --> 0:31:53,262
the wife I lived with for four years
who isn't here and can't defend herself.

609
0:31:55,320 --> 0:31:56,497
Are you listening?

610
0:31:57,89 --> 0:31:58,939
Well, you can stop arguing,

611
0:31:59,90 --> 0:32:0,876
'cause it doesn't matter anymore.

612
0:32:1,509 --> 0:32:3,520
Look at the variability
in the heart rate.

613
0:32:4,5 --> 0:32:6,64
The S.E. has spread
into the brain stem.

614
0:32:6,460 --> 0:32:8,968
Wherever it is,
you can still cut it out.

615
0:32:10,627 --> 0:32:13,13
No. We can't cut the brain stem.

616
0:32:14,148 --> 0:32:17,514
This thing's moving too quickly.
Surgery's no longer an option,

617
0:32:17,978 --> 0:32:20,505
which I guess means you've won.
Congratulations.

618
0:32:22,7 --> 0:32:24,441
Put in a pacer
and start her on chemo and radiation.

619
0:32:24,713 --> 0:32:26,925
It won't cure her,
but it'll buy a couple weeks

620
0:32:27,50 --> 0:32:29,113
so she can find out who she is
before she dies.

621
0:32:32,182 --> 0:32:33,617
That was pretty rough.

622
0:32:34,61 --> 0:32:35,911
Do you always break the news
that way?

623
0:32:36,184 --> 0:32:38,18
Or were you short-handing it for me?

624
0:32:38,946 --> 0:32:40,457
Husband was being an idiot.

625
0:32:40,974 --> 0:32:42,595
Well, he was asking for it.

626
0:32:43,610 --> 0:32:46,630
But, to punish him
you have to punish the wife too.

627
0:32:47,174 --> 0:32:49,57
Why did he make you so angry?

628
0:32:49,299 --> 0:32:51,594
Because he didn't want
to cooperate with you?

629
0:32:53,60 --> 0:32:56,73
He'd rather risk his wife's life
than their marriage.

630
0:32:56,880 --> 0:32:58,310
People's brains stop working

631
0:32:58,435 --> 0:33:0,686
when they think they're gonna
lose someone they love.

632
0:33:2,671 --> 0:33:3,814
Your leg hurt?

633
0:33:7,776 --> 0:33:8,861
It's all right.

634
0:33:11,730 --> 0:33:13,115
Anyone else you pissed off?

635
0:33:21,708 --> 0:33:23,125
50 bucks for the book.

636
0:33:23,709 --> 0:33:24,835
Forget it.

637
0:33:25,335 --> 0:33:27,838
You paid $25.
That's 100% return.

638
0:33:28,6 --> 0:33:30,487
That's what I paid.
But it's a rare surgical text,

639
0:33:30,612 --> 0:33:33,93
nearly 100 years old,
plate's in mint condition.

640
0:33:33,261 --> 0:33:35,541
That book's worth
several thousand dollars.

641
0:33:36,192 --> 0:33:37,56
$2,000.

642
0:33:37,607 --> 0:33:39,558
- I'll write you a check.
- Nice try.

643
0:33:39,726 --> 0:33:40,624
Face it.

644
0:33:40,749 --> 0:33:43,854
I had the wit to recognize
something valuable when I saw it.

645
0:33:44,149 --> 0:33:47,315
In the great Darwinian race,
I get my just reward.

646
0:33:48,14 --> 0:33:49,516
You become roadkill.

647
0:34:1,827 --> 0:34:3,998
Yo, House,
you want to stop by the library?

648
0:34:4,123 --> 0:34:6,377
'Cause I got a book to return.
Ta-ka-plow!

649
0:34:6,893 --> 0:34:8,811
Old Professor tried to hoard/hog

650
0:34:8,936 --> 0:34:11,439
you can't stop Alvie
with no guard-ass dog.

651
0:34:11,564 --> 0:34:12,707
Anyone see you?

652
0:34:12,832 --> 0:34:14,509
Prof saw me
walking down the driveway.

653
0:34:14,634 --> 0:34:16,616
He said the roses
need more fertilizer.

654
0:34:22,419 --> 0:34:25,462
I didn't know there was
a section of the brain just for hope.

655
0:34:26,231 --> 0:34:27,620
It's very, very tiny.

656
0:34:28,1 --> 0:34:31,253
We used fluoroscopy to guide pacemaker
placement in the patient's heart.

657
0:34:34,695 --> 0:34:37,40
Rapidly progressive
dilated cardiomyopathy.

658
0:34:37,165 --> 0:34:39,827
This isn't S.E., and whatever it is,
it's not just in her brain.

659
0:34:39,952 --> 0:34:41,394
It's attacking her whole body.

660
0:34:41,519 --> 0:34:44,368
You work for House?
We're teammates. Isn't that cool?

661
0:34:49,840 --> 0:34:52,68
- What the hell?
- We're taking you into custody

662
0:34:52,193 --> 0:34:53,297
deportation order.

663
0:34:53,422 --> 0:34:55,801
I'm a citizen.
You're disrespecting Puerto Rico.

664
0:34:55,969 --> 0:34:58,187
If you're a citizen,
why'd you miss your hearing?

665
0:35:1,489 --> 0:35:2,789
You called them?

666
0:35:8,905 --> 0:35:10,205
What's going on?

667
0:35:16,277 --> 0:35:17,281


668
0:35:19,355 --> 0:35:22,286
We're trying to stabilize her heart.
She's still tachy and hypotensive.

669
0:35:22,597 --> 0:35:23,579
<i>Brain, heart,</i>

670
0:35:23,880 --> 0:35:25,461
and rapidly progressing.

671
0:35:26,502 --> 0:35:28,596
<i>Endocarditis, slow-moving
infection in her heart</i>

672
0:35:28,721 --> 0:35:30,127
<i>throws clots to her brain.</i>

673
0:35:30,808 --> 0:35:32,458
I'm not talking to you.

674
0:35:34,427 --> 0:35:35,912
How could you turn me in?

675
0:35:36,37 --> 0:35:37,926
<i>Her extreme exercise
suppresses her system,</i>

676
0:35:38,94 --> 0:35:39,680
allows the infection to smolder.

677
0:35:39,805 --> 0:35:42,765
<i>Or allows an old infection
to reactivate it, t. B.</i>

678
0:35:44,225 --> 0:35:46,106
Start her on a multidrug regimen.

679
0:35:46,231 --> 0:35:47,824
I don't like you, House.

680
0:35:48,625 --> 0:35:49,550
I hate you.

681
0:35:49,675 --> 0:35:51,690
<i>Even I.V. antibiotics
will take time to work.</i>

682
0:35:52,654 --> 0:35:55,424
A general reminder,
the use of cell phones is prohibited.

683
0:35:55,549 --> 0:35:58,112
Give her the first dose directly
into the lungs in the O.R.

684
0:35:58,237 --> 0:36:0,404
Before the less gentle
arrest for contempt.

685
0:36:0,529 --> 0:36:2,521
Put her in an isolation
room with U.V. light.

686
0:36:2,646 --> 0:36:5,90
And get yourselves tested.
You've all been exposed.

687
0:36:9,2 --> 0:36:10,334
Docket number 4378.

688
0:36:17,131 --> 0:36:18,175
You are?

689
0:36:18,554 --> 0:36:20,404
I am Mr. Alvarez's doctor.

690
0:36:28,196 --> 0:36:32,160
Your honor, DNA evidence proving
the matriarchal lineage of Juan Alvarez.

691
0:36:35,488 --> 0:36:37,907
My mother's DNA
was still on that cross?

692
0:36:38,408 --> 0:36:39,508
It could be.

693
0:36:41,3 --> 0:36:42,153
You faked it?

694
0:36:45,856 --> 0:36:48,326
It wasn't just me.
You lied to them too!

695
0:36:48,909 --> 0:36:51,346
I'm better at it than you are.

696
0:36:52,458 --> 0:36:54,382
I'm gonna repaint
your whole apartment now,

697
0:36:54,507 --> 0:36:56,421
make the drapes
match the carpet now!

698
0:36:59,562 --> 0:37:1,381
Lungs sound wet.
O-2 sats are dropping.

699
0:37:1,506 --> 0:37:3,595
May need to tube her.
Grab some I.V. Furosemide.

700
0:37:8,393 --> 0:37:9,202
Wait.

701
0:37:9,644 --> 0:37:11,954
She's crashing.
We need to get her on a vent.

702
0:37:22,901 --> 0:37:24,654
There's something on her ankle.

703
0:37:27,949 --> 0:37:28,949
Tattoo.

704
0:37:29,748 --> 0:37:31,98
"Eddie would go."

705
0:37:31,510 --> 0:37:34,18
It's a surfing phrase.
Must be from her earlier life.

706
0:37:35,30 --> 0:37:36,628
She tried to get it removed,

707
0:37:36,912 --> 0:37:38,932
but they only took off
the top layers of skin.

708
0:37:39,57 --> 0:37:42,467
The ink is still in the deeper layers.
Set off an allergic reaction.

709
0:37:43,114 --> 0:37:45,679
She was fine until she started
the long-distance running.

710
0:37:45,847 --> 0:37:48,202
The ultra-marathoning
modified her immune system,

711
0:37:48,327 --> 0:37:50,180
set off the allergic reaction.

712
0:37:50,705 --> 0:37:52,816
We did a full thickness skin graft,

713
0:37:53,524 --> 0:37:54,730
and she'll be okay.

714
0:37:56,226 --> 0:37:58,671
So you were right...
In the end.

715
0:37:59,963 --> 0:38:1,263
It was her past.

716
0:38:2,716 --> 0:38:4,156
Did she get her memory back?

717
0:38:5,453 --> 0:38:6,453
Not yet.

718
0:38:7,830 --> 0:38:8,785
Will she?

719
0:38:9,449 --> 0:38:10,699
No way to know.

720
0:38:10,988 --> 0:38:12,831
I think roses are my favorite.

721
0:38:14,25 --> 0:38:15,987
But I guess I told you that
at some point.

722
0:38:16,765 --> 0:38:18,115
I don't remember.

723
0:38:21,152 --> 0:38:23,581
He's treating her
as though they just met.

724
0:38:25,490 --> 0:38:27,12
He's courting her.

725
0:38:27,734 --> 0:38:29,141
Whose idea was that?

726
0:38:30,695 --> 0:38:33,260
He was doing the opposite
of what he should. He's changed.

727
0:38:33,385 --> 0:38:36,190
- Taub thought it might...
- That was your idea.

728
0:38:36,633 --> 0:38:39,396
And you asked me what I thought
was going on between them.

729
0:38:40,54 --> 0:38:42,74
It's their relationship
that's on your mind.

730
0:38:42,199 --> 0:38:44,367
That's why you've been thinking
about this case...

731
0:38:44,492 --> 0:38:45,693
relationships.

732
0:38:45,935 --> 0:38:47,950
Lost one with Wilson,
gained one with Alvie.

733
0:38:48,562 --> 0:38:49,662
Not exactly.

734
0:39:11,614 --> 0:39:13,617
<i>You gonna tell me
what the note said?</i>

735
0:39:19,476 --> 0:39:22,673
Alvie was very grateful
that I'd gotten him out of trouble.

736
0:39:23,466 --> 0:39:25,487
It allowed him to go stay
with his cousin in Phoenix

737
0:39:25,655 --> 0:39:28,97
without worrying about immigration
looking for him there.

738
0:39:29,453 --> 0:39:31,712
You didn't think
he was gonna stay forever.

739
0:39:35,275 --> 0:39:36,725
What happened next?

740
0:39:42,642 --> 0:39:44,217
Nothing happened next.

741
0:40:11,996 --> 0:40:13,291
That's all I got.

742
0:40:18,311 --> 0:40:19,511
Relationships.

743
0:40:21,522 --> 0:40:22,565
Bergman.

744
0:40:23,477 --> 0:40:25,305
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

745
0:40:25,430 --> 0:40:26,969
You're the one who said the thing...

746
0:40:27,94 --> 0:40:30,719
something about relationships
made you go out and provoke a fight.

747
0:40:32,23 --> 0:40:34,619
Wilson and Sam have a relationship.

748
0:40:35,892 --> 0:40:38,247
- You're not thrilled about it?
- They're happy.

749
0:40:40,191 --> 0:40:41,759
Why should I screw that up?

750
0:40:42,786 --> 0:40:44,136
Everyone's happy.

751
0:40:44,712 --> 0:40:46,612
Everyone's moving in together...

752
0:40:48,404 --> 0:40:50,982
Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas.
Even Alvie.

753
0:40:51,107 --> 0:40:53,366
Cuddy and Lucas
are moving in together?

754
0:40:54,89 --> 0:40:55,494
You didn't mention that.

755
0:40:55,821 --> 0:40:57,774
They talked about moving
in together before.

756
0:40:57,899 --> 0:40:59,299
It's not big news.

757
0:41:15,268 --> 0:41:17,996
<i>Approach to the acute abdomen</i>...

758
0:41:26,286 --> 0:41:28,699
Written by Ernest T. Cuddy, M.D.

759
0:41:28,824 --> 0:41:30,558
Any relation to your Cuddy?

760
0:41:32,342 --> 0:41:33,847
Her great-grandfather.

761
0:41:35,621 --> 0:41:37,257
I've had it for years...

762
0:41:38,32 --> 0:41:40,747
Always meant to give it to her
for a special occasion.

763
0:41:41,836 --> 0:41:43,500
Like her...
Housewarming?

764
0:41:44,480 --> 0:41:45,830
It's just a gift.

765
0:41:46,515 --> 0:41:49,210
A woman you care about
is taking one step further away from you

766
0:41:49,335 --> 0:41:50,840
and closer to someone else?

767
0:41:51,412 --> 0:41:52,789
I think I can safely say

768
0:41:52,969 --> 0:41:54,915
yes, it's significant
if you don't mention it.

769
0:41:55,224 --> 0:41:57,889
You were willing to punish
the husband of your patient

770
0:41:58,57 --> 0:42:0,215
because you identified with him.

771
0:42:1,763 --> 0:42:4,601
He was also losing someone he loved.

772
0:42:4,772 --> 0:42:7,662
I'm not gonna go out and get hammered
because a woman I'm not even with

773
0:42:7,787 --> 0:42:10,344
is moving in with someone.
That'd be pathetic.

774
0:42:13,467 --> 0:42:15,5
What's the hell with this?

775
0:42:18,230 --> 0:42:19,874
When I first came to you,

776
0:42:20,333 --> 0:42:22,305
I told you
that I wanted to be happy,

777
0:42:23,77 --> 0:42:24,927
and I followed your advice.

778
0:42:25,797 --> 0:42:27,591
And instead, I'm just miserable.

779
0:42:28,116 --> 0:42:29,709
How is this working for me?

780
0:42:30,668 --> 0:42:32,716
It takes time.

781
0:42:32,885 --> 0:42:35,260
For a year,
I've done everything you've asked,

782
0:42:35,428 --> 0:42:37,185
and everybody else is happy.

783
0:42:38,348 --> 0:42:41,183
I run on my treadmill.
You just sit there and watch.

784
0:42:42,613 --> 0:42:43,957
You're a faith healer.

785
0:42:45,441 --> 0:42:47,872
You take advantage
of people who want to believe.

786
0:42:51,488 --> 0:42:53,925
But there's nothing
in your bag of tricks.

787
0:42:59,839 --> 0:43:1,982
Whatever the answer is,
you don't have it.
