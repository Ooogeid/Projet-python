1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,600
Chinese water torture cell

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,400
was invented in 1911
by harry houdini.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,300
Nothing like new material.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,000
 <i>he was lowered head first</i>
 <i>into the water.</i>

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
His ???

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm going to need a volunteer.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,200
The guy dislocating
his shoulder...

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,100
 <i>yeah...</i>

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,000
Could you tell the guy
next to you to come up?

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,700
Come on,
get up there, man.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,100
Get up there, get up there!
Come on!

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,500
Come on!

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,200
- Hi. Have we met before?
- No.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
See, if you said yes, you could
have gone back to your seat.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,800
 <i>now, can you vouch</i>
 <i>for this audience</i>

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,900
that this is
a glass tank full of water?

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
- Yeah.
- No, you can't.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,300
You haven't done anything yet.
Come on.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,500
Knock on the glass.
Solid glass.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,300
Knock on it.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,400
It's real water too.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,800
Ilana, splash the guy.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,700
 <i>does that feel wet</i>
 <i>to you?</i>

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,600
- yeah.
- And you think that proves it's water?

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,500
I think we have met.

26
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Do you know
the public washroom

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
behind the truck stop
east of omaha?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,500
no.

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
See, if you'd said yes,
that would have been so funny.

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,200
 <i>hold out your arms</i>
 <i>for me.</i>

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,700
You've done this
before, right?

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,600
no.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,900
Again, two choices, and
you went for the unfunny one.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,400
Now, remember,
there's only one thing

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,700
you've got to be able to do--

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,500
Drag a screaming,
crying, shackled man

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,900
out of a tank of water.

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,100
up!

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,100
Hey, you can swim, right?

40
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,600
Whoa, whoa,
tell me you can swim.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah.

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,500
Two answers, man.

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 <i>two answers!</i>

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,400
is that part of the act?

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm new.
I think so.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,500
Maybe not.

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,300
Get up here!

51
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,200
five eager doctors,

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,500
and no sick people.

53
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,600
 <i>let us try and fill</i>
 <i>our spare time</i>

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,300
with a new challenge.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
The winner gets immunity.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,500
I have a sick guy.
I saw this magician last night--

57
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,600
The girl's fine.

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
He didn't really cut her
in half.

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,600
His heart stopped

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
while he was hanging
upside down in the water tank.

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
A drowning man's
heart stopped.

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
That is a mystery.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
 <i>along with immunity,</i>

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,900
the winner
gets to nominate two--

65
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
 <i>he lost consciousness</i>

66
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,300
almost as soon
as he hit the water.

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,200
You have to leave work
at 6:00 p.m.,

68
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
but you make time
for man dates?

69
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
What's the challenge?

70
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,100
Are we not allowed
to be friends?

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,300
No, I'm just hurt.

72
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,700
When I asked you
to come see <i>mama mia--</i>

73
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,600
no history of heart disease.
No angina.

74
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
- No--
- He's lying.

75
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,900
- <I>about his history? Er confirmed.</i>
- About everything. He's a magician.

76
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,700
That's what they do.

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,600
He screwed up the trick,
he started drowning,

78
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,700
he got a cardiac arrest.

79
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,300
You were talking
about a challenge?

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,400
The winner nominates...

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,700
Two of your competitors.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
 <i>i will fire one of them.</i>

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500
Even if he was drowning,

84
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,400
it would have taken longer
to set off a cardiac incident

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
without some underlying
problem that--

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,500
Fine. Go run your tests.

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,300
If you're wrong,
you're fired.

88
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,500
If I'm right, do I stay?

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,800
If I say no, are you
gonna let your patient die?

90
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,300
What's the challenge?

91
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,800
We can all applaud the doctor

92
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,900
who's willing
to break all the rules.

93
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,100
But the real hero
is the unsung doctor,

94
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,700
toiling in anonymity,

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,700
'cause he broke the rules
without getting caught.

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,900
I need to know
you have these skills.

97
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,700
I need you...

98
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,300
To bring me the thong
of lisa cuddy.

99
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,100
Not kidding.

100
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,100
Thong. Cuddy. Go.

101
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
It's how I got hired.

102
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,100
You're actually
considering this?

103
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,300
If you want to stand
on principle,

104
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,000
I really
respect you for that.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,600
It's childish, unprofessional,
and inappropriate.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The job is not worth it.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
We should all beg off.

108
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,400
Tell him we failed.
No winners, no losers.

109
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,100
Fine.

110
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
You're gonna do it,
aren't you?

111
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
Of course
i'm gonna do it.

112
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,400
No valvular regurgitation,

113
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,300
no wall motion abnorbnbnormalities,
no structural defects.

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
If you didn't sound
so despondent,

115
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
i'd say
that was good news.

116
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
It is for you,
not for him.

117
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Notice any heaviness in your legs 
the last couple days?

118
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,500
Why isn't it
good news for you?

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,000
Because, if there's nothing
wrong with you, he gets fired.

120
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,200
Seriously?

121
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,900
Somewhat seriously.
Your legs?

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Haven't noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,700
- Shortness of breath?
- Would it help if I puked?

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Pick a card.

125
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,800
Any tightness
in your chest or arms?

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,300
- Pick a card.
- You don't seem too worried.

127
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,800
Would you please
pick a card?

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Our boss thinks
your cardiac arrest

129
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,900
was just a result of you
accidentally drowning.

130
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,700
Your boss is an idiot.
Put it back.

131
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,100
Shuffle 'em up.

132
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,600
So then why
aren't you worried?

133
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,700
Either I'm dying
or I'm not.

134
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,100
I mean, I don't want
the ride to be over,

135
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,500
 <i>but unless worrying</i>

136
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,400
is some new form
of treatment...

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Your card.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
no.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm gonna prep you
for a transesophageal echo.

140
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
You sure you shuffled these?

141
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,200
And I'm gonna need
to sedate you.

142
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,100
Might wanna check
your wallet first.

143
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,800
Would you check your wallet?
It's part of the trick.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,800
oh.

145
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,700
That's my card.
How did you do that?

146
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,600
Do it again.

147
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,500
 <i>thought</i>
 <i>you weren't playing.</i>

148
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,300
I'm not.

149
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,800
She'll fire you
if she catches you.

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,700
I don't think
she can fire me

151
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
for <i>not</i> trying
to steal her panties.

152
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,100
You trying
to will them off?

153
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,300
If I had a plan,

154
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
the first part would be not 
telling <i>you</i> what the plan was.

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,200
You haven't touched
that coffee.

156
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, I have.

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,800
She can't keep her panties on
if they're wet.

158
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
 <i>we work together.</i>

159
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
One wins,
protects the other.

160
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,300
Or I win by myself,

161
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,900
and then <i>you</i> try desperately
to convince <i>me</i> to spare you.

162
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,700
Dr. Cuddy.

163
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,000
- Ooh!
- Oh!

164
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,300
Dr. Taub, are you okay?

165
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,600
I--I just tripped.
I'm so sorry.

166
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,900
I have some extra time.

167
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
Do you need any help
in the clinic?

168
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,900
Uh...okay.

169
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,100
We found no apparent
cause for the arrest.

170
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,600
T.t.e. And t.e.e.
Revealed no--

171
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,900
Send the patient home.
You can give him a lift.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We checked for clots.
We checked for--

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're reporting to me because
you're scared to report to house

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,400
because you found nothing,
because this isn't a case.

175
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,000
And you thought
i'd save your ass.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,600
Yeah.

177
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
I thought he was sick.

178
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
What was I
supposed to do?

179
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,400
What about his lungs?

180
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Decreased oxygen saturation
leads to heart failure.

181
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,700
E.r. Didn't find
anything.

182
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,600
E.r. Wasn't looking.

183
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,300
Too busy trying
to keep him alive.

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,700
Get an mri.

185
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,600
Clinic.

186
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,900
Yes, can you ask Dr. Cuddy

187
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,000
to come to the nurse's station,
stat?

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,800
Right away.

189
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,700
I asked you to get
doctor--

190
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Dr. Taub said
she'd be right out.

191
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,100
A fungus in my lungs?

192
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,300
How would I even get
something like that?

193
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,400
Right now,
it's just a theory.

194
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
We don't even know
if it's--

195
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
I knew I shouldn't have done
those mushrooms in college.

196
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm sure
there's no connection.

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,900
It was a joke.

198
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,400
You really lose
your sense of humor

199
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,700
when your job's
on the line, huh?

200
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,900
Sorry. Most dying people
don't really like to--

201
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Not that you're dying.

202
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,200
But a little sick
would be perfect, right?

203
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,800
Yeah.

204
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,800
Aah! My stomach!

205
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Stabbing or throbbing?

206
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,900
Grey turner's sign.
He's got internal bleeding

207
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,000
i'll call surgery.

208
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,400
Surgeons have transfused
three units ab positive,

209
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,100
but they're still looking
for the source of the bleed.

210
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,800
No trauma.
Could be liver disease.

211
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
Vitamin k deficiency.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,800
The only thing we know
for sure it's not...nothing.

213
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,000
 <i>and we would have noticed</i>
 <i>something chronic</i>

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,800
like liver disease.

215
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
It's probably
an intestinal infarct--

216
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,600
I got it!

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,900
 <i>ahem.</i>

218
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,800
Eau de cuddy.

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,900
 <i>no way.</i>

220
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,800
How did you get them?

221
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
Only one way.

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,800
These are not cuddy's panties.

223
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,300
- You don't think that I--
- No.

224
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Also, she's wearing
a red bra today.

225
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Like I'm the only one
who noticed.

226
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Means the downstairs
will match.

227
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,200
Do your research,
people.

228
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
 <i>an intestinal infarct</i>

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
could be linked
to the cardiac arrest.

230
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Hike up your skirt.

231
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Wow, that's rude,
even for you.

232
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Hike it down then.

233
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,300
 <i>you're wearing</i>
 <i>a black bra.</i>

234
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,300
Let's see the underwear.

235
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
no!

236
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,400
You two cut a deal.

237
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,900
If you're not cheating,
you're not trying hard enough.

238
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,100
Is she not wearing
any underwear?

239
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
 <i>um, there's a guy</i>
 <i>bleeding--</i>

240
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,000
foreman, she's not wearing
any underwear.

241
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,700
You used to be more fun.

242
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,800
She's not wearing
any underwear--big deal.

243
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,900
 <i>when she stops</i>
 <i>wearing clothes,</i>

244
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,400
then we can drop
the medical stuff.

245
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,900
Let me see the mri film.

246
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,200
Oh, we didn't
get any images.

247
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
 <i>he started screaming</i>
 <i>as soon as I turned it on.</i>

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,300
Define "soon."

249
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,700
Uh...i didn't even get
a chance to sit down.

250
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,400
You guys ever wonder

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
how he was gonna get out
of that water tank?

252
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,800
You--come.

253
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Lacerations
in his digestive tract.

254
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
And his spleen
is shredded.

255
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

256
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,300
I have nothing
in my hands,

257
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,900
nothing up my sleeve.

258
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,100
I do have something
in my pants,

259
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,500
but it's not gonna help
with this particular trick.

260
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,500
Watch closely.

261
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,500
How ya been?

262
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,900
Fine. Till now.

263
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Ta-da!

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,500
Now you...disappear.

265
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,300
 <i>look familiar?</i>

266
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,800
the mri's magnet ripped this
through your intestine

267
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,000
into your spleen.

268
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,800
Forgot about that.

269
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,500
On account
of almost dying.

270
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,300
Where's Dr. Kutner?

271
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,100
He's no longer
on your case.

272
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,800
'cause there's nothing
wrong with you.

273
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,700
I didn't screw up
that trick.

274
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,900
Everything that's happened
can be explained

275
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,400
by you being forgetful
and incompetent.

276
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,300
You screwed up,
you passed out--

277
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,900
Know my favorite time
to lie?

278
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,900
When my life hangs
in the balance.

279
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Your life doesn't hang
in the balance.

280
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,100
You know your life
doesn't hang in the balance.

281
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
Your <i>reputation</i>
might hang--

282
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
You ever do magic
as a kid?

283
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,800
You seem like
the type--

284
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,600
Lonely, obsessive.

285
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,700
I outgrew it. You?

286
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,600
Pick a card.

287
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Too much trouble.

288
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,300
Can I just pick my nose?

289
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,700
I'm not a hack.

290
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,200
If I tell you how it's done,
will you go home?

291
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,800
So you gonna make it magically
appear in my wallet?

292
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
You are a hack.

293
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,200
I don't screw up.

294
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,700
A nosebleed that major
means he's actually sick.

295
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Means the cardiac arrest
was a symptom.

296
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,900
Stop gloating.

297
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
I'm not gloating.

298
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,300
Then what's that smirk?

299
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,000
No smirk.
This is how I look.

300
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,700
What about
the underwear challenge?

301
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
I declare it
officially on hold.

302
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,100
Not really fair,
but I get it.

303
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
It's cuddy's.

304
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Pull down your pants.

305
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,600
You think I'm lying?

306
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,900
No. I wanna give you
a reward.

307
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,300
 <i>yes, I think</i>
 <i>you're lying.</i>

308
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,700
Cardiac arrest
plus nose bleed--go.

309
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,300
Uh, patient has no significant
family history,

310
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,000
no angina,
no prior attacks.

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,400
<i>What if it</i>
 <i>isn't his heart?</i>

312
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
what if it's the vessels
around his heart?

313
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,700
Polyarteritis nodosa
causes cardiac symptoms

314
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
and hypertension,
which makes his nose bleed.

315
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,900
 <i>you know what else makes your</i>
 <i>nose bleed and your heart race?</i>

316
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,100
cocaine. Guy works in a b-list
nightclub in atlantic city.

317
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,600
He's gotta be taking
regular rolls in the snow.

318
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,800
You, take the gloater
to the patient's drug den.

319
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,100
Make sure you pat down
his pockets before you leave.

320
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,600
You and big love,

321
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,500
biopsy of blood vessel
from around the heart.

322
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,200
Test for
polyarteritis nodosa.

323
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,500
You...

324
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,000
In my office.

325
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,600
Those aren't my panties.

326
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
I know.

327
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,300
Hypothetical.

328
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,500
A young woman
does something clumsy in public.

329
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
 <i>and instead of</i>
 <i>laughing it off,</i>

330
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,200
she gets
irrationally upset.

331
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,900
Explain.

332
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,200
Maybe she's clumsy
'cause she's nervous,

333
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,700
'cause she forgot to do
her spelling homework.

334
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
In my hypothetical,
she's eight.

335
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
But this girl's
not insecure.

336
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,800
Seems more like
she's afraid.

337
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,900
Do you have a point,

338
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,700
or did you just get
a new book of riddles?

339
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
I think you're hiding
a medical condition.

340
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm not.

341
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
I'm glad we had this talk.

342
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,400
Doctors often try to ignore
their symptoms

343
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
'cause they think
they can't get sick.

344
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
If you got something
going on,

345
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,700
I need you
to take care of it.

346
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,300
And I take your compassion
entirely at face value.

347
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,200
It's not compassion.
It's self-interest.

348
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,000
I want my team healthy.

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,100
It's not self-interest.
It's curiosity.

350
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,900
I dropped a file, house.

351
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,400
I start bleeding
from the eyes,

352
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,100
i'll be sure
to make an appointment.

353
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay.

354
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Eh, found some pot.

355
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,900
Bag it.

356
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
I'm not sure it really fits
the symptoms.

357
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:27,900
Of course not,

358
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,000
but it'd be irresponsible
to leave it here.

359
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,200
You have a quarter?

360
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,100
no.

361
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,800
How did cole get those panties
off cuddy?

362
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,700
They were never
on her.

363
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,400
No way those are hers.

364
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Uh-huh.

365
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,300
Tularemia.

366
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,900
No, you'd have
to have rabbits.

367
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,900
True--maybe a tick

368
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,500
jumped from a rabbit
and landed

369
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,900
on one of these
white, fluffy alligators.

370
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,700
Then it jumps
onto our patient,

371
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,900
transfers the bacteria,
causes pericarditis.

372
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,200
Explains everything.

373
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,800
What are you giving me?

374
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,800
How'd you do the trick?

375
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,400
Oh, if I explain,
it becomes mundane,

376
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,300
and you lose
the actual magic.

377
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,000
What do you mean,
the <i>actual</i> magic?

378
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,900
Think you're <i>actually</i>
sawing women in half?

379
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,500
You gonna tell me what's
wrong with me or not?

380
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,800
Magic is cool.

381
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,700
Actual magic
is oxymoronic.

382
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,000
Might not even be oxy.

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,700
You're not gonna tell me
unless I tell you?

384
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,100
You got a nurse
to plant the card.

385
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,700
I can't get a nurse
to help me pee.

386
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,300
You got a buddy
to plant the card.

387
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,900
The fun...
Is in not knowing.

388
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,800
The fun...
Is in knowing.

389
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,100
Oh, my head. Oh!

390
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I got a headache.

391
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,000
How bad?
Is it new?

392
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,700
It's not too bad.

393
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,100
I'll--i'll just
take one of these...

394
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Vicodin.

395
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,500
You eat a lot of beets,
you have an electric toothbrush,

396
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,000
and you sleep
less than six hours a night.

397
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,100
That's impressive.

398
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,200
The red betamine
from the beets

399
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,100
stains the plaque deposits
on your teeth,

400
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,500
which are then swirled
by your spinning toothbrush.

401
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,100
Your heavy lids
and your prematurely aging skin

402
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,300
tell me that you're carrying
a major sleep debt.

403
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,200
That was way cooler
before you explained it.

404
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,500
It was meaningless
until I explained it.

405
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,100
People come to my show

406
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,600
because they want
a sense of wonder.

407
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
They want
to experience something

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,500
that they can't explain.

409
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
If the wonder's gone
when the truth is known,

410
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,100
there never was
any wonder.

411
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,900
You have tularemia
from your rabbits.

412
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,300
I've put you
on antibiotics.

413
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,800
You'll be better
in a couple of days.

414
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,900
Sorry to spoil
the mystery.

415
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,200
Thank you.

416
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,500
Because
it's very important

417
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,900
to actually do it well.

418
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I'll get it.

419
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,600
Oh...my...god!

420
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,600
You're not wearing
underwear!

421
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Of course, I'm--

422
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,100
Skirt that tight,
you got no secrets.

423
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Skirt that tight,
I can tell if you got an i.u.d.

424
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,700
You've seen Dr. Cole?

425
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,800
no.

426
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,900
You're blushing.

427
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
I am not.

428
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,800
Look at me.

429
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,800
Oh...my...

430
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
God!

431
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,400
How'd you do it?

432
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,500
So I'm safe?

433
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,400
In this job, yeah.

434
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,800
Crotch,
on the other hand...

435
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
How'd you do it?

436
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
Prayer, mostly.

437
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,600
Just tell me.

438
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,300
Does cuddy have
her groove back?

439
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,600
It'd be rude of me
to discuss.

440
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,600
You handed over
her panties.

441
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,500
I don't think gallantry's

442
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,300
really an option
at this point.

443
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,500
If I tell you,
then where's the magic?

444
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,499
(kutner)
he passed out.

445
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,499
Ultrasound revealed bleeding
around his heart.

446
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,199
 <i>we drained 100 ccs</i>
 <i>before it stopped.</i>

447
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,499
The antibiotics
aren't working.

448
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,900
It's obviously not tularemia
or any other infection.

449
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,000
Excuse me--
We were talking.

450
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,199
 <i>(taub)</i>
 <i>bleeding around the heart</i>
 <i>could meaned biopsy</i>

451
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,199
when cole was looking
for the--

452
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,799
Why would you accuse
the man who decides your fate

453
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,200
 <i>of screwing up?</i>

454
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,500
(taub)
those really were
her panties?

455
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,899
Cole has traveled through
the forest of crustaceans

456
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,700
and brought us
a treasure.

457
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,599
And he has earned
his reward.

458
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,999
If I could just get
the immunity, I--

459
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
No, sophie, you can't.

460
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,800
 <i>use whatever criteria</i>
 <i>you want.</i>

461
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,799
Could be
a clotting issue.

462
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,899
(amber)
if he developed d.i.c.
After the surgery,

463
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,899
even a normal biopsy bleeds
out of control.

464
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,899
So cardiac arrest
and d.i.c.

465
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,199
What's the common denominator?
Could be cancer.

466
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,800
 <i>we've been looking in his chest</i>
 <i>since he got here--it's clean.</i>

467
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,799
 <i>(taub)</i>
 <i>so the main mass is somewhere</i>
 <i>else--throws up a clot,</i>

468
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,100
 <i>blocks an artery in his heart,</i>
 <i>causes the arrest.</i>

469
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Good!

470
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,700
Go find out where
he's hiding his cancer.

471
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,000
(cole)
if you swallowed
any more metal,

472
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
now would be
a good time to tell us.

473
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,600
My hands feel
kind of numb.

474
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,200
You lost a lot of blood.

475
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm gonna die.

476
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,000
Everybody gets scared
in a hospital.

477
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,299
You're sick,
you feel awful--

478
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,200
no.

479
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,600
This time tomorrow.

480
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,900
I'll be dead.

481
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,100
So who's going
on the block?

482
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,200
He thinks he's dying.

483
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,900
He's probably right.

484
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,900
Tomorrow.

485
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,500
You decide to put me up,
I totally get it.

486
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Nothing personal.

487
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,199
I haven't decided anything.

488
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,400
But you don't like me.

489
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,900
I like you.

490
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,600
Some fluid in the lungs.

491
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,200
No masses.

492
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm manipulative.
[typing]

493
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,699
I play the game.

494
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,900
I can be a bitch.

495
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,300
There's a dark spot.

496
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,000
Damage from where the key
ripped through.

497
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,200
You're probably expecting me
to bash the others,

498
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
give examples
of how they screwed up.

499
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,900
You know I can.

500
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,500
I'm a good doctor.

501
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
As good as anybody
around here.

502
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,700
Probably better.

503
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,500
You know that's
the only thing that matters.

504
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,400
 <i>(cole)</i>
 <i>what's that?</i>

505
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,900
it's not a tumor.
It's another bleed.

506
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
This one's in his kidney.

507
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,800
And his thigh.

508
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
He's bleeding
all over the place.

509
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,300
???

510
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,600

it was creepy.

511
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,400
The patient predicted
his own death.

 <i>(house)</i>

 <i>more impressive</i>

 <i>that he wasn't gonna die.</i>

514
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,600
Of course,
that takes longer to prove.

515
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,599

could be a symptom.

516
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,100
Sense of impending doom.

517
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,500
Yeah, could be
adrenal gland disorders,

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,100
blood issues,
anaphylaxis.

If you're gonna kiss his ass

520
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,999
at least wait

 <i>it's a symptom</i>
 <i>of him being a charlatan.</i>

He's a second-rate magician

Why wouldn't he

 <i>(kutner)</i>
 <i>he got scared</i>

Tainted blood

529
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,499
Could also explain
the d.i.c.

530
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,900
I predict all your pagers
go off...right now.

531
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,600
oh!
But if it had happened...

532
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,499
Anyone bother
looking at his panel?

533
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,099
His immunoglobulin levels
are low.

534
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,600
That doesn't tell us
anything specific about--

535
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,199
Are you acting stupid 'cause
you know you're safe? Clever.

536
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,599
 <i>(foreman)</i>
 <i>low immunoglobulin</i>

537
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,799
plus failing heart,
plus fluid in the lungs,

538
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
 <i>plus internal bleeding,</i>
 <i>equals amyloidosis.</i>

539
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,499
He's bleeding way too much
for amyloidosis.

540
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,699
Say anything about his hands
or feet feeling weak?

541
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,199
 <i>(cole)</i>
 <i>he said his hands felt numb,</i>

542
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
but that's explained
by the blood loss.

543
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,000
No! Do not give me
credit for that.

544
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,299
 <i>close doesn't count.</i>

545
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,399
That's how people get sucked
into this stupidity.

546
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,499
He's seizing.

547
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,400
Somebody stabilize him.

548
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,299
 <i>rest of you,</i>
 <i>pull his medical records.</i>

549
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,200
Go back ten years.

550
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,000
Look for joint pain,
fatigue,

551
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,300
anything associated
with amyloidosis.

552
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,700
???

553
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,399
You had
a grand mal seizure.

554
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,399
We're giving you liquids
and an anticonvulsant.

555
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Just try to rest.

556
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,699
Pulse is dropping.

557
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,900
 <i>he's stabilizing.</i>

558
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,699
You're not gonna put me
on the block, are you?

559
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,600
I haven't decided
who I'm gonna pick.

560
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
That's cool.

561
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,800
His legs look swollen
to you?

562
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,699
Slight swelling
could be renal.

563
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
I babysat for you.

564
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,999
I decided I'm gonna make
my decision

565
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
based solely on who
deserves to be here.

566
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,700
That's admirable,
though stupid.

567
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,300
 <i>you shouldn't save</i>
 <i>the strongest.</i>

568
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,199
You should get r the strong

569
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,800
eliminate your competition,
which is definitely not me.

570
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
And I'm your friend.

571
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,999
And how are you
gonna explain to your kid

572
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,700
that I can't take him
to the zoo next week

573
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,300
 <i>because you got me fired?</i>

574
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
kutner.

575
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
He's gonna seize again.

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,899
Flank pain.
His kidneys are shutting down.

577
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,700
Also...amber's a racist.

578
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,100
(wilson)
you knew they'd get paged?

579
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,699
I noticed a trend--

580
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,800
If nobody does anything,

581
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,700
sick people
often get sicker.

582
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,999
You think it's
remotely possible they had sex?

583
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
They're both single.

584
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,699
It's still legal
in the blue states.

585
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,400
She barely knows him.

586
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,899
You know,
in some cultures,

587
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,200
hiring people to steal
someone's underpants

588
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,600
is considered wooing.

589
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,800
You should move there.

590
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,099
Because here it's just,
you know, creepy.

591
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,400
There was no woo.

592
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,700
This was
an effective test.

593
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
This is beneath my skills.

594
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,900
(kutner)
kidneys are shutting down.

595
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,299
Led to a sodium deficiency.
Caused him to seize.

596
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,599
Kidney failure
means I was right

597
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,799
about amyloidosis.

598
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,499
Except that nothing
in his medical history

599
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,100
remotely indicates
amyloidosis.

600
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,800
So kidney failure proves
i'm right about the bad blood.

601
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,200
Bad blood doesn't explain
the heart or the liver.

602
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,499
His major symptoms didn't start
until after we transfused him.

603
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,499
Is cardiac arrest no longer
considered a major symptom?

604
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,999
Not when it's caused
by drowning.

605
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,799
So your new theory

606
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,499
is that you're an idiot
to take this case.

607
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,099
Yes. Can I go test
that theory now?

608
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
 <i>waste of time.</i>

609
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,900
He needs a bone marrow
transplant for the amyloidosis.

610
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,399
You'd have to
irradiate him first.

611
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,299
If they're right
about the blood,

612
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,300
you'd be destroying
his immune system for nothing.

613
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,799
Which could be a good thing.

614
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,200
Does he have
a really crappy life?

615
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,300
Go prove I'm right.

616
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,099
Do a subcutaneous
fat biopsy.

617
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,099
At least let us
eliminate the bad blood theory,

618
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,800
 <i>check the blood banks for</i>
 <i>mis-marks and contamination.</i>

619
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,899
You've got two hours.

620
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,400
That's completely arbitrary.

621
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,299
 <i>no, if I'd said that</i>
 <i>you got three lunar months,</i>

622
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,699
that'd be
completely arbitrary.

623
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,499
 <i>two hours is how long</i>
 <i>it's gonna take big love</i>

624
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,299
 <i>to finish a biopsy</i>
 <i>that you guys can't do</i>

625
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,800
because you're wasting two hours
checking blood.

626
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,000
9-3.
5-all.

627
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,200
Hey. Brought you
something from the cafeteria.

628
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,100
It's not a bribe.

629
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,300
 <i>this</i> is a bribe.

630
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,799
How much?

631
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,500
$1 million.

632
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,900
$5,000.

633
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,899
This is so wrong.

634
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,799
House specifically said

635
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,799
you can use
whatever criteria you want.

636
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,100
I've got money.
You need money.

637
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,599
Hand me that slide.

638
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,899
Right now, you're earning
what I'm earning,

639
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,500
which is miserable.

640
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,300
I know what school
your kid's at.

641
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,900
I know what it costs.

642
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,000
I've seen his picture.

643
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,900
He's gonna need braces.

644
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,299
(kutner)
no r.b.c. Damage.

645
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,499
(thirteen)
nothing wrong with storage.

646
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,600
I'm gonna double-check type
and start cultures.

647
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,800
(foreman)
we've still got
32 minutes left.

648
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,999
Time flies.
What have you found?

649
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You're checking up on them--
That means cole's finished

650
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,699
with the biopsy,
and it was negative.

651
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,200
Inconclusive.

652
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,099
Fat doesn't always
give you the answer.

653
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,899
Need to biopsy
his actual organs--

654
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,099
Lungs, kidneys, liver.

655
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,899
We stick another needle in him,
he'll hemorrhage.

656
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,399
Unless we start treatment
for amyloidosis.

657
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,199
Unless it's not
amyloidosis.

658
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,700
If he has an infection,
the radiation will kill him.

659
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,899
Show me evidence
of infection.

660
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,599
We need
more than two hours.

661
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,500
Some of these cultures will
take at least a day to grow.

662
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,600
He'll be dead in a day.

663
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,499
Like he predicted.

664
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,700
O. He'll be
half a day off.

665
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,300
 <i>would it make you guys</i>
 <i>feel any better</i>

666
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,099

 <i>for...three minutes</i>

667
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,400

for amyloidosis?

668
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,900
No. Just treat
for amyloidosis.

669
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
No. Don't.

670
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,299
You're playing
the cuddy card?

671
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,399
That's why I'm here.

672
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,899
Amyloidosis was your idea.

673
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,799
I was wrong.

674
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
Yeah, me too.
You were never fun.

675
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,300
Give me the blood.

676
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,899
I'm type ab.
Give me the blood.

677
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,299
 <i>(kutner)</i>
 <i>whatever's in there</i>
 <i>could be killing him.</i>

678
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
In where?

679
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,300
How much tainted blood
do you think they keep in here?

680
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,700
How many people
would have gotten sick--

681
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,100
It would have to have been
the first batch,

682
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,900
the splenectomy--that's when
the symptoms started.

683
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,600
Okay. So transfuse blood
from those donors.

684
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,799
 <i>i'll be fine.</i>

685
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,300
We move on.
Treat for amyloidosis.

686
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,900
Fill 'er up.

687
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,200
 <i>(house)</i>
 <i>i have a new theory.</i>

688
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,600
 <i>you're not stubborn.</i>

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,900
 <i>you're not</i>
 <i>getting it checked</i>

690
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,200

I found an old picture

692
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,500
Of course you did.

693
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,500
I wasn't snooping.

694
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,300
I needed lunch money.

695
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,000
Figure it's your mom,

696
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,800
except she looks
about 32 years old.

697
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,799
The only reason
not to update a photo

698
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,000
in 20-odd years
is she's not talking to you,

699
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,600
which would be interesting,

700
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,700
or she's dead.

701
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
Which would also
be interesting.

702
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,900
She's dead.

703
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,900
So's grover cleveland.

704
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,500
Pretty young
to have a dead mom.

705
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,200
You were even younger
20 years ago.

706
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,000
I googled her obituary.

707
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,399
Said she died
at new haven presbyterian

708
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,500
after a long illness.

709
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,100
Parkinson's?

710
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,500
Huntington's chorea.

711
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,400
I'm sorry.

712
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm leaving
when this case is over.

713
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
No, you're not.

714
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,799
You don't want a doctor
on your team

715
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,500
who's slowly losing control
of her body and mind.

716
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,800
Huntington's isn't the only
thing that causes tremors.

717
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,000
You think
it's just a coincidence?

718
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,500
I think you're
the only one on the team

719
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,400
who drinks decaf.

720
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,599
I've been switching it out
with regular

721
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,700
 <i>ever since you dropped</i>
 <i>that file.</i>

722
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,700
You're trembling 'cause
you're hopped up on caffeine.

723
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
The first file
wasn't my fault.

724
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,099
Medical explanation
for that is...

725
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,800
People drop things.

726
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,199
I've been walking around
thinking I'm dying...

727
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,300
You are.

728
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,900
You don't know that.

729
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,499
With huntington's,
it's inevitable.

730
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,600
No, you don't know,
because I don't know.

731
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,900
How could you
not get tested?

732
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,899
If your mom had it,
it's a 50% chance

733
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,199
 <i>you're a bomb</i>
 <i>waiting to explode.</i>

734
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,799
Not knowing makes me do things
I think I'm scared to do--

735
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,599
Take flying lessons,
climb kilimanjaro,

736
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,199
work for you.

737
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,199
'cause if you knew,

738
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,000
you couldn't do
any of those things.

739
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,499
What?

740
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,900
You're sweating.

741
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,400
You're burning up.

742
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,100
House...

743
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,100
You???

744
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,399
 <i>(kutner)</i>
 <i>could be pneumococcus.</i>

745
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
 <i>that'd cause chest pain</i>
 <i>and the stiff neck.</i>

746
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,499
It's not pneumococcus.

747
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,700
Let me check
your lymph nodes.

748
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,300
I'm not the patient.

749
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,700
 <i>patient is the one</i>
 <i>whose body is shutting down.</i>

750
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,099
I'm having a benign
transfusion reaction.

751
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,599
Pseudomonas would present
as an armpit rash.

752
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,499
Take off your shirt.

753
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,199
You first.

754
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,799
House, you gotta
let us do this.

755
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,999
 <i>we can't biopsy him</i>
 <i>without bleeding him to death.</i>

756
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,499
You are not
biopsying me.

757
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,300
How's your stomach?
Any diarrhea?

758
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,199
[exhaling]
the more transfusions you have,

759
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,800
the greater the chance
of you reacting.

760
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,600
 <i>I've had three</i>
 <i>in a decade.</i>

761
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,400
Fever'll be gone
in a couple of hours.

762
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,899
 <i>(thirteen)</i>
 <i>i heard somewhere</i>
 <i>that doctors ignore symptoms</i>

763
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,400

764
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,199
 <i>(kutner)</i>
 <i>you told us to give you the</i>
 <i>blood so that you wouldn't--</i>

765
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,099
I am not sick.
Fever is a symptom.

766
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
But not of what
the patient has!

767
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,900
 <i>my kidneys are working.</i>

768
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,599
I'm not bleeding
out of every organ.

769
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,700
Yet.

770
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,400
This is a waste of time.

771
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,800
And it's distracting you
from the actual case.

772
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,400
What's wrong?

773
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,499
The room is spinning.

774
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,600
You okay?

775
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
No, I'm dizzy.

776
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,000
My mouth just went dry.

777
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,199
Could be a symptom
of any number--

778
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
It's a symptom of narcotics.

779
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,200
Who spiked my--

780
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,199
What'd you drug him
with?

781
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,799
Amber's nickname
is cutthroat bitch,

782
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,000
and you're pointing
at me.

783
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,900
Got the kidney sample.

784
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,400
You're the only one
with nothing to lose.

785
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,599
Could have been you.

786
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,800
You don't seem to care
if you get this job or not.

787
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,299
Yeah, I've been here
for eight weeks

788
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,400
'cause my subscription
to <i>masochism weekly</i> ran out.

789
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,600
You're the only one
who hasn't asked me

790
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,500
not to put them
on the block.

791
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,700
You're either gonna pick me
or you're not.

792
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,900
You're fair enough to try
to make the right decision,

793
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,999
and arrogant enough

794
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
that nothing I can say
will change your mind.

795
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,700
I don't want it
to be over, but...

796
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Unless worrying about it
is gonna make a difference...

797
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,300
I'm gonna run
some stains.

798
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,000
He'll be less
of an ass to you.

799
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,100
Patient dead yet?

800
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
no.

801
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,599
That's a little much
for a first date.

802
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,300
Obviously,
you've never dated me.

803
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,900
Feels like you already
got the...

804
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,999
Lung and kidney samples.

805
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,399
Now I just need
a piece of your liver.

806
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,699
Hey, you might wanna use
a little lidocaine--

807
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

808
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
oh!
Slight pinch.

809
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,900
You drugged me.

810
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,800
You drugged me.

811
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,800
Stopped by the lab.

812
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,299
Your mutinous team
is starting to worry

813
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
about life
on pitcairn island.

814
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,300
All your biopsies
are clean.

815
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,400
Because there's
nothing wrong with me.

816
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,300
Did foreman finally okay

817
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,199
the amyloidosis treatment?

818
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Patient's scheduled
for irradiation at 9:00.

819
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,100
You risked your life again.

820
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,599
You couldn't be sure
he had amyloidosis.

821
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,299
You can't be sure
that I couldn't be sure.

822
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,799
You did one test.
It was negative.

823
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,499
Inconclusive.

824
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,799
Well, then, by all means

825
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,699
flood your body
with possibly lethal blood.

826
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,699
I usually like to give
the lethal blood to foreman,

827
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,599
but I'm the only one
who's type ab.

828
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,800
 <i>of course.</i>
 <i>you're type ab.</i>

829
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,900
Universal recipient.

830
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,500
You take from everybody.

831
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,000
Course, you're type o--

832
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,500
 <i>universal donor.</i>

833
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,900
No wonder you're paying
three alimonies.

834
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,800
How do you know...
What blood type I am?

835
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,000
I don't.
Just seemed to fit the metaphor.

836
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,400
No, no, no, no, no.

837
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,500
Did you test my blood
for something?

838
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,400
 <i>why would you test</i>
 <i>my blood for something?</i>

839
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,200
I didn't.

840
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,299
You must have...
Told me what you were.

841
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,799
 <i>who the hell chats</i>
 <i>about their blood type?</i>

842
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,600
you had to have
tested me.

843
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,800
There's no reason to ask
anyone their blood type.

844
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,600
You're about to run
out of here, aren't you?

845
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,900
Nurse, can I have
a moment with my patient?

846
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,100
He's due
in radiation.

847
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,600
It's too late.
He's dying.

848
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,500
Told you.

849
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,500
I'm sorry I doubted you.

850
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,200
Be a shame if your secrets
died with you.

851
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,100
Perhaps you've got that trick
written down somewhere?

852
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,300
Or maybe you wanna tell me,
and I'll write it down for you.

853
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,000
That way...
You can live on.

854
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,600
I'm taking it with me.

855
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,499
See, that way,

856
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,400
it stays magic.

857
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,100
You were wrong
about everything.

858
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,500
It was never magic,
and you're not dying.

859
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,600
What's your blood type?

860
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,100
T-type a.

861
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,899
What?

862
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,400
Trust me.
It's way cooler to know.

863
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,000
(coleman)
where's finn?

864
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,900
Up my sleeve.

865
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,000
It's not amyloidosis.

866
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,800
And his blood's fine.

867
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,700
We just gave him
the wrong type.

868
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,900
 <i>'caused the d.i.c.,</i>
 <i>explains the bleeding.</i>

869
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,199
Multisystem failures.

870
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,399
But we tested his blood.

871
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,500
That's because
we don't test blood for type.

872
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,999
We test for antibodies.

873
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,799
'cause your body
only makes those antibodies

874
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,700
when you actually have
that type of blood.

875
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,699
Apparently,
he has one more symptom.

876
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,499
His body's making
an extra antibody--type b.

877
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,400
Combine that with his
natural type a,

878
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,799
and presto change-o,
he magically pulls

879
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
blood type ab
out of his hat.

880
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
Would you stop that?
God, yes!

881
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,699
 <i>(thirteen)</i>
 <i>autoimmune diseases</i>

882
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,999
can make antibodies
go haywire, but still...

883
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,500
It's happened...and apparently,
it's happened again.

884
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,000
I finally
have a case of lupus.

885
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,399
 <i>flush him with saline.</i>

886
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,100
Transfuse four units type a.
Start him on steroids.

887
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,300
He'll be back
hoodwinking idiots in no time.

888
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,700
Use their power wisely,
my lord.

889
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,200
I nominate...amber.

890
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,600
 <i>cutthroat bitch...</i>

891
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,300
Rise.

892
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,600
You're surprised?

893
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,700
You're everyone's pick.
Next victim.

894
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,800
I nominate...

895
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,900
Kutner.

896
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,599
Now everyone's surprised.

897
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,700
Why?

898
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
You said I don't have
to justify my picks.

899
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,800
 <i>no. I said you could use</i>
 <i>whatever criteria you want.</i>

900
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,300
 <i>doesn't mean</i>
 <i>i don't wanna know.</i>

901
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,500
He was right
about this being a real case.

902
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,299
He was right
about the botched transfusion.

903
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,800
And he's
your love nugget.

904
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,700
 <i>you got no reason</i>
 <i>to pick him.</i>

905
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,700
But somebody else does.

906
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Kutner's a liability.

907
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,900
 <i>he electrocuted himself,</i>
 <i>lit a patient on fire.</i>

908
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,699
It's only a matter of time

909
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
before he burns
the hospital down.

910
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,400
You made the deal
with cuddy.

911
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,900
That's how you got
her underwear.

912
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,399
She sold it to you

913
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,799
for the right to put
her choices on the block.

914
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,700
You said
get her underwear.

915
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,600
I got it.

916
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,900
Your scheme was brilliant.

917
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,000
And you're fired.

918
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,000
You're all about
breaking the rules.

919
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,100
Her rules, not mine.

920
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,600
The whole point of this
was to subvert cuddy.

921
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,499
You became her partner,

922
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,599
 <i>gave her power</i>
 <i>she didn't already have.</i>

923
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,500
Let her greedy fingers
into my cookie jar,

924
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,100
which, sadly, is not
as dirty as it sounds.

925
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,900
Thanks for playing.

926
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,400
What the hell is this?

927
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,999
Looks like an envelope
with the results

928
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,700
of the genetic test
for huntington's inside.

929
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,100
Did you look?

930
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,300
I thought it'd be fun
to find out together.

931
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,099
I don't want to know.

932
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,699
No. You're afraid
to know.

933
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,000
I might die.
So could you.

934
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,599
You could get hit
by a bus tomorrow.

935
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,200
The only difference is you don't
have to know about it today,

936
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,600
so why should i?

937
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't have to know
the lottery numbers.

938
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,400
But if someone offered
them to me, I'd take them.

939
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,900
You spend your whole life
looking for answers...

940
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,100
Because you think the next
answer will change something,

941
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,200
maybe make you
a little less miserable.

942
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,000
And you know that when
you run out of questions,

943
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,500
you don't just
run out of answers.

944
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,500
You run out of hope.

945
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,300
You glad you know that?

946
00:42:50,300 --> 00:43:00,300
