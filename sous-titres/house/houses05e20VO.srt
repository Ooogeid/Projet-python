1
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,819
Bye.

2
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,862
i want to be alone...

3
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,598
with my wife.

4
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,448
I'm a selfish s.o.b.

5
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:53,153
I... i never got you to rio.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,392
There was always... one
more problem at the stores.

7
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,060
You deserve better than that.

8
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,498
I love you.

9
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,802
I always have.

10
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:16,209
I'm ready. It's okay.

11
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,351
I know...

12
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:53,313
somebody...

13
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:57,818
help her!

14
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,620
Help her!

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,755

Pour Tilyocean pour
docteur-house.niceboard.com

18
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,255
54-year-old woman with
acute respiratory failure.

19
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,891
No anaphylaxis, lung
issues, or tracheal lesions.

20
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,860
Tox screen was clean for
coke and amphetamines.

21
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,128
I will give you 30 reasons,

22
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,197
one for each pound that caused the apnea

23
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:47,000
which enflamed the epiglottis.

24
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,404
Why is our rainbow coalition
missing brown and bi?

25
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,906
Thirteen's with a patient,
and kutner's dog's sick.

26
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,841
He should be in by lunch.

27
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,243
No apnea because no sleeping
problems when she's sleeping.

28
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,579
She spent the last six
months caring for her husband

29
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,314
who's dying of heart failure.

30
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,316
Reason 31... whatever
whacked the husband's heart

31
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,584
is also whacking her airway.

32
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,085
And...oh, good.

33
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,288
I thought maybe kutner was
home nursing the rib you broke

34
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,291
when you elbowed your way in
for credit on the last patient.

35
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,959
I contributed.

36
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,795
And the patient's illness
wasn't caused by her husband

37
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,863
unless lung cancer's contagious.

38
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,398
Interesting. Not about the patient.

39
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,833
That was kinda dull.

40
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,701
I thought maybe you were
lying to cover for kutner,

41
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,236
which sounds noble,

42
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:26,072
except you're doing it out
of guilt instead of love.

43
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,810
She visited her sister in
hawaii about six months ago,

44
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,478
just before her husband got sick.

45
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,579
Could've picked up melioidosis

46
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:33,880
from one of the islands.

47
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,381
Would have jumped to the husband

48
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,051
and finished off him and
his lame immune system.

49
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,420
No tumors, no drugs, no bacteria.

50
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:42,255
Leaves viral... varicella zoster.

51
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:44,223
Start her on iv fluids and acyclovir.

52
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,326
Can't. She's demanding to be released

53
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,828
so she can get home to her husband.

54
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,330
How sweet. They can die together.

55
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,699
Instead of separately, 40 years apart.

56
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,368
She claims he got stronger

57
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,170
the mind can heal the body.

58
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,638
Seeing his wife in distress

59
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,574
might have actually
slowed down his death.

60
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,108
Or he just had an adrenaline surge

61
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,578
when he saw his chance to
hit the singles' market.

62
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:08,114
Send her home. We don't need to.

63
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,617
I had an idea... all by myself.

64
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,424
Eddie?

65
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,426
Found him loitering in the lobby.

66
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:22,061
You're still with me.

67
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,798
Where the hell else am i gonna go?

68
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,733
And now, with your permission,

69
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,969
we'd like to try to make you better.

70
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,377
The pageant starts in an hour.

71
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,778
You have to do something.

72
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:41,114
There's something wrong inside her head.

73
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,150
It's like she has no idea
what's going on around her.

74
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,353
I thought she was just flirting with me.

75
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,489
I can fix it, but it's gonna cost you...

76
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,491
$3.75.

77
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:55,562
I'm not just gonna give you my coffee.

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,165
Think of it as costa rican sober juice.

79
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,368
She's drunk?

80
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,937
That little minty scent

81
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:06,239
hiding beneath the rose petal perfume

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,074
and the cherry blossom moisturizer

83
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,376
and the morning dew hair spray.

84
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:14,280
You sneak into mommy's bathroom
and gulp some of her mouthwash?

85
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,983
Gotta be perfect.

86
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:21,821
You spit it out? Mommy doesn't.

87
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,222
Treatment worked.

88
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,958
Charlotte's breathing's back to normal.

89
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:26,359
She's being discharged.

90
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,161
She can resume her
vigil over her husband

91
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,328
who started fading again.

92
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,897
Win some, lose some.

93
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,166
And strictly speaking,
since he's not my patient,

94
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,668
win some.

95
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,069
Look at the time.

96
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,638
It's half past "taub
was lying about kutner."

97
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:41,207
He probably went to a comic book fest,

98
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,375
spent the night at some
wonder woman's lair.

99
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,743
I'm sure he'll...

100
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,979
find out what or who he's doing.

101
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,814
Either way, cuddy's
gonna want me to write it

102
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:49,082
under "reason for termination."

103
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,951
That kutner?

104
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,452
Charlotte.

105
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,488
02 sat and s-t are normal.
It's not her airway.

106
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,626
You're okay. Don't worry about me.

107
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,462
She's in pain.

108
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,631
Pulse is rabid and regular.
No fluid in her lungs.

109
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,167
What's happening? I don't know.

110
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:15,875
Kutner. It's foreman and thirteen.

111
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,343
Where are you going?

112
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,846
House didn't ask us to
find out where he wasn't.

113
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,215
If you wanna climb a
fifth floor fire escape...

114
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,851
this might be faster.

115
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,389
Kutner.

116
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,192
Man/boy heaven.

117
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,495
Surprised he ever leaves.

118
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,469
There's nothing on his calendar.

119
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,239
His pager's still here.

120
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,846
Oh, god.

121
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,655
I need an ambulance at 410 willis,

122
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,922
apartment 5c.

123
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,190
28-year-old
male.

124
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,525
Single gunshot wound
to the right temple.

125
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,193
No pulse!

126
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,096
Alert princeton plainsboro.
Have a trauma unit ready.

127
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,465
His pupils dilated. His head's swollen.

128
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,167
Still no pulse.  Come on, kutner!

129
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,835
Let me try.

130
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,948
He's cold.

131
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,952
Eric!

132
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:11,575
He didn't say anything... to any of you.

133
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:13,677
Family problems...

134
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:16,380
bad relationship, financial pressures?

135
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,750
His parents were shot
right in front of him.

136
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,285
Parents are ancient history.

137
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:23,119
Not to someone who actually cares.

138
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:27,123
He didn't slit his wrists and...

139
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:30,627
peacefully drift
away... he shot himself.

140
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:34,564
He didn't leave a
note. That means panic.

141
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:36,300
Which could have been preempted

142
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:38,201
if the idiots who worked alongside him

143
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,703
for 80 hours a week
had seen this coming.

144
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:42,138
You're blaming us?

145
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,907
Just trying to figure it out.

146
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:46,009
We would have helped him
if he had reached out to us.

147
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:47,778
He didn't.

148
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,413
We should have picked up on something.

149
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,748
This isn't our fault!

150
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:54,083
Something like 25% of suicidal people

151
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:56,052
show no outward signs of depression.

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,121
No. 25% of suicidal people

153
00:08:58,189 --> 00:08:59,723
have friends who didn't notice anything

154
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,491
and don't want to feel guilty.

155
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,461
Killing himself also
kills all other options,

156
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,997
makes kutner an idiot.

157
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:10,434
So pity, yes, but guilt, no.

158
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,469
That's what you wanna tell yourself.

159
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:15,839
We still have a patient. Actually, two.

160
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,875
One worsening, one who
should be worsening.

161
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:21,611
You can't be in denial about
kutner and the husband  .

162
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,748
It's possible eddie's body
is willing itself to live.

163
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:26,850
Well, call the tabloids.

164
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,618
Tell them you just witnessed the miracle

165
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:32,121
of slightly increased kidney function.

166
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:34,624
Maybe we should pass this
file off to another doctor.

167
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:36,993
And the next one too?

168
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:41,097
The one after that?

169
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:44,468
How many files till it's
okay that kutner's dead?

170
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:50,574
Cardiac enzymes means she
didn't have a heart attack.

171
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,577
No vision problems means
no mitochondrial disease.

172
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:56,212
Could be a metabolic disorder, acidosis.

173
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,047
Blood ph was normal.

174
00:09:58,115 --> 00:09:59,850
Polyserositis would
inflame the membranes

175
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,252
near her epiglottis and
the heart's pericardium,

176
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,053
causing the chest pain.

177
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,823
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:08,958
I've hired a grief counselor

179
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,627
whom i'm sure none of you will see,

180
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,128
and i'm offering time off,

181
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,264
which i'm sure none of you will take.

182
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:18,167
But just know it's available.

183
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,738
Polyserositis fits.

184
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:24,741
Start her on indomethacin.

185
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,380
If you'd rather not
deal with this case...

186
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,983
i'm fine... despite
what wilson will say.

187
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,519
He hasn't come to you?

188
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:38,254
Pretty sure he has
mah-jongg tuesday mornings.

189
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,724
I assume he thinks i will
work through this better

190
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:44,561
if i don't have to keep flicking
his wings off my shoulder.

191
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:48,632
You didn't even have an inkling?

192
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,367
I know his fantasy
football team cratered.

193
00:10:51,436 --> 00:10:54,604
Figured he'd gotten over it.

194
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:56,973
Well...

195
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:03,780
sorry for your loss.

196
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:06,783
Thanks. But it's not my loss.

197
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:09,820
Then i'm sorry you don't think it is.

198
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:20,864
Patient's membranes aren't
gonna heal themselves.

199
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:23,600
Taub went to run the treatment.

200
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:27,303
We'd like to go see kutner's parents.

201
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,240
I'll join you.

202
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:40,851
Polyserositis damages
the protective covering

203
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,519
around tissue and organs.

204
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:44,688
The indomethacin is simply
an anti-inflammatory,

205
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:46,523
but it should fix it.

206
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:49,459
Just make the pain stop.

207
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:52,762
Charlotte...

208
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,700
close your eyes.

209
00:11:56,767 --> 00:12:00,103
Now...

210
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,374
pretend you... finally
made it down to rio.

211
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:09,679
You're on the balcony of a...

212
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:13,049
some fancy hotel.

213
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:15,719
You never talk like this.

214
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,622
Yeah, just...shut up and let me do this.

215
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,690
And you're on that balcony,

216
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:23,359
and you're watching the mardi gras.

217
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:26,262
It's called carnival.

218
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,767
And i don't wanna go without you.

219
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:34,370
I want you to.

220
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:38,742
And i want it to be everything
you've ever dreamed of.

221
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,710
Sorry to interrupt...

222
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:43,446
but i'd like to run one more test...

223
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,048
on you.

224
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:51,655
This is the first day we got him.

225
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:53,623
He was six.

226
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:57,293
Sweetest little boy you ever met.

227
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:01,097
Must have been scary...
going through a trauma

228
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:04,067
and then being handed
off to a new family.

229
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:07,437
We kept telling him to
call us richard and julia,

230
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,873
but it was always mr. And mrs. Kutner.

231
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:14,444
And on his ninth birthday,
we gave him a chemistry set.

232
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:18,715
Lawrence always loved blowing things up.

233
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:23,753
And he said, "thanks, mom. Thanks, dad."

234
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:26,122
That's who we were from then on.

235
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,294
He was pretty special.

236
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,730
We were lucky to have him.

237
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:36,933
You spent the most time with him.

238
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,936
He spoke so highly of all of you.

239
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:44,574
Do you have any idea?

240
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:47,276
Wish we did.

241
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:51,180
We all... it was his name.

242
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,718
He was conflicted, didn't
know where he fit in.

243
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:58,888
Being ripped out of his
world and stuck into yours.

244
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:01,858
We encouraged him to
hold on to his heritage.

245
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,027
It's hard to still be lawrence choudhary

246
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,329
when everyone sees
you as lawrence kutner.

247
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:08,464
It was his idea to take our name.

248
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:10,867
Then you should have said no. House.

249
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,602
All his anglo name gave him

250
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,237
was the illusion that
he was someone he wasn't.

251
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,506
You were being emotional, not rational.

252
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,041
You didn't understand him.

253
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,510
We loved that boy, you son of a bitch.

254
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,647
You wanted to make him happy
by shutting out his pain.

255
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:26,683
When he looked happy, you
assumed the pain had gone.

256
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:28,518
It just got buried deeper...

257
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:30,987
leaving him tormented about who he was

258
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,622
until finally he put a bullet...

259
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,891
house!

260
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,994
Go back to the hospital.

261
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,249
I'm sorry about your son.

262
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:14,397
Indomethacin had no effect.

263
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:17,133
She's still in pain.
Rules out polyserositis.

264
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:18,367
I ran a hormone panel on eddie.

265
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:19,736
His prolactin's above normal.

266
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:23,573
Means he's actually improving.

267
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,209
Body chemistry changes
for all sorts of reasons...

268
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:27,977
stress, fear... why not love?

269
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:30,180
But maybe he's going into
some sort of remission.

270
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,515
You haven't asked if i
learned anything relevant

271
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,917
from the kutners.

272
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:36,219
If you had, i'm sure
you'd have mentioned it.

273
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:38,788
Or you're just afraid
there is something relevant.

274
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,456
Which would mean you
could have saved him.

275
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,659
I don't buy that suicide
is always a cry for help.

276
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:46,896
Sometimes you just don't want help.

277
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:50,166
Good thing you got some...

278
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:55,304
or you'd have tried
again and gotten it right.

279
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,274
She doesn't have wegener's.

280
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:01,978
Kidney function's normal.
It's not byssinosis.

281
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:05,581
It's not mitral valve
stenosis. Nothing fits.

282
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,818
If it doesn't fit any diagnosis...

283
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,255
it just leaves one diagnosis.

284
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,394
I'm dr. House.

285
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:20,029
You have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

286
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:22,331
His heart is too weak.
Yours is too strong.

287
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,900
Good news is it's fixable.

288
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,601
We induce a massive heart attack

289
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:27,070
and kill off the extra muscle.

290
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:28,537
You wanna give me a heart attack?

291
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:30,940
It's only dangerous if
your heart is normal size.

292
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:33,743
But since all the... are you serious?

293
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:35,611
No.

294
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,480
This is actually very annoying,

295
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:39,415
and i'm getting really
bored of lying to patients

296
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,716
to scare them into telling me the truth.

297
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:42,318
She's faking.

298
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,654
And yes, if she keeps faking,

299
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:47,323
i'm going to eventually do
something that will kill her.

300
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,692
How could she be... the windpipe thing?

301
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,761
That was real. Treatment
made her better.

302
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,296
But good for her was bad for you,

303
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:55,598
which was bad for her,
so she made herself bad.

304
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,100
It's all so simple.

305
00:16:57,168 --> 00:17:02,038
She figured the sicker she
was, the longer you'd hang on.

306
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,407
Charlotte?

307
00:17:09,146 --> 00:17:11,614
We haven't been this close for years.

308
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:14,317
I wanted to hang on to that.

309
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:19,255
Oh, please. People hate reruns.

310
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:21,457
It's my leg. I swear this is real!

311
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,626
What, you pinky swear,
or you just plain swear?

312
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,028
Because...

313
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:30,233
how can she fake that?

314
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:33,336
She can't.

315
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,543
so...what can shred an epiglottis

316
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,478
and make muscle disappear?

317
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:43,482
Mr. And mrs. Kutner.

318
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,251
They caused kutner's
death. Why not charlotte's?

319
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:47,019
Mourning period's over.

320
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:48,654
Foreman's sense of irony is back.

321
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:52,391
I was wrong about the ethnic reason.

322
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,061
Step one... change your name back.

323
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:57,129
Step two... if step one fails,

324
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:59,565
move to bangalore.

325
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:02,368
Step 14... if step 13
doesn't work, kill yourself.

326
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:04,670
So what now... you gonna insult
your way through his rolodex

327
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:06,172
till you find someone with an answer?

328
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:08,006
I've been polite to
the friends i've called,

329
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:10,576
all of whom were useless.
They weren't useless.

330
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:13,079
They just didn't know
anything more than we did.

331
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:14,613
Tomato, tomah-to.

332
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:17,015
M.s. Weakens myelin sheath,
compromises nerve conduction.

333
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:19,385
I'm talking about charlotte,
the one who's still alive.

334
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:21,620
You two, stick her in an mri.

335
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:23,922
Confirm m.s.

336
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,257
And you run the echo on eddie

337
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,193
that you're planning
to do behind my back

338
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,028
to see if his heart's improving.

339
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:34,333
Did you let me hire a pervert?

340
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:36,702
Well, it would
hypocritical of me not to.

341
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:39,771
Kutner's police background
check from when he started.

342
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,907
He was charged with indecent exposure.

343
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:44,243
Kutner streaked at the
penn-dartmouth football game.

344
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:47,779
Precisely the kind of thing
you'd expect him to do.

345
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:51,217
It's okay. You should be upset.

346
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:53,986
He thought like you,
pushed boundaries like you.

347
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:56,355
If he thought like me...

348
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:58,056
he would have known
that living in misery

349
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,860
sucks marginally less than dying in it.

350
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:05,831
Just a few more minutes,

351
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:08,867
then we'll get you back to eddie.

352
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:10,936
What's it like, 30
years with the same man?

353
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:13,705
Great for me.

354
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:16,908
Good for him, i hope.

355
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:18,744
You don't think he loves you?

356
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,747
I think he always loved me in his way.

357
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,716
Just not in the "spend
time with me or show emotion

358
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:28,754
or any affection for me" sort of way.

359
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:31,823
Why did you stay?

360
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:34,793
I didn't need him to feel about me

361
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:37,329
the way i did about him.

362
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:40,232
Love...doesn't...

363
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,169
charlotte?

364
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,608
I've heard stories

365
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:54,480
of cancer patients going
into spontaneous remission.

366
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,748
You think this might
be that sort of thing?

367
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,250
It's unlikely, but you never know.

368
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:00,619
If i just had a little more time...

369
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:04,256
be with charlotte, try
and do better by her.

370
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:05,624
Yeah, maybe.

371
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:08,126
You don't think i mean it.

372
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:10,929
I think you mean it now.

373
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:12,164
I think it's much easier to mean it

374
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:14,233
than to do anything about it.

375
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:24,910
Chamber walls are barely moving.

376
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:27,446
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:41,628 --> 00:20:43,962
He needs a friend.

378
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,866
I can't...deal with this and house.

379
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,435
You need a friend too.

380
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,570
You couldn't give a crap what i need.

381
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:54,707
You just want someone
to take care of him.

382
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:03,716
He told kutner's parents
it was their fault.

383
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:12,458
Ruptured spleen. Means it's not m.s.

384
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:14,393
What are you doing here?

385
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,362
Waiting for you to fix her spleen

386
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:18,230
so we can biopsy it for
rheumatoid arthritis.

387
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:20,031
I'll do it. Go home.

388
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,236
She's not your patient.
And kutner wasn't my friend.

389
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:27,873
Kutner wanted to die. Charlotte doesn't.

390
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,708
So in a contest for my
concern and interest,

391
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,410
she wins.

392
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:33,945
Okay, either you're
a cold-hearted bastard

393
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:35,481
or you're too miserable to face it.

394
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,750
Go home and cry.

395
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:40,653
It's not rheumatoid
arthritis. Her liver's scarred.

396
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,556
Whatever she's got, it's spreading.

397
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:03,609
For the record,

398
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:08,414
i'm uncomfortable violating
a dead colleague's dignity.

399
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:16,288
It's only violating it
if you find something.

400
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:19,358
Good to see you.

401
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:23,061
What are we looking for?

402
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:25,597
He was hiding.

403
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:26,898
Why?

404
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:30,369
Shame? Fear?

405
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:32,938
Are you okay?

406
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:35,841
It's okay not to be okay.

407
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:41,246
"Colonial warrior
blaster. Number one one."

408
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:44,049
He'd have spent months
tracking this down.

409
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:45,818
He had passions.

410
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:49,020
He was obviously in pain.

411
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,992
Does it really matter why?

412
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,628
He hung the bad with the good.

413
00:22:56,696 --> 00:23:01,066
His loss beside a reminder
of what he'd gained.

414
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:05,203
Means he was open about the pain.

415
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:06,905
Should mean that if it got worse,

416
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,140
he had no reason to hide it.

417
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:14,713
Here's how we're gonna
handle this, house.

418
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,783
We're gonna leave here
and go to the closest bar

419
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:19,985
and drink and tell stories

420
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:23,655
about the time kutner
almost blew up an o.r.

421
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:26,759
And pass out in our own sick.

422
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:30,061
Sound like a plan?

423
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:53,552
What am i missing?

424
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,125
You've got that look.

425
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:01,894
You figured this out.

426
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,632
You're not here because
you care about kutner.

427
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:08,534
You're here because it's a mystery.

428
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:12,037
You're here for the puzzle.

429
00:24:12,104 --> 00:24:13,906
What if i didn't miss anything...

430
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:19,110
'cause there's nothing to miss?

431
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:22,448
He didn't kill himself.

432
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:25,517
He was murdered.

433
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:46,149
Epiglottis muscle,
spleen, and now her liver,

434
00:24:46,216 --> 00:24:49,418
which is operating at 20%
and deteriorating fast.

435
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:52,188
Autoimmune hepatitis?
Did you page foreman?

436
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:54,657
Took up cuddy's offer of time off.

437
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:56,993
Normal thyroid means no hepatitis.

438
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,861
Could be amyloidosis.

439
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:00,396
Amyloid buildup hits
the organs, tissue...

440
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:01,664
her muscles wouldn't have atrophied.

441
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,499
You run the echo on the husband?

442
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,934
Heart's still failing.

443
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,170
The improvement was only temporary.

444
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:10,372
I prefer the less subtle
answer: you were right, house.

445
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,811
So...less time proving
why hubby isn't dead.

446
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:19,082
More time proving why kutner is.

447
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:21,117
Motives for murder.

448
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,720
House...it was a suicide.

449
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:25,321
The police have already investigated.

450
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:26,823
They investigated what they saw,

451
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,424
not what they didn't saw.

452
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:31,560
Talk to friends, classmates,
pizza delivery guy.

453
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:33,096
And draft foreman.

454
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,463
He can make calls through his tears.

455
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:35,832
No.

456
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:37,867
Is that no, i'm not
calling my boyfriend,

457
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,068
who apparently called
my boss instead of me

458
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:40,536
to say he wasn't coming in?

459
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:41,838
'cause it's really not fair

460
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,639
to have that much
subtext in one syllable.

461
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:45,875
We all wanna know why kutner did it.

462
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:49,779
But we're not gonna
waste time chasing ghosts.

463
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:53,883
You're not remotely curious?

464
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:56,385
Only why a man who embraces the rational

465
00:25:56,453 --> 00:26:01,523
is suddenly pursuing the irrational.

466
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:04,727
She could have alpha-1
anti-trypsin deficiency.

467
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:07,764
Run her aat proteins.

468
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:14,937
I'd like to be with eddie.

469
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:17,339
It's too soon after your surgery.

470
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:19,742
You can ask that someone get your organs

471
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,343
if you die, right?

472
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:24,380
Even if the donor bank turned them down?

473
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:26,883
Individual donors can
bypass the registry,

474
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,819
but there are a lot of
other factors...blood type...

475
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:31,988
i've given him blood.

476
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:34,924
It's not just... please.

477
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:41,798
If i go before him, i want
you to give him my heart.

478
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:44,633
This isn't over yet.

479
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:50,273
For me. But it is for him, isn't it?

480
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,541
Yes.

481
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:58,281
Remy hadley. I also answer to thirteen.

482
00:26:58,348 --> 00:27:00,683
I sometimes sleep with you.

483
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,685
I know i should have called.

484
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:05,521
I just need some time.

485
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:08,757
Alone?

486
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:11,794
I've worked through a lot
of bad stuff in my life.

487
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:15,531
Always done it solo.

488
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,606
So i should go.

489
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:28,144
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:30,847
Okay.

491
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:45,394
I.t.'s been trying to close
out kutner's email account.

492
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:48,364
Apparently, someone's
still logged onto it.

493
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:52,034
It wasn't hard to figure out
that his password was kutner.

494
00:27:52,102 --> 00:27:53,736
He did what they tell you not to.

495
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:55,905
He wasn't murdered.
But his parents were.

496
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:58,107
And the guy who killed them
is coming up for parole.

497
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,776
He's coming up for parole.
He's not out on parole.

498
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:04,313
Kutner testified at
every one of his hearings.

499
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:06,849
The guy wouldn't be the first
to see the clock ticking.

500
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,885
He was killed by his own gun.

501
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:11,520
Which he bought years ago,
obviously for self-defense.

502
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:13,655
In the temple. Cops found residue.

503
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:15,557
Right, the murderer would never try to

504
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:19,528
make it look like suicide...
that would be unethical.

505
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:24,934
You haven't asked about my patient.

506
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:27,270
You're waiting on aat protein results.

507
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:29,438
Means you checked up to
see that i'm still on it.

508
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:33,376
You wanna transfer the case,
but you won't because you think

509
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:35,945
it's the only thing
that's holding me together.

510
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,881
Relax. Either i'm right or i'm wrong.

511
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,582
We'll know soon enough.

512
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,152
Find what's killing your patient...

513
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,389
and then i'll find you another patient.

514
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,296
What happened? Nurses
found her like this.

515
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:54,563
She broke into the cart

516
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,432
and injected whatever she could grab.

517
00:28:56,499 --> 00:28:57,900
Dumb way to look worse for eddie.

518
00:28:57,968 --> 00:29:00,736
She wasn't trying to look worse.

519
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,406
She was trying to kill herself.

520
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,917
she's stable,

521
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:09,853
but whatever was left of her
liver is definitely shot now.

522
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:11,487
And there's no change in eddie.

523
00:29:11,556 --> 00:29:14,323
So...thanks to her idiotic move,

524
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:17,460
she's dead in 24 hours if
she doesn't get a new liver.

525
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:19,829
It was selfless. She loves him.

526
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:21,831
How does that disagree
with what i just said?

527
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,700
Test was negative for aat deficiency.

528
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:25,501
Myelofibrosis fits,

529
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,503
but testing takes at least 48 hours.

530
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:29,973
We should try a partial
donation from a live donor.

531
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,675
Damage is too severe. She
needs a whole new liver.

532
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:34,978
No diagnosis, no liver.
No liver, no living.

533
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:37,480
What do you know?

534
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:40,483
It is myelofibrosis.

535
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:43,820
Says so right here.
Who wants to tell cuddy?

536
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:46,155
How many times have you lied
to the transplant committee?

537
00:29:46,223 --> 00:29:48,291
Just twice. How many
times has it worked?

538
00:29:48,358 --> 00:29:51,628
I...don't quite see how that's relevant.

539
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:57,500
Cheese it. It's the coppers.

540
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:59,335
We're not just gonna leave them to die

541
00:29:59,403 --> 00:30:00,770
while you fixate on kutner.

542
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:02,973
Technically, he's not our patient.

543
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,374
So i'm really only leaving her to die.

544
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:07,176
We've already explored
the usual options.

545
00:30:07,244 --> 00:30:09,713
Shouldn't we at least
explore unusual ones?

546
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,547
Absolutely. Don't worry.

547
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:13,349
This is why god gave me two ears.

548
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:16,753
Kutner would say we should
just come clean with cuddy.

549
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:21,157
If only he were here to say that.

550
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:24,027
I'm sure cuddy would be
bound to fall for the old,

551
00:30:24,095 --> 00:30:27,664
"hey, the dead guy won't
mind if we're wasting... "

552
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:37,974
need an incurable romantic
to talk to incurable romantic.

553
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:39,575
Kutner wasn't murdered.

554
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,511
You deduce that by
removing your sunglasses

555
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:43,312
to the strains of a who song?

556
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,914
Suicide means you could have helped him.

557
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:47,416
Murder lets you off the hook.

558
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,889
Needs a liver. Has a liver.

559
00:30:52,957 --> 00:30:54,958
He can make a partial donation.

560
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:57,226
The faster he agrees,

561
00:30:57,294 --> 00:30:59,562
the faster she gets to not die.

562
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,698
Partial won't be enough.
She needs a whole liver.

563
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:05,601
And he'd never survive the procedure.

564
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,905
Nice symmetry, huh?

565
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:10,606
He dies on the table,

566
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,542
and you give her his whole liver.

567
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:16,379
If he's gonna do this,
he's gonna do this for love.

568
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:21,217
I thought he should talk to
someone who spoke the language.

569
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:23,687
You want me to die on the table.

570
00:31:23,754 --> 00:31:28,357
We don't want you to.
Your wife needs you to.

571
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:30,493
My heart? Is still dying.

572
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:32,662
You have a couple days at most.

573
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,932
But this could buy us
enough time to save her.

574
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,102
When can i say good-bye?

575
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,104
You can't.

576
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:45,408
If she knew what we were
planning, would she be okay?

577
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:48,578
She'll resent me.

578
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:51,447
She'll be alive. Nothing else matters.

579
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:15,638
You can't do the transplant.
Only if he said no.

580
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,640
But your urgent hovering
means he said yes.

581
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,275
His fingers have nodules.

582
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:21,111
I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.

583
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:23,613
Or you sprinkled too much
wishful thinking in your tea.

584
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,581
Obese man with lung cancer...

585
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:27,583
two easy explanations
for his heart failure.

586
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:29,819
Nodules can mean something
else, something curable.

587
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:31,520
Go back to the e.r.

588
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:33,489
My thanks to you and your cold feet.

589
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:35,358
What's going on?

590
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:36,893
I'm giving you a shot
at a cool result...

591
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,862
better yet, a chance to
prove other doctors idiotic.

592
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:40,529
Except you're wrong.

593
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:42,899
You figure that out by
taking off your sunglasses

594
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:45,534
to the strains of a who song?

595
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:47,837
The guy who killed kutner's parents

596
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:50,073
died of an aneurism two months ago.

597
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:52,441
Kutner hid from everyone.

598
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,811
You didn't get a chance
to save him... no one did.

599
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:56,579
Run the tests.

600
00:32:56,647 --> 00:33:00,116
Find out if you have
a chance to save eddie.

601
00:33:07,557 --> 00:33:09,893
Bad news.

602
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,295
Love can't save you.

603
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:17,333
On the other hand...

604
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:19,435
mold can.

605
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:22,738
Your heart failure was
caused by a fungal infection

606
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:25,341
called cardiac blastomycosis.

607
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:27,677
It started as nodules in your lungs

608
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:31,147
which every doc, except
one, mistook for cancer.

609
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:33,249
It's very rare, very curable.

610
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:35,218
I'm starting you on itraconazole.

611
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:37,620
But how come i was getting
better without the medicine?

612
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:40,223
Your emotional state
bumped your catecholamines

613
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:41,757
which helped raise your prolactin.

614
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:42,892
My emotional state?

615
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,627
Three months of treatment,

616
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:47,763
you'll be back to your
buff, chiseled self.

617
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:51,234
I don't want the treatment.

618
00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:53,336
Do the transplant.

619
00:33:53,403 --> 00:33:56,172
But you'd be trading...

620
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,008
the certainty that you'll live

621
00:33:59,076 --> 00:34:00,877
for the uncertainty that she'll live.

622
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:03,679
I was ready to die anyway.

623
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:07,717
Now you get to be
nicer to your next wife.

624
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:13,522
If you won't do it... release me.

625
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,792
And when i get hit by a car

626
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:20,830
and show up in your morgue,

627
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:24,800
you can give her my liver then.

628
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:31,013
you're basically asking
us to commit murder.

629
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,614
I was yesterday too.

630
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:34,883
There's a difference when
he has 20 years to live

631
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:36,484
instead of two days.

632
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,119
Not really. Not legally.

633
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:40,155
That's your way of
convincing us to do this,

634
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:41,924
by saying it's no more immoral?

635
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:43,959
The idiot is gonna do
this with or without us.

636
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:45,561
This way we can protect the organ.

637
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:47,228
We should be protecting him.

638
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:50,231
So we strap him to the bed,
wait till his wife dies?

639
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:53,301
I'm not doing this.

640
00:34:56,673 --> 00:35:00,042
I will.

641
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:03,845
We've already had one pointless death.

642
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:10,786
Eddie...what's going on?

643
00:35:10,853 --> 00:35:14,556
I don't know. He just came and got me.

644
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:17,092
Your husband has a curable disease,

645
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,394
but he wants to die so
he can give you his liver.

646
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:20,729
Are you okay with that,

647
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:22,397
or would you rather
he take the treatment?

648
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:24,633
You son of a bitch! Eddie, don't!

649
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:28,604
You have to let me do this.
Charlotte, can you hear me?

650
00:35:30,372 --> 00:35:31,940
She spiked a fever.

651
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:33,942
Lp shows her white
cells through the roof.

652
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,078
She's infected everywhere.
I should fire you.

653
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:37,713
Just did what you failed to do...

654
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,281
convince eddie to live
and let his wife die.

655
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:42,417
Infection means we have a new clue.

656
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:44,953
And a full two or three
hours to figure it out.

657
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:46,688
Sarcoidosis hits the
spleen and the liver.

658
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:47,956
She would have lung issues.

659
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:49,357
Scleroderma inflames the tissue.

660
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:51,392
No skin or gi problems.

661
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,595
What is she hiding?

662
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:55,163
You don't know...

663
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,398
either we have all the
clues and we're idiots

664
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:58,734
or we don't have all the clues.

665
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:03,304
Possible exposure, people, places.

666
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:05,040
Both.

667
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:10,112
Bad lie.

668
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:12,614
Did you really think
the beaches in hawaii

669
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:14,683
were just like the beaches in rio?

670
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:17,919
The disease bearing sand
flies are completely different.

671
00:36:17,987 --> 00:36:20,889
She's never been to
rio. Who'd you go with?

672
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:24,192
Why are you doing this?

673
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,427
I don't actually need
to know who it was.

674
00:36:26,495 --> 00:36:29,197
I just need to know that you went...

675
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:32,934
so we can know that you
have visceral leishmaniasis.

676
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:36,371
But since lancelot there
was ready to die for you...

677
00:36:36,438 --> 00:36:40,042
he might want the answer to both.

678
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:51,653
Last year...

679
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:55,657
it was nobody you knew.

680
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:59,260
Rio was supposed to be ours.

681
00:36:59,328 --> 00:37:03,331
I got tired of waiting.

682
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:07,836
I'm so sorry.

683
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:20,015
Start her on antimony.

684
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,851
And have cuddy find her a liver.

685
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,889
They were ready to die...

686
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:30,125
but for guilt, not love.

687
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:33,962
You can't feel that
much guilt without love.

688
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:42,738
New york mercy's medevacing the liver.

689
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:44,172
It should be here...

690
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,007
tell 'em to turn around.

691
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:48,476
Charlotte's treatment isn't taking.

692
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:52,013
We diagnosed it too late.

693
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:58,286
Everyone's heading over
to kutner's funeral.

694
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:00,088
You're welcome to ride with me.

695
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:02,924
I'm gonna stay with charlotte.

696
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:07,362
She bought you some time to save eddie.

697
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:10,132
It'll give her death some meaning.

698
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,701
No. It won't.

699
00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:23,078
I was wrong about you. No, you weren't.

700
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:24,913
You're in pain.

701
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:27,415
And you're romanticizing... again.

702
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:29,985
You worked with him
every day for two years,

703
00:38:30,052 --> 00:38:31,419
and you never saw this coming.

704
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:32,988
No one saw it coming.

705
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:35,056
But you see everything coming.

706
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:37,025
This has never been
about what you missed.

707
00:38:37,093 --> 00:38:38,994
This is about why you missed it.

708
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:41,729
You're terrified that
you're losing your gift,

709
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:45,433
losing...who you are.

710
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:50,138
And i'm terrified of what you'd do then.

711
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:52,540
Unless you feel there's
more to do here to cure me...

712
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:55,677
don't you have a funeral to go to?

713
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:33,348
I'm taking a ride ?

714
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:36,351
Off to one side ?

715
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:40,688
It is a personal thing ?

716
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:44,826
Where when i can't stand ?

717
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:52,033
Up in this cage i'm not regretting ?

718
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:58,874
I don't need a better thing ?

719
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:03,578
I'll settle for less ?

720
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:09,217
It's another thing for me ?

721
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:17,558
I just have to wander
through this world ?

722
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:20,561
Alone ?

723
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:45,253
Stop before you fall ?

724
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:52,427
Into the hole that i have dug here ?

725
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:56,764
Rest, even as you ?

726
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:04,272
Are startin' to feel the way i used to ?

727
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:09,911
I don't need a better thing ?

728
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:16,217
Just to sound confused ?

729
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:21,622
Don't talk about everyone ?

730
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:31,099
I am not amused by you ?

731
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:36,972
