1
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,600
I don't know about you,

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,900
but I'm nervous.

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,400
Zel tov!

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,300
Mazel tov!

5
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,600
This is a great thing,
roz.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,400
I am so happy for you.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,900
Thank you, mrs. Silver.

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,400
Yonatan is a good man
from a good family.

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
I know you chose well
for me.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,100
I've been blessed.

13
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Cross-species mating.

14
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,500
If you like darwin
and the galapagos.

15
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,600
Amber and I
have a lot in common.

16
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,300
She's a cutthroat bitch.

17
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
<i>You cry over dark victory. </i>

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Bette davis, another strong,
assertive woman.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,600
You don't like strong.
You don't like assertive.

20
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,800
You like needy.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,300
She's not dying, is she?

22
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,300
Yes. Go away.

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
I give it two months.

24
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Hundred bucks.

25
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,100
Not really fair.

26
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,600
You're not objective.

27
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,400
But I'm all about
the teaching-

28
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
we're at four months.

29
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,800
You hid this from me?

30
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,100
I was wrong, okay?

31
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,600
I thought you'd be upset.

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
I thought you'd track me
down in hallways-

33
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,200
<i>I shouldn't have
discounted the sex. </i>

34
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
<i>She's obviously limber enough</i>

35
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,100
to put off the meltdown
for two months.

36
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,600
She's not needy.
I don't need needy.

37
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
She's scary.

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,100
Why does scary need pathetic?

39
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,500
Are you gonna talk to her?

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't see
that I have any choice.

41
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,400
You all right with that?

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
<i>No impulse
to save her from me?</i>

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,300
I've broken
the pattern, House.

44
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,900
Which is why
this has a chance.

45
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,200
<i>I know
you're too suspicious</i>

46
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,900
to accept that
without getting out your ruler,

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,800
and your calipers, and
your scanning equipment, so...

48
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,300
Go ahead.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,300
Get it out of
your system.

50
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
38-Year-old female
with loss of bladder control,

51
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,500
<i>blood in her urine,
and a broken leg</i>

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,100
from collapsing
at her wedding.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Ampicillin for the uti.
Shiny cast for the leg.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,300
You guys know
Wilson's dating Amber?

55
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,900
No.

56
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,100
Wilson and Amber?

57
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,900
I knew.

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I asked her out.

59
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,700
Said she'd just
started seeing someone.

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,100
<i>Cultures were negative
for utis. </i>

61
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,000
No signs of previous
trauma or stds.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,700
- Kidney cancer.
- Ct was clean for tumors and kidney stones.

63
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
I thought Amber
scared you guys.

64
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,800
She does.

65
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,700
But she also has legs that go
all the way up to canada.

66
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,900
So do canadians-doesn't mean
I wanna date one.

67
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,500
Her sodium's low-could be
endometriosis in the bladder.

68
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,100
Low sodium
could also be from low food.

69
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,200
Hasidic jews
fast on their wedding day.

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Or sodium was absorbed by
a toxin already in her system.

71
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,200
Was it just the legs,

72
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,700
or did you detect something
resembling a soul?

73
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,900
She grew on me.

74
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,700
If there's a toxin in her,
could be carbolic acid.

75
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm talking
about the patient now.

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,300
That much carbolic acid,

77
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,800
someone would have had
to poison her.

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,500
Could have been a cossack-
if this was 18th century poland

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,900
and cossacks were
into Household cleansers.

80
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,700
Which is why it's more likely
that the poisoner was poisonee.

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,100
Suicide's a sin.

82
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,700
Corollary of "people lie"
is "people sin. "

83
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,000
And in my world,
people includes jews.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,900
She was getting married.

85
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,200
Hasidic women marry young

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,800
so they can start pushing out
little hasidilings.

87
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,500
38 Means a woman
not on anyone's hot list

88
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
being pushed onto a guy
who's not on anyone's hot list.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,600
No way out, no way out.

90
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,900
Endometriosis fit's better

91
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,600
than an epiphany
that her life is meaningless.

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,100
We should start her on a. I. S
and do a cystoscopy to confirm.

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,900
Fine, check her innards
for bad cells

94
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,600
and her home for bad karma.

95
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,400
Carbolic acid
should be on the shelf

96
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,300
right next to the regret
and the self-loathing.

97
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,000
These people are crazy.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Yeah. She should
be self-hating.

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,700
I'm not self-hating.

100
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,500
I hate religious people who are
out of touch with reality.

101
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,300
You only marry someone
you met three times

102
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
if they're carrying
a little mistake.

103
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,400
What's their divorce rate?

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,100
<i>Cleaners are all organic. </i>

105
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,800
Nothing with carbolic acid.

106
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,500
You like
how they hook up?

107
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
Romance is just
emotional foreplay.

108
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
Candlelight meals,
flowers.

109
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
It's as much a ritual
as anything these people do.

110
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,700
<i>Why not go with someone
who's pre-vetted,</i>

111
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
shares the same values?

112
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
<i>Cut to the quick. </i>

113
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
<i>Values may give you
the big picture,</i>

114
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,500
<i>but time together
gives you the little picture-</i>

115
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,300
<i>does she chew her food
too loud?</i>

116
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,200
<i>Will she leave you alone
during the final four?</i>

117
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
You commit
to something deeper,

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
you let the little
surprises slide.

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Surprises kill-
which is why I only commit

120
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
when there are
no more surprises.

121
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
And you have no more surprises
for your wife.

122
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Do you think this came up
on date number two?

123
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,500
You ever heard
of a hasidic jew into hard rock?

124
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,100
She's listed as a producer
on all of these.

125
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,500
Where there's rock and roll,

126
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,100
and sex...

127
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Usually, there's drugs.

128
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,900
<i>I'm baal teshuvah. </i>

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,700
I became hasidic
about six months ago.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
And before six months ago?

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,600
Music business isn't
exactly known for it's holiness.

132
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,000
Heroin.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,700
But I have been clean
for months.

134
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Yonatan knows.

135
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,500
The broad strokes.

136
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,900
He never actually asks
the details.

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Says what's important
is the person that I am now,

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
not the person I was then.

139
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
How do you go
all the way from-

140
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,500
just took a class.

141
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,200
Then I took another class.

142
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,000
And you just completely left
the music business?

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,000
Pop music is considered
frivolous.

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,700
Same reason we don't watch tv
or go to movies.

145
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Your drug use may have caused
some long term damage.

146
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
<i>We're gonna need
to take a hair sample</i>

147
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,800
to test for latent toxins.

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,700
<i>So you can never watch
star wars again. </i>

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
You figured
that I'll hire you

150
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
if you promise
to dump Wilson.

151
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200
- How did you-
- Wilson had a key.

152
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,900
<i>You figure that I'll make
your life hell at first,</i>

153
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
but I'll eventually see
how good you are and keep you.

154
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,500
It's a good plan,
don't you think?

155
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,900
Perfectly tailored
to your personality.

156
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
No, it's not.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
You know it's not.

158
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
<i>Means you just wanna stay
in my orbit. </i>

159
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,100
'Cause you figure
I'll eventually realize

160
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
that I made a mistake

161
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
and you're gonna be able
to rub my face in it.

162
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,200
I can't wait.
It's gonna be awesome.

163
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,900
No, it's not.
And you know it's not.

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,700
<i>'Cause you know that even
if I made a mistake,</i>

165
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,500
<i>I'd never admit
that I made a mistake. </i>

166
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,100
Which means that you're
just toying with Wilson

167
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,900
to toy with me.

168
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,800
Your goal
is pure feral vengeance.

169
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,200
Innocent bystander,

170
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,500
but there's
a greater good.

171
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,400
No, that's not it.

172
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Because a bag
of flaming poop

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,700
bypasses the bystander.

174
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,300
So...

175
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,800
Which is it, House?

176
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,600
Am I in this for you...

177
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Or am I in this for him?

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,700
Give him back
his sweatshirt.

179
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,400
Pit stains
don't become you.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Treatment had no effect.

181
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Rules out endometriosis.

182
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
And her hair sample
was negative

183
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
for residue drugs.

184
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,400
This woman lived
in the fast lane

185
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,200
till six months ago.

186
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Maybe we're missing
something.

187
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,100
She admitted drug use.

188
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,600
Doubt she's holding out on her
days as an asbestos miner.

189
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,900
Cryoglobulinemia might account
for the symptoms.

190
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400
Except for
the one you missed.

191
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,500
There's no change
in her condition.

192
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
I'm not talking
about a new symptom.

193
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm talking about one
that presented six months ago.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,900
Look, she's nuts,
but we can't just give her

195
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,100
10 ccs of atheism
and send her home.

196
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Religion is a symptom
of irrational belief

197
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
and groundless hope.

198
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
Altered mental status,
on the other hand,

199
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
is a symptom of porphyria.

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,900
She didn't develop
uncontrollable anger,

201
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,100
crying, anxiety.

202
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,700
She just decided
to go to temple.

203
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,500
<i>The woman didn't just
choose to keep kosher. </i>

204
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
She went directly
to the extremes of hasidism,

205
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,000
a life of stringent rules.

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,100
She became a masochist.

207
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,000
She didn't like her old life,
so she changed it.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
People don't change.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,800
They want to.
They need to.

210
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,100
Taub gave up a six figure
plastic surgery career

211
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,500
for this job.

212
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,900
That mean he has
porphyria?

213
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
He switched jobs
to save his marriage.

214
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,200
He did it to avoid change.

215
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,400
He's right.

216
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
<i>You don't suddenly
choose crazy</i>

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
without suddenly
being crazy.

218
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,200
No, no, if she walked
away from everything

219
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
to go base jumping
or live with apes,

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
we wouldn't be having
this discussion.

221
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,100
We would if she was
also tinkling blood

222
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,000
out of her overexcited bladder.

223
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,900
Pump hadassah full of hematin
and give her a phlebotomy.

224
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Bloodletting?

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,100
<i>Porphyria is a rare
genetic disorder</i>

226
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,500
that causes an overproduction
of a certain protein.

227
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,600
Draining the blood
relieves-

228
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,700
the hair test
for damage from drugs

229
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
showed she has
a rare genetic disease?

230
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,900
Not-not exactly.

231
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,600
We're testing her now
to confirm.

232
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,700
You're treating it
before you confirm it?

233
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,700
<i>Blood test results
take 24 hours. </i>

234
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,800
You must have seen something
that makes you suspect it.

235
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Dr. House has

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
a theory.

237
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,300
A theory based on what?

238
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,900
We'd like
a different doctor.

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,300
I assure you
that dr. House is our best-

240
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,500
then we will settle
for second-best,

241
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,400
someone who doesn't think
my wife is sick

242
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,500
just because
she's religious.

243
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,900
<i>If you prefer,</i>

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
I can give your wife
my second-best diagnosis.

245
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Do you know Wilson's
dating Amber?

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
I have reviewed
the chart.

247
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,700
Someone on your team
must have pointed out

248
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,600
that cryoglobulinemia
also fit's the symptoms.

249
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
<i>Yes, it fit's many
of the symptoms. </i>

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
<i>My wife's body is sick. </i>

251
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,900
Her mind and soul are fine.

252
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,500
You live according to god's
600 commitments, right?

253
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
613.

254
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
You understand them all?

255
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,000
Takes a lifetime
of learning...

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,900
But you follow
the ones

257
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,700
you don't understand because
the ones you do understand

258
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,900
make sense, and you believe

259
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,000
the guy who created them
knows what he's doing.

260
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,400
Of course.

261
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,900
So you will trust
my diagnosis

262
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,000
and you'll let me
treat her,

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
<i>because in this temple,
I am dr. Yahweh. </i>

264
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
I want a new doctor.

265
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,700
I'm starting her
on indomethacin

266
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,500
for cryoglobulinemia.

267
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
People don't change.

268
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,400
For example, I'm gonna keep repeating
people don't change.

269
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
So alcoholics that successfully

270
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,700
go through treatment
don't exist.

271
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,400
They're still alcoholics.

272
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,900
If they never take a drink
as long as they live,

273
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,800
it's only 'cause
they didn't live long enough.

274
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,000
If you're dissatisfied
with your life,

275
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,700
changing it is a symptom
of mental health.

276
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,600
I get why that concept
is strange to you.

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
O2 sats are 85.

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
<i>She's hypoxic.
We might need to intubate. </i>

279
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,100
What's wrong with her?

280
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
It's definitely not
cryoglobulinemia.

281
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Better ask him.

282
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,900
<i>We kept her
on oxygen overnight. </i>

283
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,100
Her respiratory rate
stabilized,

284
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,200
and her o-sat's
back up to 95.

285
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I saw Amber drop off Wilson
this morning.

286
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes, the male
always drives the female.

287
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,200
So what caused
the breathing problem?

288
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,800
Pulmonary involvement
rules out porphyria.

289
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,100
She kiss him or he kiss her?

290
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,000
I missed it.

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
The lab tech with the tongue
stud also pulled up.

292
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,100
Wegener's would explain
her elevated sed rate.

293
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,600
Wegener's wouldn't explain
the changed mental status.

294
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,700
Actually, we've
been trying to ignore

295
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,300
that part
of the whiteboard.

296
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,000
I wrote it in black.

297
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm always serious
when I use black.

298
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,700
- Lupus would explain-
- maybe she didn't change.

299
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
Are you agreeing with me
or you making a point?

300
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,500
I'm making a point.

301
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,600
That's gonna take longer.

302
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,900
<i>How do we know
that the real roz</i>

303
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,100
isn't who she is now
and who she was then?

304
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
<i>Can't we say that
her previous life was true</i>

305
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,100
without making
her present one a fraud?

306
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,900
"Life is messy" argument.
Nice.

307
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,700
<i>Explains everything
without explaining anything. </i>

308
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,800
If it's lupus,
there's a heart problem

309
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,100
<i>we don't know about yet. </i>

310
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
Run her through
a stress test.

311
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,200
If she has a heart attack,
I'm right.

312
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
Or we could wait,
hope that-

313
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
you're afraid
to give her a heart attack.

314
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
Of course we're afraid-

315
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
no reason to be afraid.

316
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,100
Unless you think I'm right.

317
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,700
It's wegener's.

318
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
But we'll have the crash cart
just in case.

319
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh, my god!
What are you guys doing here?

320
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,700
I had a sudden yen
for fusion.

321
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,100
I put a different restaurant
in my date book.

322
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm firing my assistant.

323
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,400
That's okay.

324
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,200
Hi, greg.

325
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,500
And I call you greg
because we're now social equals.

326
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I call you
cutthroat bitch...

327
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,900
<i>Well,
quod erat demonstrandum. </i>

328
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,100
And I speak in latin

329
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,400
because I don't try to hide
what an ass I am.

330
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,100
I assume you'd like
to join us?

331
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,800
It'll be easier
to observe our interaction

332
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,000
if you're at the same table.

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
If we ever get seated.

334
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,700
Excuse me.

335
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,400
No, no, i, uh-

336
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,500
we've been waiting for ...

337
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,200
<i>Any minute now,</i>

338
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,500
she's gonna hit him
in the face

339
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,000
with your testicles.

340
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,700
She tends to treat e-

341
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,600
she tends to treat
every event

342
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,700
like it's the last copter
out of saigon.

343
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,400
<i>She's the anti-Wilson. </i>

344
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
She's a force
for evil.

345
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
She has
an annoying quality.

346
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
Perhaps even two.

347
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
If I was perfect,
I would date perfect.

348
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,900
You like that!

349
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,100
It's annoying,
but she's good at it.

350
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Wait a second.

351
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,300
This isn't just
about the sex.

352
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
You like her personality.
You like that she's conniving.

353
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,400
You like that she has
no regard for consequences.

354
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,600
You like that she can
humiliate someone if it serves-

355
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
oh, my god.

356
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,800
You're sleeping with me.

357
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,300
I need you to go faster, roz.

358
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,600
A little harder.

359
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,700
I am going harder,
damn it.

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
What if dr. House
was right?

361
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,200
And roz did make
a radical change?

362
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
Lupus is chronic
but treatable.

363
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,100
And with the treatment,
it'd undo the change?

364
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,400
She'll be the way she was
before I knew her?

365
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,100
I don't think it's likely.

366
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,700
Then you don't know for sure.

367
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
You'd find someone else.

368
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,800
There isn't someone else.

369
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
You've had three dates.

370
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,700
How long have you
been married?

371
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,900
12 Years.

372
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,400
And is she the one?

373
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
We wouldn't still be together
if she weren't.

374
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,300
I love her as much now
as the day-

375
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,000
<i>well, you should
love her more. </i>

376
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,500
The more you know someone,

377
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,200
the more you
should love them.

378
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,800
Okay, that's enough, roz.

379
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
Okay, your heart's
as strong as a battleship.

380
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,300
<i>Does this mean
dr. House was wrong?</i>

381
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
Oh! Oh, my leg!

382
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Heart's strong enough
to prove you wrong

383
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
about the change
in mental status.

384
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,900
Only proves
this isn't lupus.

385
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,000
Just as the leg pain proves
it isn't wegener's.

386
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,700
Leg pain can be
from nerve entrapment.

387
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,900
We're thinking
blood clot.

388
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
Do an mri
to look for the clot.

389
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Then do an fmri.

390
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,300
- An mri alone ...
- If the clot hasn't dissolved.

391
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,800
An fmri can show signs
of near-ischemic stroke

392
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,600
in post-ischemic parts
of the brain.

393
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,600
- Give me ten bucks.
- No.

394
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,500
I missed lunch.

395
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,800
- I thought you went-
- I missed lunch.

396
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,300
Good symmetrical activity
in both hemispheres.

397
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,400
Caudal structures look okay.

398
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,500
She hasn't changed?

399
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
<i>Sex, drugs,
rock and roll,</i>

400
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,300
the 600 rules of god
are all in there somewhere.

401
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,000
We oversimplify people.

402
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,900
<i>It's how
the human mind works. </i>

403
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
<i>Everything's
on or off. </i>

404
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Everything's got a category.

405
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,500
You don't like it.

406
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
You don't wanna be
oversimplified.

407
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
Roz, move your right leg.

408
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
No one can describe themselves
in ten words.

409
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,700
Why would we want to hear
anyone else do it?

410
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,200
So you keep it a mystery.

411
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,100
No categories
if no one knows anything.

412
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,000
Do you think maybe
you're oversimplifying me now?

413
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,100
No.

414
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,600
I'm sure you have
many reasons

415
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,900
to keep yourself a mystery,

416
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
besides the fact
that you're bisexual.

417
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,200
Uh... Denial would have worked
before the long, vacant stare.

418
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Roz, move your left leg
just an inch.

419
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,500
People who have a problem
with boxes

420
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,200
are people
who don't fit in them.

421
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,300
You've been working
for House for a long time.

422
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,700
No need for name calling.

423
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,100
I would ask if this
was gonna be lunchtime gossip,

424
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,000
but lucky for me-

425
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
I don't give a damn.

426
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,000
How's our mental yentl?

427
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,900
Mri shows no sign
of clots.

428
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,500
<i>Fmri shows
no problem areas. </i>

429
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,100
Go restart her iv.

430
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,400
- What's wrong with it?
- Nothing.

431
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
But like so many procedures
we put patients through,

432
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,400
it hurts.

433
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,200
Which, if she's enjoying it,
will show up in pretty colors.

434
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,800
This is why you wanted
an fmri?

435
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,300
It showed she didn't
have a blood clot,

436
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
<i>which is diagnostically
relevant. </i>

437
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,100
And it can show
if she's become a masochist-

438
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,000
also diagnostically relevant.

439
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,300
And it'll be cool.

440
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
Either will explain which part
of my analysis makes sense.

441
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
Or go do it.

442
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
It isn't cool.

443
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,800
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
<i>Heavens.
Look at her limbic system. </i>

445
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,400
<i>Pleasure centers are lighting
up like a hanukah bush. </i>

446
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,900
Foreman must have
a touch like an elephant.

447
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, roz.
We've got what we need.

448
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,700
Yes, it was impressive.

449
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Roz.

450
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,300
You all right?

451
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
I'm sorry.
I was praying.

452
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,100
All through
the procedure?

453
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,000
No.

454
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
When dr. Foreman
apologized,

455
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,800
I knew something bad
was gonna happen.

456
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
She was praying.

457
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,000
<i>Could explain
the brain activity. </i>

458
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,300
Bp, nd heart rate
are dropping.

459
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,000
She's crashing.

460
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,300
She's stabilizing.

461
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,700
Get her up.

462
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,300
All the way up.
On her feet.

463
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Make her do that again.

464
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,800
We started her on
fludrocortisone and ephedrine.

465
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
<i>It's planet of the apes. </i>

466
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
Apes are the humans,
humans are the apes.

467
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>It's wacky wednesday,
opposite day. </i>

468
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,600
<i>When you stand up,</i>

469
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
your bp and heart rate
are supposed to go up, not-

470
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
got it.

471
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,300
So what causes bloody urine,

472
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
loss of bladder control,
leg pain, altered mental status,

473
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,600
and pressure-blood
in direction-wrong?

474
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,100
Pheochromocytoma.

475
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,500
Low catecholamines
in the urine

476
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,700
means no pheochromocytoma
in the jewess.

477
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,500
Could be
systemic sclerosis.

478
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Mental status.

479
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,900
She was praying.

480
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,500
She was in pain.
You no longer think she's crazy?

481
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,800
I can see why she'd be attracted
to that life.

482
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,000
You drank the
manishevitz-flavored kool-aid.

483
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,300
I'm not saying I agree.
I'm just saying-

484
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,600
that there's a rational basis
for the irrational.

485
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
They have something
we don't have.

486
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,700
Imaginary friends.

487
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,900
If the toaster's not working,
wiring could be bad.

488
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
Which debate is that metaphor
supposed to help us with?

489
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
Electrical problem
in the heart.

490
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>Arrhythmia messes with
the blood flow when she stands,</i>

491
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,300
<i>causes low bp and heart rate. </i>

492
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,900
Could also impact
mental status.

493
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,000
Everybody's happy.

494
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,100
Run an ep study of her heart.

495
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>Find where the wiring's
verklempt. </i>

496
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Went by your hotel
this morning.

497
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
They told me
you moved out.

498
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,000
Moved in with c. B. ?

499
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No, apparently,
I moved in with you.

500
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,900
The very fact
that you're resisting my insight

501
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,800
proves to me-

502
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
House, you're right.

503
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,300
Why not?
Why not date you?

504
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
It's brilliant.

505
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,100
We've known each other
for years,

506
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,300
we've put up with all kinds
of crap from each other,

507
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,000
and we keep coming back.

508
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,400
We're a couple.

509
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,000
Are we still speaking
metaphorically?

510
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,400
<i>Amber is exactly
what I need</i>

511
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,200
and you would agree if you
weren't mired in self-loathing

512
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,400
topped with a thin crust
of megalomania.

513
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Hey. That's my best friend's
girl you're talking about.

514
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
I was wrong.

515
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,200
House, you're right.

516
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,400
She's not me.
Well, she is me.

517
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,900
But that's not why
she's attractive.

518
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,300
She's a needy version
of me.

519
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,100
Hard to imagine
such a mythical creature.

520
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,700
You started seeing her
right after I fired her.

521
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,900
I started seeing her
four months ago.

522
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
She told kutner
it was four weeks.

523
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
You lied to me.

524
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,200
There was money
on the line.

525
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,400
Because I knew
how you'd react,

526
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,000
and I knew you
wouldn't pay me anyway.

527
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,300
You knew that I was right.

528
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,000
She wasn't needy.

529
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,100
She was in a...
Bad situation.

530
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
There's a difference.

531
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,100
Not to your libido.

532
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,900
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

533
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,500
Why are you doing this?

534
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,100
Every time I agree with you,
you find a new argument.

535
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,800
What are you
trying to avoid?

536
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,600
Well, if you'd looked at me
with those flashing eyes

537
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,300
before I was involved...

538
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
<i>C'est la vie. </i>

539
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,600
And... I use
the french because...

540
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,000
You're an ass.

541
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,600
Right atrium normal,
no arrhythmia.

542
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,800
You can become
a d'har master.

543
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,600
Does that require
further explanation?

544
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,600
Right ventricle normal.

545
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,700
In college, I was really
into science fiction-

546
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,200
not like the guys
with the $600 prosthetic ears

547
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
who could swear in romulan,

548
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,900
that was embarrassing
to the rest of us

549
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
who just thought it was
good, smart literature.

550
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
Went to one convention.

551
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,000
By senior year, I was d'har
master in the klingon empire.

552
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,300
I'm not gonna become
hasidic.

553
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,700
I'm not even gonna become
slightly more reformed.

554
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,800
Coronary sinus normal.

555
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
You can't have your eyes opened
to something and not act on it.

556
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,600
I haven't had
my eyes opened.

557
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
I just... Don't think
they're crazy anymore.

558
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,800
Then they have
something to offer.

559
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,700
She's living proof

560
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,500
<i>that sane people
can make radical changes. </i>

561
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,600
But House, he thinks
that he can bully-

562
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
<i>no loshon hora. </i>

563
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,500
I'm sorry?

564
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
I think she's telling you
to stop deflecting.

565
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,000
<i>No loshon hora. </i>

566
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,800
<i>Evil tongue. </i>

567
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Gossip.

568
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,400
It's okay.

569
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,500
Thanks to the sedative,
you won't remember it.

570
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,000
Words are permanent.

571
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,900
<i>Someday you'll say something</i>

572
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,100
that you'll wish
you could take back.

573
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,400
This bundle's normal.

574
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
Pathways are all clean.
No arrhythmias.

575
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,300
If the toaster doesn't work

576
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,700
and the wiring
in the House is fine,

577
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,400
problem's gotta be
in the city's power grid.

578
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Autonomic nerve disorder
could be riley-day syndrome.

579
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,600
Congratulations
on your wedding.

580
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,700
You have a rare and incurable
degenerative disease.

581
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,900
I'll set up for
a thermoregulatory sweat test.

582
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
She's a bisexual.

583
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,100
What?

584
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,500
I could hear them talking
from inside the mri.

585
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,600
Hear who?
I heard the word sex.

586
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,200
<i>- It was interesting.
- What was interesting?</i>

587
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
It doesn't matter.

588
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,700
We're doctors.

589
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,800
We never know
what's gonna matter.

590
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,900
She said sex.

591
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
If she wants to tell you
when she wakes up...

592
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,100
Yeah, these people
aren't gonna change you at all.

593
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,500
I need you to sleep
with Wilson.

594
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Good morning.

595
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,900
He's involved
with an inappropriate woman.

596
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,200
His people are sheepherders
and Amber's are cattlemen?

597
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,800
He's combining two
of his worst qualities-

598
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
his love for me
and his love for need.

599
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,400
<i>As administrator
of this hospital,</i>

600
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,800
you have to save
your star oncologist.

601
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,300
Wish I could help,
but as administrator,

602
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,500
there are some people
in accounting

603
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,700
I'm scheduled
to sleep with first.

604
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
Wilson has a pattern
with women.

605
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,600
<i>He saves them,
then he betrays them,</i>

606
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,300
which then causes guilt...

607
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,000
Which then causes him
to go save somebody else.

608
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
For example, a hospital
bureaucrat nearing 40

609
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,300
who has no personal life.

610
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,900
I suggest
you go braless.

611
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,600
I get that "sleep with"
is your way of saying

612
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
I should talk to him?

613
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,800
No. I really mean
sleep with.

614
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,300
You're not worried

615
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,400
you're worried
it'll succeed.

616
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,100
That Wilson will no longer be
at your beck and call 24/7.

617
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,800
That your best friend
will change.

618
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,500
People don't change just
because they wish they could.

619
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,000
And it bugs you
that he wishes he could!

620
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,300
You'll never lose
your friend, House.

621
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
You're the long-distance runner
of neediness.

622
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,200
<i>As the chAmber heats up,</i>

623
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
<i>roz's body temperature
should also rise,</i>

624
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,900
making her sweat
and turning the powder purple.

625
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,100
No change in color
means no sweating,

626
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,900
which means her central
nervous system is damaged.

627
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
I shouldn't
see her like this.

628
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,300
We could have a diagnosis

629
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,700
as soon as she comes
out of the chAmber.

630
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,800
It might be better
if you stayed.

631
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,300
It's disrespectful.

632
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,700
I'm sure sure she imagined

633
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,800
<i>the first time
her husband would see her</i>

634
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
bare like this would be
celebrating the marriage.

635
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
Given the circumstances,

636
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,900
I think roz
would sacrifice modesty

637
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,300
to have you with her.

638
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Please.
Don't do that.

639
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
What? I think it's nice
that you're here.

640
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,800
- I think-
- you think it's sweet...

641
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,400
That I care for her modesty,

642
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,100
but that it's archaic
and ultimately irrelevant.

643
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,800
Our traditions
aren't just blind rituals.

644
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,900
They... They mean something.

645
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,100
They have purpose.

646
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,600
I respect my wife.

647
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,400
And I respect her body.

648
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
Her body temperature's
stopped climbing.

649
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,200
What's going on?

650
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,300
She's having a seizure!
We need a crash cart!

651
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,000
Blankets too!
She's freezing.

652
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,400
<i>She was supposed to sweat
and she froze. </i>

653
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,600
<i>Return to the planet
of the apes. </i>

654
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,500
Hypothermia caused the seizure.

655
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,200
What caused the hypothermia?

656
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,400
<i>It could be an infection. </i>

657
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
<i>Her white blood cell
count was fine. </i>

658
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,700
When she was admitted.

659
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,100
She could have picked
something up here.

660
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,000
Complication
on a complication?

661
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,800
Body's doing the opposite
of what it's supposed to.

662
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,000
Her body's Wilson.

663
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,700
How do we respond to that?

664
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,300
We accept
that he's happy.

665
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,500
We do the opposite.

666
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
So you want us to what,
send the patient home?

667
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,100
Infection... Means that

668
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,500
something's been added
to the body,

669
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,400
something that should
be expelled.

670
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,900
What's the opposite
of that?

671
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
Something missing
from the body.

672
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,300
Could be an enzyme
or a hormone.

673
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,300
Cortisol.
Could be addison's.

674
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,900
It fit's.

675
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,100
Every symptom.

676
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,200
I'll run a cortisol
stimulation test.

677
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Are you sure
she doesn't wanna just

678
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,500
take you back to her lair,
hang you upside down,

679
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,100
and deposit her eggs
in you?

680
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,400
Excellent disguise,
House.

681
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,400
You two are really
that serious?

682
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,300
She's pretty.
She's funny.

683
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,800
- Maybe she's a little more...
- Evil?

684
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Aggressive than
you'd expect from me.

685
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,300
But I'm happy.

686
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,000
Can't I just enjoy what
that feels like for a while?

687
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
How many people have looked
at you trustingly

688
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,100
while you gave them
a fatal prognosis,

689
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,200
but you knew it was kinder
to tell them the truth?

690
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,500
Amber compulsively looks out
for number one.

691
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,800
You compulsively look out
for the person that you're with.

692
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Your needs are gonna feed
her needs

693
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,400
until all that's left
is a Wilson chalk outline

694
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,800
on the floor.

695
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Sorry.

696
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Wow!

697
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,500
That cortisol stuff
is great.

698
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,300
Does it work
on everything?

699
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,800
I take it
you're feeling better.

700
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Oh, still weak.

701
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>But yeah. </i>

702
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
You must be so tired.

703
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,300
You should go home
and get some sleep.

704
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,400
I'll stay.

705
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,600
I never told you,
but you are much better looking

706
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,800
than mrs. Silver
led me to expect.

707
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
<i>She never liked me. </i>

708
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,400
When I was eight,

709
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,600
I threw up on her shoes
at my uncle's wedding.

710
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
Your abdomen's
a little swollen.

711
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,400
Mm?

712
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Is it serious?

713
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,300
It's hard to say.

714
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,800
Sometimes it can mean
a liver issue.

715
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,400
- We'll have to test.
- Oh...

716
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,100
Oh, dizziness
is getting-

717
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,700
she's going into shock.

718
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,200
I need another liter of saline.
Type and cross two unit's.

719
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,500
What's happening
to her?

720
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,900
She's bleeding internally.

721
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,100
<i>She's saying the shema. </i>

722
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,000
She thinks she's dying.

723
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,600
The mri shows
you're bleeding internally,

724
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,500
but not where
it's coming from.

725
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,100
The blood can only
keep you stable for so long.

726
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,700
Our best option
is to open you up and search.

727
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,100
But you can fix it?

728
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,900
If we find the leak.

729
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
You find the bleeding,
you find the disease?

730
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,700
No.

731
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,800
But it could keep you alive
long enough

732
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,500
so dr. House can find
what's wrong with you.

733
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,300
No.

734
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,500
I don't want to have
the surgery...

735
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,300
It's the only chance
you've got.

736
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,900
I don't want to have
the surgery

737
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
until after sunset.

738
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm probably
gonna die anyway.

739
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,100
I just wanna share
one shabbat with my husband.

740
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,500
Roz, please.

741
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,000
The torah commands us
to preserve life.

742
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,100
I waited 38 years
to find what I wanted.

743
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,000
I can wait
another eight hours.

744
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,400
I'll leave the rest
to god, okay?

745
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,300
I had a rabbi call.

746
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,700
She's adamant.

747
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,900
She's not a masochist.

748
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,300
She's suicidal.

749
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,100
Nice work, chase.

750
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,600
Yeah. I should have
had twin rabbis call.

751
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,500
Can I go?

752
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,700
We need you.

753
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,200
So instead of a few days
we now have a few hours

754
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,500
to figure this out.

755
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,900
- Nice work, chase.
- Why do you need me?

756
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,500
Saying, "nice work, chase"
when you're not here

757
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,800
<i>is pointless. </i>

758
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,400
Seriously, we need you.

759
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
We should x-ray
for malformations of the rib

760
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,300
that could cause
arterial twisting.

761
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,400
Malformations don't cause
bloody urine.

762
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,800
She's not suicidal.

763
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
<i>She made a commitment
to a new life with her husband</i>

764
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,300
and she wants one meaningful
experience in that life.

765
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,200
<i>- She just met the guy.
- Taub just met her. </i>

766
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
And he's already so in love,
he's ready to let her die

767
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,500
<i>and take her back
to the home planet</i>

768
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,900
for a burial
in the lava sea of tormiad.

769
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,200
It's who he might be.

770
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,400
She's connecting with all
the years she's not gonna have.

771
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,000
Better way of connecting
to those years

772
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,500
is to actually have them.

773
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,000
You want more time?

774
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,100
Joshua got god to make
the sun stand still.

775
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,500
No reason
god can't speed it up.

776
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,900
And, by god,
I of course mean you.

777
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,200
Told you
we needed you.

778
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,300
It's sundown, roz.

779
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
We're taking you back
to your room

780
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,000
for your candlelight
dinner.

781
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,400
Ready?
One, two three.

782
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,000
It's too early.

783
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,300
Your sense of time is off
because of the medication.

784
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,200
<i>Good shabbos, roz. </i>

785
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,000
So you pray,
scarf down some challah,

786
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
then we can do this?

787
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,100
<i>You wanted
to see me?</i>

788
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
And you came.

789
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,500
I feel pretty confident

790
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,100
it'll be
something interesting.

791
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,100
Solvis case
and the job is yours.

792
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,500
Is there a "drop Wilson" clause
attached to this?

793
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,800
Standard contract
all employees sign.

794
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,000
Why do you have to believe
I have an ulterior motive?

795
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,300
For the same reason
I believe

796
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,900
that crack whores
can have sex for crack.

797
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
All my life

798
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,900
I thought
I had to choose

799
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,200
between love
and respect.

800
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
And I chose respect.

801
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,300
And with Wilson...

802
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,300
I know what it's like
to have both.

803
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,200
And that beats
a fellowship.

804
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,000
Could be d. I. C.

805
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,200
You've changed.

806
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
I hope so.

807
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,200
Normal platelet count
rules out d. I. C.

808
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,600
Good try though.

809
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,800
I read that a hydatid cyst
could-

810
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,400
would affect the lungs,
not the bladder.

811
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
Tested her white cell
count again.

812
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,300
Normal.

813
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,900
How long till we
get to cut her open?

814
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,800
<i>When I left, he was still
singing eshet something. </i>

815
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,700
The husband's blessing
of his wife.

816
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,400
Woman of valor.

817
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,800
"Strength and honor
are her clothing.

818
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,500
She laughs at the future. "

819
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,500
Because she's an idiot.

820
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,600
Volvulus of the small intestine
could cause bleeding.

821
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,400
She would have had
constipation.

822
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,700
Her value
isn't "beyond pearls" either.

823
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,500
'Cause dead people
have no value.

824
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,000
Polycythemia vera.

825
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,700
Rbc count would be higher.

826
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I need to bring
the light to my face.

827
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Thrombocytopenia.
If it's autoimmune-

828
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,300
titers were normal.

829
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,100
Parkinson's would explain
the hypothermia.

830
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,500
<i>Not the bloody urine. </i>

831
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,200
The woman's not just
a masochist, she's a hypocrite.

832
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,600
The commandment
to preserve life

833
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,300
comes before all others.

834
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
<i>Actually means she's
not a masochist. </i>

835
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,100
<i>She's not following
all the rules,</i>

836
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,200
just the ones
that please her.

837
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,700
Right, she walked in crazy

838
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,400
and explained how ritual
trumps living,

839
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,500
and you decide
it's a beautiful lifestyle.

840
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,400
I know.
She's wrong.

841
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,200
But if there's
nothing more-

842
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,900
then the only meaning
is here.

843
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,300
But if she thinks
god is there for her,

844
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,100
if she lives her life
believing that god is there-

845
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,400
then she dies.

846
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,400
Things aren't where
we want them to be

847
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,100
just because
we want them to be there.

848
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,000
Of course, that doesn't mean
they're where they should be.

849
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,300
Hey!

850
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,100
<i>Stop that jew. </i>

851
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
<i>Chase hates working
on shabbos. </i>

852
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,100
Gonna make this easier for him.
Stand her up.

853
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,500
She doesn't do so well
on her feet.

854
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
<i>Neither do I.
Stand her up. </i>

855
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,400
<i>You can tell all the ladies
at the mikvah about this. </i>

856
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,300
What did you do?

857
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,000
What are you doing?

858
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,800
Put your hand here.

859
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,700
Press hard.

860
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
You have nephroptosis.

861
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,900
<i>Also known as
"floating kidney. "</i>

862
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,500
The kidney's
like a chandelier.

863
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,900
It's attached to a ceiling of
intestines and blood vessels.

864
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,100
But your contractor-
think you know who he is-

865
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,700
he hung it
with a cheap chain.

866
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,900
It's been hanging sloppy
for years.

867
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,300
Finally something
shook it loose.

868
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,700
<i>After that,
every time you stood,</i>

869
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,800
your kidney dropped
a few centimeters,

870
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,200
caused all your symptoms.

871
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,500
None of the scans
picked it up.

872
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,700
Because we do scans
with patients lying down.

873
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,600
<i>She'd have been lying down
in surgery too. </i>

874
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Never have found it.

875
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,500
Good chance
she'd never come out.

876
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,400
She'll be all right?

877
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,900
Ultrasound to confirm,

878
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,500
then tell chase to put
the kidney back on the shelf.

879
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,200
The bleed will be nearby.

880
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
That's... It?

881
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
Mazel tov.

882
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Couple hours surgery,

883
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,000
you'll be ready
to push out those 14 children.

884
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,300
You do it both ways,
right?

885
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,300
What?

886
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,700
The ultrasound-you do it
standing up and lying down.

887
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,000
What else would I mean?

888
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,500
I've decided
you could do worse

889
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
than a female proxy
for me.

890
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,500
So you're going to acknowledge
that people can change?

891
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,300
No.

892
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,000
You think I have changed
or Amber's changed?

893
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,800
Nope.

894
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,800
Then you've changed.

895
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,500
If you do change,
can it be the part of you

896
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,900
that chases me down halls,
trying to change me?

897
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,100
Do you know
what this means?

898
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,500
That you made
one go dating choice.

899
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,600
The fabric of the space/time
continuum could unravel.

900
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,800
My world could expand.

901
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,900
I could form
a long-term connection

902
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,100
that isn't with you.

903
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,000
And since you put

904
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,500
the darkest possible
construction on everything,

905
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,800
you could end up
losing a friend.

906
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,100
You've thought
of all this.

907
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,700
<i>And yet... </i>

908
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,000
You're going along with it.

909
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,700
Are you being...
Self-sacrificing?

910
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,200
I'll sacrifice a lab rat,

911
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,600
I'll sacrifice a fly,

912
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,800
and I'll sacrifice $200
on a mudder at monmouth park.

913
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,400
I don't sacrifice self.

914
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,900
<i>Shabbat shalom, Wilson. </i>

915
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,300
<i>Shabbat shalom, House. </i>
