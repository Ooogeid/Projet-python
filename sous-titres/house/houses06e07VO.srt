1
00:00:06,094 --> 00:00:08,365
This bagel's as hard
as a hockey puck.

2
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,157
- Then don't eat it.
- Used to be a full breakfast service.

3
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:14,205
- They're trying to starve us.
- You're worried about the food?

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,659
No, I'm worried about
what the food represents.

5
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,694
I got seven scenes to shoot today
on half of what we used to spend.

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,972
We're going through a recession.
It is what it is.

7
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:23,779
But nobody's gonna bail us out.

8
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:26,600
Free content everywhere,
DVD sales in the toilet.

9
00:00:27,123 --> 00:00:30,279
Now the back office bean counters
are vetoing half my ideas.

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,297
So we begin to make it
about the performances.

11
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:36,414
- You okay?
- A bit of a headache.

12
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,288
- If you need an ibuprofen...
- I need you to put your game face on.

13
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:41,519
Screw the bagels,
the sets, the wardrobe.

14
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:43,604
Do you have any idea
how lucky we are?

15
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:45,305
We get to do something we like,

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,680
we get to touch people's lives
and we get paid for it?

17
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,299
Let's make a movie.

18
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:51,798
Hey, baby.

19
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,074
Roll camera.

20
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:01,857
And...

21
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:04,608
action.

22
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:12,709
What's wrong?

23
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:14,891
My eyes...

24
00:01:15,097 --> 00:01:17,247
They feel like they're exploding.

25
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,329
All right, turn off the damn lights.

26
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,151
Get an ambulance.

27
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:23,124
Now!

28
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,536

Arrow

33
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,261
We're gonna be late for work.

34
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,290
Then we'll be late.

35
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,213
You took a patient's life,
you lied about it for weeks,

36
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:14,800
you broke who knows
how many laws and oaths to cover it up,

37
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,401
but I can live with it.

38
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:21,056
We can get through it together.

39
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:27,705
You have no idea what
I've been living with,

40
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,232
and what it means
to hear you say that.

41
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:33,694
But we need to get away
from Princeton-Plainsboro.

42
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,492
You can barely walk by the rooms
where Dibala was treated.

43
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:43,051
Why should we live with that
hanging over our heads?

44
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,456
If there was ever a time

45
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:48,031
to turn the page...

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,885
Three-month-old with fever,
incessant drooling,

47
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,426
and chronic muscle weakness.

48
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,447
Or...

49
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:02,201
porn actor Hank Hardwick,
born Henry Lefkowitz,

50
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,198
totally clean workup,

51
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,636
collapsed on the job
with extreme photophobia.

52
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,887
Or...
an infant as limp as a rag doll.

53
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:11,050
Let's wait
till Chase and Cameron get here.

54
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:13,150
They'll have the good sense
to side with me.

55
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,361
Doesn't matter, I'm still in charge.

56
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,876
We're taking the limp
three-month-old.

57
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:20,616
Oh, good.
You paged the limpness specialist.

58
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,581
This envelope is oddly...

59
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,793
medical license-shaped.

60
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,858
Congratulations.

61
00:03:37,273 --> 00:03:38,830
House is back in charge.

62
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:40,789
We get to treat a porn star.

63
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,908
- Congratulations.
- Perfect timing for us.

64
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:47,184
We're leaving the team
and the hospital, effective immediately.

65
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:50,869
That's kind of sudden.

66
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:53,544
Unless you've been circulating
your resumes for a while.

67
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:56,630
We're starting to think about new jobs,
where we want to live.

68
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,737
Moving too.
Interesting.

69
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,030
Are you sure?

70
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:08,080
- We'll miss you.
- We'll miss all of you too.

71
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,776
We'll start clearing out our things.

72
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,777
Run an STD panel and a tox screen.

73
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:20,342
Send a C-reactive protein
to look for inflammation

74
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,351
and an ANA to screen for autoimmune.

75
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:24,205
The rest of you take a history

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,640
and do an l.P.
to rule out viral encephalitis.

77
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:28,865
Oh, it's just you.

78
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,396
Here's hoping
you're good at multitasking.

79
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:38,642
I get tested for STDs regularly,
so does everyone I work with.

80
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,988
Since I'm guessing
you don't take their word for it.

81
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,408
All right, I'm gonna need you
to lie on your side

82
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,573
and put your knees to your chest.

83
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,286
Any history of alcohol
or substance abuse?

84
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:53,261
My wife used to smoke a little pot,
but I never touched the stuff.

85
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:54,929
You're married.

86
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,136
Happily, for two years now.

87
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,880
She happy you do porn?

88
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:02,134
Very, since she does it too.

89
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,763
You ever get jealous
when your wife's working?

90
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:07,491
It's a job.

91
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:10,336
Once you start letting your work life
rule your home life,

92
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,585
especially if you're
in the same line of work,

93
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,201
- your relationship's gonna be short.
- You're gonna feel a little pressure.

94
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,484
- Any history of sexual abuse?
- I defy the cliche.

95
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:22,291
Have you ever suffered
depression or psychosis?

96
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,115
Let me save you some time.
There's not a blotch on my record.

97
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:26,575
Look...

98
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:30,609
I know most of the people in my field
are drug addicts with daddy issues,

99
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:33,232
but I'm a nice,
Jewish boy from the 'burbs.

100
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:35,678
I wasn't driven to this.
I chose it.

101
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,180
I believe in it.
I actually think it's...

102
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,240
My arms are killing me.

103
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,915
Looks like tetany.
Your muscles are contracting.

104
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,690
- Need some meperidine in here.
- Oh, God.

105
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,341
Jew with megalophallus,
photophobia, and muscle spasm.

106
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,019
You tell me
which is the most unusual.

107
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,732
Four candidates,
three slots on the team.

108
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,610
Need to know if you've still got
your diagnostic chops.

109
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,864
I leave this office
by 6:00 every day,

110
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,491
I have my weekends again,
I recognize my wife again.

111
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,660
Yeah, I agree. Does sound pretty dull.
No wonder you want to work for me.

112
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:11,370
Tox screen was clean,

113
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,622
we ruled out viral encephalitis.

114
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:21,048
The only obstacle to you coming back

115
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,256
is your wife.

116
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:25,134
Which has never been
that much of an obstacle to you.

117
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:31,682
Maybe you're right.

118
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:37,603
The only link between eye
and muscle is the brain.

119
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:39,224
Tumor, seizure...

120
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,087
Taub seems to think
the link has to be the brain,

121
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:48,365
but eye and muscle
are governed by different parts

122
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,325
of the patient's
second-favorite organ.

123
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:51,952
Which means it's...

124
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,705
Thailand was wonderful.
Thanks for asking.

125
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:58,729
Of course. Yes.
It has to be multifocal.

126
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:01,462
I have an interview with a community
health clinic in two hours.

127
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,477
Back-up plan's fine.
Taub's swinging for the fences.

128
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:06,925
- You don't divide your attention.
- Good point.

129
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,184
I won't divide my attention, then.

130
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:13,193
Taub thinks it's a brain issue,
13 thinks it's multifocal.

131
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:16,185
- And they don't want to work here.
- Don't take their word for it.

132
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,819
Taub's problem is his wife,
13's problem is you.

133
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:21,879
Chase and Cameron's problem
is the dead African dictator.

134
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,373
None of them
has a problem with the work.

135
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:28,321
Cerebral vasculitis would explain
both the eye and arm findings.

136
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:29,846
Steroids to treat,

137
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:33,243
brain angiogram to confirm,
EMG and nerve biopsy while you're at it.

138
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:35,148
I'll be at lunch.

139
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,119
I'd hire all four,

140
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:40,273
but a five-person team
seems unwieldy.

141
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:42,169
Who would you turn down?

142
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,701
I'll have whatever he's buying.

143
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:48,276
Two cheeseburgers
and two large fries.

144
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:51,827
There are a thousand people
who want to be on your staff,

145
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,764
but you're going after
the four who don't.

146
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,814
They don't because their lives

147
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:58,400
are irrelevantly
and annoyingly complicated,

148
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:01,548
which makes them confused,
which makes them make poor decisions.

149
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:02,954
And your life is simple?

150
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,936
You went all the way up
to the conference to cozy up to Cuddy.

151
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,613
Instead she's dating one of two people
in the world you think of as a friend.

152
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,582
There's no way
that's not devastating.

153
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,645
So I had an attraction of sorts.

154
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,270
Yeah, the sort in which
your imaginary tryst

155
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,498
landed you in a mental hospital.

156
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,271
And I got help.

157
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:23,246
And she got Lucas,
who bought me a ginger ale.

158
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,977
It's all fine.

159
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:27,354
Which won't be true of my department
unless I can figure out

160
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,243
which doctor I'm not hiring.

161
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:31,929
I suppose throwing
yourself into your work

162
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,175
isn't the worst thing you could do.

163
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:37,459
What is the worst thing I could do?

164
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:42,542
House thinks it's cerebral vasculitis.
If you could do the brain angio

165
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,651
- while I finish up...
- We're out the door.

166
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,942
He's got me running every test
and treatment by myself.

167
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,916
Which is why you should
be out the door too.

168
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,761
This is completely unreasonable,
even for House.

169
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,283
You owe me this.

170
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,930
Thank you.

171
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,968
You really believe
this is cerebral vasculitis?

172
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:06,093
Could be.

173
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:09,715
House wants to thread
a catheter through his brain,

174
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,971
which could cause a vasospasm,
give steroids,

175
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:14,748
which could spread infection
all over the place, because it could be.

176
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:16,185
Sounds like House.

177
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:19,222
It could also be
a severe vitamin D deficiency.

178
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:22,098
Is a restrictive diet
works long hours indoors,

179
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:25,173
became hypocalcemic,
got tetany and photophobia.

180
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,067
I shouldn't do the angio?

181
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,735
House ordered it, Foreman wants it,
of course we should do it.

182
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,855
- I'm saying we're right to leave.
- You sure?

183
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,336
Because right now
I'll basically do anything you ask me.

184
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:37,711
I'm not interested in guilting you.

185
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:39,401
We're moving on.

186
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,439
Right after I take the patient
to the phototherapy suite,

187
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:47,073
blast him in ultraviolet light,
and IV vitamins

188
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:49,415
for his severe vitamin D deficiency.

189
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,301
So do you actually work together?

190
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,303
We did at first,

191
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,721
but now we like to keep
our films produced separate.

192
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,265
So do you...

193
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,668
watch her work?

194
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,434
We're both busy with our own stuff.

195
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:07,309
Think what you want,
but we're proud of what we do.

196
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:09,733
Divorcing sex
from all emotional content?

197
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,319
Emotion is emotional.
Sex is mechanical.

198
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,780
There doesn't really
need to be any overlap.

199
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,806
Certainly not in your world.

200
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,112
We've helped a lot of couples

201
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:21,578
by taking sex out
of some deep, dark dungeon.

202
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:25,452
Do what you want
without some big, moral comeuppance.

203
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,793
You think you can escape
the consequences,

204
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,090
but you can't.

205
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:31,926
You don't get to make
your own rules or morals.

206
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:33,801
You're here to treat him,

207
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,983
not lecture us about our...

208
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,613
Are you all right?

209
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,931
- Are you okay?
- Just a nosebleed.

210
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:45,102
Inside his leg?

211
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,982
- Petechial hemorrhages.
- We were wrong.

212
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:51,358
So was Foreman.

213
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,571
Patient's blood won't clot.

214
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,782
- We're back to square one.
- And you're back.

215
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:02,577
- So much for playing hard to get.
- We're here to help Foreman.

216
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,831
- Is that...
- He's not without talent.

217
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:08,847
UV rays made the patient's
capillaries more fragile,

218
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,419
hastening the onset of DIC.

219
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,879
- Sounds like sepsis...
- But isn't. No sign of shock.

220
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,215
- No drop in blood pressure.
- Can we turn that off?

221
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,536
Right, 'cause Cameron
thinks pornography is evil.

222
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:20,219
I don't care what he does.
I don't care what you watch.

223
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,097
It's annoying that he pretends

224
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:25,234
it's some beautiful life
we should all be aspiring to.

225
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,144
Left shift points to bacteremia.

226
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,290
No fever.

227
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:30,939
Plus it wouldn't explain
his spasmodic muscle contractions.

228
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,734
The ball and chain smacked you down.

229
00:11:34,103 --> 00:11:36,110
But widespread petechial rash,

230
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,266
nervous system involvement.

231
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,699
It's some kind of blood infection.

232
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:42,655
Meningococcemia.

233
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,544
Start the patient
on heparin for the DIC.

234
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:48,707
Broad-spectrum antibiotics
for the meningococcemia.

235
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:56,590
Chase is relaxed, at ease,
in lockstep with you again.

236
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:59,801
I guess he finally told you
that he iced Idi Amin Jr.

237
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,859
Does that mean he can break
the other nine commandments too?

238
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:05,261
Taking the lord's name in vain,
sure,

239
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:07,976
but coveting thy neighbor's wife?
Is she hot?

240
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,761
I've forgiven him.

241
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:12,356
Not for murder. Not you.

242
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:14,612
Doesn't matter how evil Dibala was.

243
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,301
By every conscience-hugging,

244
00:12:16,426 --> 00:12:18,489
mother Teresa-loving
bone in your body,

245
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,822
you should be leaving him,
not leaving with him.

246
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,677
Your position
was our leaving is a ruse.

247
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:25,552
We're not talking about mine,
but yours, which doesn't add up.

248
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:28,369
Here's what doesn't add up.
If you were serious about staffing,

249
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:30,832
you would know exactly
which three fellows you wanted.

250
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:33,960
You plowed ahead with this case
even though you hadn't hired new fellows

251
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,617
because you knew Foreman
would ask Chase and me to help,

252
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:38,993
giving you more time
to blow up our marriage.

253
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:40,518
I don't want that.

254
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,493
But we'd be foolish
not to plan ahead.

255
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:47,621
A... my firing Chase was the only reason
you left two years ago,

256
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,682
B... when the full horror
of his homicide hits you,

257
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:52,371
your marriage will blow up.

258
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:53,496
And Z...

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,441
the only obstacle to you
working here will be gone.

260
00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:00,695
Or maybe I skipped
a couple of letters.

261
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,021
Meningococcemia's spread
person-to-person.

262
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,996
Think about it
next time you show up for work.

263
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:12,539
It's okay.

264
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:14,501
Your wife's not here.

265
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,761
I'm telling you...

266
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:19,297
You lecture me
when she's around, I get it.

267
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,301
But I can tell from all your questions
you're more like me than you admit.

268
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:25,463
I'm a guy.

269
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,681
I look around every once in a while,
but I love my wife.

270
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:30,934
I love that she's the only one
I'm intimate with.

271
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,314
And no part of you wants to just

272
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,022
toss this rule book
everyone's forced on you?

273
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,151
No part of you wants a life
of actual commitment?

274
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,555
Is my relationship perfect?
No.

275
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:46,099
Am I ever horny when my wife
has just had sex for nine hours?

276
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:47,224
Yes.

277
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,653
But we are committed to each other,
in every way that matters.

278
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:55,178
In other words, you're committed,
except when you're not.

279
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:57,919
Doesn't work so well
if you have a conscience.

280
00:13:58,197 --> 00:13:59,247
Conscience.

281
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,630
That thing that kicks in

282
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:04,593
when there's no logical reason
to behave the way people want you to?

283
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,563
- What?
- You have a fever.

284
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,735
Means the antibiotics
aren't working.

285
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,731
Mr. Takayama.

286
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,277
I'm really happy
with what the last guy did with my eyes.

287
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,571
But why would
broad-spectrum antibiotics

288
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,876
fail to work on meningococcemia?

289
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,857
Excuse me, I've got a real patient.

290
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:29,982
Mister...

291
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:33,374
Hitler. Really?

292
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,291
Had to do something to amuse myself
while your receptionist

293
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,382
- fought with her boyfriend.
- Next?

294
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:41,796
A guy who needs two decades' worth
of corn chips hoovered out of his neck,

295
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:43,840
or a guy who can't stand daylight,

296
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,607
and whose blood won't clot.

297
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:48,386
- You do the triage.
- Who's the jerk?

298
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,805
Someone with zero chance
of hiring me back.

299
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,392
I told you,
I'm content at home and at work.

300
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:56,305
But not with content.

301
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:58,688
That's why you got sucked
into those stock scams,

302
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,690
why you cheated
on the wife you love.

303
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:02,322
At bridge.

304
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:05,981
My wife and I play a lot of bridge.

305
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,907
- Why you worked on a case last time.
- I gave you a theory.

306
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,448
Like I'd help a guy
who needs a Heimlich in a restaurant.

307
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,407
And then I shut the door behind you.

308
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:15,539
You'd knock over 3 doctors
to give it to him.

309
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:18,041
Metaphorically speaking,
you're a Heimlich addict.

310
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,004
You're an addiction addict.
Your drug of choice is your old team.

311
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,330
Like any addict you're trying to solve
another problem and it won't work.

312
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:25,795
Excuse me, I have a...

313
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,078
A tight schedule of nose jobs
and tummy tucks.

314
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:31,198
Yes, I do nose jobs, like the guy
who came here after a car crash,

315
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:33,947
couldn't even breathe through his...

316
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,564
Antibiotics wouldn't work
if his sinuses

317
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,347
were infected and clogged,
if there was a pocket of bacteria

318
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:46,563
his blood vessels couldn't reach.

319
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:49,114
Surgically drain his sinuses,
the drugs will work.

320
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,514
Nice.

321
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,286
Tell me it didn't feel good.

322
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:56,913
See you tomorrow.

323
00:15:58,644 --> 00:15:59,944
Not coming back!

324
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,468
Looks like quite a trip.

325
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,119
It was.

326
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:18,733
House send you to talk to me?

327
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:22,230
Then there's nothing to talk about.
I don't wanna work for him.

328
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,183
You're a great doctor.

329
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,779
House is right
to want you in the mix.

330
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,741
You saying this 'cause you have feelings
for me and want me back?

331
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,659
I'm saying it shouldn't be an issue.

332
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,120
Do you have feelings for me?

333
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:41,666
I don't want our work life to have
anything to do with our personal life.

334
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,418
You couldn't keep 'em separate.

335
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:46,785
And that's why
our personal life doesn't exist.

336
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,977
- None of that has to...
- I can't work with you.

337
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:54,375
Actually, you can.

338
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:58,031
I was the one who had the problem.

339
00:16:58,672 --> 00:16:59,972
I don't anymore.

340
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:10,061
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

341
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,864
<i>I was wr...</i>

342
00:17:15,257 --> 00:17:16,357
Wrong about?

343
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:20,897
<i>You spent weeks elaborately concealing
the fact that you...</i>

344
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:24,000
<i>crashed daddy's car.</i>

345
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:25,937
<i>And you just confessed.</i>

346
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:29,095
<i>Seemed idiotic.
Certain to end in disaster.</i>

347
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,175
<i>Instead you're riding off
into the sunset together.</i>

348
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,843
<i>Any theories on why?</i>

349
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,596
You've already dismissed
the "she loves me" theory?

350
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:38,621
<i>Well, it's possible.</i>

351
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:41,017
<i>It'd require the presupposition
all she's done</i>

352
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,145
for the last six years has been
inconsistent with her character.

353
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:47,315
- <i>It's possible.</i>
- We've established,

354
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,202
- it's also possible you're wrong.
- <i>Or there's another explanation.</i>

355
00:17:51,924 --> 00:17:54,739
Since you don't have one,
I'm gonna keep looking for you.

356
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,795
Let him drain, then pack it
with anesthetics and sterile gauze.

357
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:06,641
Any idea what's going on with House?

358
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:09,849
He's trying to get
his old fellows back?

359
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:11,524
It's called stalking.

360
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,441
I am too busy
to play officer of the court.

361
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,553
A shame, since you triggered this.

362
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:20,449
What do you see in Lucas anyway?

363
00:18:20,574 --> 00:18:22,136
None of your business.

364
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:24,227
Did you think House
wouldn't find out?

365
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,813
Had you told me,
I wouldn't have coached him

366
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,261
- on how to prove his worthiness to you.
- You're upset

367
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:31,535
because I didn't choose
to date your best friend.

368
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:33,959
But I'm living my life.

369
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,740
For the first time
I'm not gonna change that

370
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,229
because of how
it might affect him or you.

371
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,253
I feel like crap.

372
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:55,086
Look, our relationship is gonna be
about House, or it's gonna be about us.

373
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:57,844
I vote for us.

374
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,805
House is gonna make it
about him for us.

375
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,623
This is very insulting.

376
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,810
You're apparently shocked by this,
which means you thought

377
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,720
there was some way we could date,
get married, have two kids, a dog,

378
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:12,692
retire to Florida,
all without House finding out.

379
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,571
Or you thought
that we wouldn't date all that long.

380
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:20,200
First means you're delusional.
The second means I am.

381
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:23,410
It could also mean you thought
House had matured,

382
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,413
but then we're back to your being...

383
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,731
Shut up.

384
00:19:27,854 --> 00:19:29,004
You're right.

385
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,418
I'm sorry.

386
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,629
I'm also flattered.

387
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:35,340
You acted all cool and everything
with Wilson,

388
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,156
but you feel comfortable enough with me
to freak out.

389
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:39,701
That's cool.

390
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:47,894
His sinuses are clear.

391
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,651
Antibiotics should work this time.

392
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:53,822
Why did you forgive me?

393
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,828
I mean, I'm glad, I'm grateful,

394
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,180
but I'm confused, you've been harder
on the patient than you've been on me.

395
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,517
The difference
between you and the patient...

396
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:06,925
is that you feel shame, guilt.

397
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,874
That's how I know
we'll get through this.

398
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:14,634
My stomach.

399
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,591
It really hurts.

400
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,700
His liver's failing.

401
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:25,523


402
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:28,653
His liver's failing and his abdomen
keeps filling with fluid, so...

403
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:30,239
It's not meningococcemia.

404
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:33,082
No matter how much
you finish each other's sentences,

405
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:36,107
don't count on being
a diagnostic package deal.

406
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:37,986
Patient's liver's not working.

407
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,113
We don't have time
for your team-stakes.

408
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,354
Sometimes, you're just wrong.

409
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:47,012
Something genetic,
something in his history we overlooked?

410
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:48,537
Both are spotless.

411
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:51,124
Every time he had a bad cough as a kid
he went to a doctor.

412
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,209
Klatskin tumor
obstructing his bile ducts?

413
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,260
No jaundice.
Wouldn't have ocular effects.

414
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:57,448
If it's inflammation
inside the bile channels

415
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:58,762
sclerosing cholangitis.

416
00:20:58,887 --> 00:21:01,676
He stopped producing clotting proteins,
damaged his blood cells,

417
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,715
- causing small strokes.
- Enough!

418
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:06,389
Stop pummeling 13 and Taub.

419
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
It fits.

420
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,552
Prep the patient for an ERCP.

421
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:14,872
See if there's hope
of opening his bile channels.

422
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:17,031
Tell him to look for a liver donor.

423
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:19,869
Dr. Chase.

424
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:22,767
Your turn.

425
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,450
What'd she say?

426
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:29,769
She forgave me
because I feel guilty.

427
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:32,248
- That works too.
- And now,

428
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,709
you expect me to ask you
what the "too" refers to.

429
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:36,788
Only if you're interested.

430
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:39,380
Only if you have doubts
about her answer.

431
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,501
She thinks you don't have anything
to feel guilty about,

432
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:47,126
because you didn't kill anybody.
I did.

433
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,017
She blames me for Dibala's murder,
not you.

434
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:53,895
You were barely involved in that case.
She knows that.

435
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,315
But I created the big, bad, evil climate
that allowed it to happen.

436
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,093
- You're wrong.
- Powerful counter-argument.

437
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:04,280
Why are you doing this?
Why are you trying to screw things up?

438
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,880
You got the tense wrong.

439
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:08,952
Things are already screwed up.

440
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:12,234
Which is why you don't just want
to work for me, you need to.

441
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:14,415
Cameron thinks
you're my sock puppet.

442
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:17,666
If you don't stay,
it's gonna be hard to prove you're not.

443
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:19,952
I have to go.

444
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:34,867
Last week,
my cane could only do ten minutes.

445
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:40,321
What are you doing here?

446
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,611
Waiting for you to take a nap
so I can surge into the lead.

447
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:51,995
What's the best way to restore the liver
in someone with sclerosing cholangitis?

448
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:55,331
- Not getting drawn into this.
- You already are.

449
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,001
- Because you crashed my workout?
- You're core training.

450
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,252
Improves balance,

451
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,160
Staves off the most debilitating
symptoms of Huntington's.

452
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,826
You've ended
your self-destructive streak.

453
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,101
Want to do something significant,

454
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:11,426
that'll last longer
than the few years you have left.

455
00:23:12,596 --> 00:23:14,633
My team is your first-best choice.

456
00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:16,959
My first choice
is the community health clinic

457
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:18,479
I interviewed with yesterday.

458
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:20,940
You should do that.

459
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,122
Three hours a week.
Every doctor should.

460
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:24,652
'Cause every doctor can.

461
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:26,696
You don't want to be every doctor.

462
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:30,094
Plus, on my team,
you get to screw with Foreman.

463
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:32,535
Every way but literally.

464
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,703
Why are you doing it this way?

465
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:37,243
You're pretending to assume
we're all coming back

466
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:38,791
without actually asking us.

467
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,959
Why?

468
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:42,253
This is why you'd be miserable
in a clinic

469
00:23:45,131 --> 00:23:48,176
You can't ask
because you can't face the rejection.

470
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:51,387
- Why not? What's going on?
- Are you asking me to ask you?

471
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,905
I'm saying you shouldn't,
for your sake as well as mine.

472
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:59,767
We don't know how much
the sclerosing cholangitis

473
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:01,437
has damaged your liver.

474
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:04,212
It might be in a year,
it might be in ten.

475
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,319
But you're gonna need a new one.

476
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:10,281
And you should know,

477
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,576
while no transplant committee
will say this openly,

478
00:24:13,991 --> 00:24:17,252
they'll never grant an organ
to someone working in your profession.

479
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,952
I have to change jobs?

480
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:25,171
You're medically
advising me to change jobs.

481
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:28,576
- Hank, if you're too sick...
- She wants me to have a conversion.

482
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,676
She's practically
salivating over it.

483
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,013
- I'm just being candid about...
- So you don't think I'm scum.

484
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,111
Just some committee does.

485
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:37,746
That your lifestyle has risks.

486
00:24:37,871 --> 00:24:41,229
You work around more sick people
and germs and blood than I do.

487
00:24:41,786 --> 00:24:43,481
I'm not gonna live my life afraid

488
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,066
like my parents did.

489
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:46,984
Barely letting me play outside

490
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,452
and God forbid that I get a scratch.

491
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:51,823
I'll talk to him.

492
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,144
He'll calm down and realize
this is the only...

493
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,787
Why does everyone want to dictate
the way I live my life?

494
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,468
Because the way we're living
is gonna kill you.

495
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,671
Passing the pancreatic duct...

496
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:12,051
- Don't listen to House.
- You have no idea what he said.

497
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,719
I know he's manipulative.

498
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,863
I know you're in a vulnerable state,

499
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:18,335
and that Cameron
wants your marriage to work.

500
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
So do you.

501
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,767
So don't listen to House.

502
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:23,992
House doesn't make my decisions.

503
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:26,987
I'm in the common bile duct.

504
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:29,593
What's that mass?
Gallstone?

505
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,196
Can we magnify times five?

506
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:37,534
That's not a gallstone.

507
00:25:38,827 --> 00:25:41,427
His liver's completely filled
with worms.

508
00:25:41,552 --> 00:25:42,640


509
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:45,710
You have strongyloides,
also known as threadworms.

510
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,212
They disseminated in your body,
causing your symptoms.

511
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,698
How'd I get a parasite?

512
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:52,884
Most likely through sexual activity,
but we can't be sure.

513
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,553
What's the treatment?

514
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:57,887
Two mebendazole pills.

515
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,433
That's it?

516
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:03,144
You'll be fine. Your liver too.

517
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:05,155
Go back to your lives.

518
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,923
You know this is
the doctor's lounge.

519
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,010
I know.

520
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:17,658
It seemed like the place
to read doctors' notes.

521
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:20,703
You are good at it, by the way.

522
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,234
Why are you reading my charts?

523
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:27,528
Because I'm worried
about my girlfriend.

524
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:31,500
Your girlfriend...
is a male porn star?

525
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,299
No, I'm dating Lisa Cuddy.

526
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,103
- Seriously?
- Cool?

527
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,785
If House doesn't have his team,
that'll make her miserable,

528
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,457
which will make me miserable,

529
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:43,309
which brings us to the fact that
you have elevated noting to an art form.

530
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,646
- I see the connection.
- Most doctors write "9:00 a.m."

531
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,634
if they scrub in at 9:00
or anything near it.

532
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:52,568
You write 9:03, and you make little
notations when procedures are delayed.

533
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:54,969
You're easily impressed.

534
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:56,763
Well, yeah.

535
00:26:57,013 --> 00:27:00,326
I was, till I saw that you had
virtually stopped writing them

536
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,410
- about four weeks ago.
- Been busy. Got a backlog.

537
00:27:04,517 --> 00:27:08,464
People with your level of precision
don't really just "get" backlogs.

538
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:12,755
No one knows why
you're leaving PPTH.

539
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,424
Because it's personal.

540
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:18,296
If something happened,
I mean, if you're leaving

541
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:22,213
to get away from something that you did,
or she did, or both of you did.

542
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:25,101
I mean, emotionally maybe you want
to run away, but in my experience,

543
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,235
if you're staring at a pit bull
in some guy's back yard,

544
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:32,510
You're better off
staying right where you are.

545
00:27:32,893 --> 00:27:34,537
Face the problem.

546
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,684
That way
it can't bite you in the ass.

547
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,610
Thanks for the folksy wisdom.

548
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,492
You got any,
dirt on any of the other three?

549
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:49,041
It'd really help me out.

550
00:27:55,451 --> 00:27:57,425
You said those
two pills was all he needed!

551
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,359
- Lungs are filling with fluid.
- Suction him and get him on oxygen.

552
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:08,019
Patient's lungs are
severely compromised.

553
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,474
Liver's still failing.

554
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,415
Worms could easily
have been a coincidence.

555
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,509
Almost be surprising
if he didn't have 'em.

556
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:17,129
Which means it could be a hematological
problem plus cardiomyopathy

557
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,530
Neck veins are flat,
precordial exam was normal.

558
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:22,033
What if it's lymphoma?

559
00:28:22,323 --> 00:28:25,202
Peritoneal carcinomatosis
explains the liver failure.

560
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,831
Paraneoplastic syndrome
explains everything else.

561
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,459
Lymphoma it is.

562
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,786
Prep him for chemo.

563
00:28:34,484 --> 00:28:37,089
Fax Taub and 13
the latest update on the case.

564
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:41,886
Seriously?

565
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:45,054
They've as much right
to know as anyone.

566
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,141
You either like
the diagnosis or you don't.

567
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:50,980
If you don't, we need to keep talking.
If you do, you need to shut up.

568
00:28:51,214 --> 00:28:53,314
What we don't need
is this stupid game.

569
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,967
You're mad at House,
but you're not mad at me.

570
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,271
Do you want me to be mad at you?

571
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:08,364
You blame House.
Not me.

572
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:10,432
I am mad at House
because he's an ass.

573
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:13,645
And I am mad at you,
but I don't want to leave you.

574
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,920
What I did may be
the worst thing I ever did.

575
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,449
It may be the best.

576
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:20,484
I'm either a murderer or a guy
who stopped a mass murderer,

577
00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:22,528
but I did it. Me.

578
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,930
And even if it destroys me,
I'd do it again today.

579
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:30,128
- You don't mean that. This isn't you.
- I'm not running away from what I did

580
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:32,463
because you want to
pretend I never did it.

581
00:29:35,172 --> 00:29:37,107
If that's how you feel...

582
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:46,746
My strategy's not
completely working.

583
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:50,451
All four of them want
to work for me,

584
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:53,916
but all four of them have reasons
why they don't want to work for me.

585
00:29:54,738 --> 00:29:56,723
How do I get them
to take one from column A

586
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:58,498
and none from column B?

587
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:04,814
Right.

588
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:08,347
Right, by not saying anything,
you're saying that answer is inside me.

589
00:30:08,626 --> 00:30:10,683
The answer has nothing
to do with the question.

590
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:12,739
Then it's not
technically the answer.

591
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:14,854
Why do you need
three of these doctors?

592
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,922
Because I know they're good.

593
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,032
Other doctors fall into
the "might be good" category.

594
00:30:20,157 --> 00:30:21,970
It has nothing to do
with them being good.

595
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:24,613
You think they're idiots half the time,
but they're comfortable.

596
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,883
You feel abandoned,

597
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:28,529
so you're reaching out
to people you know for comfort.

598
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,950
Oh, my god, you're right.

599
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,096
I don't need doctors at all.

600
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,666
I just need a good friend.

601
00:30:37,113 --> 00:30:41,033
Cuddy's right. Maybe, just maybe,
if I don't play along, you'll realize

602
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:43,924
you can't solve a deeper problem
with a surface solution.

603
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,511
Would've been more profound
if you hadn't said anything.

604
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:52,224
You okay?

605
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:53,809
Getting through it.

606
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:56,228
Be a lot easier once
you two are away from here.

607
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:03,001
He's peeing blood.

608
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:05,696
- BP's rising.
- Heart rate's up to 250.

609
00:31:05,992 --> 00:31:07,573
He's going into cardiac arrest.

610
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:11,965
Charging.
Clear.

611
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,996
- He's bleeding out.
- His body's completely giving out.

612
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:16,887
- Charging.
- Clear.

613
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,904
We've got him stabilized,
but no red cells,

614
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,506
no white cells
practically no platelets either.

615
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,431
Mebendazole can cause adverse
effects, but nothing like this.

616
00:31:26,556 --> 00:31:28,919
He's been off 'em
since yesterday, anyway.

617
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:34,162
Long passes, wild guesses, anything.

618
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,709
Hypopituitarism could cause
multi-organ failure if...

619
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,064
If his thyroid hormone
wasn't completely normal.

620
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:42,858
- Renal cell carcinoma.
- Renal ultrasound was clean.

621
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:45,253
I'd say aleukemic leukemia.

622
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,822
- Marrow's not making normal cells...
- Ablate the patient's bone marrow.

623
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,283
Find him a donor match.

624
00:31:52,156 --> 00:31:55,428
You want to nuke the patient's marrow?
He had no evidence of being anemic

625
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:57,498
or immune-compromised
when he was admitted.

626
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,024
- Perfect white count as well.
- Ablation could kill him

627
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:02,969
or leave him defenseless
against an infection that could.

628
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:04,951
Then come up with something better.

629
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,096
He may as well die
while we're treating him.

630
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:17,017
OK with you if i bring the other
candidates into the loop now?

631
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,394
The risks are,
they're really minimal.

632
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:27,457
We'll do a series
of painless injections, and...

633
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:29,824
Excuse me.

634
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,994
All can be done as an outpatient.

635
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:53,488
You're leaving at 11:00 a.m.?

636
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:56,568
Trust me, case is almost over.

637
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:00,436
Foreman told me
you're ablating the patient's marrow,

638
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,342
on a non-theory
that Foreman himself withdrew.

639
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:05,461
You're gonna kill the patient.

640
00:33:07,604 --> 00:33:09,273
Is this about me and Lucas?

641
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:15,180
I want alternatives for the patient.

642
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:16,205
So do I.

643
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,266
I want to be on the team.

644
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:36,543
That's gonna save your marriage?

645
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:41,979
I don't know.

646
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,652
Four candidates, three spots.

647
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:52,237
I got a tough decision ahead of me.

648
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:17,443
<i>Hi, Remy, this is Dr. Turner</i>

649
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:19,504
<i>from the Pennsauken free clinic.</i>

650
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,821
<i>We all loved meeting you,
and, well, the job's yours.</i>

651
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:25,845
<i>Call me back.
Let's pick a start date.</i>

652
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,416
I want it to look natural.
I mean, much younger, but natural.

653
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:47,626
Can you get
rid of the crow's feet altogether?

654
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,934
Or is it better
to leave a trace of them?

655
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:52,172
I don't look old enough
to have them anyway?

656
00:34:52,836 --> 00:34:54,883
- Absolutely.
- I do look old enough?

657
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:58,142
What?
I'm sorry.

658
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:00,674
Hang on a second.

659
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,900
- Why are you here?
- 'Cause I think we're wrong.

660
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,058
Which means something's
gonna go wrong.

661
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:17,740
Or right.

662
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:20,784
- Takayama here.
- It's me and 13. Stop the ablation.

663
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,024
- Because?
- Those thread worms.

664
00:35:27,149 --> 00:35:29,752
Why would his body have gone to hell
hours after they were gone?

665
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,245
The worms weren't hurting him.
They were helping him.

666
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,298
He has extra-intestinal Crohn's.

667
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:36,779
<i>He got it from being
raised in a too clean,</i>

668
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:38,651
<i>too overprotective
of an environment.</i>

669
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:41,489
<i>It's the hygiene hypothesis.
Why there's so much autoimmune disease</i>

670
00:35:41,614 --> 00:35:44,396
in the developed world, and almost none
in the developing world.

671
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:47,969
<i>They were keeping the Crohn's in check,
teaching his immune system</i>

672
00:35:48,094 --> 00:35:50,372
what it should've learned
from eating dirt growing up.

673
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:52,524
Once you killed them,
it started killing him.

674
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:56,653
So his life of filth
wasn't the problem,

675
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,614
clean living was.

676
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:01,158
Let's start him
on methylprednisolone.

677
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,659
And some helminths.

678
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:05,871
Worms.

679
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:07,331
Cool?

680
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,570
Best out of three?

681
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:30,658
I want to be on the team.

682
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,689
Good news for your wife.

683
00:36:33,379 --> 00:36:34,650
Thanks for the sarcasm.

684
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:38,276
I reorganized my life
to spend more time with her,

685
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,681
but apparently I don't love her
as much as I thought.

686
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:43,358
Or you love her more.

687
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:47,910
This job gives you the thrill
you used to find through philandering.

688
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,225
Better to cheat
with a beaker and an MRI

689
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,427
than one of your platinum-blonde
plastic surgery patients.

690
00:36:58,055 --> 00:36:59,341
I'll let you know.

691
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:21,017
I told House I want
to work for him again.

692
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:24,428
Stay on the team.

693
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:29,213
You were always more into it than I,
more interested in diagnostics.

694
00:37:30,843 --> 00:37:33,182
Unless House was right
about why you want out.

695
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,881
Four for four.

696
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,540
I was in love with you.

697
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,315
I was an idiot.

698
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:01,194
Tried to be like you,
tried to understand you, because...

699
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:04,608
I thought I could heal you.

700
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,536
You almost killed that patient.

701
00:38:09,817 --> 00:38:11,594
If almost not saving
his life means...

702
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,734
You knew the diagnosis
a long time ago.

703
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,501
You risked another patient's life
to bait your old team.

704
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:17,753
Another one?

705
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:20,005
You did kill Dibala.

706
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:23,260
By playing god
and teaching us to do the same.

707
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:26,664
- I taught you to think for yourselves.
- You don't think of them as people.

708
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:29,251
They're just lab rats
for your little puzzles.

709
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,969
As you celebrate their humanity,
I save their lives.

710
00:38:33,094 --> 00:38:34,494
Motives do matter.

711
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,954
- Lives can't come second.
- The patient is alive.

712
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,205
- That's what matters.
- Not to you.

713
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,753
All you care about
is that Taub and 13 fell for your game.

714
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:46,984
You'll poison them
like you poisoned Chase.

715
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:52,245
Your husband killed a patient
and you're breaking up with me.

716
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:55,343
You ruined him.

717
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:01,381
So he can't even
see right from wrong.

718
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,806
Can't even see the sanctity
of a human life anymore.

719
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:12,265
I loved you.

720
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,837
And I loved Chase.

721
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,675
I'm sorry for you both.

722
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,275
For what you've become.
Because...

723
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:27,143
there's no way back
for either of you.

724
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:36,438
Any idea where I can get a great, big
"mission accomplished" banner?

725
00:40:39,032 --> 00:40:40,520
Got my sanity back,

726
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:42,077
my license back,

727
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:43,690
and now...

728
00:40:45,224 --> 00:40:47,319
You're kidding.
All of them?

729
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,961
Three out of four.

730
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:51,156
Which is almost as good
as four out of five.

731
00:40:51,938 --> 00:40:53,670
- Who was the...
- Cameron.

732
00:40:55,715 --> 00:40:58,294
I can't believe it.
I mean, really.

733
00:40:58,811 --> 00:40:59,831
I can't...

734
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,940
believe it.

735
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,379
You were right, House.
Good for you.

736
00:41:07,793 --> 00:41:08,893
Yeah, it is.

737
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,018
She's broken up with Chase,
and she's leaving the hospital.

738
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:16,101
Still,

739
00:41:16,828 --> 00:41:18,672
three out of four ain't bad.
