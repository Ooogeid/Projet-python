1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,701
I want to reassure you,

2
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:05,888
your child can have
a completely normal life.

3
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:10,794
How can a baby have
male and female DNA?

4
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:14,488
It's a condition called
genetic mosaicism.

5
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:18,697
The ambiguous genitalia
can be surgically repaired.

6
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:20,576
Repaired?

7
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:23,773
Made to look more... typical.

8
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:26,624
More typical?

9
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:30,843
But you haven't even told us
if the baby's a boy or a girl.

10
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:33,435
That's...

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,760
that's a choice you have to make.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,293
Nice job, Jackson!

13
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:50,341
Take it.

14
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:01,915
He had the shot.
He lost his nerve.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,771
Honey, it's okay.
He's doing great.

16
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:09,610
Three.

17
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,756
No fear that time.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,810
Melanie.

19
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,712
Oh, my God.

20
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:47,064
Jackson!

21
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:56,657
House - Season 05 Episode 16

24
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,833
{\pos(192,220)}Black heels or the boots?

25
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,220
{\pos(192,220)}You know I'm a fan of those heels.

26
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:38,908
Boots it is.

27
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,956
{\pos(192,220)}For all we know, House knows
you're a fan of those heels.

28
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,815
{\pos(192,220)}You think House is gonna figure out

29
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,402
{\pos(192,220)}we faked our break-up
because of your shoes?

30
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:53,756
Go with the boots.

31
00:02:57,774 --> 00:02:59,804
- Gonna eat that?
- Have at it.

32
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,558
{\pos(192,210)}Did you just ask my permission
before you took my food?

33
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,151
{\pos(192,220)}Yes, we can.

34
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,807
Adolescent genetic mosaicism.
Collapsed during a basketball game.

35
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:12,071
{\pos(192,220)}Presenting with persistent
pelvic pain.

36
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:13,669
{\pos(192,220)}Fun.

37
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:16,395
{\pos(192,220)}The parents haven't told their son
that he could've been their daughter.

38
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,648
{\pos(192,220)}They want assurance
that you won't either.

39
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,495
{\pos(192,220)}Less fun, but still.

40
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,891
{\pos(192,220)}That was easy.

41
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:33,128
Our new patient.

42
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:34,880
Part girl,

43
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,140
part boy.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,884
All 13's dream date.

45
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,813
{\pos(192,220)}Severe pelvic pain
started during a basketball game.

46
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:45,683
{\pos(192,220)}- Could be dehydration.
- ER gave him fluids when he came in.

47
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,021
Still it feels chronic.

48
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:48,940
{\pos(192,220)}We've got a kid
who could mate with himself,

49
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:52,273
{\pos(192,220)}we think he didn't have enough to drink?
There are dozens of intersex disorders.

50
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:56,176
{\pos(192,220)}Persistent pelvic pain could mean
congenital adrenal hyperplasia,

51
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:57,193
PMDS...

52
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:00,985
{\pos(192,220)}Those conditions occur in intersex kids
who are chromosomally XX or XY.

53
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,483
{\pos(192,220)}Not XX and XY.

54
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,576
Parents recently started him
on testosterone.

55
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:07,913
{\pos(192,220)}- Maybe there's some...
- Vitamins wouldn't cause pelvic pain.

56
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,929
{\pos(192,220)}There's a note in here.
We're supposed to refer

57
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:13,985
to his testosterone shots
as vitamins.

58
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,089
His parents aren't just liars.
They want us to be liars too.

59
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,457
I won't do it.

60
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,426
You guys will, though.

61
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,095
He's a kid. Parents don't think
he's ready to deal with it.

62
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,533
{\pos(192,220)}My dad was the same way about me
maybe having Huntington's.

63
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:28,630
{\pos(192,220)}Well, that was your experience.

64
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:30,869
{\pos(192,220)}It should surely apply
in this situation.

65
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:35,155
Pain could be caused
by a blind uterus hidden in his abdomen.

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,095
- He needs an MRI.
- Right.

67
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,652
Boy with girl genes.

68
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,088
I'm sure you're the first doctor
brilliant enough

69
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,598
{\pos(192,210)}to check for a uterus.

70
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:45,205
{\pos(192,210)}He could have complications
from the surgeries on his penis.

71
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,897
{\pos(192,220)}- That can cause pelvic pain.
- Way to multi-task.

72
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,547
{\pos(192,220)}Impress your boss
and humiliate your Ex.

73
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,816
{\pos(192,220)}MRI is a waste of time.

74
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:56,337
{\pos(192,220)}To continue the humiliation,
you'll put a camera up his penis.

75
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,925
You're Dr. House, aren't you?

76
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:03,974
{\pos(192,220)}What do you think's wrong
with our son?

77
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:07,306
{\pos(192,220)}These people were just coming
to tell you.

78
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:09,141
This is better.

79
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,810
{\pos(192,220)}Don't have to worry
about them losing their way.

80
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,521
We think that he has a blind uterus.

81
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,898
He should have an MRI.

82
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,037
Did you send 'em a text?

83
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:19,735
Over the past 13 years,

84
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,528
we've educated ourselves.

85
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,649
Who needs med school
when you got Wi-Fi?

86
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,698
Let's schedule their son
for an MRI with contrast right away.

87
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,205
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

88
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:35,625
{\pos(192,220)}You said an MRI was a waste of time.

89
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,086
So is arguing with them.

90
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,341
Contrast's in.

91
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:45,219
Jackson, we're gonna get started,
so try to lie still.

92
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:50,143
How long do you think

93
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,810
the post-break-up awkwardness
is gonna last?

94
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,110
Foreman and I are both
professionals.

95
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:57,982
Stomach and liver are clear.

96
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:02,353
If by professional you mean, he's a
T-1000 build by cyberdyne systems.

97
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,930
I never understood what
you saw in him.

98
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,186
He's not really your type?

99
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:09,076
Moving down through
the pelvic floor.

100
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,951
Here's my impression of Foreman
on the happiest day of his life.

101
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:17,892
Now the saddest day of his life.

102
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:21,213
We just broke up.

103
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,939
I'm not quite ready to mock him yet.

104
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,977
House was a jerk
to split you two up.

105
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:30,122
But, bottom line,
he did you a favor.

106
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,225
Area around the intestinal tract
is clear.

107
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:34,824
No blind uterus.

108
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:45,112
I think there's something wrong
with House.

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,506
Who's he making miserable now?

110
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,927
Actually no one.

111
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:51,223
He okay'd an MRI
just because the parents

112
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:53,412
wanted to look for a blind uterus.

113
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,334
There was no fighting, no arguing.
He just went along.

114
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,464
- It's a valid medical theory.
- He doesn't think it is.

115
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:03,505
House decided to humor
these parents.

116
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:07,042
Maybe he had a great cup of coffee.

117
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,181
Or a tremendous bowel movement.

118
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:11,722
Bottom line is your boss
is in a good mood.

119
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,266
Stop analyzing it and just enjoy it.

120
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:24,693
We're gonna use this scope
to fill your bladder with saline.

121
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:27,488
Then examine your urethra
for any narrow spots.

122
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:29,698
Why would there be a narrow spot?

123
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,534
Sometimes it just happens.

124
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:36,746
- Can my parents come in?
- Sure.

125
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,918
I thought it'd be awkward
for you having them here.

126
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:44,258
I have this feeling
they've seen me naked before.

127
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:48,759
Now take a breath.
Just try to relax.

128
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:53,847
Mom.

129
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,069
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

130
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:03,565
Hey, remember those sprints
they made you run in practice?

131
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:06,110
Those were so hard.

132
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,804
But you pulled through.

133
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,239
You can do this too.

134
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:15,869
I'm to the bladder.
Start the saline.

135
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,585
I'm gonna look around
and pull back on the scope.

136
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,314
Feels tight.

137
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,558
That pressure's normal. Just try
to hold on for a few more minutes.

138
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,535
It's not down there.

139
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:34,696
It's my chest.

140
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,383
Can't breathe.

141
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,643
Can't bre...

142
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:41,252
Can't breathe.

143
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,984
Is he okay?

144
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:44,731
Muffled heart sounds.

145
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:46,157
Jugular's distended.

146
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:48,335
Pericardial effusion.
We need ten gauge on a syringe.

147
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,683
- What's happening?
- His heart is filling with exudate.

148
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:52,886
If we don't drain it,
it'll stop beating.

149
00:08:58,355 --> 00:09:00,583
We drained the fluid
from his pericardial space.

150
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,659
- His heart rate is back to normal.
- Pelvis plus heart.

151
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:06,753
Doesn't fit with any of the syndromes
associated with mosaicism.

152
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,922
Could be drugs, toxins,
an infection.

153
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:12,134
- You're okay with this?
- With what?

154
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,339
That we're considering
a diagnosis unrelated

155
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:16,225
to this kid being a shemale.

156
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,827
Assuming a coincidence like that
would usually torture you

157
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:21,852
- but you're completely unfazed.
- Completely unfazed?

158
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:24,667
You think I'm totally lacking
in any fazing?

159
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,461
The idea that I'm anything less
than half-fazed

160
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,067
I actually find offensive.

161
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,485
It greatly fazes me.

162
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,821
- He started testosterone...
- Vitamins.

163
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,741
A few months ago. That can cause
autoimmune diseases

164
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,576
like polyarteritis and SLE

165
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,015
which can cause pericardial effusion
and pelvic pain.

166
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,372
So it is related.

167
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,022
Now I'm unfazed.

168
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:48,949
Start him on corticosteroids
for the autoimmune.

169
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:51,215
Finasteride to block the vitamins.

170
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,002
You slept with House.

171
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:03,268
He asked permission
before taking my bagel.

172
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:05,307
Took the case without a fight.

173
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,978
Honored the parents' request
for an MRI.

174
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:10,317
Yes, those were my terms
for sleeping with him.

175
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:11,860
He's in a good mood.

176
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:14,279
Sex with me would explain that.

177
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:18,546
But it doesn't explain why I'm not
curled up in a ball weeping in shame.

178
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,507
I did not have sex with House.

179
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:23,550
If you two aren't keeping
something from me,

180
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:26,667
that means he's keeping
something from both of us.

181
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:29,210
- That can't be good.
- Or he's just in a good mood.

182
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:30,755
This is not a crisis.

183
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,632
Maybe you can get back
some of that money he owes you.

184
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,212
Testosterone blocker?

185
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:45,405
Does that mean if Jackson

186
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,799
has SLE or whatever
that other thing was,

187
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:50,274
that he'd had to go off
the hormones?

188
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:51,775
Probably.

189
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:53,990
Then Jackson'll stop developing.

190
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,992
He'll never go through puberty.

191
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:58,510
Maybe this isn't what's wrong
with him.

192
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,338
Maybe the testosterone
didn't cause it.

193
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:03,434
Yeah, but if it is,
then he'll never be a man.

194
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:06,915
Did we make the wrong choice?

195
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:17,843
You'll need to tell him the testosterone
blocker is something else.

196
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:22,889
Or maybe this is a good opportunity
to tell him the truth.

197
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,559
It might make it simpler.

198
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,352
For all of you.

199
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:30,530
You want us to tell
a sick adolescent boy

200
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:33,397
that he's really not
an adolescent boy?

201
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:36,403
That... doesn't seem simpler to me.

202
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,850
No.

203
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:41,155
Just...

204
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:44,821
give him the meds.

205
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,499
So you have pain

206
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:53,019
in one arm and both your legs.

207
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:55,420
- Does it hurt right now?
- No.

208
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:58,608
It's when I, like,
put pressure on them.

209
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:00,922
See...

210
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:03,064
it hurts when I do this.

211
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,010
And this.

212
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:11,991
And this.

213
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:18,526
What about this?

214
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,329
Did you give House the moron
with the broken finger?

215
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,654
They've been in room two
about ten minutes.

216
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,234
Patient should've been screaming
for another doctor seven minutes ago.

217
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:39,518
Thanks, Brah.

218
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:54,732
If I have this IV,
why do I need a shot too?

219
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:58,464
Just some extra medicine.

220
00:12:58,589 --> 00:12:59,889
Just to be safe.

221
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,661
I hear you're quite
the basketball player.

222
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:05,788
- What position?
- Point guard.

223
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:07,109
Small forward.

224
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:08,893
How's your crossover dribble?

225
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:10,083
It's okay.

226
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,915
Not really that into basketball.

227
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:14,501
Gonna feel a little pinch, okay?

228
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:20,224
So if you're not that into it,
why did you join the team?

229
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:24,594
My mom kind of made me do it.

230
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:26,668
My parents were the same way.

231
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:28,938
Always pushing me to try new things.

232
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:31,535
It's more like what
she didn't want me to try.

233
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:35,242
I wanted to take dance.

234
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,692
She flipped out and made me choose
between basketball and hockey.

235
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,449
- What does your dad say?
- He seemed okay with it.

236
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,532
Then he just caved in to my mom.

237
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,537
Your palm is red.

238
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,650
What does that mean?

239
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,370
That we still don't know
what's wrong with you.

240
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:03,907
You were right.

241
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,709
He is in a good mood.

242
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:15,812
Bummer it didn't work out
with you and thirteen.

243
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:18,815
- It happens.
- You guys seemed happy together.

244
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,068
It's probably for the best.
You know, the bisexual thing and all.

245
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,404
- It was never an issue.
- No, it never is.

246
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,822
Until it is.

247
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,458
This is thirteen.
Before you guys got together,

248
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,620
she was hooking up
with a different girl every night.

249
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,798
Long term, you really think
you could compete with that?

250
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,627
Wake up. We have to talk.

251
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,194
Stop pretending to be asleep.
We're not leaving.

252
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,011
What's going on?

253
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:54,993
- {\He's not breathing}No breathing.
- {\Can you get }A pulse?

254
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:56,394
- Barely.
- Call a code.

255
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,812
Get an ambu bag.{\from the nurse's station.}

256
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:00,330
Heart still working means
synapses are still firing.

257
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,421
We just need to get
a message through.

258
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,782
You stopped breathing.

259
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,251
What the hell is going on?

260
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:24,422
I think my penis stopped breathing.

261
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,967
- Do you know CPR?
- Looks like your brain is okay.

262
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,226
Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive.

263
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,429
I'm fine.

264
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,973
Other than the fact
that my nurple is now purple.

265
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,736
No wonder you broke up with him.
I'm surprised yours are still attached.

266
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,896
By the way,
I could see that from here.

267
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,018
I assume those are
our patient's lab results.

268
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,775
{\The patient}He can wait.
You could've died.

269
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,168
The only reason you'd ignore
a near-death experience

270
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:50,213
is you don't care
or you already know why it happened.

271
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,808
It's called vicodin.
I took too many.

272
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,985
Can I please get some information
about our patient?

273
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,310
Patient's palms are red. Lab tests
confirmed liver and kidney dysfunction.

274
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:01,167
I don't remember you taking
any vicodin{\ today}.

275
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,334
I don't remember hiring my mother.

276
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,837
What causes the enzymes

277
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,047
in little Boy George's
existing heart problem and pelvic pain?

278
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:10,343
You didn't take any yesterday
at breakfast either.

279
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,429
I don't remember eating
{\having breakfast} with my mother.

280
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,349
- Amyloidosis with systemic involvement.
- Protein levels are normal.

281
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,125
This kid's depressed. If he's
self-medicating with drugs and alcohol,

282
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,480
- that'd explain his symptoms.
- Search the school. Search the home.

283
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,364
- Seriously? Or are you just deflecting?
- Both.

284
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:30,961
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

285
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:33,408
I'm staying right here.
So we can properly discuss this.

286
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,968
He's on heroin.

287
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,041
- How can you...
- Number 1:

288
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:43,346
he's happy, which means he's high.
Number 2:

289
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:46,470
when he moved his bad leg,
he didn't use his hands to support it.

290
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:49,315
Whatever he's taking,
it's stronger than vicodin.

291
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,093
What are we gonna do?

292
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:57,890
You really think House
took too many vicodin?

293
00:16:58,324 --> 00:17:01,954
Guy pops 'em like candy.
I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.

294
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:04,671
You miss sleeping with women?

295
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:07,733
- Excuse me?
- Simple question.

296
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:12,197
It's a simple answer.

297
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,808
I'll... check under the bed.

298
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:20,303
I also miss sleeping with other men.

299
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,916
And I'm sure you miss sleeping
with other women.

300
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:25,266
Monogamy is like saying

301
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:29,373
you're never gonna have any other
ice cream flavor besides rocky road.

302
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,091
So you're saying

303
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:33,426
if you don't have pink bubblegum
for a while,

304
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,995
that one day you're gonna
chase down the ice cream truck?

305
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:39,046
Rocky road is great.

306
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,463
It's a very delicious
and complicated flavor.

307
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:46,415
I also know that if I have
other flavors,

308
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,110
then rocky road is gonna be left
in the freezer where anyone can dip in.

309
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,795
Can we please drop the metaphor?

310
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:56,199
Why is this coming up now?

311
00:17:57,203 --> 00:17:59,828
Kutner said the silver lining
of our break-up was

312
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,236
I wouldn't be dumped for a girl.

313
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,013
There's nothing in here either.
{\Seems like }You're wrong about this kid

314
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:07,484
- having drug or alcohol...
- When did he bring that up?

315
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:09,245
Earlier today.

316
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:12,120
- Right before...
- This morning Taub called you a robot.

317
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:16,583
Either it's a big coincidence or...

318
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:18,845
they're jerking us around.

319
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,120
- They know.
- And if they know,

320
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,857
House knows.

321
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:24,602
This is bad.

322
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:28,152
This is good.

323
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:32,193
House only has two ways
to handle us still going out.

324
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:35,495
He jerks us around or he fires us.
He chose option "a".

325
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,365
This is good.

326
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:44,704
But this is bad.

327
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,710
"I stand alone, my soul and me,

328
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,861
"beneath the mask
that others... see."

329
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,893
His chest is still rising.
He's just screwing with me

330
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:59,968
'cause Cuddy made me babysit.

331
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:03,718
"A pain that tears and bites
and will not bend.

332
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,943
"Only when I sleep will it end."

333
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:07,221
Downer.

334
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:09,898
And medically irrelevant...

335
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,669
you sure his chest is moving?

336
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,182
If he's faking, you think he's gonna
come clean 'cause you said his name?

337
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:20,241
Back off.

338
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:23,369
Only thirteen gets
to grab my nipples this time.

339
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:25,872
You know, recreating the moment
when you made us

340
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:28,197
crap our pants isn't actually
all that funny.

341
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,870
That is sweet that
you're worried about House.

342
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,001
Unless the next stanza reads

343
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:38,371
"Hoping to fry my brain to death,

344
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:41,144
"I smoked some primo crystal meth",

345
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:42,849
I'm not interested.

346
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,974
You can't deny that this kid
may be suicidal.

347
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,435
We're not here to make him happy.
We're here to diagnose him.

348
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,645
It's an infection.

349
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:52,165
Swab of the kid's water bottle
turned up toxoplasmosis.

350
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:54,674
I'll start him on pyrimethamine.

351
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:06,336
I had no idea he felt this way.

352
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,541
Is there a therapist here
that you can recommend?

353
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,876
It might help more
if you talked to him.

354
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:14,921
He's not ready.

355
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,924
If telling him the truth would help him
stop feeling like this...

356
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:21,344
if I knew that it would make him
less confused, I'd tell him right now.

357
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:25,515
But if she's wrong,
we'd only make things worse.

358
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:29,096
He obviously senses he's different.

359
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:31,464
He's looking for answers.

360
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,107
Every teenager feels different.

361
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,496
He's sick.

362
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,329
This isn't the time
to spring this on him.

363
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:47,901
When you give Jackson
the antibiotics,

364
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:50,449
will you please restart
the testosterone?

365
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:52,154
Sure.

366
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:59,007
I get House wanting to jerk
me and 13 around, but you guys?

367
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,380
Told you they were still together.

368
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:04,229
How do you know?

369
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,596
Noticed you smell like
13's soap every morning.

370
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,671
- You figured it out?
- Yes, I'm a little slow.

371
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:12,352
Maybe someone should let me know
when I should be insulted.

372
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:14,856
Then House doesn't know.

373
00:21:15,097 --> 00:21:18,107
Probably does now that you felt her up
during that last differential.

374
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,598
You noticed this but House didn't?

375
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,884
Yes, I get it.
He's generally smarter than me.

376
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:29,349
- Can we move on?
- He's not generally smarter than you.

377
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:31,268
He's always smarter than you.

378
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:33,281
Unless...

379
00:21:40,722 --> 00:21:42,056
House is on heroin.

380
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:47,688
Well, that's certainly
an... interesting notion.

381
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:50,650
It's why his lungs stopped.
It's why he okay'd the mri.

382
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:54,175
It's why he missed...
things he wouldn't ordinarily miss.

383
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,062
We'll run some tests,

384
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,511
- I'll let you know.
- <i>He's there, isn't he?</i>

385
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:01,986
That would certainly explain
the inappropriate responses.

386
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,194
I gotta go.

387
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:07,105
Sorry.
A consult.

388
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:11,412
- When did you order these?
- When you were in the bathroom.

389
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,320
I thought a celebration
was in order.

390
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:16,668
To cheating death.

391
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,101
You off bourbon?
We can get you something else.

392
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:28,846
I came here expecting a burger.

393
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:32,183
Figured I'd have to endure
a little lecture on moderation.

394
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:35,922
- You never listen, so why...
- Instead, I get a drink.

395
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:39,316
Nice little serving
of respiratory depressant

396
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,586
on the day that my lungs
stopped working.

397
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:42,902
You seem fine now.

398
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,071
You don't believe
that I od'd on vicodin.

399
00:22:45,994 --> 00:22:47,615
You figure I'm on something
stronger.

400
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,794
And because you can never{\, ever }assume anything
but the most screwed-up scenarios,

401
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,400
- as far as I'm concerned...
- Funny how I'm usually right.

402
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:54,998
You think that I'm on heroin.

403
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:58,458
This is your version
of a tox screen.

404
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:00,401
Because if I am on heroin,

405
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:03,339
I can't drink that without risking
another bout of not breathing.

406
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,377
Well?

407
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:21,537
Good night.

408
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:29,756
Another shot?

409
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:31,463
I'm afraid so.

410
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,997
That looks like the vitamins
my parents give me. Same red top.

411
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:47,285
These aren't vitamins.

412
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,928
What is it?

413
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,949
I can't tell you that.

414
00:23:53,318 --> 00:23:54,724
You should ask your parents.

415
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,034
You idiot!

416
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:08,237
Okay, I admit it.

417
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,547
I have bulimia.

418
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,782
- I look good though, don't I?
- Heroin.

419
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:16,412
House, of all the stupid...

420
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,924
I'm not on heroin.

421
00:24:18,148 --> 00:24:20,541
I just caught you with
your fingers down your throat.

422
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:21,751
I'm on methadone.

423
00:24:25,217 --> 00:24:26,467
Stupid product.

424
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:28,049
Heroin without the high.

425
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,601
Yeah, and twice the risk of death.

426
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,178
But no risk of arrest.

427
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,387
You nearly died.

428
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:35,932
- Today was a fluke. I nodded off.
- Right.

429
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,760
You're safe as long
as you never sleep again.

430
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:42,068
Mistime your dose, you die.
Couple of drinks, you die.

431
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:44,044
Mix it with the wrong drugs,
you die.

432
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:47,650
You want to detox from vicodin?
Pick something that won't kill you.

433
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:48,778
I'm not detoxing.

434
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,783
If you're looking for something
to help with your pain...

435
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,278
Doesn't help my pain.

436
00:24:56,374 --> 00:24:57,537
It eliminates it.

437
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:10,047
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

438
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,186
She completely disregarded
our instructions.

439
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,564
He asked a question.
I was tired of lying.

440
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,983
I didn't tell him anything
about his genetic condition.

441
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:29,485
I want her removed
from our son's case.

442
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:32,947
I'm sorry for the position
Dr. Hadley put you in,

443
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:34,635
but I can't do that.

444
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,797
She's a valuable part of Dr. House's
diagnostic team.

445
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,663
If he stays on the case,
so does she.

446
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,707
We have to deal with Jackson.

447
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,669
- These questions aren't gonna go away.
- He's not ready for this.

448
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,610
Let's hope you're wrong.

449
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,390
I'm sorry. I'll stay away
from their son.

450
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:01,132
No, you won't.

451
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:04,764
In about 15 mn, you're the only person
that kid's gonna trust.

452
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:07,732
If he needs a hand to hold,
make sure yours is available.

453
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:16,228
So what?

454
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,035
Am I a boy or a girl?

455
00:26:20,577 --> 00:26:22,577
Some of your cells are male...

456
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,115
and some are female.

457
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,709
So basically I'm a freak.

458
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:28,628
No, no, buddy.

459
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:32,124
You're just a little different.

460
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:36,614
You've known this...

461
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,461
since I was born.

462
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:40,640
And you never told me.

463
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:43,836
- We didn't want you to be confused.
- So you lied to me.

464
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:47,472
Oh, please, sweetie,
we were just trying to protect you.

465
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:48,837
Don't.

466
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:51,943
Just leave me alone.

467
00:26:54,637 --> 00:26:55,637
Get out.

468
00:26:58,425 --> 00:26:59,425
Let's go.

469
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,922
You still breathing in there?

470
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:17,507
'cause if not,
I'm sending in janitorial.

471
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,514
I'm not breathing.
But it's strictly voluntary.

472
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,942
Should've seen the guy
who was in here before{\ me}.

473
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:25,498
I know about the methadone.

474
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:29,403
It's legal.

475
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:30,783
I have a prescription.

476
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:33,075
Whatever doctor you conned
into writing it

477
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,109
clearly had no idea
about your addiction issues.

478
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:37,341
- Your lack of...
- He knows I'm in pain.

479
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,558
What I put in my body
is my business.

480
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:42,159
You keep taking this, you could die.

481
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,770
If you'd said that if I keep doing this
you could die,

482
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:46,355
then it'd be your business.

483
00:27:47,853 --> 00:27:50,293
I can't sit by and watch you
kill yourself.

484
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,421
As long as you're in my hospital,
you can't do methadone.

485
00:28:02,126 --> 00:28:03,597
I'll send someone for my stuff.

486
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:07,560
That's it?

487
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:09,812
You're quitting?

488
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,106
You're choosing methadone
over this job?

489
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:15,940
I'm choosing lack of pain
over this job.

490
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:28,823
Eventually you have to talk
to your parents again.

491
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:30,048
No, I don't.

492
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,316
I have this one friend.

493
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,723
He's on my basketball team.
Will.

494
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,250
We hang out a lot.

495
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:52,141
I really like him.
Now I'm worried that I...

496
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:55,701
You know, like him.

497
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:01,067
Maybe I'm supposed to.

498
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,575
Because if I'm really a girl...

499
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,998
Do you feel like a girl?

500
00:29:12,225 --> 00:29:14,363
I like dancing more than basketball.

501
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,420
Is that what that means?

502
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:24,619
Jackson...

503
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:28,933
As hard as it is right now,

504
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:30,935
At least it's out in the open.

505
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:33,594
You don't have to hide...

506
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:35,001
behind a mask.

507
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:42,446
I found the poem you wrote
in your room.

508
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,868
No matter how bad things get,

509
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:51,747
killing yourself
is never the answer.

510
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,089
This was an english assignment.

511
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:06,281
We were supposed to write
a poem in the style of Sylvia Plath.

512
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:13,116
You don't feel this way?

513
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:17,164
I'm sad sometimes.

514
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,015
I don't want to die.

515
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,363
At least, I didn't.

516
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:36,870
Are these antibiotics
supposed to make you nauseous?

517
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:38,581
Yeah, they can.

518
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:22,918
- We're on our own.
- Is he okay?

519
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:24,456
He's fine.
He's just not here.

520
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:26,175
Did he quit?
Did she suspend him?

521
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,839
She didn't say. She just told me I
was in charge until further notice.

522
00:31:29,964 --> 00:31:32,900
So if we add bloody vomit
to our patient's list of symptoms.

523
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,817
Surgeon reports the bleeding
was caused by a gastric fistula

524
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:38,910
- caused by necrotizing pancreatitis.
- She must've told you something.

525
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:40,864
Nothing that would help us
with this patient.

526
00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:42,604
Heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas.

527
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:46,129
Obviously whatever this kid's got
is something systemic.

528
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,571
Zollinger-Ellison?

529
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:49,602
Or systemic scleroderma.

530
00:31:51,316 --> 00:31:53,086
Zollinger-ellison fits better.

531
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,212
- Why?
- Can we at least call house?

532
00:31:55,337 --> 00:31:57,277
We can. I have.
He's not answering.

533
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,291
Put the patient
on proton pump inhibitors.

534
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,836
He gets better, it's Zollinger-Ellison.
If not, it's scleroderma.

535
00:32:08,603 --> 00:32:11,323
Zollinger-Ellison
doesn't fit better.

536
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:14,807
You don't want it to be scleroderma
because that means he's gonna die.

537
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:16,725
Patients die all the time.

538
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,686
Not the ones whose family
you've ruined.

539
00:32:19,694 --> 00:32:20,771
I don't think that.

540
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:22,733
You do.

541
00:32:23,434 --> 00:32:24,608
It's not your fault.

542
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,840
He was no more confused
than any other teenager.

543
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:29,321
Then I started a fire
and threw gas on it.

544
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:31,571
You were trying to help.

545
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:41,027
Hi, is House here?

546
00:32:41,152 --> 00:32:42,702
He's getting dressed.

547
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,902
I'll be back around 10:00 tonight.

548
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:47,220
Go on in.

549
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Okay.

550
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:56,098
- who was she?
- I hired her to watch me sleep.

551
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,780
Make sure I don't stop breathing.

552
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:00,005
Home nurses usually wear scrubs.

553
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:02,219
She's not a nurse.

554
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:05,999
You hired a hooker
to watch you sleep?

555
00:33:06,124 --> 00:33:07,474
That just can't...

556
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:11,064
Surprisingly,

557
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:12,478
hookers are cheaper.

558
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:14,372
And they don't sue
for sexual harassment.

559
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:15,497
Which one?

560
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:17,911
You shaved.

561
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:20,080
The red one then.

562
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:22,416
You have two ties?

563
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:25,085
Meeting at St. Sebastian's today.

564
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:28,714
Gonna try and talk 'em into starting
up a diagnostics department.

565
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:30,382
Sounds great.

566
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:33,720
I just came by to check up on you.

567
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,137
See how you were doing.

568
00:33:36,804 --> 00:33:37,804
I'm fine.

569
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:41,352
I guess you are.

570
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,023
He hasn't responded
to the medication at all?

571
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,816
I'm afraid not.

572
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:50,002
So...

573
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,126
That means he's got the other thing?

574
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,197
I'm so sorry.

575
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,158
We'll start him
on anti-inflammatories.

576
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,476
If we're lucky, that will slow down
the progression.

577
00:34:08,442 --> 00:34:11,253
My son has a death sentence
and I can't go in there

578
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:12,966
and be with him because of you.

579
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:14,468
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,845
You find a homework assignment
and decide he's suicidal.

581
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,632
Make it your own personal mission.

582
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:22,977
- I let my feelings...
- Oh, don't you dare apologize.

583
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,316
Like it could absolve you
of what you've done to me,

584
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:27,629
my family.

585
00:34:27,754 --> 00:34:28,754
He was fine.

586
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:31,235
I understand why you're angry.

587
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,529
But this isn't where
you belong right now.

588
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,192
He won't let us in the room.

589
00:34:35,317 --> 00:34:37,878
He's a teenager.
You're his mother.

590
00:34:38,003 --> 00:34:40,160
This is not the time
to start listening to him.

591
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,504
Go be with him.

592
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,256
Thank you.

593
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,976
I didn't do it for you.

594
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:04,317
We made a mistake.

595
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:05,507
No, we didn't.

596
00:35:05,632 --> 00:35:09,060
- The methadone's good for him.
- The methadone is gonna kill him.

597
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:11,505
He shaved.
He was wearing a tie.

598
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,360
He has a meeting at St. Sebastian.

599
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,195
If he buys a new pair of shoes,
should we let him smoke crack?

600
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,990
Cuddy, he's happy.

601
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:20,021
House doesn't do happy.

602
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:21,493
Pain or no pain.

603
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,516
Okay, maybe...

604
00:35:24,632 --> 00:35:26,879
But he's our friend.

605
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:29,817
And this is his one chance

606
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:31,587
to not be miserable.

607
00:35:55,775 --> 00:35:56,748
The heels.

608
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:57,873
Very nice.

609
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:00,893
No reason not to wear them
now that house is gone.

610
00:36:01,462 --> 00:36:02,562
You okay?

611
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:04,276
Yeah. Jjust tired.

612
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,278
Got some good news.

613
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:09,561
Patient's scleroderma is responding
to the anti-inflammatory meds.

614
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:11,937
His ast level's dropped a bit.

615
00:36:12,062 --> 00:36:14,622
So he's dying slightly
less quickly than we thought.

616
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:16,147
That's great news.

617
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:20,172
I'm not okay.

618
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,489
Next time just say that.

619
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,060
What's his ast?

620
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,521
185, I think.

621
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,388
That's a pretty fast drop. Are we sure
it's from the anti-inflammatories?

622
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:36,276
What else could it be from? He's been
off the antibiotics for a while.

623
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,570
- Proton pump inhibitor...
- He's back on testosterone.

624
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,032
- Testosterone wouldn't help his liver.
- It could improve his kidney function

625
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,007
which would also lower his ast.

626
00:36:44,132 --> 00:36:45,911
But not in kidneys damaged
by scleroderma.

627
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,579
Which means it's not scleroderma.

628
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:56,182
I have an interview in two hours.

629
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:01,468
Hand over my letter
of recommendation.

630
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:04,219
Sorry, I haven't done it yet.

631
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,975
- You have no right to sabotage...
- I was busy with this.

632
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,729
It's a list of requirements
for your methadone treatment.

633
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:15,107
Weekly drug tests.

634
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,275
Supervised doses

635
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,443
administered on a precise
schedule by me

636
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,161
or one of the nurses.

637
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:24,074
Seems weird getting my meds here
when I'm working somewhere else.

638
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:25,405
Yes.

639
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:30,330
I'm offering you your job back.

640
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:33,959
I want a raise.

641
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,098
No.

642
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:38,130
And a bigger office...
but in the same spot.

643
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,047
No.

644
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,514
We both know this is where
you belong.

645
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:48,745
Okay.

646
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:52,352
Welcome back.

647
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,144
Thank you.

648
00:38:03,252 --> 00:38:04,323
You're welcome.

649
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:14,249
You okay?

650
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,586
I have issues with authority.
You?

651
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:19,546
We thought you were gone.

652
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:21,006
Cuddy missed me.

653
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,753
And what happened to your cane?

654
00:38:22,878 --> 00:38:24,843
She asked to borrow it
for some reason.

655
00:38:25,432 --> 00:38:26,582
Patient dead?

656
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,055
Or do I need to do anything?

657
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,750
- He's got scleroderma.
- It's not scleroderma.

658
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:33,942
Two days,

659
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:36,188
And you've already got
two separate theories.

660
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:38,231
You're back. Good.

661
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:41,315
We noticed a drop in ast levels.
It's not the anti-inflammatory...

662
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,654
It's because his kidneys got
better from the testosterone.

663
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,197
Which rules out scleroderma.

664
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:47,741
When did you two come up with this?

665
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,259
We ran into each other in the lobby.

666
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:54,130
What did we miss?

667
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:56,333
When I say "we" I mean "you,"
since I wasn't here.

668
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,317
We've ruled out Zollinger-Ellison.

669
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:00,420
- That was a dumb idea.
- Why?

670
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,741
- Because it was wrong.
- Also toxoplasmosis,

671
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,570
dehydration, SLE,
various intersex disorders.

672
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:07,928
Oh, crap.

673
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:12,683
This kid like energy drinks?

674
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,882
I saw some empty bottles
in the team locker room.

675
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,313
But energy drinks don't explain...

676
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,301
- Nice work.
- So... we're okay?

677
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:24,084
Why wouldn't we be?

678
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:26,359
Nice heels.

679
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,665
This is all your parents' fault.

680
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,763
Excuse me?

681
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:41,128
Chug a lot of energy drinks
before, during, and after practice?

682
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:44,506
Your son came in here
with simple dehydration.

683
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,962
That's why he collapsed
during the game.

684
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,962
The ER treated him for that.
It didn't help the pain.

685
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,930
That's where the energy drinks
came in.

686
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,961
They put a strain on his kidneys
so he needed more time to rebound

687
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:57,477
- From the initial dehydration.
- Then why isn't he better?

688
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,479
That's where your idiocy came in.

689
00:40:00,455 --> 00:40:02,399
Before we could give him
another glass of water,

690
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,317
You two insisted I do an MRI.

691
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:07,446
So I go down a blind alley

692
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,150
looking for a blind uterus.

693
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,575
And my team injects him
with contrast material.

694
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:15,470
If his kidneys had been healthy,
they would've filtered out the contrast

695
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:17,347
in a couple hours.
Since they weren't,

696
00:40:17,472 --> 00:40:19,702
they went around and around.
Eventually getting absorbed

697
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:21,569
by his heart, his liver,
and his pancreas,

698
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:24,132
getting in trouble
everywhere it went.

699
00:40:24,393 --> 00:40:26,443
Your son was fine when he got here.

700
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:27,878
It was your...

701
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:30,677
freaked-out overprotectiveness
that nearly killed him.

702
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:32,442
Nearly?

703
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:34,473
He's young.

704
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,185
A few weeks of dialysis,
he should be fine.

705
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:48,363
You gave birth to a freak of nature.

706
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:52,404
Doesn't mean it's a good idea
to treat him like one.

707
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:05,879
How you feeling?

708
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:07,506
A little bit better.

709
00:41:08,472 --> 00:41:10,432
I saw you talking
to your parents earlier.

710
00:41:10,557 --> 00:41:11,426
That's good.

711
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,911
My mom asked if I wanted
to take dance lessons.

712
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,097
That's great.

713
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:18,843
I'm actually worried
I might miss basketball.

714
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:20,730
Starting to get good.

715
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,479
No reason you can't do both.

716
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,211
Starting tomorrow, you'll come
to my office for your fix.

717
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,229
I'm done with the methadone.

718
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,758
I screwed up.

719
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,524
The kids' parents wanted that mri.

720
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,012
I knew he didn't need it.

721
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,480
I did it anyway.

722
00:41:58,151 --> 00:41:59,704
That's what got him sick.

723
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,012
You just solved a case
that no one else could solve.

724
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:04,479
I created a case.

725
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,385
I played nice because
I was in a good mood

726
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,235
because I didn't hurt.

727
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,613
You don't need your pain
to be a good doctor.

728
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,490
- I'm not interested in good.
- you're afraid to be happy.

729
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,538
Why do you care if I'm happy?

730
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:27,085
You're afraid of change.

731
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:29,671
The one thing you have
is your intellect.

732
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,889
You think if that's compromised,
you have nothing.

733
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:38,513
Just take it.

734
00:42:39,762 --> 00:42:40,762
No.

735
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,976
Don't do this.

736
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,146
It's already done.

737
00:42:50,347 --> 00:42:51,943
This is the only me you get.

738
