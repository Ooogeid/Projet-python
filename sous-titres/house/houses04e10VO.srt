1
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,237
You okay?

2
00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:08,713
I'm thinking.

3
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:10,528
Thinking's not gonna get you
to the top.

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,500
Mom, you're supposed to be
encouraging me.

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,963
No, I'm supposed
to be coaching you.

6
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:16,120
The slower you go,
the more tired you're gonna get.

7
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,475
There's a hold about a foot
above you on the left.

8
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:27,264
I know.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,064
Nice grab.

10
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:34,869
Keep going,
you're almost there, babe.

11
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:36,263
I can't.
My calf's cramping.

12
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:38,714
You need to get off your toes.
Get on the ball of your foot.

13
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:39,984
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

14
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:41,878
You can get all the way to the top.

15
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:49,601
It's okay, I got you.

16
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:51,499
- You all right?
- Looks like you were wrong.

17
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:54,472
Yeah, but you did awesome.
That's the highest you've gotten.

18
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,600
- I'm proud of you.
- I don't feel so good.

19
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:58,023
Okay, come on down.

20
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,755
Mom?

21
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:03,458
Mom, are you okay?

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,467
God.

23
00:01:17,264 --> 00:01:19,495
- Are you all right?
- My arm... I think I broke it.

24
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:21,418
- Don't move.
- God, Jane, I'm so sorry.

25
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:23,164
What happened?
Did the rope break?

26
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,625
My hands...

27
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,925
I can't move them.

28
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:34,825
Season 4 - Episode 10
"It's a wonderful lie"

29
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:41,399
Synchro : ¤AkaZab¤, Icefre@k, Bluedoc

30
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:44,958
- Transcript: <i>ydy.com</i>
- Sub-way.fr

31
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:08,103
She's been to an ortho, two neuros,
and an immunologist.

32
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,235
None of the treatments
have had any effect.

33
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:12,248
- You think it's over?
- It's getting worse.

34
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:14,932
Last neurologist found intermittent
numbness in both arms as well

35
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,751
- as the hand paralysis.
- I meant the game.

36
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:18,449
You think he's gonna keep
all four of us?

37
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:19,513
He said he would.

38
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,269
No sign of upper
motor neuron involvement.

39
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,309
He lies.

40
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:23,835
My ears are burning.

41
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,207
Tell 'em you're done firing people.

42
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:28,648
Well, if I lie...

43
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:30,564
That would be little reassurance.

44
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,728
Dr. Kutner,

45
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,079
who told you that
it would be a good idea

46
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:37,307
to put up superficial representations
of a hypocritical season

47
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:40,368
- celebrating a mythical figure?
- It wasn't me.

48
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:41,868
He lied.

49
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:44,541
Homey knows better,

50
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:48,028
Hymie doesn't care, and Huntington's
would have done a better job.

51
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:49,533
I don't have Huntington's.

52
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:51,254
- That you know of.
- Why would you...

53
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,080
Because I got sued
when I called you "Honeybuns."

54
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:57,018
- Am I fired if I put up...
- The point of the game was to scare us.

55
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:58,528
Telling us it's over isn't scary.

56
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:01,044
Therefore he has no reason
to say that unless it's true.

57
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,178
- Good.
- Then can we do a secret santa?

58
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:09,578
I liked you better 15 seconds ago
when you were afraid for your job.

59
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,777
- So who's sick?
- 35-year-old single mom.

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,069
It's an odd presentation of paralysis.
Is there any history of drug use?

61
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:17,996
- No.
- She says there's no history.

62
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:19,507
She's not a liar.

63
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:22,274
Okay, this is gonna be a tough case.

64
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:25,080
I have almost no knowledge
of alien physiology.

65
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:27,558
Everyone lies, but there's
an exception to every rule.

66
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:29,922
Actually, there isn't.
That's kinda what makes it a rule.

67
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:31,924
The patient's mother died of
breast cancer when she was seven.

68
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:33,552
She never even knew
her mom was sick.

69
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:35,667
She promised herself,
she would never hide anything

70
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:36,912
from her own daughter.

71
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:39,782
I didn't know she promised.

72
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:41,621
And we're not her daughter.

73
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,663
The patient inherited
the BRCA1 mutation from her mom.

74
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:47,010
She got a prophylactic
double mastectomy ten years ago.

75
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:47,977
She lied about it.

76
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:49,983
She told her co-workers.
She told her kid.

77
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,312
She lied to the world.

78
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,040
Reconstructive surgery is
designed to convince people...

79
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,929
She didn't get
reconstructive surgery.

80
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,824
- Okay, we can rule out breast cancer.
- Actually, I was gonna rule it in.

81
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,547
Paralysis could be paraneoplastic.
Even the best surgeon can't remove

82
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,264
every cell of breast tissue.

83
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,948
MRI what's left of her chest.

84
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,131
Set the machine to scan for irony.

85
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,266
I'm gonna go redo the patient history.

86
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:22,350
Your mom tell you
about all the drugs she does?

87
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:26,397
She smokes pot once in a while,
but not in a long time.

88
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,623
What about you?

89
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:30,198
- How would that make her sick?
- Are you a doctor?

90
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:31,886
I'm 11.

91
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,281
That's not an answer.
That's an evasion.

92
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,080
Like drinking?
You ever sneak a drink?

93
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:41,567
I don't do any of that stuff.
It's bad for you.

94
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:45,064
I understand why you don't want
your mom to know.

95
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:47,264
- But I'm her doctor, so...
- I would tell my mom.

96
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,200
And I would tell you.

97
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,991
- Why?
- Because she would never lie to me.

98
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,598
What's her favorite way to have sex?

99
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:00,156
I don't get what sex has to do
with breast cancer.

100
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,529
Are you a doctor?

101
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:04,324
Did you go to med school
since the last time I asked?

102
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:06,076
You just think
we've got to be lying to...

103
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,552
- White lies?
- What are those?

104
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:10,564
Those are lies we tell
to make other people feel better.

105
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:11,728
I don't lie.

106
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:13,823
- Rationalizations?
- What are those?

107
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:16,035
Those are lies we tell
to make ourselves feel better.

108
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:16,967
No...

109
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,865
- We don't...
- Lies of omission?

110
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,933
Saddle bronc or doggie?

111
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:25,518
That's sex talk.

112
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:29,658
She used to like being on top,
but...

113
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:31,875
But now she likes to be
on her stomach.

114
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:37,196
That way she doesn't
have to see them looking at her scars.

115
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:47,024
It's child abuse.

116
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:48,280
Honesty?

117
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:51,591
There's a reason that everybody lies...
It works.

118
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:55,564
It's what allows society to function.
It's what separates man from beast.

119
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:57,364
Oh, I thought that was our thumbs.

120
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:59,523
You wanna know every place
your mom's thumb has been?

121
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:02,946
I'm sorry, I missed rehearsal.
Am I taking the "truth is good" side?

122
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:05,776
- Don't you usually take that part?
- Lies are a tool

123
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:07,483
to be used either for good...

124
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,867
No, wait. I got a better one.
Lies are like children.

125
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,414
Hard work, but they're worth it,
because the future depends on 'em.

126
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,084
You are so full of love...
Or something.

127
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,685
- When you care about someone...
- You lie to them!

128
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,605
You pretend that their constant
ponderous musings are interesting.

129
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:30,196
You tell them that they're not losing
their boyish good looks

130
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,261
- or becoming worn out and...
- I stand corrected.

131
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:34,616
And may I say it's been
a real pleasure chatting with you.

132
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:37,263
Axilla's clean.
Surgical margins look clear.

133
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,987
No lymphadenopathy,
no masses, no nothing.

134
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,434
It's not cancer.

135
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:44,152
<i>We need a new theory.</i>

136
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:46,232
- You catch her lying?
- Not yet.

137
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,209
Wouldn't "no" have been
a shorter answer?

138
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,991
Wouldn't you not talking
have made this a shorter conversation?

139
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:53,714
- Kid says mom's a slut.
- She called her mom a slut?

140
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:55,235
No, I called her mom a slut.

141
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:57,197
She jumps anything
with a pole and a pulse.

142
00:06:57,442 --> 00:06:58,553
Not that I'm judging here.

143
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:00,576
Given her medical history,
I'm actually impressed.

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,959
Maggie already admitted to
having multiple sexual partners,

145
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,977
which is why we already tested for
and ruled out syphilis and any other STD

146
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:07,449
that could have caused her symptoms.

147
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,529
Stds aren't the only risk in risky sex.

148
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:12,722
The problem in sleeping
with strangers is they're strange.

149
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,531
We'll follow up
with any recent partners.

150
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:17,043
Send Foreman and Taub.
They're better liars.

151
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:18,906
More likely to get to the truth.

152
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,394
You think I drugged her?
Use a coaster.

153
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:29,849
We're not cops.

154
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:32,101
Legally, we don't care
one way or another.

155
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:34,432
But we need to know the truth
so we can help her.

156
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:37,234
I'd known her for less than an hour,
and she offered to take me home.

157
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:38,679
There was no need to drug her.

158
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:41,784
Not that I would.

159
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,402
She's gonna be okay, right?

160
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:48,003
As long as she doesn't have
to pick up or hold anything, yeah.

161
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,864
Sorry, I just had the floors done.
Reclaimed pine.

162
00:07:56,872 --> 00:07:58,347
You always this thirsty?

163
00:07:58,866 --> 00:07:59,953
I don't know.

164
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,351
Water's supposed to be
good for you, right?

165
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,589
- Dehydration, anxiety, aggression...
- I'm not aggressive.

166
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,589
Spastic chorea in his right hand.

167
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:10,712
What about my hand?

168
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,277
How much you weigh?
About 180, 190?

169
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,303
- 180. What is the...
- If you took what she did,

170
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:16,951
it could take longer to hit you.
It might affect you differently.

171
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:19,164
But you didn't give her
anything... Right?

172
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:22,876
She was really drunk.

173
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:26,435
I just gave her some "e",
to help enhance things.

174
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:28,711
Have any of it left?

175
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:33,179
- Is my hand gonna be okay?
- There's nothing wrong with it.

176
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,341
We lied.

177
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,174
I've had a sore throat
for a few days now.

178
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,329
My stomach's also been bothering me.

179
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:47,200
I think my glands are swollen.

180
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,668
Saint-Nicholas?

181
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,215
Patron Saint of children.

182
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:56,977
Also seamen, merchants, archers,
prostitutes, and prisoners.

183
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,501
Must've been pretty hard-working.

184
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,513
Or just a credit hog.

185
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,427
Open wide.

186
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:06,164
- Say ahh.
- Ahh...

187
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:08,258
You have strep.

188
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,130
Is it contagious?

189
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,426
Only for the next 24 hours,
as long as you take the antibiotics.

190
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:15,476
How contagious?

191
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:17,464
Take a personal day.

192
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:18,391
I can't.

193
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,640
I'll write your pimp a note.

194
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:22,884
My pimp?

195
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:26,525
You're tested for aids
every three months, and your necklace.

196
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,825
- Prostitutes wear religious symbols.
- I think they just like kneeling.

197
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:34,738
You don't have the skin
of a seaman,

198
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:36,972
the fingers of an archer,
the clothes of a merchant,

199
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,927
or the attitude of an ex-con.
So, it just leaves one left.

200
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,846
Two, actually.

201
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,919
But I'm not a child, am I?

202
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:59,178
You owe me 50 bucks.

203
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,575
Then you owe me half a lap dance.

204
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:05,016
It's for the nurses' holiday bonus.
I know you got the memo.

205
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:06,496
I got the memo last year.

206
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,348
I want to hire 40 more fellows.

207
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:11,856
- You already fired the ones you hired?
- They work better when they're scared.

208
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:14,028
You were right.
Guy slipped her ecstasy.

209
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:16,567
- He have any symptoms?
- No.

210
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,591
Kutner's starting the patient
on hemodialysis, and Thirteen's

211
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:22,158
in the lab trying to figure out
what the guy put in the drugs.

212
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:25,080
See?

213
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:28,385
A clear, simple statement of facts
describing their cooperation

214
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:32,003
- with absolutely no attitude or fear.
- Something's gotta be done.

215
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:33,153
Yeah.

216
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,997
How are you feeling?

217
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:40,019
- I still can't move my hands.
- It'll take a few more hours

218
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:42,027
to cycle all your blood
through the machine.

219
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:43,703
What just happened?

220
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,164
Nothing.
What's wrong?

221
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,443
What do you mean?
The lights just went out.

222
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:50,319
Didn't they?

223
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,999
- What did you do?
- Is this from the drugs?

224
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:55,235
Most of the drugs should be
out of your system by now.

225
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,679
- And our drugs...
- I can't see.

226
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:58,633
- Do something.
- I can't see.

227
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,578
I can't see!

228
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,594
Nothing in the ecstasy
except ecstasy.

229
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,089
Well, that never hurt anybody.

230
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,341
It can't make 'em blind
days later.

231
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,844
Do you spell "homie"
with a "y"?

232
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,817
I want to be respectful.

233
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,117
You're actually gonna let us do
secret santa?

234
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,250
Not just you guys.

235
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,488
I like presents too.

236
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:25,896
Pick a name.

237
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:27,392
Why are you doing this?

238
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:29,964
See, this is why
no one likes your people.

239
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,968
<i>The notion of picking
one time of the year</i>

240
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,399
to be decent to other people

241
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,623
is obscene, 'cause it's actually
validating the notion

242
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,747
of being miserable wretches
the rest of the year.

243
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,233
So you think this is the part of the
year that's screwed up?

244
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,871
On the other hand,
you are now a team.

245
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,015
You've gotta work together.
And the simple fact is,

246
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,053
giving people crap
makes people like people.

247
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,933
So spend 25 bucks.
Learn to love.

248
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:51,359
Blindness could be a complication
from the hemodialysis.

249
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,463
No, the dialysate composition
was within range.

250
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,007
- Sweet.
- Interesting.

251
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:58,804
Dialysate composition
just indicates-

252
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,674
Nothing.
I was referring to his reaction

253
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:02,472
<i>- to the name he got.
- I was pleased.</i>

254
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:05,098
- I thought it would be fun to buy-
- Means there's someone here

255
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:06,547
it wouldn't be fun
to buy for.

256
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:07,714
I wonder who.

257
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:09,244
Pick a name.

258
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,532
Then go check out
the patient's house.

259
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:15,863
Interesting.

260
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:18,468
<i>We're wasting time
going to the home.</i>

261
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:20,444
Kearns-sayre syndrome
fits the symptoms.

262
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,669
No family history of kearns.
- Go to their house...

263
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,299
She would have told us if
there were any other drugs.

264
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,485
You met her. She couldn't
have been more candid.

265
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:28,276
You're absolutely right.
Go to their house.

266
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:30,020
Ms or vascular problem
fits better.

267
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,785
They could affect hands
and eyes.

268
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,782
Fine, do an MRI,
check for MS.

269
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:38,125
And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes
to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.

270
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,388
And whoever goes
to their House,

271
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:42,139
get me their computers.

272
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,263
You talk to your kid
about sex

273
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:46,459
so she'll think you're being open
about everything.

274
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:49,492
Keeps her from asking questions about
the things you don't want to talk about.

275
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:52,107
That's right. Her honesty proves
just how dishonest she is.

276
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:54,664
Yes!
Exactly who I wanted.

277
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:56,467
This is gonna be fun.

278
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,508
The dye may sting
when it enters your bloodstream.

279
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,431
Are you scared, mom?

280
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,664
Yeah. Are you?

281
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:09,875
Yeah.

282
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:11,210
Are they?

283
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,373
They don't look scared.

284
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,174
Either they're confident
or they just don't care.

285
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,764
We're confident.

286
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:20,280
Okay if I shift you a bit?

287
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,979
Get you into position.

288
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,605
Your boss is weird.

289
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:33,149
Yeah, he is.

290
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:36,986
He thought he'd get information
you may not have been telling us by...

291
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,146
Being a jerk?

292
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:40,264
You'd be surprised
how often it works.

293
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:41,824
Choroidal flush looks good.

294
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,994
Why would people lie
to a doctor?

295
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,382
Dozens of reasons to lie,

296
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:48,109
<i>only one reason
to tell the truth.</i>

297
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,540
<i>You're never even tempted?</i>

298
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:54,482
I mean, lies do sometimes
smooth things out,

299
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:55,744
make life easier.

300
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:57,923
Yeah?
Your life easy?

301
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,547
Not even close.

302
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,268
The dye has reached
the retinal capillary bed.

303
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:04,388
No leakage.

304
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,484
That's good, right?

305
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:09,852
It means it's not
a vascular problem.

306
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,020
<i>What?</i>

307
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,272
A vascular problem
we could fix.

308
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,518
They look worried now, mom.

309
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,033
What's with
the secret santa?

310
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:26,709
You trying
to bring them together?

311
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:28,162
I want to drive them
apart.

312
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,944
With gift giving?

313
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:31,801
Conflict's built
right into the name.

314
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,219
Santa's about sharing.
A secret's about withholding.

315
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:37,408
Aside from the trojan horse,

316
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,865
- gifts don't usually...
- What'd you get your wife

317
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,575
for your final
anniversary?

318
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:42,968
Uh... A sweater.

319
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,803
- She hated it.
- She loved it.

320
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,430
Then you didn't buy it.

321
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,433
I gave her some cash...

322
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:50,764
<i>And...</i>

323
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:54,012
Gifts allow us
to demonstrate

324
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:55,863
exactly how little we know
about a person.

325
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:57,691
And nothing pisses off
a person more than

326
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,485
being shoved
in the wrong pigeonhole.

327
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:00,945
Yes.

328
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:05,473
I'm thinking of spending a few
extra bucks on my secret santa.

329
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:06,354
Bad idea.

330
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:09,197
You mind if I tell house you asked
them for the key instead of breaking in?

331
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:11,507
- Yes, I do. Just another five bucks.
- Five will be ten.

332
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,623
The key's proof she doesn't
have anything to hide.

333
00:15:13,684 --> 00:15:16,113
The key is proof I didn't do exactly
what house told me to do.

334
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,837
And what do you care
if it's another $15?

335
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:20,249
I'm gonna tell him.
Who are you so anxious to please?

336
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,102
Not you.

337
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:23,958
You really think you're going to prove
people are capable of honesty

338
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:26,178
using a mother and daughter
you've known for one day?

339
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:28,991
I'm not the one who's based his entire
world view on the proposition.

340
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,909
If I'm wrong, so what?
If he's wrong...

341
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,583
- So you've got Huntington's?
- Nope.

342
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,955
- But house said that...
- If I wanted to talk about it,

343
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:40,192
why didn't I bring it up?

344
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:45,336
<i>Fluorescein angiogram was clear.
No leaks, no lesions.</i>

345
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:47,968
<i>Definitely not
a vascular problem.</i>

346
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,945
Someone get their birthdays
out of the file.

347
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,205
Have you tried
leaving it blank?

348
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:59,254
Tough to get into the head of someone
who actually trusts people, huh?

349
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:02,016
<i>Found both computers
in an office</i>

350
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:03,716
on a desk they share.

351
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:06,244
<i>No sign of macular degeneration
or optic neuritis.</i>

352
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:07,805
Her eyes are
completely normal.

353
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,565
Except she can't see
out of them.

354
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:10,931
So she says.

355
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,141
Find anything
on the mri?

356
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:15,091
No sign of plaques.
It's not MS.

357
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:17,229
We haven't found anything
abnormal on any test.

358
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:18,939
Except she can't see
or move her hands.

359
00:16:19,099 --> 00:16:20,181
So she says.

360
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,401
You can't lie about
flaccid paralysis.

361
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,029
Maybe she's not lying.

362
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,405
<i>Her brain is.</i>

363
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,198
What if it's
a conversion disorder?

364
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:31,280
Lacks personal boundaries...

365
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:33,644
Promiscuous...

366
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:36,541
Inappropriate obsession
with truth telling.

367
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,542
Certainly sounds
like a psych case.

368
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:41,163
Cool, I'll set up
a psych consult,

369
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:42,694
start her
on anti-depressants.

370
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:43,583
No.

371
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:47,343
Her mind is tricking
her body.

372
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,013
We need to trick
her mind.

373
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:53,655
Or even better.

374
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:58,344
You don't need her.

375
00:16:58,464 --> 00:16:59,187
I know.

376
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:00,908
Then this serves
no medical purpose.

377
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:03,442
You have a genetic defect,
choose to ignore it.

378
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:05,463
This woman has a genetic defect.

379
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,864
She chooses to butcher herself
to be safe.

380
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:10,964
Yet what you claim to be
fascinated by is her honesty.

381
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,744
Interesting.

382
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,644
You claim to want
the truth...

383
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:17,344
And then you screw with people
who actually live by it.

384
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:18,508
Pathetic.

385
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:20,334
Hey, I gave you credit
for "interesting."

386
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:25,445
You're protecting her because you're
jealous she did what you couldn't.

387
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:27,655
I need you.

388
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:30,783
I'm not lying to her.

389
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:32,888
Fine, keep your mouth shut.
I still need you.

390
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,520
<i>If it doesn't work,
you gotta hold the kid down</i>

391
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,434
until someone else finishes
lying to mom.

392
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:40,858
That does actually serve
a medical purpose.

393
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:46,987
Jane.

394
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,063
I have to lie
because she trusts me?

395
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:52,444
If you show doubt,

396
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:54,284
the placebo treatment
won't work.

397
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,949
If it's just depression,
that's good news, right?

398
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:01,105
- There are a lot of great medications.
- Then why can't we just give her those?

399
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,544
<i>Why do we have to lie
to her?</i>

400
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,837
Because we might be wrong.

401
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:07,172
And those medications take
a long time to work,

402
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,268
and since you're mom's condition
is declining...

403
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,594
There's a chance the drugs won't tell us
anything until it's too late.

404
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:15,764
My mom's not depressed.

405
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:18,434
Maybe she's hiding it from you. No.

406
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,744
- She wouldn't-
- She's doing what every good mom does.

407
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,544
Protecting her child
from bad news

408
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:25,187
that she can't
do anything about.

409
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:28,164
- My mom's never lied to me.
- If you don't know how to lie,

410
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:31,408
you don't know how to tell
when you're being lied to.

411
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:36,535
Maybe you're right.

412
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:38,746
I know-
I was lying.

413
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:41,852
I know how to lie.

414
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:45,627
I just won't do it
to my mother.

415
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,657
You like foosball?

416
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:57,764
Until the treatment of your infectious
paraparesis takes effect,

417
00:18:57,884 --> 00:18:59,563
Jane can't come back
into the room.

418
00:18:59,683 --> 00:19:01,052
I've already been
inoculated.

419
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,463
Can she have it already?

420
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,604
Don't worry, it's a very effective
treatment.

421
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:07,524
You should be feeling better
in a matter of minutes.

422
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:13,655
Don't you think Jane deserves
a few secrets?

423
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:15,863
Some personal space-

424
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:18,863
Room to, uh...
Make her own mistakes?

425
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,764
She makes plenty
of mistakes.

426
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,648
Only difference is I'm there
to help her through them.

427
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:25,972
But she's gotta know you're
looking over her shoulder.

428
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,364
- It's gotta stifle...
- I think the world would be

429
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:30,963
a better place if everybody always
acted like their mom was

430
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,674
looking over their shoulder.

431
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:46,845
- I want to go see my mom.
- She's sleeping.

432
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,167
Why don't we just double
the amount we can spend?

433
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,533
Can't afford another $25?

434
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:52,694
If we allow people $50,
people will spend $60.

435
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,321
So you can't afford
another $35.

436
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:55,954
You must really like
who you got.

437
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,347
Or really dislike.

438
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:01,263
My mom always gives
the best presents

439
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:03,366
to the teachers
I get along with the worst.

440
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,583
- No.
- No.

441
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:11,713
How do you know "no"?

442
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:13,811
I know you didn't
get house.

443
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,112
I know he didn't get house.

444
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,845
<i>You gave them all your name?</i>

445
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:22,663
Figured I could sow
some dissention

446
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:24,912
<i>and get a few ties
and sweaters.</i>

447
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:26,844
What happens
when they find out?

448
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,313
<i>It's secret santa.</i>

449
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,744
And what happens
when they find out?

450
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,544
They'll argue about what to do
with that information.

451
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:36,905
The ties are less important
than the dissention.

452
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:39,172
- We still have to buy him something.
- Not a chance.

453
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:41,782
We weren't supposed to discuss this.
We're not supposed to know.

454
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:43,982
He's not supposed to put
his name in there five times.

455
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:45,347
He wants presents.

456
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:46,248
It's sad.

457
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:47,628
It's pathetic.

458
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,477
I'm still buying him
a present.

459
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:51,664
No, you're not.

460
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:54,296
Fine!

461
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:05,421
What's wrong?

462
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:07,216
I think it's getting worse.

463
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:09,688
I can't breathe.

464
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,583
I need a nurse in here!

465
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:20,324
The lymph nodes are cutting off
her airway. We've got to intubate!

466
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:33,673
The swollen lymph nodes were
cutting off Maggie's airway.

467
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,106
We shrunk 'em with alcohol.
She's breathing on her own now.

468
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:37,925
That sucks.

469
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:40,636
4,300 saved emails,

470
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:43,096
<i>and not a single mention
of "lesbionic," "sanchez,"</i>

471
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:44,223
or "man-gina."

472
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:47,100
<i>Swollen lymph nodes means</i>
it wasn't psychological.

473
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,394
Who's that from?

474
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:50,896
Santa, obviously.

475
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:52,556
'cause you know
I worship him.

476
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:54,064
No, wait, I mean Satan.

477
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,999
I always get 'em confused.

478
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,752
What is an alpine butterfly?

479
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:01,599
And why is she learning how to do one?

480
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:03,123
We already have a full history.

481
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:05,161
- Need to waste time
- It's just a climbing knot.

482
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:07,357
But what does she use it for?
Try bondage.

483
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,909
I did once.

484
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:12,561
She just tied me down and whined about
how hard it is to be dean of medicine.

485
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,729
Gyms aren't exactly pristine. Could be a

486
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:16,581
fungal infection.
Seriously who's it from?

487
00:22:16,646 --> 00:22:18,158
No fever, no elevated white count.

488
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:20,361
That's funny.

489
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:22,290
Her friend sent her a Garfield cartoon.

490
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:24,583
That cat sure does love lasagna.

491
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:25,790
House!

492
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,022
Stop obsessing.

493
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,865
If it weren't for my obsessions,

494
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:33,469
you wouldn't know
that she has sarcoidosis.

495
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:36,942
18 months ago she sold her stairmaster.

496
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,060
<i>It was only two months old.
Now, eithershe needed the cash,</i>

497
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,780
was getting more difficult.

498
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,590
12 months ago,
she canceled a hiking trip.

499
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:48,036
<i>Now, either she just wanted
to sit home and watch Tv,</i>

500
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:49,938
<i>or walking was getting more difficult.</i>

501
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:52,334
She's been suffering joint pain
for the last two years.

502
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,891
Pull my Ribbon,
if you know what I mean.

503
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:57,857
A.c.e. Levels are too low
for sarcoidosis.

504
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,917
That's not what I meant.

505
00:23:01,726 --> 00:23:04,191
- Could just be an inactive phase.
- It's not Christmas yet.

506
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:06,314
I remembered I'm not a satanist,
i'm a druid.

507
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,896
- No lung involvement.
- Yet.

508
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:10,022
We'll need a bronchoalveolar
lavage to confirm it.

509
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,892
That's a Shame. I was gonna surprise
her with one for Christmas.

510
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,286
Wow!

511
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,622
Now,
either that cost more than 25 bucks

512
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,189
or I'm seriously starting to doubt

513
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,900
Steve jobs' business strategies.

514
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,700
Thanks!

515
00:23:29,997 --> 00:23:31,752
<i>Last round of Saline, Maggie.</i>

516
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:33,108
<i>One more big breath.</i>

517
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:36,165
We've gotta get the liquid to go all
the way into your lungs, okay?

518
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:37,682
Here we go.

519
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,541
The gift could be from a patient.

520
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,817
Who sent it to the wrong doctor?

521
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,000
House obviously
gave the present to himself.

522
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,845
They're arguing right now.

523
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:55,780
I've been looking for this all morning.

524
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,407
Did you look in the box on my desk?

525
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:58,825
<i>By the way, your mom called.</i>

526
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,194
Your dad's dead.

527
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:03,066
You left the present sitting
on your desk?

528
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:05,907
It wouldn't have been as effective
sitting in a closet in my home.

529
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,215
They gonna know from you.

530
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:09,089
No, they're gonna guess
that it was from me.

531
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:12,120
Might even be 90% sure that it was
from me, but all that means is

532
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:15,400
they're 10% sure that one of the other
guys is screwing them over.

533
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:19,039
Have you ever considered
channeling your powers to,

534
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:21,552
I don't know,
bring peace to the mid-east?

535
00:24:21,883 --> 00:24:23,002
I couldn't do that.

536
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,260
But if they ever got it,
you could screw it up?

537
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:27,507
Yeah, that's more where my powers lie.

538
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:30,378
- Gift could be from Wilson.
- It's House.

539
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:32,356
Why do you have a problem
with him speculating?

540
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:34,459
Because that's what House
wants us to do.

541
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:38,308
Lungs are pristine.
No infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.

542
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,318
Maggie, I'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?

543
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:43,918
A little harder.

544
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,376
Great.

545
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:50,468
Maggie,

546
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:51,899
Open your eyes.

547
00:24:58,108 --> 00:24:59,690
Why aren't you saying anything?

548
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:03,594
What's wrong?

549
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:07,421
Maggie tested negative for sarcoidosis.

550
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,042
But she's bleeding into her eyes now.

551
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:11,471
Have her platelets dropped?

552
00:25:11,491 --> 00:25:13,205
Plummeted.
New labs show they under 40.

553
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:15,346
She bleed out of every orifice
don't find the cause.

554
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,489
Could be splenic sequestration,
tuberculosis...

555
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:18,989
Gaucher disease, TTP.

556
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:20,975
Hemolytic uremic syndrome, sepsis.

557
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:23,608
Listing all the possible causes
is only impressive

558
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,533
if you can do it reverse-alphabetically.

559
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:28,184
We need to know why
her platelet machine is broken.

560
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,211
Go to the factory.
Do a bone marrow aspiration.

561
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:42,522
I'm your secret Santa.

562
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,456
You're not supposed to tell.

563
00:25:46,598 --> 00:25:48,000
But you got a present already.

564
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,320
Which means you have more
than one secret Santa.

565
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,637
Or somebody else wants to make me happy.

566
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:57,839
Merry Christmas.

567
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:18,577
On one hand, you should be in bed.

568
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:21,389
And on the other hand,
I told you to rest.

569
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,887
So I see your Dilemma.

570
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,037
I don't think resting is the problem.

571
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:28,300
Can strep
cause this?

572
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,232
Clap on...

573
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:32,434
Trust me, first place I went.

574
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,891
No rash on my labia.

575
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:36,463
Do you need to take a look?

576
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,428
I'm saving my money
for a red ryder BB gun.

577
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:44,745
Darker Shade of lipstick?

578
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:46,286
I'm not wearing any.

579
00:26:52,013 --> 00:26:53,614
You tell your mother what you do?

580
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:55,956
It doesn't matter. I'm curious.

581
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:59,802
I don't need to break her heart
just so I can feel righteous.

582
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,144
Do you do a Donkey show?

583
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm not curious.
It matters.

584
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,718
It's a Donkey or a Mule.

585
00:27:18,663 --> 00:27:20,206
I can never remember.

586
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:22,439
Wow...

587
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,369
That is a creepy smile.

588
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,237
I bet the Donkey's is even creepier.

589
00:27:27,977 --> 00:27:29,556
- Do I have to explain?
- Nope.

590
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,331
That's my job.

591
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:33,000
Contagious ecthyma.

592
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:37,201
Any contact can cause rashes,
flu symptoms, sore throat.

593
00:27:37,457 --> 00:27:39,541
Has there been... Contact?

594
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:45,453
Okay, antibiotic cream for you,

595
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,869
and a love glove for Francis.

596
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:49,286
You'll both be fine.

597
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:54,824
You should come see the show.

598
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,202
I think you'd like it.

599
00:27:57,713 --> 00:27:59,400
Sorry, I hate Westerns.

600
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,901
<i>So they really never lie?</i>

601
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:16,194
Doesn't seem like it.

602
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:17,290
Admirable.

603
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:19,741
- You tell Cameron everything?
- No.

604
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:21,956
<i>You think she keeps secrets?</i>

605
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,261
If I knew, they wouldn't be secrets.

606
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,740
I hope she does.

607
00:28:25,957 --> 00:28:28,996
People have a right to a little privacy,
even from the people they love.

608
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,725
You buy House a present?

609
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:37,388
Why would i?

610
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,618
To screw with me.
Then I'm gonna say yes.

611
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:42,600
Wait, stop, stop.
What's that smell?

612
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,309
The bone is smoking.

613
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:50,341
Her Bones are harder than the drill?

614
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:59,296
We ran a full-body Bones scan to find
the cause of hardening in the hip.

615
00:28:59,395 --> 00:29:00,610
No hot spots anywhere.

616
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,115
Tracer could have been inactive.

617
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,432
So I screwed up the test?

618
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,365
There are so many ways
that could happened.

619
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:07,410
Maybe it was inactive.
It didn't fully circulate.

620
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:10,700
- It circulated the camera picked up.
- Hey, hey, It's Christmas.

621
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:12,225
Why are you guys fighting?

622
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:15,650
Why do you think there are no hot spots?

623
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,100
I did not screw up.
The density's consistent.

624
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,990
It just means the density
was consistent.

625
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,333
It doesn't mean it was cold.

626
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,296
It's possible
all she has are hot spots.

627
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,750
It's consistent because her entire
skeleton is turning to stone.

628
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,817
Good for an aspiring superhero.

629
00:29:33,177 --> 00:29:35,723
Fatal for a human hoping
to make it to kwanzaa.

630
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:38,506
It's gotta be from a carbonic
anhydrase type-ii deficiency.

631
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,979
It has free will. Doesn't have
to be anything it want to be.

632
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:42,448
I meant, if it's not CA 2...

633
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:46,300
Well, none of the other causes
of osteopetrosis are treatable.

634
00:29:50,986 --> 00:29:52,414
You're right. It's gotta be.

635
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,400
We'll run her blood and hope that your
sunny optimism isn't misplaced.

636
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:06,658
They accused kutner
of screwing up a test

637
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:08,889
- because they hate him.
- You're surprised?

638
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:11,813
That's the sort of crap that happens
when you mess with people's heads.

639
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,880
One day he will screw up a test.

640
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:17,700
If they don't accuse him of that because
they like him, someone could die.

641
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,754
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere, I just know it hurts you.

642
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:30,079
<i>CA-2 deficiency's a genetic disorder</i>
<i>that scrambles proteins.</i>

643
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:33,400
If the blood test is positive,
you'll need a bone marrow transplant.

644
00:30:33,818 --> 00:30:36,808
Transplant sounds like
a euphemism for slim odds.

645
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:40,100
Slim but not none.

646
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,292
We're gonna need to test jane
for a match.

647
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,385
Don't you have donor banks?

648
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:47,541
Jane is your best bet.

649
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:49,598
The procedure's perfectly safe.
There's no risk.

650
00:30:49,628 --> 00:30:50,700
No risk!

651
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,024
- Any surgery has.
- Then don't

652
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:54,800
tell me there's no risk.

653
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:57,157
You gonna tell me
there's no pain either?

654
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,200
- The testing will hurt a little.
- I'll be fine.

655
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,148
If she doesn't do this

656
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:07,367
and you don't make it,

657
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,650
she's gonna spend the rest of her life
blaming herself.

658
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:14,512
Mom...

659
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:16,262
Please.

660
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,736
Find someone else.

661
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,900
Let someone else take the risk.

662
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,876
Donor bank turned up
a 49-year-old man in Cleveland

663
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:41,287
who's a five out of six HLA match.
First flight out of Cleveland leaves at.

664
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:43,389
Why is a 49-year-old Cleveland man

665
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:44,870
a closer match than her daughter?

666
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,885
He may not be.
Maggie didn't let us test her.

667
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:48,889
- Why not?
- Pain,

668
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,129
danger, risk of.

669
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:51,797
The only reason to give multiple reasons

670
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:54,600
is your searching for
what the person wants to hear.

671
00:31:57,863 --> 00:31:58,867
House.

672
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:09,575
You were wrong about sainted mommy.

673
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:11,500
Don't care.
You can forget the donor bank.

674
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:13,000
There's no ca-2 deficiency.

675
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:15,237
Best we can do is make her comfortable.

676
00:32:19,213 --> 00:32:20,255
Is that from taub?

677
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,209
Yes.

678
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,900
Yes, it is.

679
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,100
Merry Christmas.

680
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,145
Who's gonna tell the patient
she's dying?

681
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,313
I will.

682
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,400
And nobody leaves here until
we find out what killed her.

683
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,100
Whatever she has is fatal.

684
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:53,118
Makes no difference if it's disease
number 58 or 907.

685
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:57,463
You guys mad at me?

686
00:32:57,823 --> 00:32:59,830
Nope.
You had no choice.

687
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:02,889
Of course I had a choice.
You had no choice once I made my choice.

688
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:04,900
And now I'm choosing
not to be mad at you.

689
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,585
- Why?
- Cause it'll drive House nuts.

690
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:12,761
You think that'll make your lives
better or worse?

691
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,380
I told my mom
I don't care what she thinks.

692
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:20,078
I want you to test my marrow.

693
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,652
I can't be dying.

694
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:28,555
Sure, you can.

695
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:29,700
You're wrong.

696
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:31,759
You don't even know what I have.

697
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,414
What you have is one last Christmas
with your daughter.

698
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
One last chance to give her a present.

699
00:33:39,932 --> 00:33:40,993
The truth.

700
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:44,068
<i>It's inexpensive.</i>
Highly valued.

701
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:47,489
Never have to stand in line to return it
the day after Christmas.

702
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:48,924
What are you talking about?

703
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,789
A mother who's going to die

704
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:54,184
doesn't refuse a donor test
because it might hurt.

705
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,920
She refuses when she knows
it won't match.

706
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:01,589
Which tends to happen
when mother and daughter

707
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:03,218
aren't mother and daughter.

708
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,844
I can do DNA tests

709
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,482
if you'd rather keep lying to me.

710
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,917
I never wanted kids.

711
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,275
I love them, but with my genes.

712
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:27,955
I knew this woman.

713
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,174
A drug addict.

714
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:33,776
She got pregnant,

715
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:35,710
didn't want to have an abortion.

716
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:40,493
But she also didn't want her daughter
to ever know who her real mother was.

717
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:43,313
What she was.

718
00:34:45,388 --> 00:34:47,491
I promised never to tell.

719
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:55,235
Then a promise to an addict
is worth more than a

720
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:57,900
- promise to your daughter?
- It'd be cruel to tell her.

721
00:34:58,227 --> 00:34:59,230
Right.

722
00:34:59,317 --> 00:35:00,700
She lives a lie,

723
00:35:00,824 --> 00:35:02,232
you get to die a hypocrite.

724
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:07,714
Mom,

725
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:10,028
The doctors told me what's happening.

726
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,200
<i>It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.</i>

727
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,000
I promise you.

728
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,706
Doctors can be wrong.

729
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,413
- There's still a chance I can beat.
- Do you really believe that?

730
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,843
I do.

731
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:30,422
No, mom,

732
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,011
you're dying.

733
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:34,521
Nobody can help you.

734
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,756
It's not going to be okay.

735
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:03,788
That was cold.

736
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:04,909
Yeah.

737
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:28,922
What'd you get for Christmas?

738
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:32,243
I got a watch, a vintage lP,

739
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,361
and a second-edition Conan Doyle.

740
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,300
And if that wasn't bad enough,
my patient's dying.

741
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,137
Christmas deaths in a hospital.
There's nothing more depressing.

742
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:43,265
No one ever wants to go
in the patient's room.

743
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:45,500
Even the Candy Stripers
leave them alone.

744
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:49,298
But I saw something amazing.

745
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:52,252
Pure truth.

746
00:36:53,508 --> 00:36:55,592
She told her mother that she was dying.

747
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:57,455
Stripped her of all hope.

748
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:00,876
That sounds... Horrible.

749
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:02,590
It was like watching some

750
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:05,909
bizarre astronomical event that you know
you're never gonna see again.

751
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:09,446
You tell people the cold, hard truth
all the time. You get off on it.

752
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,305
Cause I don't care.

753
00:37:11,555 --> 00:37:12,578
She cared.

754
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:15,000
She did it anyway.

755
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,480
She did it because she cared.

756
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,389
The angels of Christmas
have finally given House

757
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,855
a present he can appreciate.

758
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,689
Well, don't ruin it.
Don't pin this on Christ got the niesem.

759
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:30,838
- Ent had to die.
- Would you take off that hat.

760
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:33,149
It's Christmas. It's a reindeer.

761
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:34,843
It's a moose on a Jew.

762
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,632
Who cares?

763
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:44,044
Things have their place. You wouldn't
hang dreidels from a Christmas tree.

764
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:45,800
You could.

765
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:48,567
Things don't care.

766
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,083
No, they don't.

767
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:00,900
Happy Solstice, House.

768
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,900
<i>God rest ye merry, gentlemen.</i>

769
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,400
<i>Let nothing you dismay</i>

770
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,689
<i>remember Christ our savior</i>

771
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,700
<i>was born on Christmas day</i>

772
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,689
<i>to save us all from Satan's power</i>

773
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:18,000
<i>when we were gone astray...</i>

774
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,341
Don't you people know holiday spirit?

775
00:38:20,437 --> 00:38:22,310
Bring me the eggnog of good cheer.

776
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,224
House,
if you have something to say, say it.

777
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:26,530
If you don't give us a chance
to get home before Santa.

778
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:27,567
Scrooge.

779
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,600
Give the patient risperidone.

780
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,755
That's an anti-psychotic.
She's dying. She's not crazy.

781
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,535
I am going to perform
a Christmas miracle.

782
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,000
<i>Tidings</i>
<i>of comfort and joy</i>

783
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,383
<i>comfort and joy... </i>

784
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:45,286
You said all the other causes
of osteopetrosis are fatal.

785
00:38:45,432 --> 00:38:47,226
Except for the one we discounted early.

786
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,640
Because it was impossible.

787
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:52,336
When a fetus forms,
it's just a mass of cells.

788
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:56,359
<i>Breast tissue covers an
extensive portion of the body.</i>

789
00:38:56,645 --> 00:38:59,558
<i>As the fetus develops,
most of this tissue recedes,</i>

790
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,200
remaining only in the fun places.

791
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,989
But sometimes extra breast tissue

792
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,654
<i>is left behind in places
where it doesn't belong.</i>

793
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,066
Risperidone does a lot of things.

794
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:14,100
One is it makes breast tissue swell,
so we can find it more easily.

795
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,552
You're telling me
I could have breast cancer...

796
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,305
Somewhere not in my breasts?
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

797
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:22,043
Taub's parents have
a winter condo in Florida,

798
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:23,553
they're still New Yorkers.

799
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:25,218
- Actually, my parents.
- Don't care.

800
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:26,800
I told a parable.

801
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:30,049
Now I'm going to raise the dead.

802
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,406
Give me that syringe.

803
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:36,100
That's gotta be a fat deposit.

804
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,889
Yes, I could be wrong.

805
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,775
<i>If I am, she's dead.</i>
So shut up.

806
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:47,290
What's that?

807
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,631
Risperidone also causes galactorrhea.

808
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,259
What's that.

809
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:55,029
Galac-galactic?

810
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:56,700
Open your mouth.

811
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:59,377
Relax, you've had it before.

812
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:00,700
I am not.

813
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:05,903
Milk?
Eww!

814
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:12,600
We'll cut out your mom's tumor
and start her on chemo.

815
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:15,634
All the rest of your symptoms
should go away.

816
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,024
I love you.

817
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,979
I know.

818
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:39,267
Have a wonderful life.
