1
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:06,521
<i>And now, coming to the line,</i>

2
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,125
<i>last year's "Rookie of the year",</i>

3
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:11,826
<i>Casey Alfonso!</i>

4
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:15,505
<i>And in lane two,
nine times national champion,</i>

5
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,872
<i>Tony Cooper!</i>

6
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:23,704
<i>Tony's got his light on in lane two.</i>

7
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,080
<i>- And now Casey's approaching the line.</i>
- How do you feel?

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,352
Great.

9
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,268
- I feel like throwing up my guts.
- You always feel like throwing up.

10
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:32,261
Come on dad,
let's get this digger on the line.

11
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,180
You're sure you don't wanna
go to law school?

12
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:36,855
- I hate lawyers!
- Yeah, so do I. Go get them baby!

13
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:41,955
<i>Okay, looks like we're ready to go.</i>

14
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,202
<i>Let's hear it folks!</i>

15
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:32,696
<i>And it's Casey Alfonso
by Less than half a car length!</i>

16
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:35,817
<i>What a spectacular finish
for the young phenom.</i>

17
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:39,019
Casey Alfonso with an amazing finish.

18
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:41,349
- What'd you do at the end there?
- Yeah, heh...

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,301
At about 250 feet,
the car got out of shape a bit.

20
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:45,771
But about halfway down...

21
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,184
I just got into the zone or something.

22
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:51,210
I pedaled it back into the groove.
It was the coolest ride of my life!

23
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:53,799
How does it feel to beat nine-time
national champion

24
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,940
Tony Cooper?

25
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:00,334
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:01,943
Can you repeat that?

27
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:03,756
<i>How does it feel,</i>

28
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:06,849
<i>to beat nine-time national champion
Tony Cooper?</i>

29
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,450
Casey!

30
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:10,889
Casey! Casey!
Out of the way!

31
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:12,067
Out of the way. Casey!

32
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:14,444
Casey! Get the ambulance!
Brian, get the ambulance!

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,810
<i>Casey...</i>

35
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:27,224
Season 4 - Episode 6
"Whatever It Takes"

36
00:02:49,116 --> 00:02:52,301
- 68-year-old male, non-smoker.
- 68's a good run.

37
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,819
That'll leave something
in the lockbox for the rest of us.

38
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:56,893
- Next!
- That's your breakfast?

39
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,828
Technically, it's Wilson's Lunch.

40
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:01,184
20-month-old baby,
Persistent rash, fever.

41
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,978
- Too much crying.
- Female college student?

42
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:03,973
Too much drama.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,886
You don't care about the crying
or the drama.

44
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:07,339
Cause you won't see the patient.

45
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:10,086
And you'd treat methuselah
if his snot had an interesting color.

46
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,782
It means you've already decided
which case you wanna take next.

47
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:15,769
- Tell me about speed racer.
- Female,

48
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:18,859
seizure with visual
and auditory processing deficiency.

49
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:21,351
- I did a consult and...
- What kind of race car?

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Dragster.

51
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,497
Continue.

52
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:28,059
You're gonna take a case based
on the car she drives?

53
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:31,094
Nothing says "thanks for saving my life"
like a test drive in a car,

54
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,084
that accelerates faster
than the space shuttle.

55
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,141
Can't save her life,
cause she's not dying.

56
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:37,388
Her lab shows signs of dehydration.

57
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:39,647
That means the problem's just likely...
Heatstroke.

58
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,691
Kinda hard to get heat-struck
in 4 1/2 seconds.

59
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,985
Not when you're wearing
a three-layer fireproof suit.

60
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,545
Excuse me.

61
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,729
Dr. House?

62
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:56,242
No, lazy ass called in sick again.
We can give him a message.

63
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:01,219
May we talk in private?

64
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,640
So... Either it's Heatstroke,

65
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,500
in which case we take the afternoon off,

66
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:17,729
or it's one of the diagnoses

67
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,647
that you guys are gonna have for me
in two minutes.

68
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:22,835
- You're in charge.
- I know.

69
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:30,689
- Cop?
- He's not packing.

70
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,526
Your dad's either a cop or
a security guard.

71
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:36,454
Or she carries a weapon.

72
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:40,300
You're with the CIA?

73
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,209
One of our employees just returned
from an assignment sick.

74
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:47,187
We believe he may be the victim
of an assassination attempt.

75
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:52,664
Sure.

76
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,224
You wanna close the door?

77
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:55,154
Door?

78
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,935
I assume you're gonna drop trou
at some point during the dance.

79
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,258
- I don't see why I should share.
- This isn't a joke.

80
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,535
If you're willing to help us,
we need to leave now.

81
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,530
If I have to walk somewhere,

82
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,732
there better be at least
five girls involved.

83
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,910
And they better be working
their way through college.

84
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,678
Okay, what do you got?

85
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:14,971
Hereditary brain disorder,

86
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:17,503
transient ischemia,
or paraneoplastic syndrome.

87
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:20,195
None of those go away with IV fluids.
It's heatstroke.

88
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:23,103
- Or cushing's or calcium deficiency.
- Who's your friend?

89
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:26,025
We use the term "life partner."
Get a fresh history,

90
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,184
neurological exam,
and an MRI of her head.

91
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,685
15 minutes for the lap dance.

92
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:32,954
A half hour to scrub
the guilt off my soul.

93
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,771
See you in 45.

94
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:41,293
- Dr. House... We need to hurry.
- Yeah, we need to hurry.

95
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:43,892
Little advice, I mean, obviously

96
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,461
the village people played
out the whole cop thing.

97
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:48,535
But, come on, CIA?

98
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,709
Do you seriously
expect anyone to believe that?

99
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:01,603
It helps when you have props.

100
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:08,817
Keep your eye on my pen.

101
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:11,862
Very good.

102
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:14,468
Any nausea or vomiting
before the seizure?

103
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:15,796
No.

104
00:06:16,553 --> 00:06:18,951
My Dad had some,
but he's always like that before a race.

105
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,503
It could have been food poisoning.
Two eat breakfast to gether?

106
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,654
- No.
- Any history of sciatica or

107
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,662
spinal injury?

108
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:25,890
No.

109
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:28,261
Abnormal deep tendon reflex.

110
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:30,496
Really?
Let me see.

111
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,481
It's there.

112
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,716
I didn't say it wasn't there.
I said it was abnormal.

113
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:41,804
We're gonna give you
an MRI to be sure, but

114
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,359
I'm guessing your symptoms were caused

115
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:46,086
- by just dehydration and the heat.
- You're guessing?

116
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,086
Look,

117
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:51,253
I make a living
driving 300 miles an hour,

118
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:54,906
which makes the ability
to stay conscious kind of important.

119
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,781
I'm sure it's just heatstroke.

120
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,946
But we're gonna do an MRI
to be extra careful.

121
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,679
You said you left your cell
in your office.

122
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:13,927
I lied.

123
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,471
I wasn't going to take it,

124
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,485
just tell you to turn it off
for takeoff.

125
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,509
I know.

126
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,747
Just wanted to see if you could tell
that I was lying.

127
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:23,954
Useful information.

128
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,789
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

129
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,441
I'm on a top-secret mission for the CIA.

130
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:30,335
Right.

131
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,307
There was nothing on your racecar
driver's CT,

132
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,051
and the history and physical
were normal.

133
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,673
Her deep tendon reflexes seemed
a bit weak to me.

134
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,789
<i>Areflexia could mean miller fisher.</i>

135
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:41,088
<i>Yes, are flexia could
Mean miller fisher,</i>

136
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:43,384
but since the reflex was weak,
not absent,

137
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,641
it doesn't mean anything.

138
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:47,301
I'm releasing her.
You can go back to your poker game.

139
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:48,425
Poker's illegal.

140
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:50,562
<i>CIA would never allow illegal activity.</i>

141
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,986
<i>Have you considered Miller Fisher?</i>

142
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,091
Why? What happened?

143
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,079
She just had another seizure.

144
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,479
And now she's getting
a vertical nystagmus.

145
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,567
We think it's Miller Fisher,
an inflammatory process.

146
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:15,173
In rare cases,
it can cause respiratory failure, but...

147
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,835
Wait, she could stop breathing?

148
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:19,464
You said there was nothing wrong.
You said you were sure.

149
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:22,374
You just had another seizure.
Clearly, there's something wrong.

150
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:24,923
So why should I trust you
to figure out what it is?

151
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,614
Where's Dr. House?
I'm at this hospital.

152
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:29,849
It's gonna be all right.

153
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:31,857
We just need to start
the plasmapheresis.

154
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:32,813
No!

155
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,659
It's not going to be all right,

156
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,846
because you obviously don't have a clue.

157
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,907
What you're doing.

158
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:40,246
I'm not letting you touch me.

159
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,879
- Honey, come on.
- I wanna see House!

160
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:44,328
Where is he?

161
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:57,388
Looks a lot better on 24.

162
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:07,359
I take that back.

163
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:10,892
Dr. Samira Terzi.

164
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,992
It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. House.

165
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,484
We really appreciate the consult
on such short notice.

166
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,709
There's nothing that gives me more
pleasure than helping out a colleague.

167
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:21,562
This is Dr. Sidney Curtis
from the Mayo Clinic.

168
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,854
He's also agreed to help
with the diagnosis.

169
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:26,905
- Dr. House.
- Curtis on Immunology Sidney Curtis?

170
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,961
- You've read it?
- Nope!

171
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,700
But it is keeping my piano level.

172
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:35,612
So...

173
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,226
Where is the poor, sick fella?

174
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:41,674
- What do we do?
- I don't know yet.

175
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,829
- She needs treatment.
- This is a test, right?

176
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,725
You're reporting back to him
everything we do.

177
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,640
Yeah.

178
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:48,500
And I asked the patient
to be uncooperative.

179
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,286
- Personally, I think she overplayed it.
- She's being uncooperative.

180
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:52,978
Because you made us all
look like idiots.

181
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,288
We're only gonna look like idiots

182
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,062
If we can't figure out how to get her
to agree to the treatment.

183
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:58,592
What would House do right now?

184
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:01,812
Pop a pill, insult us,
and trick the patient.

185
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,497
We can do that last part.

186
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,458
She's never met House before, has she?

187
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,811
- Who's got a cane?
- House isn't here.

188
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:10,317
We're not gonna act like him.

189
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:20,943
What do you want?

190
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:22,872
I...

191
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,946
I'm gonna do what doctors
aren't supposed to do.

192
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,380
Admit I made a mistake.

193
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,389
I shouldn't have been so quick
to dismiss your symptoms.

194
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,494
But you need to let us start
the plasmapheresis.

195
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:37,855
What do you want?

196
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:41,273
Case?

197
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,179
Honey, do you know where you are?

198
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:46,934
She's burning up.

199
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,438
- Start the treatment.
- We can't.

200
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:50,518
You've got my permission.
She's obviously confused.

201
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,791
It doesn't matter anymore.

202
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:53,925
Miller Fsher doesn't cause dlirium
and fever.

203
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:56,719
I don't know what this is.

204
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:00,391
I'm afraid there are going to be ome
limitations on his medical history.

205
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:03,116
Just let me know what you need,
and I should be able to provide it.

206
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:05,208
FYI, my mal practice insurance

207
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:06,843
doesn't cover alien autopsies.

208
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:08,047
That's fine.

209
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:09,735
X-files are the next wing over.

210
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:11,730
Where was the patient
when he first felt ill?

211
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:14,345
Sorry, that's classified. But assume
there aren't too many places

212
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,966
in the world John hasn't been.
And, yes, John's a cover name.

213
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:19,123
What makes you think
it was an attempt on his life?

214
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,494
Sorry, can't tell you that either.

215
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,783
What can you tell us?

216
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,527
Yeah, did Oswald really have sex
with Marilyn Monroe?

217
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:46,604
Good lord.

218
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:49,056
Very professional.

219
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:52,008
Five days ago, he was 185 pounds.

220
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:53,545
Perfect health.

221
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,865
Cool.

222
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:03,967
Fever and delirium rule out...

223
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:08,891
He's not gonna hire you
just because you call him the most.

224
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:11,663
Especially since it's obvious
he doesn't wanna be called.

225
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:14,842
Symptoms rule out miller fisher.
MS fits better.

226
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:16,860
Progression's too fast.
More likely meningitis.

227
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,523
Areflexia doesn't fit as well with.

228
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,680
Does with amyloidosis.

229
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,743
That's even slower than MS.
It's lupus.

230
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,419
I'm with the little man on this one.

231
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,295
It's attacking the body and the brain.
Classic autoimmune.

232
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,522
Flirt all you want,
but I should warn you.

233
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,517
Shiksas are for practice.

234
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:33,247
Lupus this aggressive
wouldn't spare her kidneys.

235
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:34,767
It's primarily neurological.

236
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:37,210
- Let's start her on.
- Why no plaques on her MRI?

237
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:38,681
MRI was inconclusive.

238
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,065
- So I don't know.
- So now you're sure that it's MS.

239
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:43,396
Just like you were sure
it was miller fisher.

240
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:45,386
An hour after you were sure
it was heatstroke.

241
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,145
The symptoms fit.

242
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,658
- Start her on interferon.
- We're not gonna score any points

243
00:12:49,673 --> 00:12:51,965
with House if we solve
this just by running your errands.

244
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,886
- I get that you want to be right.
- You don't?

245
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:56,567
I'm just trying to save a patient,
not score points with my boss.

246
00:12:56,585 --> 00:12:59,156
Would it hurt the patient
if you let us run some tests?

247
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:04,602
You've got three hours.

248
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,679
We've run six complete tox screens,

249
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:17,110
tested for every heavy metal, poison,
and biological agent we can think of.

250
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,974
It says here he ate a lot of chestnuts.

251
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:21,165
Hold on a second.

252
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,727
If the squirrel liberation
army's involved,

253
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:25,733
I'm outta here.
Those little rodents are.

254
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:28,320
Horse chestnuts are poisonous.
If someone switched them.

255
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:29,938
Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts,

256
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,354
but they taste like a horse's
lower-than-chestnuts.

257
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,319
Which makes the theory

258
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:36,173
that he accidentally ate a couple
of hundred slightly less persuasive.

259
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,116
And seeing as how he was prowling

260
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:42,473
the back alleys of... Tehran?

261
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,863
It wasn't tehran. It was...

262
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,554
Oops, you almost got me.

263
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,952
Unless we know
the local environmental factors,

264
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,260
- poisonous flora...
- You know I can't tell you that.

265
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,742
Well, then, why are we here?
You might as well just Google "poison."

266
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,466
All they would tell me is...

267
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:00,853
He spent the last 11 months in Bolivia.

268
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,381
Who you gonna kill in Bolivia?

269
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,821
- My old housekeeper?
- We don't kill people.

270
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,860
I'm sorry.
Who are you gonna marginalize?

271
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,440
If it is my housekeeper,
she has it coming.

272
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,848
Cleaning the windows
means cleaning both sides.

273
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:14,072
Am I right, or am I right?

274
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:16,344
What does it matter what he was doing?

275
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,102
- The guy's dying.
- Not anymore.

276
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:20,609
I know what's poisoning him, and who.

277
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:21,832
John.

278
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:25,901
It's just pancreatitis.

279
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,399
He's not an alcoholic.

280
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,605
And unless his pancreas
is in his fingers.

281
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,630
Spies can't get fungal infections?

282
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:32,893
And the burns on his skin?

283
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,484
Spies can't get sunburns?

284
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:35,898
Bolivia doesn't have sun?

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,500
So, either we go

286
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:40,261
with his theory
of the non-drinking drunk,

287
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,533
Or he was poisoned by some group

288
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:45,458
with the resources
to make it completely untraceable.

289
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,625
Some customized isotope.

290
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,626
Let's treat for radiation poisoning.

291
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:58,619
The iodine's to protect your thyroid.

292
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,025
Antibiotics are to handle infections.

293
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,250
Should start working
in a couple of hours.

294
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:05,702
We should celebrate,

295
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:06,939
with a beer,

296
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:08,092
or eight.

297
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,051
I don't drink.

298
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,906
Me thinks he doth protest too much.

299
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:15,980
He's deathly ill.
Why would he lie about drinking?

300
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:19,657
Guilt over killing a man.
Make anyone hit the sauce.

301
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:23,575
- We don't kill people.
- Right.

302
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:25,895
You just lie to your friends and family,

303
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,105
establish false identities, trick people
into betraying their country.

304
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:31,312
He'd never cover up his drinking.
He's too honest.

305
00:15:33,718 --> 00:15:35,256
Something I've always wanted to know.

306
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,697
That poison lipstick that ginger
used to kiss Gilligan...

307
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,061
Why didn't that kill her?

308
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:51,481
Okay, drum roll.
LP is negative for meningitis.

309
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,646
Sorry, Cole.

310
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:56,254
Fat pad biopsy is...

311
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:58,374
Wait for it...

312
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:03,312
Negative for amyloidosis.
And thirteen goes down.

313
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,884
Could we hurry this up? My son has.

314
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:06,678
Can I have a kid too?
I'm working too hard.

315
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:07,725
I could hook you up.

316
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,527
I had two minutes and some anti-nausea
meds, I'd take you up on that.

317
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:13,266
And for the gold...

318
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:17,898
Protein 65, glucose 70.

319
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:19,977
It's MS, start her on interferon.

320
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:23,199
Turn to the last page.
Sed rate's 95 ANA's weakly positive.

321
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:24,324
Positive? It's lupus.

322
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,112
Weakly. Not lupus, it's MS.

323
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,241
We obviously don't know what it is.
Treat for both.

324
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,084
No.
I gave in on the test.

325
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,472
I'm not treating her for two completely
separate diseases

326
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,664
because you think lupus
will win you a prize.

327
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:42,547
Still think it's lupus?

328
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,432
Yeah.

329
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:44,615
Me to.

330
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:46,612
In case of emergency,

331
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,400
go to the emergency room.

332
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,409
- Could be lupus.
- That's what we figured.

333
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,142
Then why are you here?

334
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:56,143
You're an immunologist.
We wanted to confirm.

335
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,396
Who are you looking for me

336
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:59,341
to help you sell down the river?
House or Cuddy?

337
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,321
Foreman.

338
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,322
Sorry.

339
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:04,646
He's pushing MS.
Thinks that because he's in charge,

340
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:06,807
he has to prove he's the smartest guy
in the room.

341
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:09,578
All I've heard about you. You put
the patient above everything else.

342
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:11,391
That's why everyone
finds you so annoying.

343
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,960
All House cares about is results.

344
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,351
I know. I'm talking about how
to do deal with Foreman.

345
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:19,756
So am I.

346
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:26,125
- Fever's down to 101.5.
- Treatment's working...

347
00:17:26,183 --> 00:17:28,071
Trying to figure out
which treatment's working.

348
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,074
It's kind of tacky doing
it front of the patient.

349
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,709
You put her on steroids too?

350
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:33,990
We had no choice.
The sed rate pointed to lupus.

351
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:35,953
- And the a NA ruled it out!
- Doctors!

352
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:39,785
Legs hurt?

353
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:43,384
I can't feel them at all.
I don't think i can move them.

354
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,079
Vitals stabilizing.

355
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,915
- Tummy ache's gone as well.
- So the treatment's working.

356
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,642
Wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy and...

357
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:12,678
hop in the company jet?
Little trip down mexico way.

358
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:15,721
And I'm not talking about
the country or the plane.

359
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,804
Do you think acting like an idiot
and talking about sex works on girls?

360
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:23,441
Well, if it didn't, the human race
would have died out long ago.

361
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:26,299
You're pretty cheery for someone who was
just proved wrong about his

362
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,793
- pancreatitis theory.
- I'm appropriately cheery for someone

363
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,738
- who's being proved right.
- John hasn't vomited in six hours.

364
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:34,216
What's to vomit?
I'm eating his lunch.

365
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:37,509
With holding nutrients
is the treatment for pancreatitis.

366
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,739
That and the antibiotics you put him on.

367
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:42,072
I did unhook your iodine, though.

368
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:43,790
Didn't seem to fit with the whole,

369
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,618
I'm just jerking you guys
around gestalt.

370
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:46,841
You're unbelievable.

371
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:50,336
Well, let's ask John if he'd rather
be sick honestly or cured dishonestly.

372
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:51,300
John.

373
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:53,770
John.

374
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,210
Any chance he's just...

375
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:05,979
Overwhelmed with gratitude?

376
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:20,247
Paralysis.

377
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,833
It's a new symptom?

378
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:27,967
Big white space on the board
where it would fit?

379
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:29,389
Nice, multicolored markers?

380
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,452
I'm not writing it because we can't know
if it's a real symptom.

381
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,182
When these two went rogue and
pumped her full of ste...

382
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,790
- Steroids don't cause paralysis.
- She was also on interferon!

383
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:41,352
Giving her both probably fried
her immune system.

384
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:43,176
Who knows what infection
you could cause...

385
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:44,682
We consulted an immunologist.

386
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,179
- She said we have...
- She?

387
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:47,665
You talking about Dr. Cameron?

388
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,975
- She thought lupus...
- She tell you to start treating?

389
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:51,816
Yes, they've ignored you.
They screwed up.

390
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:55,168
And it's fun watching you spank them.
But can we get back to the medicine?

391
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,360
The last thing any of you give
a damn about is the medicine!

392
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:01,860
Look...

393
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:05,943
I'm not saying
you're bad doctors or bad people.

394
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:07,577
But House is.

395
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:10,392
He created a nasty
little cutthroat world,

396
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,754
planted you in it,
and is watching you play.

397
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,971
And none of it works for anyone
except him.

398
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,297
And whoever wins.

399
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:25,304
Given its quick progression,
we gotta assume botulism.

400
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:27,724
I'll go to her place,
check out her fridge and pantry.

401
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,938
It's not botulism. It's polio.

402
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,553
Brilliant.

403
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,488
We should search her home
for FDR's remains or a time machine.

404
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:40,334
She could have contracted it from anyone

405
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:42,594
- who's been to Africa or...
- She's been vaccinated.

406
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,670
Vaccines wear off.

407
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,801
There hasn't been a single american case
in over 20 years.

408
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:48,378
I've seen this disease.

409
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,726
I know what it looks like.

410
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:52,257
That's why you're finding it,
because you're looking for it.

411
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:53,961
Polio... It's crazy.

412
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:55,421
House wouldn't think so.

413
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:57,703
So go find House
and tell him your theory.

414
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:58,892
Take a personal day.

415
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:00,441
Seriously.

416
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,097
Get outta here.

417
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:05,608
- You don't have the power to fire me.
- But I do have the power

418
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:07,489
to kick your ass off my case.

419
00:21:10,718 --> 00:21:14,038
We're starting the botulism treatment.
The rest of you, look for confirmation.

420
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:26,078
- He should be brought up on charges.
- Okay, relax.

421
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:28,183
I'll take your book out
from under my piano.

422
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:30,910
He's dying of radiation sickness.
He's obviously in pain.

423
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,168
All of which could have been avoided
if you hadn't interfered with...

424
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,922
What was that for?!

425
00:21:36,352 --> 00:21:39,645
Radiation sickness kills specific cells
at specific times.

426
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:42,902
His hair should be coming out in clumps
before he's writhing in pain.

427
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:44,012
Since it's not,

428
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:46,130
I know who's trying to kill him.

429
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:47,713
God.

430
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:50,181
It's blood cancer. Waldenstrom's.

431
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,619
Radiation can cause infections,
which set off...

432
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:57,434
If had any real evidence of foul play,
you'd be torturing Bolivians

433
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:01,124
instead of putting me into a state
of anticipatory sexual arousal.

434
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:03,805
- Can we treat for both?
- Bad idea.

435
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:06,574
Unless you're the one
who's trying to poison him.

436
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,205
I'll arrange
for plasmapheresis and chemo.

437
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:11,637
Are you gonna trust him
after what he did?

438
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:13,886
I don't have to trust him
to agree with him.

439
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,244
You make a good point.

440
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:24,263
I've been wrong every time,
and she still won't listen to you.

441
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:27,988
So either she really likes me
or she really hates you.

442
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,758
And I got a ride in the jet.

443
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:38,087
Hi.

444
00:22:38,147 --> 00:22:40,348
- What are you doing here?
- Just came to say hi.

445
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,441
Hi again.

446
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,564
Where's... Mrs. Bearman?

447
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,626
Sent her home.

448
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,457
I was scheduling her for an MRA.

449
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:48,708
If we gave MRAS to every patient
with a headache...

450
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,107
This wasn't just a headache,
it was the worst in her life.

451
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:54,335
Then lucky for you, I'm a neurologist.
She went to a wine and cheese tasting.

452
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,099
- Both triggers for migraines.
- She's never had a migraine before.

453
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:59,515
And I never hagel
before the first time I had one.

454
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:02,810
Bagels don't kill people.
This is a classic ticking-bomb aneurysm.

455
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:05,610
This taught me a lesson.

456
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,487
I guess when I mess
with other people's patients,

457
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:10,766
I risk looking like an officious bitch.

458
00:23:14,556 --> 00:23:16,852
We're gonna have to track down
Mrs. Bearman.

459
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:21,281
Wait...

460
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,494
Never mind.

461
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:27,976
- That's funny.
- It's not funny. It's totally immature.

462
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,074
It is funny.

463
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,329
You just can't appreciate it
because you're the victim.

464
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:33,934
Yeah, I deserve shame and ridicule
for offering a consult.

465
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,542
Unheard of for a doctor.

466
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:37,684
You didn't offer a medical consult.

467
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:40,030
You offered a
"dealing with Foreman" consult.

468
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,912
For the good of the patient.
It's what House would have done.

469
00:23:43,366 --> 00:23:46,120
Maybe House will hear about it
and tear up with pride.

470
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,184
You think I'm trying to impress him.

471
00:23:48,244 --> 00:23:50,997
I think that, for someone
who's not involved in his team,

472
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:53,154
you're remarkably involved in his team.

473
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,705
Let it go.

474
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:56,808
Let him go.

475
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:02,606
And that's mature?

476
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:11,907
120 over 80.

477
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:13,295
Let 'er rip.

478
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:19,174
Now we got the medical stuff
out of the way.

479
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,350
Why don't we meet back at your place

480
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:23,555
for some enhanced
interrogation techniques?

481
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,760
My safe word is,
"help, please, please stop."

482
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:29,883
It's two pleases.
Anything less than that, you keep going.

483
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:33,162
You actually cure this guy,
I'll show you my private water board.

484
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:38,515
We need to consult an oncologist
about the chemo.

485
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:42,851
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought...

486
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:46,941
You were still euphemizing.
My valet knows a little oncology.

487
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:54,032
I was wondering when you'd grow bored
of avoiding my calls.

488
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:56,831
Oh, I can never grow bored
of ignoring you.

489
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:59,124
What's the latest protocol
on Waldenstrom's?

490
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,879
- Where are you?
- CIA headquarters.

491
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,234
How much fludarabine...

492
00:25:03,277 --> 00:25:05,886
Either you're sprawled naked
on your floor with an empty bottle

493
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:08,214
of vicodin, or collapsed naked
in front of your computer

494
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:09,580
with an empty bottle of viagra.

495
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:12,012
Please tell me which,
because Chase has another pool going.

496
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:14,109
They flew me in to help deal
with a sick employee.

497
00:25:14,187 --> 00:25:16,194
- How much...
- Hallucinations. Damn! I shouldn't

498
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:19,186
- have bet on the viagra.
- Okay, call the langley switchboard,

499
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,396
- ask for extension...
- 3578

500
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:22,584
3578.

501
00:25:22,972 --> 00:25:25,982
He asked an awful lot
of questions for a valet.

502
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:30,148
You know, I happen to have
a position available on my penis.

503
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,200
Wait a second...
I think I screwed up that joke.

504
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,168
You offering me a job?

505
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:40,043
I'd settle for that.

506
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:43,715
As tempting as a position
on your staff is,

507
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,690
- I like it here.
- Pays better.

508
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,620
And we've only had one
assassination attempt.

509
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,936
And I'm sure you're a great boss.
That's why your fellows left en masse

510
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:52,286
a couple of months ago.

511
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,403
I have satellite images.

512
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:04,850
Inspector Gadget.

513
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,400
My God.
You're actually at the CIA.

514
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:09,849
You've gotta get down here.

515
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:12,320
They've got a satellite aimed
directly into Cuddy's vagina.

516
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:15,406
I told them the chances
of invasion are slim to none, but...

517
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:17,247
Waldenstrom's.

518
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,630
Recommended dose is
25 milligrams per meter squared.

519
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,331
- They do a background check on you?
- 25 milligrams?

520
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:27,001
They did a background check on you,
they did a background check

521
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:28,217
<i>- on your friends.
- Relax.</i>

522
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:31,274
I'm sure they already know that you
brought heroin back from Afghanistan.

523
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:34,702
<i>That... That's not true.
I've never been to Afghanistan.</i>

524
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:36,741
House?

525
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:43,228
- She's getting worse?
- Fever's risen slightly.

526
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:48,932
But it's definitely...

527
00:26:49,802 --> 00:26:50,691
Botulism?

528
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,358
Right?
Because if you're wrong again,

529
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,078
and you're treating her for something
she doesn't even have...

530
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,650
The antitoxin hasn't had time
to work yet.

531
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:01,215
I know it's hard, but try to be patient.

532
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:05,520
Excuse me.

533
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:15,274
I know you're pissed I interrupted,

534
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,342
but you're gonna be
even more pissed in a second.

535
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,754
You tested her without telling me?

536
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:21,752
Yeah. And I know,
I'm really, really sorry. But...

537
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,766
On the other hand, it's a positive.

538
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,829
She has polio.

539
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:34,237
Now what, boss?

540
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:38,660
Where's House?

541
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,986
He's blown off four hours of clinic.

542
00:27:44,853 --> 00:27:47,083
He's consulting for the CIA.

543
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,491
Seriously.
Call langley and ask for extension 35...

544
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:54,270
3536?

545
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:58,378
There's definitely two threes.
I... I wrote it down.

546
00:27:58,433 --> 00:27:59,496
I have it somewhere.

547
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:02,405
He's gonna make up twice
his skipped hours in the clinic.

548
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:05,338
- Okeydoke.
- And for protecting him,

549
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:07,911
- you're gonna make up twice that.
- Why are you punishing me

550
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,942
- worse than him?
- Because House never learns.

551
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,040
You might.

552
00:28:21,722 --> 00:28:22,996
How are you feeling?

553
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:27,653
- Like crap.
- Yeah, cancer can be that way.

554
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,960
My hair is falling out.

555
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:36,627
That the chemo?

556
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:39,644
No, it's too quick.

557
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,564
So what does it mean?

558
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:49,585
It means you don't have cancer.

559
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:53,761
Someone actually did try to kill you.

560
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,189
You're stubborn.

561
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:05,521
- You're arrogant!
- There's no need to yell.

562
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:09,072
- You may have cost that man his life.
- He's getting the radiation treatment.

563
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,502
24 hours too late!

564
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:12,677
I didn't yell at you
when I thought you were wrong.

565
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,484
- I wasn't wrong!
- This isn't productive.

566
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:18,371
There is no productive. It's too late.

567
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:21,363
Because of your inexperience,
your poor judgment.

568
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:24,615
And your failure to recognize
a reckless fool!

569
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:28,545
Cordyceps sinensis.

570
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:37,421
It's... It's an herbal treatment
derived from a parasitic fungus,

571
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:39,473
comes from caterpillars.

572
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:43,007
Along with dimercaprol chelation,
it's been shown to mitigate

573
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,526
bone marrow damage
from radiation poisoning.

574
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,047
In monkeys.

575
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,042
I'm sorry.
I was stubborn and arrogant.

576
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,085
Self-recriminations won't help her.

577
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,158
Nothing's gonna help her.
She's got polio.

578
00:29:59,237 --> 00:30:00,949
There's no cure,
but there are treatments.

579
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,115
- She's dying.
- Yeah. Every death's a tragedy.

580
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:05,833
Funny how you weren't so depressed

581
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:08,092
when she just dying because
me and Amber screwed up.

582
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,387
And I'm also self-centered.
Thanks for clarifying.

583
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,260
Don't forget self-pitying.

584
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:15,644
Vitamin C.

585
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:17,105
Extremely high doses.

586
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,830
It was experimental treatment
protocol in the '50s.

587
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,801
- And they haven't finished yet?
- They... Lost funding.

588
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:25,863
That's because there's no logical reason
vitamin C would cure polio.

589
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,595
- Well, someone thought there was.
- Someone thought black people

590
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:29,936
made excellent farm implements.

591
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:31,583
I'm not talking about hurting anyone.

592
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,590
I just wanna force feed her
some orange juice.

593
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:36,260
You wanna throw in
some bacon and eggs as well?

594
00:30:37,221 --> 00:30:39,082
If there's anything you learn today,

595
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,712
it's gotta be that you can be wrong.

596
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:53,218
John, can you hear me?

597
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:58,252
We're going to start you
on an experimental treatment.

598
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:02,278
Tea?

599
00:31:03,553 --> 00:31:04,947
It's a chinese herb.

600
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:07,946
- Which has been effective in...
- I'm dying, aren't I?

601
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:11,917
Probably.

602
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:22,844
We're gonna attempt
an experimental protocol.

603
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:25,599
- A new drug?
- An old one. Vitamine C.

604
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:29,024
Ultra-high doses have been shown
to destroy the polio virus

605
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:30,396
and heal nerve damage.

606
00:31:30,952 --> 00:31:33,804
- She could regain use of her legs.
- It's unlikely.

607
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:36,938
But, we're gonna try.

608
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:39,695
Don't give up.

609
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:56,252
Nausea's...

610
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,209
Not as bad.

611
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:01,730
Radiation sickness has a latency period.

612
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:05,157
You'll get better before you get worse.

613
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:15,142
You wanna know
what I really did down there?

614
00:32:17,192 --> 00:32:18,732
Only if it's interesting.

615
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,098
The women there...

616
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,315
During carnival they...

617
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:29,426
They do this dance.

618
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:33,163
They call it the "Devil Dance".

619
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:36,779
Not interesting.

620
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:42,532
I spent all 40 days with this...

621
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:46,878
Attache to the minister of defense.

622
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:49,840
The most...

623
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,344
Buttoned-down woman you'd ever meet.

624
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:54,542
You know?

625
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:59,021
'Cept when she did this dance.

626
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:05,814
She agreed to tell me stuff...

627
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:17,073
Okay, we have half a good story there.

628
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:20,386
Karma.

629
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:27,512
Best way to rid yourself of that guilt
is to confess your sins.

630
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:31,580
This pain is... Right.

631
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,102
It's comforting.

632
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:38,468
It makes me think that...
Somehow, it all makes sense.

633
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:41,396
What do you mean, 40 days?

634
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,035
When they found out.

635
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:47,214
What she...

636
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,006
Told me.

637
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,158
Carnival in Bolivia's only eight days.

638
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:59,665
You have any idea
what a chestnut looks like?

639
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,372
You idiot.

640
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:08,710
Who are you calling an idiot?

641
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:13,252
Whoever knew that John
was stationed in Brazil, not Bolivia.

642
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:14,884
Brazil?

643
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:17,976
Well, then, I guess
I'm talking to you, idiot.

644
00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:19,198
It's the same region.

645
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:23,205
- It's the same parasite, same diseases.
- But not the same language.

646
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,156
In Bolivia, chestnuts are chestnuts.

647
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:28,095
Brazil, on the other hand,
hascastanhas do para, literally,

648
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:29,694
"chestnuts from para."

649
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:32,053
Because it would be stupid
for people from Brazil

650
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:33,699
to call them Brazil nuts!

651
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:36,369
So he ate Brazil nuts. Big deal.

652
00:34:36,503 --> 00:34:38,235
No, he ate a lot of Brazil nuts.

653
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:40,455
Which is a big deal,
because they contain selenium.

654
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:44,183
Which, in high doses, causes fatigue,
vomiting, skin irritation,

655
00:34:44,258 --> 00:34:47,185
discharge from the fingernail beds,
and hair loss.

656
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:49,090
Any of that sounding familiar?

657
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:52,752
Can you treat it?

658
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:56,344
We've already started.

659
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,118
Treatment's chelation,
same as for radiation sickness.

660
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:02,025
The only difference is it works
a lot better on nut poisoning.

661
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,577
So what's the problem?

662
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:06,604
You're an idiot.

663
00:35:21,062 --> 00:35:22,327
Why is she shivering?

664
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,960
Low serum calcium is
a side effect of the treatment.

665
00:35:25,113 --> 00:35:28,166
- I can give her a calcium supplement.
- My arm hurts.

666
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:30,960
Infusion rate has to remain high
for the treatment to work.

667
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,873
Is it working?

668
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:36,785
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

669
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:38,427
It hurts.

670
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:40,986
It's working.

671
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,745
This is fantastic.

672
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:53,306
There's a lot you can learn
in my fellowship.

673
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:56,040
A few new procedures I could teach you.

674
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,299
Course, we'd need a nurse to prep.

675
00:35:58,337 --> 00:36:00,863
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.

676
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:04,780
Actually, I was just trying to make
another euphemism for sex.

677
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:06,919
- So was I.
- Oh, God.

678
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:09,304
How can you flirt with this idiot?

679
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:13,364
He lied to us again and again.
He broke laws, ethical codes...

680
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:14,494
I was right.

681
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:19,134
- That doesn't mean everything.
- It means a lot.

682
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:22,231
Dr. Curtis.

683
00:36:23,353 --> 00:36:24,353
Dr. House.

684
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:26,651
Appreciate your help.

685
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:56,289
When...

686
00:36:57,094 --> 00:36:58,308
When you were dying,

687
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:00,411
you tried to infect me.

688
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:02,493
Because you knew I'd fight for you

689
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,282
if I thought I was dying too.

690
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:07,689
You bringing this up now so I'll
forgive you for messing with my patient?

691
00:37:07,774 --> 00:37:10,097
I'm happy I changed jobs.

692
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:12,445
But I know...

693
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,186
I'll never have that sort of...

694
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:17,359
Excitement.

695
00:37:17,398 --> 00:37:19,677
- You Miss people trying to kill you?
- No.

696
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,057
I miss...

697
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:25,054
People doing whatever it takes
to get the job done.

698
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:32,484
I guess that's why
I'm having trouble giving it up.

699
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:37,777
I shouldn't have helped them
mess with your patient.

700
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:40,599
They had to screw with me.

701
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,494
I've gotten everything wrong.

702
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:45,286
I don't believe it.

703
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,343
You're not...
Gonna get everything right.

704
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:54,111
But you're never gonna get
everything wrong.

705
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:17,252
Morning!

706
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:21,150
- Where have you been the last two days?
- Overslept.

707
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:25,097
- We saved speed racer. She had polio.
- We cured it with vitamin C.

708
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:27,455
Yeah.

709
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:29,833
I cured depression
with tonic water once.

710
00:38:30,471 --> 00:38:32,457
Actually, I think there was
some gin in it too.

711
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,803
150 grams over six hours. It worked.

712
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,277
No, it didn't.

713
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,528
I told you you can't cure polio.

714
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,475
That means either she's not cured
or she never had it.

715
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,987
Since she's walking out of here...

716
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:51,073
I tested her blood from admittance.
No polio.

717
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:53,483
That means Brennan
screwed up the lab tests.

718
00:38:53,517 --> 00:38:55,050
Or you screwed up your lab tests.

719
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:58,419
- You must have. She got better.
- So it's relapsing and remitting.

720
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,141
Maybe... Porphyria.

721
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:02,425
No, that's a stretch.

722
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:05,359
If she had porphyria,
you would have seen purple urine.

723
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,069
You think it's more likely
he cured polio?

724
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:10,495
They believe it.

725
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,269
Her symptoms fit perfectly.

726
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:17,073
And the alternative
is unbelievably convoluted.

727
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:19,726
Some doctor would have
to poison her with valium

728
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,592
so it looks like polio,
then fake a lab test,

729
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:25,087
then give her vitamin C and stop the
poison so she magically gets better.

730
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:27,339
Actually...

731
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:30,108
It is kind of doable, right?

732
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:35,725
So what do you think?

733
00:39:35,864 --> 00:39:39,170
Should we test her for thallium
before you contact Stockholm?

734
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:41,881
You poisoned her?

735
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,053
The really shocking thing
is that Foreman was right

736
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,216
about the heatstroke.

737
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:49,226
Vitamin C cures polio. I've seen it.

738
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:51,144
Yeah... In some Bush clinic.

739
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:54,586
You need polio in a place
with a proper lab.

740
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:57,677
The only problem is that places
with proper labs don't have polio.

741
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,350
There is no money

742
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:03,446
in finding cures

743
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:06,175
for diseases that only kill poor people.

744
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:10,029
This will make them do research.

745
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,600
And what do you care
if I faked a lab test

746
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,869
if it saves a few thousand lives?

747
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:18,528
I did what I had to do.

748
00:40:18,822 --> 00:40:20,919
Isn't that what you hired us for?

749
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,203
Which is why I'm not gonna fire you.

750
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,266
You're gonna quit.

751
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,700
Go on, get out of here.

752
00:40:41,495 --> 00:40:43,415
So you're just gonna let him go?

753
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:45,564
Absolutely.

754
00:40:46,254 --> 00:40:48,076
I'm gonna let him get
as far away as possible

755
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,605
before you call the cops.

756
00:40:49,957 --> 00:40:51,264
Guy's a nut job.

757
00:40:52,423 --> 00:40:54,486
Who the hell did I leave in charge?

758
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:58,040
- Foreman.
- There was a reason for that.

759
00:40:58,552 --> 00:41:00,182
Next time, listen to him.

760
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:14,344
Where have you been?
And don't say the CIA.

761
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:15,475
Okay.

762
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,360
- By the way, one of my employees...
- Either you're gonna have to get

763
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:22,831
someone from the CIA to call and confirm
your story, or you're doing

764
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,729
eight clinic hours
and Wilson is doing 16.

765
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:31,980
I was in the Hamptons.

766
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:37,115
I was helping some rich hedge fund jerk
treat his son's sniffles.

767
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:39,969
Fascinating as that sounds.

768
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,173
For your honesty,
I will forgive your hours.

769
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:49,273
Thank you.

770
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:53,715
No!

771
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,325
The only thing less likely
than your helping the CIA

772
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,799
is your helping some rich guy
on Long Island.

773
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:03,602
You're doing your hours and Wilson's.

774
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:05,718
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.

775
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:06,930
Who doesn't?

776
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:17,703
Hi.

777
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:19,275
Hi.

778
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:29,161
I'm going to take you up on your offer.

779
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:30,518
Yeah?

780
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:36,803
I... I live a couple miles from here.

781
00:42:38,283 --> 00:42:40,091
That's not the offer I meant.

782
00:42:42,372 --> 00:42:43,670
I gave notice today.

783
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:47,405
You said you were happy at the company.

784
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,728
I lied.
Doubt you'll hold it against me.

785
00:42:57,813 --> 00:42:59,698
I'll see you at 9:00 on monday.
