1
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,837
Doc, help, doc!

2
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:27,306
It stopped bleeding.
It stopped bleeding.

3
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:30,427
That's because your blood's freezing
as it's hitting the air.

4
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:33,881
Here, apply pressure on it.

5
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,320
I think my leg is frozen.

6
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,995
That's the least of your problems.

7
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,348
The blade severed your femoral artery.

8
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,947
Am I gonna lose my leg?

9
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:54,117
Frostbite's not too bad but
I gotta fix your artery now.

10
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,452
This is gonna hurt.

11
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:03,933
You're gonna put that in me?

12
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:06,984
Glue's the best way to repair
your artery at this temperature.

13
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:10,344
It looks okay.

14
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,844
Here, tear off some pieces.
I have to check your foot.

15
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,643
Blood flow looks good.

16
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,006
Your leg should be okay.

17
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:24,855
I thought I was done.

18
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:27,776
Yeah, like I'd let
anything happen to you.

19
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,237
You're the only one who
can fix the generators.

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,064
One... two... three.

21
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:38,035
Cate, Cate, are you okay?

22
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:39,454
Are you okay?

23
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,508
I... I... I need help.

24
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,067
Who am I supposed to get?

25
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,965
Saison 4 - Episode 11
<i>Frozen.</i>

- Transcript :  ydy.com

28
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:46,313
Why do I even give you an office?

29
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:49,234
New case. Psych department asked
for you personally.

30
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,692
Patient's a crazy person?

31
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:53,443
You're a crazy person.
Patient's a psychiatrist.

32
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:56,164
There's something wrong
with coma guy's cable.

33
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,074
He seems fine with it.

34
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:01,619
Your patient is an adjunct faculty
member here but currently...

35
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:07,709
The budget committee voted to charge
for cable in the patient rooms.

36
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:10,717
Slippery slope.

37
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,598
Today we withhold porn,
tomorrow it's clean bandages.

38
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:14,965
Talk to Carlson in derm...

39
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:16,585
He runs the budget committee...

40
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:18,217
After you look at this.

41
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:20,904
After you talk to carlson,
maybe I'll...

42
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,205
The patient is trapped at
the South Pole.

43
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:34,152
Any possibility of evacuating her?

44
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,878
That wouldn't be any fun.

45
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:37,322
And for the next two months,

46
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:40,599
winds make it impossible to fly
anything in or out.

47
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,410
Could be appendicitis or a gallstone.

48
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,797
Or a kidney stone.

49
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,455
That wouldn't be any fun.

50
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,585
If it's appendicitis down there,

51
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,161
her appendix ruptures, she dies,
there's nothing we can do.

52
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:52,519
If it's stones, she takes pain meds,
the stone passes.

53
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,481
- There's nothing we need to do.
- Could be a struvite kidney stone.

54
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,469
Most kidney stones
are calcium and benign.

55
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,404
Why would you suspect a struvite stone?

56
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:01,423
'cause he said kidney stones
were boring.

57
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:02,596
It's possible.

58
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:03,932
She's on birth control.

59
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,551
Lots of sex could lead
to urinary tract infection,

60
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,270
which could lead to an
infection-laced struvite kidney stone.

61
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,272
Excessive antarctic drilling.

62
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:14,058
Bad for the environment and the ladies.

63
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:16,480
If it's a struvite stone she needs
to break it up quickly

64
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,391
before the infection shuts down
her kidneys.

65
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:19,906
This is where it gets fun.

66
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:24,369
These are the supplies and medications
she has available.

67
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,146
Nothing here that can break up
a kidney stone.

68
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,835
What else do they have down there?

69
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,144
- I just said...
- I don't mean medical stuff.

70
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:35,264
Other stuff.

71
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,219
Some geological equipment
breaks ice and rock

72
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,355
the same way we break
kidney stones.

73
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:44,958
Discovery channel.

74
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,954
I like watching them blow stuff up.

75
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:48,174
Who doesn't?

76
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:50,979
That reminds me.

77
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:53,898
Coma guy needs cable.

78
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:56,492
Women's billiard is the only thing
that's keeping him alive.

79
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:58,962
I'm sure carlson will be moved
by his plight.

80
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:01,632
Carlson won't listen to me since
I hit on his wife.

81
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:03,017
You knew!

82
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:05,418
God no, I thought I was hitting on
his daughter.

83
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,766
Look, you're on the committee.
He'll listen to you.

84
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:10,790
I'm an avid reader of "committees
with hotties" message boards.

85
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,829
Amoxicillin,500 milligrams I. V

86
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,731
Studies conducted in major hospitals

87
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:17,255
indiCate that happy patients
recover faster.

88
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,593
Studies conducted in my apartment
show that tv makes people happy.

89
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,206
Premium channels have
a particularly striking effect.

90
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:26,019
Charging patients for cable
is bringing in 13 grand a month.

91
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,789
Until this injustice is righted,

92
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,896
I am going to waste 13 grand a day.

93
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:36,120
It's $2.49 down.

94
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:39,012
Get an EKG and a cardiac enzyme.

95
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,405
If those check out, discharge him and
tell him to get a snow blower.

96
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:46,242
How much is 13 grand divided by $.04?

97
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,060
I am not giving you cable.

98
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,063
You're gonna have to somehow survive
with the broadcast networks alone.

99
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:53,683
I'll be fine on tuesdays.

100
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:58,720
If sound waves from
the flaw detector break the egg

101
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,308
it should safely dissolve
your kidney stone.

102
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:09,766
- This isn't going to work.
- There's no reason it shouldn't.

103
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:12,146
Sound waves are sound waves.
Stones are stones.

104
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,609
Some are bigger than others.

105
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,021
Some are inside me.

106
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,056
How's it going, team MacGyver?

107
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:18,963
Oh, great.

108
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,988
I can't get cable, but I can get
the South Poleon hi-def.

109
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:23,905
We're almost ready to start the test.

110
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:24,992
Test?

111
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:26,908
Did ford test the edsel?

112
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:28,902
Did coke test new coke?

113
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,951
Did shakespeare test
his final play: snow dogs?

114
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:33,929
<i>I'm guessing you're doctor House?</i>

115
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,302
<i>I was wondering when you might drop by.</i>

116
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,460
Could she see me?

117
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,511
<i>Yeah.</i>

118
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,175
Think jagger shows up
for the sound check?

119
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,473
Okay. Roadies, off the stage.

120
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,017
Go help Cameron in the E. R

121
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,353
Why? No way you're just
doing her a favor.

122
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,528
E.R. Is standing room only.

123
00:07:57,648 --> 00:07:59,522
Which means Cameron's bound
to make a mistake.

124
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,275
Find it so I can blackmail her.

125
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,319
As far as you know...

126
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,947
this is way more than just
some silly battle over cable.

127
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,819
Ready.

128
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:42,501
You-you might wanna just
dial it down a smidge.

129
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,898
<i>I am not doing this.</i>

130
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:49,740
<i>Your kidney stone theory hinges
on me having sex, but...</i>

131
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,600
Let me guess. You're as pure as
the driven snow.

132
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,537
<i>Only if the snow likes to be on top.</i>

133
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:57,623
<i>But I am here doing
psychological research.</i>

134
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:00,543
<i>Generally not a good idea to swap
fluids with your subjects.</i>

135
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,046
Struvite stones are possible in
people who don't have sex.

136
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:06,215
They're certainly possible in
people who claim...

137
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,969
I've had no u. T. i. S.
No pain on urination.

138
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:12,430
You do realize that only one
of us is a real doctor.

139
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:16,001
<i>You do realize only one of us has
any control over my actions.</i>

140
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,557
Dr. Milton,
are you able to run a chem 7?

141
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,656
<i>Yes.</i>

142
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:24,829
That'll tell us if her kidney
function's declining.

143
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:26,239
If it is, he's right.

144
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,279
Struvite stone's
most likely explanation.

145
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:29,873
If not, she's right.

146
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:38,164
Sorry, I know how you like
to avoid avoiding confrontation.

147
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:42,278
While we're waiting for that test to
prove me right, start I. V Cefuroxime.

148
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:45,087
Keep the infection in the stone
from wiping out your kidneys.

149
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:47,729
<i>I'll send the chem
7 results when I'm done.</i>

150
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,532
She's a great psychiatrist.

151
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:56,370
One session, I've got shrinkage.

152
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,644
House wants us to spy
on you, report back.

153
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:03,140
And you're telling me this because...

154
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,494
We don't want to do it.

155
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,067
I don't see a problem so far.

156
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:08,998
If our choice is between pissing
House off or pissing you off,

157
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,828
that's not much of a choice.

158
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:14,904
So unless I give House cable, you're
gonna make my life miserable.

159
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,930
Yes.

160
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:19,413
And you're telling me this so you
won't feel as guilty when you do it.

161
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:22,666
Yes.

162
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:25,711
Accommodating House's every
whim is not my job anymore.

163
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,074
But it is ours.

164
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,978
House will get what he wants.

165
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:40,722
Maybe we should just pay for it
ourselves and tell him she folded.

166
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:42,157
No.

167
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,518
Your chem 7 results show that your
kidney function is declining.

168
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:50,486
Sounds like a kidney stone to me.

169
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:52,076
<i>The decreased function</i>

170
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:54,824
<i>could be from dehydration
caused by vomiting</i>

171
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,161
<i>due to a gallstone.</i>

172
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,328
You agreed that the chem 7 would decide
if it was a struvite stone.

173
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,093
I agreed to do the test.

174
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,412
The results are up for interpretation.

175
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,751
I'll redo the test in
an hour when I'm rehydrated.

176
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:09,185
Have you noticed any improvement
since starting the cefuroxime?

177
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,157
<i>Not really. The pain's
about the same.</i>

178
00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:13,221
While you're waiting,
we should run another test

179
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,031
- with the geology equipment.
- You're not taking the cefuroxime.

180
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:17,328
She's right handed.

181
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,308
Means she would've put
the I. V in her left arm.

182
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,518
Catheter in the arm makes
it hard to bend the elbow

183
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,270
the way people do when they drink!

184
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,607
We have a limited supply of medication
and I'm not about to waste it.

185
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:29,913
Last I checked, you had
a limited supply of doctors.

186
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,781
<i>Right before I got sick,</i>

187
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,662
<i>one of my crew members
severed his femoral artery.</i>

188
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:36,161
<i>He needs the cefuroxime.</i>

189
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,476
<i>Right, he called dibs.</i>

190
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,665
His need is definitive.

191
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:41,672
Mine is speculative.

192
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:43,514
You're breathing fast.

193
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,041
<i>It's because I'm pissed off!</i>

194
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:48,125
Lift up your chin.
Show me your windpipe.

195
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:52,965
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

196
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:55,891
- It's deviating to the left.
- Means her right lung is collapsing.

197
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:58,066
- Is anyone there with you?
- Sean went to the mess.

198
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,089
- You need to call someone.
- There's no time.

199
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,639
Get a syringe and a needle.

200
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,815
- Why am I doing-
<i>- Shut up and look.</i>

201
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,534
She could pass out.
She needs...

202
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,518
She needs to reinflate that lung.

203
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:10,358
Okay, now pull out the plunger.

204
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,759
I want you to stab yourself
in your right side

205
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,990
between the second and third rib
in the mid-clavicular line.

206
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:21,078
By the time we get someone else there,
you'll have suffoCated.

207
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,244
Just do it.

208
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:37,774
See all the good stuff that happens
when you listen to me?

209
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:41,597
<i>Means it's not a kidney stone.</i>

210
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:53,570
<i>Right side pain, vomiting,</i>

211
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,696
<i>and now a lung that gets traumatized
without any trauma.</i>

212
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:58,902
<i>Sounds odd.
Probably is odd.</i>

213
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:00,784
<i>We should discuss this,
then call her back.</i>

214
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:04,123
<i>That's fine. I made sure we got
the South Pole long distance plan.</i>

215
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,098
Your latest kidney function
test shows...

216
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:08,855
I know what it shows.
I ran it.

217
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:11,876
The more you interrupt, the longer
my grandstanding is gonna take.

218
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:14,422
Since when do you let patients
participate in differentials?

219
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,966
Since the patient and her doctor
happen to be the same person.

220
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,386
<i>Your kidney function is still declining.
Means you have a kidney problem.</i>

221
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:23,931
But not one that needed antibiotics.
Makes us equally wrong.

222
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,354
No, makes us both wrong.

223
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:27,474
Not equally.

224
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,061
You were at least six wronger.

225
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,128
<i>They run a ppd before you shipped out?</i>

226
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,349
<i>On me and everybody else here.
It's not T.B.</i>

227
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:35,818
<i>Excuse us a second.</i>

228
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:38,862
Cancer explains the symptoms.

229
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,283
A tumor in her lung or kidney that
threw a clot to the other organ.

230
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:45,786
And you're worried the tumor might
overhear, realize we're on to it.

231
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:49,357
Cancer's a hard diagnosis for patients
even when they're not in the South Pole.

232
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:51,667
We should figure this out,
maybe bring wilson in.

233
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:59,175
<i>Obviously you two
think I'm in bad shape.</i>

234
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:01,343
Only if you count the tumor.

235
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,527
Probably in your abdomen.

236
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:06,163
But you don't have any advanced
imaging equipment.

237
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:08,061
You also don't have
a surgeon to biopsy it,

238
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,368
any stains to use on the slide,
or an oncologist to analyze it.

239
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:13,981
<i>Too far away to hold her hand.</i>

240
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,183
<i>I have cancer?</i>

241
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:17,857
Possibly.

242
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:21,953
Since the only imaging equipment
you have is X-ray, let's start there.

243
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,993
X- ray your entire body.

244
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:26,766
<i>I'll upload the images when I'm done.</i>

245
00:14:30,498 --> 00:14:31,700
Good for you.

246
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:00,736
She's annoying.

247
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,740
Refused to take the antibiotics because
other people might need them.

248
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,243
She said she cares about other people?

249
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:09,161
What a poser.

250
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:10,704
K.U.B. Is clean.

251
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,749
You don't like her because
she's a psychiatrist.

252
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:17,294
I'm a compliCated man.
I loathe her for many reasons.

253
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:19,748
Never before has
a profession been so decried

254
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,798
by someone who needed it so badly.

255
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:24,510
You talk a lot of smack
about tranny hookers.

256
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:26,696
Enlarged mediastinal node.

257
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,805
Lymphoma.

258
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:30,105
Probably, but we can't confirm
it without a biopsy.

259
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:32,166
You can't analyze a biopsy
without a stain.

260
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:33,286
We can't biopsy.

261
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:36,044
'cause they don't have stains
down there. We need a substitute.

262
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:39,233
She can't biopsy that node without
a surgical team and an O. R

263
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:42,425
Anything with a strong color
could work as a stain.

264
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,031
Printer ink, food coloring, coffee.

265
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:47,484
No thanks.

266
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:50,422
Find a node closer to the surface,
one she can biopsy.

267
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:51,761
That makes sense.

268
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:53,831
- That makes sense?
- I said it first.

269
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,608
In a shockingly calm manner

270
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:00,359
after I'd just been jerking
you around for 30 seconds

271
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,048
without you complaining
or analyzing said jerking.

272
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,548
I was being mature.

273
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:06,643
In a lavender shirt.

274
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:09,757
You for some reason are happy.

275
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,015
How dare you?

276
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:13,876
The x-rays don't show any
other abnormal nodes.

277
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,803
Abnormal nodes can be felt before
they can be seen on an x-ray.

278
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:20,320
You're wearing that shirt for someone.

279
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,742
The health department.
They frown on topless oncology.

280
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,197
You're gonna do a physical?

281
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,317
Have to.

282
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,703
You and foreman are gonna
be here looking for a stain.

283
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:32,253
I can do the physical.

284
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:33,996
There's no reason you need to watch.

285
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:36,206
I can think of at least three reasons.

286
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:37,980
<i>One of them's medical.</i>

287
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,015
Where are you?
Not in your office.

288
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:42,260
You're not in the hospital.
No reason for me to be.

289
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,425
I am not...

290
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,328
undressing for you in your apartment.

291
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:46,981
<i>You're not in my apartment.</i>

292
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,511
You're three quarters of a world away.

293
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,805
<i>I promise not to get fresh.</i>

294
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:53,630
I'm not taking off my clothes.

295
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,481
One of us has to.

296
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:01,706
Show me your place.

297
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:08,405
It's got walls, a floor, and
in some places, a roof.

298
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:11,858
<i>I am not exposing myself
without some reciprocity.</i>

299
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:14,082
It's my apartment.
It's not my soul.

300
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:20,292
<i>Living room.</i>

301
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:22,427
Slow down.

302
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,020
Lots of books.

303
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,523
I'm betting all medical.

304
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:31,637
<i>Only if you count jenna jameson's
autobiography as a gynecological text.</i>

305
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:33,673
Fiction is a waste of time

306
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:35,200
unless you can laugh at it.

307
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,429
<i>I love to laugh.</i>

308
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:37,831
<i>Moving on.</i>

309
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:40,818
Back up.

310
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:43,732
<i>How bad is the insomnia?</i>

311
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:45,984
Let me clarify that.

312
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:50,176
<i>Do you drink two or three scotches
before passing out in front of the tv?</i>

313
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,367
You are so far off.

314
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,821
<i>It's bourbon.</i>

315
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:58,511
No photos anywhere.

316
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,872
Family and friends aren't important?

317
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:02,951
Well, you're sick.

318
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:06,056
You got 20 people down the hall
and you've had exactly one visitor.

319
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,634
<i>I don't want to panic anyone.</i>

320
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,019
You don't like people.

321
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:12,290
- You hide on that ice cube so people-
- Stop projecting.

322
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:16,580
<i>You're anti-social, so
you assume I'm anti-social.</i>

323
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:18,976
How about if I just get
naked and you shut up?

324
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:21,755
<i>If I thought I could get you naked,
I would've led with that.</i>

325
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:25,399
You'd rather show me
your soul than your leg.

326
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,691
Great.

327
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:29,820
You got me all figured out.

328
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:32,197
You gonna try and fix me now?

329
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:34,241
<i>I never said you needed fixing.</i>

330
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,049
He's letting her take part
in the differentials.

331
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,329
Of course he is.

332
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:42,453
He likes her.

333
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,450
Big shock, spaghetti sauce doesn't work
as a lymph tissue stain.

334
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:49,592
I'll try the coffee.

335
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,234
He's annoyed by her,

336
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:54,232
doesn't respect her as a doctor,
constantly insults her.

337
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:57,073
That's House's version of courtship.

338
00:18:58,283 --> 00:18:59,141
Oh, god.

339
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:00,643
He's been wooing me for years.

340
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:02,204
She's the perfect woman for him.

341
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:05,141
Willing to literally go to the end
of the earth for her career,

342
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:07,742
making her unavailable
for a real relationship.

343
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,625
And she's afflicted
with a mysterious illness.

344
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:12,529
Soy sauce is a no-go.

345
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:15,076
We're gonna be here all night.

346
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,887
How long does it take you to get naked?

347
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:19,286
It's the South Pole.

348
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:21,511
I wear a lot of layers.

349
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:24,040
<i>Okay.</i>

350
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:25,584
<i>Ready.</i>

351
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:27,825
I saw socks.

352
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:29,088
That's not naked.

353
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:30,832
Have I mentioned it's freezing here?

354
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:34,584
<i>When they discover lymph nodes in feet,
I will take off my socks.</i>

355
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:38,055
Use your right hand
to palpate the nodes.

356
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,391
Any node you can feel is
one you can biopsy.

357
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:45,332
Let's start with your breasts,
move down to the ass, then...

358
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:46,563
<i>I was thinking...</i>

359
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:48,620
<i>go from the neck and work
my way down.</i>

360
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,864
Well, you could.

361
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:53,654
But I'd never forgive myself if we found
something before we got to your breasts.

362
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:58,129
I'm starting with the
anterior cervical nodes.

363
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:04,841
Turn your head.

364
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:07,084
LoCate the scm muscle.

365
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,045
<i>I know how to find my lymph nodes.</i>

366
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:13,715
They teach you that before or after
the class on fondling your inner child?

367
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:18,804
<i>No swelling, no tenderness,</i>

368
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:21,223
<i>and I can hear that, House.</i>

369
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:24,184
<i>Just thought it might help you relax.</i>

370
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,169
Anything in the axillary nodes?

371
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,055
<i>All clear.</i>

372
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:32,838
Both sides.

373
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,196
Slide your hand to your sternum,

374
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:39,783
probe for nodes.

375
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:41,827
Moving slowly downward.

376
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:44,769
<i>Down to what, House?</i>

377
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:47,708
<i>Sorry, can't hear you on account
of your heavy breathing.</i>

378
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:49,751
<i>I'm supposed to be on oxygen, you tool.</i>

379
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,508
Hold it.

380
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,594
Your fingers didn't go quite as deep.

381
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,220
Feel that node again.

382
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,223
<i>It-it's swollen.</i>

383
00:21:05,935 --> 00:21:07,436
Looks like you're doing a biopsy.

384
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:20,331
<i>It's pretty numb.</i>

385
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,057
Okay, take a deep breath...

386
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,696
and insert the needle into the node.

387
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:30,582
Come on, Cate.
Let's get this over with.

388
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,483
You used her name.

389
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:38,981
Just trying to move things along, Bob.

390
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,061
Okay, I'm in.

391
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,271
You need to pull back on the syringe.

392
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,261
You need to pull harder.

393
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,787
You okay?

394
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:09,554
Yeah.

395
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:13,474
"Are you okay?"

396
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:14,873
It's a valid medical question.

397
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:18,004
I have never heard you ask a patient
that question. You've never asked

398
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:21,024
me that question, you've seen me fall
down a flight of stairs drunk.

399
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:23,823
You've slept with her.

400
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,697
She's 9,000 miles away.

401
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:29,529
And while a certain part of me unfurled.

402
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:33,997
No, you.
Somehow you've been intimate with her.

403
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:35,868
Why are you following me?

404
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:39,564
- Thought you were following me.
- No, you are definitely following me.

405
00:22:39,603 --> 00:22:41,282
- Where are you going?
- Out to lunch.

406
00:22:41,302 --> 00:22:44,163
You never go out to lunch. Means there's
a reason you're going out to lunch.

407
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:45,852
I assume that reason is a human being.

408
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:47,337
Or a sandwich.

409
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:49,806
- Sandwiches can come here.
- So can human beings.

410
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,611
Yet she's not, which I find interesting.

411
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:53,147
I'm leaving now.

412
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,649
Small world.

413
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:58,697
Are you going to follow me into my car?

414
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:00,395
It's got two doors.

415
00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:01,678
Okay, look.

416
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,851
The reason I haven't told you is.

417
00:23:10,561 --> 00:23:12,606
Call off your dogs, House.

418
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:15,471
Your little helpers are interrogating
my patients, swiping my charts,

419
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:16,837
intercepting prescriptions.

420
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:19,256
- Why would you think that I'm.
- Because I'm not a moron.

421
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,582
You had to be pulling the strings here.

422
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,573
You think that because they make
me miserable i'm gonna give you cable?

423
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,628
Let's assume that's true.

424
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:28,395
And it certainly sounds
like it might be.

425
00:23:28,415 --> 00:23:30,156
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

426
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,795
I resigned from the budget committee.

427
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:33,785
I only joined the committee
to help the hospital.

428
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:35,348
You made me a liability.

429
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:38,743
I now have zero influence
over the hospital's cable policy.

430
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,293
Well done.

431
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:52,567
It didn't work.
There's nothing more that.

432
00:23:52,606 --> 00:23:53,648
Put these up.

433
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:56,903
"Free rottweiler puppies.

434
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:59,953
<i>Please call after 11:00 pm
and before 5:00 am."</i>

435
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:02,668
Is this Cameron's home number?
I love a new puppy.

436
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,373
That last one was delicious.
In torturing her.

437
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,261
Is no point totcher

438
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,356
if she can resign, she can unresign.

439
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:10,745
Go to defcon one.

440
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:13,017
Forget waiting for a mistake,
make her make one.

441
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:15,469
You want us to sabotage another doctor,

442
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:16,973
possibly harm a patient,

443
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:20,606
- all so you can have cable.
- Harm suggests permanent damage.

444
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,455
Get her to screw up, then fix it.

445
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,259
And this time don't tell her
what you're gonna do before you do it.

446
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,543
So,

447
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:33,988
how long do I let the lymph node
marinate in the red wine?

448
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:35,792
It should be ready now.

449
00:24:39,663 --> 00:24:42,074
Try increasing the magnification
on the camera.

450
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,603
<i>You know, I e-mailed a couple colleagues
at the hospital about you.</i>

451
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,538
You're checking up on me, not House?

452
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:51,439
Yeah,
well House is straightforward,

453
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:53,291
brilliant, and an ass.

454
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,430
Two out of three good qualities,
clear majority.

455
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,220
Whereas you, on the other hand,
have a perfect score.

456
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:00,694
You are

457
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:03,285
You are responsible, nice, human.

458
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,764
And yet you're House's best friend.

459
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:06,920
<i>Hold there.</i>

460
00:25:07,211 --> 00:25:09,791
Makes you think he's secretly
nicer than he seems?

461
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:13,328
<i>Makes me think that you're secretly
a lot less nice than you seem.</i>

462
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,061
<i>Do you always insult your doctors?</i>

463
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:16,552
It's not an insult.

464
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:18,841
Indiscriminate niceness is overrated.

465
00:25:19,862 --> 00:25:21,232
No wonder he likes you.

466
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:28,293
Based on this slide,
you do not have cancer.

467
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:33,009
Thank god.

468
00:25:33,106 --> 00:25:35,178
I do see some inflammation
which could mean.

469
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:37,151
<i>Cate?</i>

470
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,836
You all right?

471
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:40,714
My left side... Hurts.

472
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:44,403
It's the same pain
that I had on the right.

473
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:46,184
Your other Kidney.

474
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:49,164
<i>No, I hope it's something, It's maybe-</i>

475
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:52,423
No! I'm screwed.

476
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:02,305
<i>Bad news is you're 0 for 2
in the Kidney department.</i>

477
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,428
Is there good news?

478
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,470
You're back at home.

479
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,666
<i>Of course. There's cable.</i>

480
00:26:09,012 --> 00:26:10,672
<i>And the freedom to work pant-free.</i>

481
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:12,609
That is good news.

482
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:16,084
Wilson found signs
of inflammation in your biopsy.

483
00:26:16,422 --> 00:26:19,192
<i>That plus the two failing Kidneys
points to autoimmune disease.</i>

484
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:22,784
Probably SLE or vasculitis.
Treatment for both is prednisone.

485
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,254
Start with 100 milligrams.

486
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:26,232
Autoimmune is just your latest theory.

487
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:29,044
Like cancer before that,
and a Kidney stone before.

488
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:32,515
<i>Take the prednisone, you'll get better,
that'll be your confirmation.</i>

489
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:34,826
You practice medicine
like it's a fire sale.

490
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:37,303
You've wasted antibiotics, x- rays.

491
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:39,455
That was not a waste.
We ruled out.

492
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:41,306
<i>We have a crew member here</i>
who has asthma.

493
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:45,238
If he has an episode after I've used up
the prednisone, he'll die.

494
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:47,007
There a good chance
he's gonna die anyway,

495
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:48,950
since there won't be
a doctor there to help him.

496
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,832
Show me
proof

497
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,460
that it's autoimmune

498
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:54,621
and then I'll take the prednisone.

499
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:02,313
<i>We should send her outside.</i>

500
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:05,777
Right, just tell her to head north
until she runs into a hospital.

501
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:08,732
Autoimmune diseases are basically
inflammation running wild.

502
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:12,388
Extreme cold has been used as treatment,
like putting ice on a sprained ankle.

503
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:15,136
She starts to feel better outside,
we know it's autoimmune.

504
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,107
Is that my wallet?

505
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:18,694
Yeah, you can have it back.

506
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,100
I've already been through it.

507
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:22,360
I like your "ice on a sprain" metaphor.

508
00:27:22,457 --> 00:27:24,424
Makes it seem like
we're not killing her.

509
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:26,257
She'd only need to be outside
five minutes.

510
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,543
Without her mittens.

511
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,255
Mom told me that was a bad idea.

512
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:33,104
Especially that winter it was 70 below
and I had dual Kidney failure.

513
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:35,377
This is a good idea.
It's perfect for you.

514
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:37,111
Experimental, risky.

515
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,526
Wilson's right.
You care about.

516
00:27:39,546 --> 00:27:42,340
You didn't touch the cash,
but you took the receipts?

517
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:47,130
$190 restaurant tab.

518
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,779
<i>That's dessert, probably booze.</i>

519
00:27:49,974 --> 00:27:53,218
Means you lingered.
Means it's at least the third date.

520
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:55,256
- Means.
- Where are you going?

521
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,766
To talk to the people I pay
to come up with medical ideas.

522
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:59,510
<i>There are no ideas.</i>

523
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:01,382
The test for autoimmune is A.N.A.

524
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:03,729
Unless penguins poop
immuno analyzers, she's not-

525
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,070
<i>Before A.N.A. Testing,</i>

526
00:28:05,395 --> 00:28:07,092
people had autoimmune diseases.

527
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:08,949
How did they know?

528
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:10,064
C3.

529
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:12,000
- Before that.
- <i>L.E. Prep.</i>

530
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,583
But she doesn't have any controlled
pore glass beads.

531
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:16,008
You don't need them.

532
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:23,047
<i>When you shake the test tube,</i>

533
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:25,665
<i>the paperclip will damage
some of your blood cells.</i>

534
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,494
<i>If you have an autoimmune disease,</i>

535
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:30,749
<i>your immune system will gorge itself</i>
<i>on the damaged cells.</i>

536
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:33,485
They'll get big and fat so you can see
em under a microscope.

537
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:35,716
How you doing?

538
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,590
<i>No change.</i>

539
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:41,232
<i>So how long should I give the cells
to fatten up before I check them?</i>

540
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:42,593
Couple hours.

541
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:45,920
Or you could stop being a hypocrite
and take the prednisone now.

542
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:48,296
<i>Not bending to your will
makes me a hypocrite?</i>

543
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:51,278
If your psych patients
demanded lab results,

544
00:28:51,422 --> 00:28:53,984
- you'd never make a diagnosis.
- <i>So I'm wrong.</i>

545
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:57,054
You sleep like a baby,
<i>your life is unfolding as you dreamed.</i>

546
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,076
Everyone is miserable.

547
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:01,452
You don't change that because people
don't change.

548
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:04,567
You want to believe that because then
you're freed from any responsibility

549
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:06,445
- <i>for your misery.</i>
- Shut up.

550
00:29:07,587 --> 00:29:09,111
I get enough of this from Wilson.

551
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:10,983
And yet you keep hanging out with him.

552
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,408
<i>And from what I hear,</i>

553
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:16,541
<i>you have spent more time with me</i>

554
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:18,036
<i>than with any other patient.</i>

555
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:23,116
Sorry about that.

556
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:26,102
Call me when you get the results.

557
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:34,134
How's your patient?

558
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,411
She has an autoimmune disease.

559
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,781
Tell the psych department
she's in denial.

560
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,445
I had to fire Cameron.

561
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:45,116
What?
What happened?

562
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:48,527
65-year-old man came into the E.R.
With a hip fracture.

563
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,241
Cameron gave him demerol.

564
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,095
The guy was on an M.A.O.I.

565
00:29:52,264 --> 00:29:54,128
Put him into a hypertensive crisis.

566
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,741
- Is he gonna live?
- Taub caught the error in time.

567
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,999
If she'd just admitted the mistake,

568
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:01,136
maybe I could've just suspended her. But

569
00:30:01,624 --> 00:30:02,878
she's packing up,

570
00:30:03,096 --> 00:30:04,408
if you want to say good-bye.

571
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:06,930
We should be hearing from the south pole
in a few minutes.

572
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:08,592
That's it?

573
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:10,701
There's nothing to be done.

574
00:30:10,838 --> 00:30:11,957
She screwed up.

575
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,956
She's got no one to blame but herself.

576
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:18,686
I gotta go talk to Cameron.

577
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:22,290
Cuddy wouldn't can her for one screw-up.
And if she did, she wouldn't come to me.

578
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:24,842
And if she did, she wouldn't open with,
"how's your patient."

579
00:30:24,871 --> 00:30:26,549
- And if she did
- Why would she lie?

580
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,001
Timeless question.

581
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,289
In this case,
she conspired with your coworkers

582
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,772
to teach me that some things
are more important than cable.

583
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,925
And I'm gonna have to teach them
that they're wrong.

584
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:38,520
Come on,
south pole really should be calling.

585
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,300
L.E. Prep test was negative.

586
00:30:44,654 --> 00:30:46,007
It's not autoimmune.

587
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:48,748
You're basing that on a test
done with a paperclip.

588
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:50,500
Just take the prednisone.

589
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Either find another diagnosis
or find another test.

590
00:30:54,425 --> 00:30:55,756
There is one way.

591
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,200
You can take this experimental
drug called...

592
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,945
<i>Prednisone!</i>

593
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,300
- <i>Your Kidneys start working.
- There is another test.</i>

594
00:31:06,677 --> 00:31:09,378
I, I think Foreman
may've just broken up there.

595
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:10,648
<i>What he actually said was</i>

596
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,308
"there is no other test."

597
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,989
<i>If you have an autoimmune disease,</i>

598
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:16,680
exposure to the cold
should decrease your kidney pain.

599
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,500
<i>If I go outside, we'll have our answer?</i>

600
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,690
<i>And you knew about this?</i>

601
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:24,449
I rejected it because
if you're frozen solid,

602
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,490
<i>it's hard to get the needles
into your arms.</i>

603
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,095
How long do I need to stay out?

604
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,600
At least five minutes. Eight minutes
outside would kill a healthy person.

605
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,895
<i>And healthy people don't
suck on oxygen masks.</i>

606
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:35,088
Healthy people can pee.

607
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:37,300
I'll go get sean, have him come with me.

608
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,867
Just take the prednisone.

609
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:41,200
Once I come inside.

610
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,552
If it's autoimmune.

611
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,754
Are you all right?

612
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm sure she's just fine.

613
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:54,571
Cate?

614
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:59,443
See if there's anye down there
who has a cell phone.

615
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:16,653
Took the station mechanic
20 minutes to respond.

616
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,908
She'd already slipped into a coma.

617
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:20,900
Started her on prednisone,
but no improvement.

618
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:24,015
Means it's not autoimmune.

619
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,250
Good thing she's in a coma,

620
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,043
- or we'd have to listen to her gloat.
- And where are we going?

621
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:31,000
To find the useful members of my team.

622
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:33,155
- You're letting him off the hook?
- Happy?

623
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,623
Because of you, i'm not gonna be able
to watch law and order in Korean

624
00:32:36,643 --> 00:32:37,567
why am I here?

625
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,771
Because I want to ask you
about your girlfriend.

626
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,855
I must know who she is
or you'd have told me her name.

627
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:46,250
She doesn't have a name.
It's some sort of birth defect.

628
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,261
There's only about
12 people we both know.

629
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,400
I can't remember five of their names,
so we're down to...

630
00:32:51,443 --> 00:32:53,373
Cuddy.. your ex-wife

631
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,504
your mama.

632
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:58,089
You need to run a Kidney function test.

633
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:00,570
Yes, if only she wasn't in a coma

634
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:03,197
we could get her to run a test
to find out why she's in a coma.

635
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,415
The results would likely be paradoxical.

636
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:08,646
Can't be Cuddy, 'cause you're straight.
Can't be.

637
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,742
We could talk the mechanic
through the test.

638
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,100
Too complicated.

639
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,252
Unless he's thirsty.

640
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:21,310
Drink her urine?

641
00:33:21,406 --> 00:33:25,105
If it has a strong, concentrated taste,
it means the problem's in her Kidneys.

642
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:27,000
<i>Watery taste means it's her brain.</i>

643
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,250
- And then you can fix it?
- Let's say yeah.

644
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:34,981
<i>How do I get the urine out of her?</i>

645
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,680
Take a straight catheter and insert it.

646
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,145
These are your only questions?

647
00:33:38,836 --> 00:33:40,931
Not,
"is it safe?"

648
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:43,300
<i>Or, "is there another way?"</i>

649
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,573
<i>Or,</i> "are you out of your minds?"

650
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,500
You wouldn't ask me if.

651
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,895
Wait a second.

652
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:51,310
You're in love with her.

653
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:55,405
That explains why you're so eager
to get her naked, then have a drink.

654
00:33:55,578 --> 00:33:57,867
'cause most guys like
to go the other way around.

655
00:33:57,944 --> 00:33:59,700
Why do you care how I feel about her?

656
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:04,818
Because now I know that I can get you
to do anything to save her.

657
00:34:07,853 --> 00:34:09,377
Tell him how to tap the keg.

658
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,280
You got Cameron fired.

659
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,760
Cuddy wasn't supposed to find out.

660
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,999
No kidding!

661
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,674
Get me cable. How tough can that be?

662
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,208
Cost a woman her job.

663
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,341
There's only one thing you can say

664
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,819
to keep me from firing you.

665
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,219
- Cameron wasn't fired.
- Wrong.

666
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,080
- You know?
- We'r still fired?

667
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,492
That should be a hint
as to what you're supposed to say.

668
00:34:35,894 --> 00:34:37,187
We're sorry.

669
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,850
- Wrong.
- I love you.

670
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,067
Wrong.

671
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,715
This is a game?

672
00:34:42,857 --> 00:34:45,701
First we have to screw with our coworker
and now we have to try to figure out

673
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:48,600
what you want us to say?
This is insane. I'm not playing.

674
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:50,106
Right.

675
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,495
Should've said this two days ago.

676
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:56,541
Do not play games with me.

677
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:59,700
Number one, you're going to lose.
You're just not ready.

678
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,111
Number two, the game was to force you
to stop playing games.

679
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,802
I need you to stand up to me.

680
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,050
Challenge me. I need you to stop
worrying about getting fired.

681
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,271
Go pay for my cable.

682
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,100
No!

683
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,300
I didn't mean on this.

684
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,480
Seriously, I need cable.

685
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:29,256
Milk, milk, lemonade.

686
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,123
This tastes kind of watery.

687
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,500
That's bad news.

688
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,007
Either increased intracranial pressure

689
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:41,247
or something's wrong
with her hypothalamus.

690
00:35:41,382 --> 00:35:43,002
<i>How do you figure out which one it is?</i>

691
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,771
We don't do anything.

692
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:49,300
You're gonna drill a hole in her skull.

693
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,889
<i>If she regains consciousness,</i>

694
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:54,423
<i>it's increased intracranial pressure.</i>

695
00:35:56,218 --> 00:35:57,626
And if it's the other thing?

696
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,800
She'll die.

697
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,500
But if it's the hypothalamus,
she's dead anyway.

698
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,452
If the problem is the pressure

699
00:36:04,774 --> 00:36:06,500
in her brain, and I fix it,

700
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:07,849
is she gonna be all better?

701
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,426
Nope, but it'll give us more time
to figure out what's wrong.

702
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,200
I have to get someone else.
I can't do this.

703
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:18,155
You love her, right?

704
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:21,160
You'd do anything to save her.

705
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,389
Not this.

706
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,626
I can't do this. If,

707
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:27,010
if she dies because of something
that I did, then I.

708
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,139
Listen, listen.

709
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,688
I am not going to let you hurt her.
Okay?

710
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,614
Now please...

711
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
This is her only chance.

712
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:43,070
Okay.

713
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,658
Well, that was easy.

714
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:57,840
<i>Okay, her head is stabilized and the</i>

715
00:36:59,074 --> 00:37:00,700
<i>drill bit is sterile.</i>

716
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:04,657
<i>Place the drill bit against
the upper left part of her forehead.</i>

717
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,448
About an inch above the temple.

718
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:25,300
It's not going anywhere.

719
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:27,265
Bone's harder than wood. Lean into it.

720
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,191
<i>The skull's only a quarter-inch thick.</i>

721
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:31,788
Once you're midway through,
drill in shorter bursts.

722
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,750
<i>If it comes out the other side,</i>
<i>you've gone too far.</i>

723
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,371
Okay, now what? Now what?

724
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:40,867
Let the fluid drain.

725
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:55,992
She's waking up. She's waking up.

726
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:06,732
Sean?

727
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:10,300
What's going on?

728
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:15,900
South pole doc is out of her coma,

729
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:18,139
and now we have a new symptom.

730
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:20,700
Increased intracranial pressure.

731
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,650
Why are we out here?

732
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,356
That's the patient room.

733
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,090
Icp plus Kidney problems

734
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,714
plus lung collapse equals?

735
00:38:28,772 --> 00:38:31,077
The most likely suspect
is a tumor throwing off clots.

736
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:32,380
We ruled out cancer.

737
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,656
But not clots.

738
00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:35,500
What causes blood clots?

739
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,206
- Bacterial endocarditis.
- Not without a fever.

740
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:40,390
Deep vein thrombosis plus
an existing PFO.

741
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,490
PFO would've been discovered
in her pre-south pole physical exam.

742
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,023
What if the clots aren't clots?

743
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:47,013
Atherosclerosis.

744
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:49,300
Fatty plaque builds up
on the arterial walls,

745
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:51,200
pieces break off, block blood flow.

746
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,490
Explains everything.

747
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,656
She has zero risk factors.

748
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:56,385
Forget fat, think clots.

749
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,400
No.

750
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,972
You're standing up to me?

751
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,231
Maybe.

752
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,680
Just to clarify.
You should do that when you're right.

753
00:39:04,895 --> 00:39:07,315
Sorry for the confusion.
How could a clot.

754
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:09,447
Could be a different kind of fat,
fat emboli.

755
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:12,091
That's a perfect fit...

756
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,600
Except it's completely impossible!

757
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,962
Fat emboli requires
an unrepaired bone break.

758
00:39:18,058 --> 00:39:20,649
Between the x-ray and the exam,
I've seen her entire.

759
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:30,875
See, that's what i'm talking about.

760
00:39:33,728 --> 00:39:35,100
<i>Take off her socks.</i>

761
00:39:36,648 --> 00:39:37,999
I could, I could do it.

762
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,298
No, I got it.

763
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,814
Your toe is broken.

764
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,545
Oh, my god.

765
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,000
<i>Bits of bone marrow have been leaking
into your blood stream.</i>

766
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:01,800
<i>Those fat emboli have caused blockages</i>
<i>in your Kidney, lungs, and brain.</i>

767
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:05,800
- It doesn't even hurt.
- Cold numbs everything.

768
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:08,500
Does a particularly great job
on the extremities.

769
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:11,612
You'll need to close the break
so stop the marrow from leaking.

770
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,695
This one you will feel.

771
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,900
Will you do it?

772
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:18,800
He drilled a hole in your skull

773
00:40:18,828 --> 00:40:21,047
after drinking your pee.
I think he's up for this.

774
00:40:21,303 --> 00:40:23,160
Grab the tip of her toe
with your right hand.

775
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,697
<i>Hold the break with your other.</i>

776
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:26,700
On the count of three, pull hard.

777
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,972
One...
Two...

778
00:40:30,214 --> 00:40:31,024
Three.

779
00:40:40,676 --> 00:40:42,007
Now splint your toe.

780
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,300
You'll be fine.

781
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,900
Thank you, House.

782
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:52,819
Don't thank me.

783
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:54,988
He's the one who saved your life.

784
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:23,652
He likes her.

785
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:34,540
A bottle of the Bordeaux

786
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,270
and some sparkling water.

787
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,119
Well, you didn't pick her up.

788
00:41:43,216 --> 00:41:45,527
Which means she's coming from work too.

789
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,580
Which means you're
comfortable enough to meet her.

790
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,680
Damn. Thought I lost you
when I walked backwards

791
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,312
through my own footprints in the snow.

792
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,128
I think I've got it narrowed down
to three possibilities.

793
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,443
Better leave.
If you see her, it'll be cheating.

794
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,967
- It's not one of your ex-wives.
- Because they hate me.

795
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:01,199
They don't.
They should, but they don't.

796
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,230
I called them.

797
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,732
Someone new,
but someone I know.

798
00:42:04,862 --> 00:42:06,965
Did you ever consider
being happy for me?

799
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,838
Briefly.

800
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,074
You ordering the wine
before she got here.

801
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:13,800
Girls are good, House.

802
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,111
And you know it.
You solved your case

803
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:17,674
because you cared about that girl.

804
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:21,190
You're demonstrating the illusion
of manly confidence.

805
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,190
Which means you haven't closed
the deal yet.

806
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,500
I closed the deal. I just like her.

807
00:42:25,618 --> 00:42:26,500
Still?

808
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:29,100
You knew your patient
hated having cold feet

809
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:31,290
because you did a physical exam,

810
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,802
because you liked her.

811
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:36,529
Your theory is I cared,
therefore I let her keep her socks on?

812
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:39,655
If that's what love is, then I don't
want to have anything to do with it.

813
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:42,600
It starts with warm feet
but leads to other things.

814
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,541
Your mom and I will explain
when you're older.

815
00:42:44,656 --> 00:42:47,861
If I'd made her take them off like
I should've, I would've seen the toe and

816
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:50,676
- would've solved the case days ago.
- But you don't care about her.

817
00:42:50,744 --> 00:42:52,000
Of course not.

818
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:54,623
House doesn't care about anyone.

819
00:42:57,198 --> 00:42:58,124
Hi.

820
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,200
Sorry I'm late.

821
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,556
Cut throat bitch?

822
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,300
I call her amber.

823
00:43:06,923 --> 00:43:08,400
Was she on your list?
