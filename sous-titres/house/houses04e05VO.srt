1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,587
Grandma's got some cash.
We can steal that.

2
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:11,693
What kind of crip are you?

3
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:13,673
We steal from strangers.

4
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:17,351
- Grandma is not gonna call the cops.
- Look,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,547
either you start doing this
or you get a job?

6
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:25,765
That guy.

7
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:30,178
You're gonna remember that guy
for the rest of your life.

8
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,144
Hey, how you doing?

9
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:49,553
I said, hey, gimme all your cash.

10
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:53,547
Why?

11
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:57,981
Wanna buy yourself a pretty dress,
you little bitch?

12
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,768
He ain't kiddin', man.
Where's your wallet?

13
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,521
On your sister's night stand.

14
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:05,246
Forgot it after I paid her.

15
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:10,572
You wanna die tonight?
I said, where's your wallet?

16
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:15,634
I think he's sick.
Maybe you shouldn't.

17
00:01:15,673 --> 00:01:18,672
He's faking.
Go in his pockets. Grab his wallet.

18
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:26,899
Good. Let's go.

19
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:33,056
- You all right, man?
- He's fine. He's faking it.

20
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:42,402
Yeah, I need an ambulance.
At maple and fourth.

21
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:44,915
There's a really sick guy.
I think he got mugged.

22
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:47,601
- What?
- Are you happy? Let's go!

23
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:56,200

Season 4 - Episode 5
"Mirror, Mirror"

25
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:29,791
Today we are hunting for
the cat burglar of diseases.

26
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:34,138
Causes a healthy man's lungs to fail
and leaves no fingerprints.

27
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:37,632
- Respiratory distress could be asthma.
- No hyperinflation on the X-ray.

28
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:39,935
Food allergy.
Could have eaten shellfish or peanuts.

29
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:43,508
- No hives. No erythema on the skin.
- Pulmonary embolism.

30
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,856
Embolisms don't magically dissolve.

31
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,335
- What are you doing here?
- Laryngospasm.

32
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,344
Frosty fall air hits his vocal chords,
they spasm shut...

33
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,151
- Choke him out.
- Good idea.

34
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:57,513
You've been tremendously helpful.
You can leave.

35
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,248
- I just hired him.
- Well, I fired him.

36
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:01,857
- To infinity.
- You didn't tell him I was coming back?

37
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,425
She did. I said no.

38
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:06,786
When your extended
job interview/reality tv show

39
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,184
killed a patient,
you lost your veto power.

40
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:12,584
- Everybody, this is Dr. Foreman. He...
- Does this mean there's

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,027
one less slot for us?

42
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,230
It's still Dr. House's department.

43
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,672
- He decides who stays, who goes...
- Foreman goes.

44
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:27,145
But Dr. Foreman
will be my eyes and ears.

45
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:30,005
You do nothing without his knowledge.

46
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:38,247
Just in case I need them, where, exactly
will Dr. Foreman be keeping my balls?

47
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,968
If you want to keep your jobs,
that never happened.

48
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,910
The only way to get the cat burglar
is to catch him in the act,

49
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:49,070
give the patient
a methacholine challenge,

50
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:50,669
see if it sets off laryngospasm.

51
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,062
You want us to stop his breathing?

52
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:55,549
Well, only until you can figure out why.
After that, it'd be irresponsible.

53
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,866
You and I should talk.

54
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,967
I'm sorry. She didn't
have to do that publicly.

55
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:07,089
Yes, she did.

56
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:09,945
She had to establish
her dominance in front of them,

57
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:11,235
limit my power.

58
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,827
There's nothing we can do.

59
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:16,179
Well, that's not the "never say never"
Dr. Foreman I know.

60
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,326
- There's lots we can do.
- Not really. Cuddy...

61
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:20,108
I can make you miserable.

62
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,120
That's true.

63
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,409
Until you quit.

64
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,627
Again.

65
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:26,625
So why don't we just skip the middleman?

66
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:27,654
I'm not quitting.

67
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:32,011
My god. Not everything's about you, and
your little job, and your little world.

68
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,967
This is about restoring order
in the universe.

69
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:36,291
I'm not quitting.

70
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,635
You're gonna be miserable.

71
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,254
I already am miserable.

72
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:50,083
Cuddy obviously thinks we're idiots.

73
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:52,066
She's not gonna let House
hire anyone of us.

74
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,098
Tidal volume's holding at 1.2 liters.

75
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,650
Increase the dose.

76
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:56,954
So which master do we serve?

77
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,802
Whose ass do we have
to kiss to get this job?

78
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,619
You really want this job so bad?

79
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,871
How 'bout you try doing this job?

80
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,846
Double the dose
to 16 milligrams per milliter.

81
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,723
My foot's tingling.

82
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:10,602
Is that normal?

83
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,560
- No. What, exactly, does...
- And my stomach's killing me.

84
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,190
Could this test cause that stuff?

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,741
No.

86
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,778
- Test was a bust.
- Amber has moved down to even money.

87
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,661
We found two new symptoms.

88
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,134
- Back to two to one.
- What's going on?

89
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,370
- You're the favorite.
- House's?

90
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,749
To get fired.

91
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,987
You can bet against yourself.
Lovely parting gift.

92
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:40,046
- What's the limit?
- Isn't one.

93
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,962
- 500 on Kutner.
- A thousand on Amber.

94
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:45,799
- Do you take checks?
- No.

95
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:53,948
How do we connect abdominal pain
and numbness in the extremities

96
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:57,200
- with respiratory collapse?
- Dissecting aortic aneurysm.

97
00:05:57,347 --> 00:05:59,493
Doesn't cover all three. What else?

98
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:02,861
Carry on.

99
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,312
He's the boss.

100
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,333
- What about a spinal cord lesion?
- Have to be in the brain stem.

101
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:15,804
- It still doesn't explain the lungs.
- Weird, though...

102
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,625
That he's the boss.

103
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,343
Didn't he quit recently?

104
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,832
- Was it a money issue?
- Lungs, stomach, numbness...

105
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,413
No, that wasn't it.
It was something else.

106
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:28,148
Was it... Bling account?

107
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:32,086
- Med plan didn't cover tattoo removal?
- We have to unify these symptoms.

108
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:33,375
Oh, I remember!

109
00:06:34,442 --> 00:06:38,216
You didn't want to turn into me, right?
You didn't want to become evil.

110
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:42,399
- Can we stick to the medicine here?
- Absolutely. I'm just flattered.

111
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:45,376
In a few short weeks,
seems like I've just...

112
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,262
Turned towards the light.

113
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,546
I mean, either that
or you sold your soul.

114
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:52,601
- Multiple marantic emboli could...
- Did you get a raise?

115
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,556
'Cause then you're a whore.

116
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:57,195
Or didn't you?
'Cause then you're a stupid whore.

117
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:00,565
Patient just crashed.

118
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,468
Can they go, boss?

119
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,955
- You're right.
- But?

120
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,912
No but. You're right about all of it.

121
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,367
Well, then, I'll see you at the reunion.

122
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,440
It seems I didn't
get out of here soon enough.

123
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:26,660
The world thinks I've been corrupted,
so no one will hire me.

124
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:29,190
I hate being here.

125
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,270
I'd love to quit...

126
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:33,047
But I can't.

127
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:49,787
- He's got a pulse.
- Must be another respiratory collapse.

128
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:51,524
This is our chance
to prove laryngospasm.

129
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,577
- We need to tube him and bag him.
- We will...

130
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:55,077
If he dies, no matter what he has.

131
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,096
Tilt his head back
so I can get a straight shot.

132
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,316
While you're killing him,
I'll get the intubation kit.

133
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,009
I decided you're right.

134
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,354
You're obviously
in an impossible position.

135
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,306
There's no point in me humiliating you.

136
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:11,287
Thanks.

137
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:14,281
So we're gonna humiliate Cuddy
until she fires you.

138
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:15,575
Guy's faking.

139
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,356
It's Munchausen's.

140
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:19,431
You notice the EMT run sheet?

141
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:22,490
Paramedic who brought him in
is also named Martin Harris.

142
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,618
If the name was
Attila Von Weinerschnitzel,

143
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:33,504
- I'd say you might be on to something.
- Look, room 406, abdominal pain.

144
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:37,022
Room 403, left-sided numbness.
402, syncope.

145
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:41,089
He's copying his neighbor's symptoms.

146
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:45,217
No.

147
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,319
Yeah, coincidence is much more likely
than you being a stubborn jerk.

148
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,840
Munchausen's patients
create symptoms, not names.

149
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:54,257
Munchausen's patients have medical
histories, they don't want us reading.

150
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,215
No laryngeal spasm.

151
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:58,731
Breathing's resumed normal rate.
Without intubation.

152
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:02,196
- See? Nothing's wrong with him.
- He's in a lab coat.

153
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:06,715
Munchausen's pretend to be patients,
not doctors.

154
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,294
He's got mirror syndrome.

155
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:11,993
Giovanni's?

156
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:14,707
Do you know another mirror syndrome?

157
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:19,081
Brain's got no idea who he is,
where he is, or what he is.

158
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,926
But it fills the holes with
whatever dirt's lying around.

159
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,468
He reads a name tag,

160
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,715
he's got a name.
He sees a doctor, he's got a job.

161
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:29,078
- Sees symptoms, he's got a problem.
- My explanation's simpler.

162
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:31,758
Well, if it's simple,
then we discharge the nut bar.

163
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:35,157
If it's complicated,
then the nut bar has got brain damage.

164
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,013
So we let him jerk them around
for a few days till we're sure?

165
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,235
No, we let him jerk you around.

166
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,498
There's a faster way.

167
00:09:48,402 --> 00:09:50,008
Mind if we play through?

168
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,196
Sure. What could possibly go wrong?

169
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,416
What's going on here, Martin?

170
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:01,348
- Operation?
- House? Who is this guy?

171
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:03,002
Excellent question.

172
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:04,752
Who are you, Martin?

173
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:11,609
He just likes to watch, hmm?
Do stuff.

174
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,011
Number ten scalpel for initial incision.

175
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,754
- Glad you're here, House.
- Of course you are.

176
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,695
- It's lecture time.
- Yeah, it is.

177
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:27,132
Stop worrying about the power play.

178
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:31,847
Was that it?
I think you can go a lot deeper here.

179
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,835
I mean,
why am I so obsessed by all of this?

180
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:37,837
You're threatened by Foreman
and feel the need to impress Cuddy.

181
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,279
The only thing that's relevant
is Foreman is a good doctor.

182
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:44,808
- He can help you, lighten the load.
- Good idea. I'll have him sort my mail.

183
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,346
Sure!

184
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:49,738
Deflect.

185
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:53,358
Who is this guy?

186
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:56,798
- I think we just found out.
- It's all about Cuddy.

187
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,163
Gotta be the alpha dog.

188
00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:02,626
Can almost smell
the pheromones now, huh?

189
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:04,160
I like him.

190
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:09,624
- Told you I didn't need you...
- House!

191
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,782
House, what is going on?

192
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:27,009
Your blood's turned to sludge.

193
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:30,495
If we don't heat you up,
you're gonna die.

194
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,547
Can't fake that!

195
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:41,043
Mirror syndrome patients
have no agenda, no ax to grind.

196
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:44,839
They can read you because they have to.
Moods, attitudes, everything.

197
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,503
They're like mind readers.

198
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:48,807
- Except they can read your mind.
- Where are we going?

199
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,582
Unfortunately, we have to cure him.

200
00:11:50,636 --> 00:11:53,536
His hand wasn't black when he came in,
the operating room was sterile,

201
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,476
the only thing different was the
temperature. Cold agglutinins means...

202
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,222
- It's gotta be some kind of infection.
- No fever, so it's gotta be

203
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:01,742
- a tiny infection, hard to find.
- You'd better find it fast.

204
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:06,075
This guy feels another cool breeze,
blood turns to slop, and he drops.

205
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,891
I need three ways to pinpoint infection.

206
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,749
- Blood cultures.
- Blood's clumpy.

207
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:11,937
Nothing you can do with it.

208
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,276
Unless we soak him in warm water
before we draw it.

209
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:15,666
Good. What else?

210
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,988
Ultrasound his abdomen,
look for an abscess.

211
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:18,837
Good.

212
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,628
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have a regrettable announcement.

213
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,445
The kitchen has just learned
that our annual shipment of mayonnaise

214
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:28,612
was improperly stored,
so anybody who ate...

215
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:32,359
Well, the food, should head across
the lobby to the clinic right away.

216
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:33,845
Ask for Dr. Cuddy.

217
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,039
You're not punishing Cuddy. You're
punishing every doctor in the building.

218
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:40,467
It's her building, her doctors.
Still need one more.

219
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:43,333
Well, we need to find out his history,
where he's been, what he's done.

220
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,380
Yeah, he has no memory,
but his bio's tattooed to his rear?

221
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,846
The mayo is fine.

222
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:49,642
You can stay where you are.
I'm a doctor.

223
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:52,831
Mail order. I've seen the diplomas.
Two "NS" in university.

224
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,229
Big Love was right. History's the key.

225
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,318
No ID, no wallet, no missing persons
report filed for a hundred miles.

226
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:03,620
The key is the key.

227
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,119
He had car keys in his pocket
when he was admitted.

228
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,451
Keep him in the isolation room
so he doesn't pick up

229
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,512
extreme bitch syndrome
from one of the nurses.

230
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:12,284
Run the ultrasound
and the blood cultures.

231
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:15,071
- Cultures were my idea.
- No one's keeping score.

232
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:18,314
You're losing.
Search the street where he was mugged.

233
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:22,285
- Find the car and the registration.
- There could be thousands of cars.

234
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:25,495
- Why do I get this assignment?
- Because if you deal with the patient,

235
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,957
he's gonna wind up singing Osmond songs
and proposing to five nurses at once.

236
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,319
I'll go with Cole.

237
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,868
We have a love connection.

238
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,536
Make a fist.

239
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:41,470
Little pinch.

240
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:44,926
That's a strong pinch.

241
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,575
This thing works,
you're lucky you've got me.

242
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:51,439
My colleague wanted
to cook you in boiling water.

243
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:59,064
That's right, baby.
My blood's that good.

244
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:07,058
- That's supposed to be me, right?
- No. That's me.

245
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:08,866
I'm always right. Gotta be.

246
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:11,096
- I don't think...
- If they don't like you,

247
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:14,360
you gotta be right,
or you're not worth anything.

248
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:23,086
Infections can hide
deep beneath the skin.

249
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:24,793
This'll find 'em.

250
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,667
Who was that last doctor?

251
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:31,004
Dr. Amber Volakis.

252
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,850
Don't really need her name.

253
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:39,607
Wait. You saying that...

254
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,948
You...

255
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,953
I want...

256
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,358
her?

257
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:47,174
Don't know what you want.
Don't care what you want.

258
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:49,033
- I'm married.
- So am I.

259
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:52,548
Even if I wasn't, she's a little too...

260
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:55,081
Aggressive for me.

261
00:14:57,462 --> 00:15:00,443
Aggressive is never a bad thing.

262
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,056
Yeah. True.

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,046
I'm done.

264
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,924
- You okay?
- Yeah. We gotta run some more tests.

265
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:23,699
You can clean yourself up.

266
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,212
Lesion on the liver.

267
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,258
- Cystic or solid?
- Solid.

268
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:32,820
Well, you certainly did the right thing
by coming to me.

269
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,510
- Yes, I needed a smug oncologist...
- An authoritative oncologist.

270
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,498
I hate you. Tell me why.

271
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,575
I've been scanning literature.
Very interesting study in sweden.

272
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:45,535
Apparently, Giovanni's patients
mimic whoever they think's in charge.

273
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,902
Any country with that low
an age of consent and

274
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,344
that high a rate of suicide
isn't thinking straight.

275
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:54,151
- I am in charge of our relationship.
- It was a surgery.

276
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,955
You were the surgeon.
In that setting...

277
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,513
You would pick up
my laundry if I asked you to.

278
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,915
- Go ahead. Ask.
- I wouldn't do that to you.

279
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,351
I want all my personal,
private doctors back right now.

280
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:19,865
Except for Foreman.

281
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:22,924
Your team, Foreman included,
is dealing with the great

282
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:25,797
mayonnaise panic of 2007.

283
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:29,084
Frankly, I'm worried it might
spread to other continents.

284
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:35,957
Lesion on the liver. Possibility...

285
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,754
Why are you doing a pelvic
for food poisoning?

286
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:41,640
She said her hoo hoo burned.

287
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,456
Lesion on the liver. Ideas?

288
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:50,106
Start with a biopsy to rule out cancer.

289
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,877
- Could be an abcess.
- Needle works for that too.

290
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,762
Unless it's a vascular hemangioma.

291
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,875
Aspirate that,
he'll bleed out, we'll kill him.

292
00:16:56,938 --> 00:17:00,048
- If he bleeds out, we know what he had.
- Had?

293
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,904
Two diagnoses out of three, he lives.

294
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,702
We do nothing,
three out of three, he dies.

295
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:06,977
- Go stick his liver.
- Where's Foreman? We should...

296
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:09,226
You need him to draft
your letter of resignation?

297
00:17:09,254 --> 00:17:11,349
You risking our patient's life
to get back at Cuddy?

298
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,370
What? No.

299
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,958
That would be childish.

300
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,201
This is what I'm doing
to get back at Cuddy.

301
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,588
Who here doesn't have
any health insurance?

302
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:24,642
Michael Moore was right.
MRIs, pet scans, neuro-psych tests,

303
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:26,662
private rooms for all these patients.

304
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:28,311
Fight the power!

305
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:33,638
Sorry.

306
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:35,435
I missed.

307
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,416
I have to reposition the needle.

308
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:40,540
You're gonna feel another pinch.

309
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,906
You still with me?

310
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:45,338
I'm here.

311
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:47,632
You feelin' faint?

312
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:49,471
- No.
- What's wrong?

313
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:51,433
It's personal.

314
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:54,906
You got personal problems?
You got no memory.

315
00:17:55,659 --> 00:18:00,659
I'm in a hospital.
I don't want to be in a hospital.

316
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:08,924
- You're sick, so...
- I'm bored.

317
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:16,143
You ask what's wrong,
then you ignore the answer.

318
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,068
Just go on with what you're doing.

319
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:23,871
You think everything's okay
as long as you don't think

320
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:25,624
about it, don't deal with it.

321
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,078
Is that blood?

322
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:33,562
I think it's pus from a fungus.

323
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,589
I have fungus in me?

324
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:38,642
If you've been in the tropics
in the last few months.

325
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:40,854
I saw this in tsunami survivors.

326
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:44,188
Their skin grafts would ooze black pus
sometimes weeks later.

327
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:47,383
Traced the fungus back to
the sand in the tsunami tides.

328
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:50,295
That's so cool!

329
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,998
I think the black pus is fungal.

330
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,609
If I'm right, that's where the cold
agglutins are coming from.

331
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,733
That's what's driving his memory loss.

332
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:03,943
Amber's putting him on amphotericin.
It will cure him.

333
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,055
This makes no sense.

334
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:09,470
I'm doing blood tests to be sure,
but the sooner we get him on...

335
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:11,365
I'm not talking about the infection.

336
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:14,942
Talking about you letting Tonya
Harding administer the treatment.

337
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,585
- I'm out of the game.
- Why?

338
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,765
A couple of weeks ago,
you named me Grumpy.

339
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,562
Said I didn't want to be here,
wanted to be back in the third world.

340
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,538
And you realized I'm right just now?

341
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,248
I got a confirmation.

342
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:29,259
The patient's nuts.

343
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:30,818
The patient's...

344
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:31,994
Unbiased.

345
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:35,920
- The patient has no ax to grind.
- The patient is nuts.

346
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:40,182
I miss my old life. Helping people
who barely have clean water,

347
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:42,808
let alone the kind of medicines
we waste by the SUV load.

348
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,004
You're nuts.

349
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:47,268
You're gonna be miserable.
At home, at work, somewhere.

350
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:50,549
The goal in life
is not to eliminate misery. It's...

351
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:52,560
To keep misery to the minimum.

352
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:54,414
That's inspiring.

353
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:58,826
You said you came back to get married.
What does your fiancee do?

354
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:00,341
She's a court reporter.

355
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,010
Well, I'm sure Thailand will have courts
any day now.

356
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:09,050
Someone's gonna be
miserable sometime. Accept it.

357
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:11,507
That's how I stay so happy.

358
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:15,176
Why do you care if I stay?

359
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:17,096
You're good.

360
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,197
Don't screw it up just
'cause you're miserable.

361
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:25,224
I'm gonna...

362
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,814
Stay till the patient's cured.

363
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:32,795
Which should be in about... An hour.

364
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:41,586
- You okay?
- Not okay.

365
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,268
- Which one of us is he mirroring?
- Well, if it was you,

366
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:46,459
he'd be inflicting pain
on someone else, so...

367
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:51,915
I'd say he's mimicking whichever
one of us happens to be dying.

368
00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:58,842
Heating blanket
wasn't keeping him warm enough.

369
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,056
Ordered a whirlpool,
got his blood flowing.

370
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,742
So far, it's keeping his rash at bay.

371
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:06,057
Rash worse equals
cold agglutinins worse.

372
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,790
Means what was in his liver
wasn't fungus.

373
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,222
- Yeah, labs confirmed...
- That it wasn't even pus.

374
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:14,122
It was just coagulated blood
caused by the cold agglutinins.

375
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:18,804
Which you mistook for a cool fungus
that you saw after the tsunami.

376
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,078
- Same consistency...
- You saw what you wanted to see,

377
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,447
not what was there.

378
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:25,053
Wait a second. Didn't you quit?

379
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,826
I spoke to my fiancee. I'm staying.

380
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,204
Of course you are.

381
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:31,878
'Cause you're the exact
right amount of miserable.

382
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:34,643
Broad spectrum
antibiotics aren't working.

383
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,800
It's gotta be viral or exotic bacteria.

384
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,529
There are a thousand
microbes it could be.

385
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,734
We could repeat all cultures.
Maybe we just missed it.

386
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:41,585
Or...

387
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,981
We could get an accurate history.

388
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:53,799
We're workin' on it.

389
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,470
Well, that'll be
a good solace to the widow x.

390
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:58,525
<i>His car was towed,</i>
and the tow gate's locked.

391
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:00,092
Guys must be out on a run.

392
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,409
<i>That's why I sent two of you...</i>

393
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:03,632
One of you breaks in.
The other posts bail.

394
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:05,652
Getting arrested is not
what I'm worried about.

395
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:06,763
Not a problem.

396
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:08,867
You know how to kill dogs, right?

397
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:16,802
So we're back to repeating
all the cultures.

398
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:18,002
Or...

399
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:19,868
We get an accurate history.

400
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:21,581
Didn't we just rule out
that possibility?

401
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:24,175
You guys ever heard
any of my metaphors yet?

402
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:27,342
Come on.
Sit on grandpa's lap as I tell you

403
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,659
how infections are criminals,
the immune system's the police.

404
00:22:30,928 --> 00:22:33,008
Seriously, Grumpy. Get up here.

405
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:34,697
It'll make us both happy.

406
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:38,088
Anyway,
cops don't just let crooks run free.

407
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,212
They keep fingerprints, mug shots.

408
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:43,839
The immune system does the same thing,
only it calls them antibodies.

409
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:46,035
We find out what diseases
he's had in his life,

410
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:48,909
good chance that'll tell us
where he's been in his life.

411
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:52,142
Alice, your turn the looking glass.

412
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:54,013
Draw blood and CSF.

413
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:58,205
Wait, guys.

414
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:00,718
I haven't signed off on this.

415
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,210
You seem like a good guy.

416
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:16,906
Cuddy seems decent.

417
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:18,624
House... Doesn't.

418
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:22,152
It means either you're gonna give in,
or Cuddy is.

419
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:23,514
Either way...

420
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,375
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:38,752
- Your boyfriend has me at even odds.
- So? Talk to him.

422
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:39,851
I did.

423
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,774
Said he's just responding
to market forces.

424
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,925
He is. I got a hundred on you.

425
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:49,937
What do you care what
other people are betting on?

426
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,279
If he's trying to screw with me

427
00:23:51,316 --> 00:23:53,809
'cause he's jealous Cuddy didn't
ask him to take this job...

428
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:55,898
Right. You're figuring
he's jealous of your misery.

429
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,929
- He's messed up enough...
- The problem is you're not miserable.

430
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:01,136
Then House has been wasting
a lot of time.

431
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,532
You've been humiliated,
treated like crap.

432
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:06,068
You've every right to be miserable,
but you're not, because

433
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:10,035
even though this job is insane
and House is insane, you like it.

434
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:12,031
You always have.

435
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:14,300
You know what's worse
than a sanctimonious speech?

436
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,445
A sanctimonious speech
that's dead wrong.

437
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:17,349
See?

438
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,517
You belong with House.

439
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,329
We're gonna use your spinal fluid
to tell us where you lived.

440
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:27,339
Cool.

441
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:28,758
Not really.

442
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,511
It's a poor substitute for
an actual history, and without...

443
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:33,289
It's cool.

444
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:37,119
Yes, it is.

445
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:41,023
I need you to stay as still as possible.
Ignore the pain.

446
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,459
Bring the pain.

447
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:46,410
I am not a masochist.

448
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,563
Neither am I.

449
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:52,028
I know, but I was responding
to you responding to...

450
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:54,262
Never mind.

451
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:56,949
I just like experience.

452
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:58,770
If it's new, it's interesting.

453
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,072
Yeah? Not me.

454
00:25:00,236 --> 00:25:02,629
I don't just like new. I gotta have new.

455
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:04,457
If it's not there, I make it there.

456
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,575
Really, I'm just easily bored.

457
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:09,406
There are 300 million
people in this country.

458
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,057
If I'm doing exactly
what everyone else is doing,

459
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:14,311
then who the hell am I?
You know what I mean?

460
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:17,108
I'm just about finished.

461
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,145
I like hot tubs.

462
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:21,684
They're nice.

463
00:25:28,554 --> 00:25:29,582
You don't knock?

464
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:31,747
Are you putting K-Y jelly
on his phone receiver?

465
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:34,930
An exploding snake in his drawer?

466
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,770
No.

467
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,579
I'm replacing his vicodin stash
with laxatives.

468
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:41,176
Don't.

469
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:43,435
- Don't stoop to his level.
- Why?

470
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,541
Because he's suddenly gonna realize
he's no longer 14?

471
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:50,330
Either I take his garbage forever,
or I give him a reason to stop.

472
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:52,614
You don't have to make him miserable.
Just...

473
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:54,572
Make him think that he's won.

474
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm not gonna fire Foreman.

475
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:58,559
I said think he's won.

476
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,751
Find some other way to soothe his ego.

477
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:02,201
The thing's big enough.

478
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,648
You must be able to find some
corner to polish.

479
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:08,627
Where were you two hours ago?

480
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:12,022
Where were you?

481
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,629
- What do you have?
- High titer to histoplasmosis.

482
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:22,784
Probably lived in the Ohio River Valley.

483
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:25,156
Also weakly positive on coccidiomycosis.

484
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:27,099
Weak means older.

485
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:31,055
Means he moved to Ohio from
the San Joaquin Valley.

486
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,888
Or he happened to visit California.

487
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,593
He's also positive for chagas disease.

488
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,024
Central America.

489
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,170
Or he kissed his maid from el Salvador.

490
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:41,577
Or he sat next to someone from Belize
on a flight to Weehawken.

491
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:43,399
Or he ate lettuce from Honduras.

492
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:45,297
Yes, you're right, buzz kill.

493
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,651
This tells us next to nothing.

494
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,710
But since that's on the something
side of nothing,

495
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,985
thought we'd go with it.

496
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:51,777
His rash is back.

497
00:26:51,802 --> 00:26:54,001
Hot tub isn't hot enough
to keep his body warm.

498
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,428
So we take his body out of the picture.

499
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:59,072
Let's hit him from the inside.
Lipopolysaccharide.

500
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,863
LPS won't just give him a fever.

501
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,655
He could hit 110, fry his brain.

502
00:27:11,837 --> 00:27:14,907
<i>Or make him just toasty enough to keep
his blood flowing free.</i>

503
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,272
<i>Like my bowels.</i>

504
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:17,485
<i>You smell that?</i>

505
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,549
<i>Not gonna get sweeter.</i>

506
00:27:19,984 --> 00:27:22,225
You nailed Brennan for seeing
what he wanted to see.

507
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:23,495
You're no different.

508
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:25,861
<i>But you are.
You used to like this stuff.</i>

509
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,872
<i>You left here because you didn't
like what you were turning into.</i>

510
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:32,469
<i>You like who you are now?
You like being Cuddy's errand boy.</i>

511
00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:36,415
<i>That was just a courtesy flush.
I'm not actually done.</i>

512
00:27:40,885 --> 00:27:42,351
You want to induce a fever?

513
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,190
Unless you're willing
to don a white t-shirt

514
00:27:44,235 --> 00:27:45,687
and hop into the hot tub with him,

515
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:47,861
I need another way
keep him warm, or he dies.

516
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:49,130
You could maim him.

517
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,346
- I could cure him.
- I'm not letting you do it.

518
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:52,526
You gonna fire me?

519
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:55,230
No.

520
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:00,972
Wait a second.
What the hell was that?

521
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:04,403
You were won over
by my soaring rhetoric?

522
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,870
I basically just threatened
to hold my breathe.

523
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:12,039
You never intended to stop me.

524
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,467
You just pretended to stop me,

525
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:16,329
you could pretend to fail to stop me,

526
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,039
so you could stroke my ego.

527
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:21,910
War doesn't end till Foreman's gone.

528
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:24,358
Foreman's not going anywhere.

529
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:25,219
And...

530
00:28:25,342 --> 00:28:27,817
I know when my vicodin isn't vicodin.

531
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:31,402
Do you know when your birth control
pills aren't birth control pills?

532
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:37,129
If we can keep your fever up,
we can get you back on dry land.

533
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:39,426
You feeling okay?

534
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:42,859
Surprisingly, yeah.

535
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:45,102
I feel pretty good.

536
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:47,106
That's not the way fevers usually work.

537
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,486
Nothing around here works the way
it's supposed to work.

538
00:28:53,353 --> 00:28:54,357
No kidding.

539
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,938
You're giving me a fever.

540
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:59,561
Doctors don't give people fevers.

541
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:01,927
It was necessary to keep
your blood flowing.

542
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,780
Yeah.

543
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,586
It was necessary.

544
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,650
And that was all that mattered.

545
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:14,688
It's exciting, isn't it?

546
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,834
You're happy?

547
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:20,554
Why wouldn't I be?

548
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,087
Hey, you with me?

549
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:29,525
I need help in here!

550
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:33,761
- Defib. We gotta shock him.
- Get him outta the water.

551
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:36,016
- How long's he been out?
- Just a few seconds.

552
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:44,691
<i>- He's dry enough.
- Not yet!</i>

553
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,138
<i>- Dry faster.
- Ten more seconds.</i>

554
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:48,299
- He'll get brain damage.
- Kutner, you'll arc.

555
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,301
- He's dry enough. Clear.
- You're gonna.

556
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,672
It worked.

557
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:00,417
For one of them.

558
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:05,669
Cardiac arrest.

559
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:07,934
We were able to shock him
back to normal sinus rhythm

560
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:09,921
and Kutner nearly into a coma.

561
00:30:09,973 --> 00:30:13,156
So now you've electrocuted yourself,

562
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,034
and set a patient on fire.

563
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,685
- I like the dedication.
- Thank you.

564
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:19,403
- Wasn't a compliment.
- Yeah, it was.

565
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,641
The insult comes now.

566
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,893
You're insane.

567
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,357
<i>Either you have an aversion to towels,
or you want pain.</i>

568
00:30:25,596 --> 00:30:28,165
I think both. I'm thinking it goes back
to high hool gym.

569
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,706
Anybody think we should discuss

570
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,118
which infection is causing
the cold agglutinins

571
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:33,751
before they stop his heart again?

572
00:30:34,442 --> 00:30:35,676
Sure, why not?

573
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:39,457
Until they find his car,

574
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,735
we have to assume he's traveled to Ohio,

575
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:44,532
California, Central America,
and possibly Weehawken.

576
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,558
- Nothing on the blood cultures.
- Do 'em again.

577
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:47,970
Quadruple run time.

578
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:51,060
We know the infection is in his heart.

579
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:52,228
We do a biopsy.

580
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:54,138
<i>We see polys, we got bacterial.</i>

581
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,327
Lymphs, we got viral.

582
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:58,184
He just had a heart attack.
Ripping out a piece might kill him.

583
00:30:58,672 --> 00:30:59,926
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:02,131
We biopsy his toe instead.

585
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:05,365
No! That's a terrible idea.

586
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,136
Won't tell us anything.

587
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:08,899
Biopsy his heart. Come on.

588
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:10,226
I'll join you.

589
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:17,921
I got you a job.

590
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:21,154
Mount Zion hospital in Boston.

591
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,500
They have a great
diagnostics department.

592
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:26,257
Gil Christ said he'd take you anyway.

593
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:28,878
That was...

594
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:30,674
Very nice of you.

595
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:33,398
God.
Does everything have to be about you?

596
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,128
It's simple math.

597
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,557
I'm not gonna back down.
You're not gonna back down.

598
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,165
Cuddy's not gonna back down.
No one's gonna be happy here.

599
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:42,940
And cuddy's gonna end up pregnant.

600
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,488
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

601
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:46,777
Are you saying?

602
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:48,808
- When did you having sex ?
- Starts monday.

603
00:31:49,552 --> 00:31:50,902
I could help to pack.

604
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:54,778
I don't want the job.

605
00:31:57,412 --> 00:31:58,415
Why not?

606
00:31:58,827 --> 00:31:59,946
You're miserable.

607
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:01,511
Apparently not.

608
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,171
Well, you're gonna be.

609
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:07,123
Are you smiling?

610
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,361
No.

611
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:12,019
Do your own stupid biopsy.

612
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,257
His name's Robert Elliot.
He's from Hamilton, Ohio.

613
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,839
Here's everything he had in
his trunk and his glove box.

614
00:32:33,193 --> 00:32:34,968
No need for the heart biopsy.

615
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,452
I now know exactly who he is
and what he has.

616
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:41,388
- You saved his life.
- Really?

617
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:42,481
No, you idiot.

618
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,515
It's vapor rub and lunch receipts.

619
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:47,908
We have his name. We can find his doctor
get his medical records.

620
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:50,485
It's 8:00 at night.
The biopsy will be faster.

621
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:54,131
Not fast enough to save him,
and that's hardly the point.

622
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,014
Thirteen.

623
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:01,799
Is your name thirteen?

624
00:33:04,438 --> 00:33:06,445
Why did you volunteer
to go street walking?

625
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,002
I thought I could help that way.

626
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:10,234
A black mormon could help that way.

627
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,583
There's no reason for
you to want to be there.

628
00:33:12,979 --> 00:33:15,372
Which means there's a reason
you didn't want to be here.

629
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,565
Didn't want to look in the mirror?

630
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:29,501
<i>Hi.</i>

631
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,119
Cuddy called.

632
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:33,219
She needs you to iron her shirts.

633
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:34,464
We'll take over.

634
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:37,794
Go ahead.

635
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,836
Just... talk to him.

636
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:51,424
You might feel a little tug
when the catheter's in the heart.

637
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:52,647
Come on.

638
00:33:53,168 --> 00:33:54,885
Make him feel comfortable.

639
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,269
I've done this procedure dozens
of times. It's completely...

640
00:33:58,288 --> 00:33:59,291
My god.

641
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:02,993
You are incredibly hot.

642
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,420
I'm not here. Deal with her.

643
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:07,993
Are you an idiot?

644
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,491
<i>Do you not think she's hot?</i>

645
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:12,463
I'm not the alpha here. She is.

646
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:13,721
She's my boss.

647
00:34:15,947 --> 00:34:17,028
The rash is back.

648
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:20,950
Increase the drip.

649
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:24,890
If you think that's
the right thing to do.

650
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:28,406
This is so frustrating.

651
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,718
I don't think that's me.

652
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:39,068
Hey.

653
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,204
Get in there. See how he's doing.

654
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:42,727
You were just in there.

655
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:45,651
Apparently, It's impossible to see
anything else while I'm in there.

656
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:48,325
I'm a blinding white hot light of power.

657
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:50,763
Got it.

658
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:52,175
Pink.

659
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:53,390
Good size.

660
00:34:53,984 --> 00:34:55,103
Nice specimen.

661
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,219
I'm scared.

662
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:58,971
It's okay.

663
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:00,917
It's gonna be okay.

664
00:35:01,994 --> 00:35:02,804
No.

665
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:06,521
No, it's not.

666
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:11,410
I'm not interested in how he's doing.

667
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:13,025
I'm interested in how she's doing.

668
00:35:13,047 --> 00:35:15,478
So get in there and tell me
how he's doing.

669
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,623
You think he'll mimic her
if I'm in there with her?

670
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,020
You're a powerful, dominating man,

671
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:22,335
- but who knows?
- So I'm gonna get fired before her.

672
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:25,465
Yes, you're gonna get fired right now
unless you get in there.

673
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:27,302
Nothing on the biopsy.

674
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:29,126
And how is he?

675
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:31,362
- His fever's at 106.
- I know.

676
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:33,265
But how is he?

677
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,696
Bitter? Sexually frustrated?

678
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,782
He's delightful.

679
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:40,140
Loves the smell of freshly
baked rhubarb pie

680
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,502
and isn't afraid to love.

681
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,131
Also, his rash is coming back.

682
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,503
He needs the meds and the tub

683
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:46,047
<i>just to keep him stable.</i>

684
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:47,423
Fine. Soak him again.

685
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:49,054
He'll be happy. Loves hot tubs.

686
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:50,727
No, you love hot tubs.

687
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:53,734
Find the rest of the gang. Tell them
to meet me in the lecture hall.

688
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,099
I hate hot tubs.

689
00:35:56,395 --> 00:35:57,411
What did you say?

690
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:00,666
- I hate...
- He likes.

691
00:36:03,315 --> 00:36:04,464
who else was in there.

692
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:05,682
No one.

693
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:08,038
You didn't think to mention that.

694
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,469
The guy likes warm, swirling water.

695
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:12,284
I didn't know that was diagnostic.

696
00:36:12,315 --> 00:36:13,208
It's not.

697
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:17,087
What it is is the water hit him,
and he had a thought.

698
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:19,498
Not about you, but about him.

699
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:24,069
We need to splash him some more.

700
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:48,422
Do I know you?

701
00:36:51,504 --> 00:36:52,735
You look familiar.

702
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:54,732
You too.

703
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:57,072
My name's Robert Elliot.

704
00:36:59,328 --> 00:37:00,853
I'm from Hamilton, Ohio.

705
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,112
Me too.

706
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,516
What do you do?

707
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:10,076
Don't know... stuff.

708
00:37:10,757 --> 00:37:11,812
Me too.

709
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:17,825
What brings you to New Jersey?

710
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,150
Is it work or vacation?

711
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,997
Work.

712
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,340
What type of work?

713
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:35,869
I'm tired.

714
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:56,614
I eat out a lot.

715
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,238
In a lot of restaurants.

716
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:04,044
"Notty pine".

717
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,552
"Ritchies."

718
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:09,898
I know those places.

719
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:14,335
They're good, uh?

720
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:16,079
They're convenient.

721
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:17,757
For what?

722
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:18,932
They're on the road.

723
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,471
You're on the road a lot?

724
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:23,912
No more than you, I suppose.

725
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:30,174
You ever use this stuff?

726
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:34,235
I use it all the time.

727
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:39,137
I use it all the time.

728
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:40,981
Yeah. I just said that.

729
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,497
You know,
the cool thing about this stuff is...

730
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:47,282
You can do a lot with it.

731
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:49,862
Soften your skin, treat scrapes.

732
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,754
Naughty stuff.

733
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:10,599
Why did you do that?

734
00:39:14,162 --> 00:39:15,178
Because...

735
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,786
Doesn't smell like dung.

736
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,162
You're saying you like the smell?

737
00:39:24,914 --> 00:39:26,419
Not really.

738
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:29,595
Just doesn't smell like dung.

739
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:33,776
But something else does smell like dung.

740
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:35,502
Yeah.

741
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:36,893
Dung.

742
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,886
You guys ready?

743
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:46,549
Now is the time.

744
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,163
You stare at me

745
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:50,059
in slack-jawed amazement.

746
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:52,303
He sells farm equipment.

747
00:39:53,713 --> 00:39:54,514
See?

748
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:57,383
Pig lagoons, pig farms.

749
00:39:57,655 --> 00:39:59,303
And, as every child knows,

750
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,276
where you have pigs, you have pig poo.

751
00:40:01,994 --> 00:40:04,183
But as very few children know,

752
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:07,208
where you have pig poo,
you have eperythrozoon infection.

753
00:40:07,826 --> 00:40:09,390
We'll start him on clarithromycin.

754
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:11,862
This time tomorrow,

755
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:13,527
he'll be back to his old self.

756
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:15,217
Whoever that might be.

757
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:16,836
It can wait.

758
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,739
He has a temperature of 107.

759
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:21,045
It can wait 15 minutes.

760
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,110
You know where Cuddy is?

761
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:29,019
Hi. I'm the dean of Medicine.

762
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:30,640
Hi.

763
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,969
I'm the guy who saved your life.

764
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:35,376
So what if it's House?

765
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:37,598
Then I take the job at Mount Zion.

766
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:39,395
There is no job at Mount Zion.

767
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:40,385
House said...

768
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:42,189
Well, if House said it, it must be true.

769
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:43,562
I can fire him.

770
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:44,834
<i>I can fire him now.</i>

771
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:47,061
I can fire him tomorrow.
I don't even need a reason.

772
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:48,945
She doesn't fire me.
She never will fire me.

773
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:50,994
- She needs me.
- He's a good doctor. That's all.

774
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:53,616
- I respect his expertise, and I...
- She's hot for me.

775
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:55,916
- Always...
- Shut up!

776
00:40:57,786 --> 00:40:59,642
Well, that could have been either of us.

777
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:03,005
You have great ya-bos.

778
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,212
Still could have been either of us.

779
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,626
You lose.

780
00:41:13,942 --> 00:41:14,978
Seriously!

781
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,925
I have always thought my breasts
were one of my best features.

782
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:20,269
Damn.

783
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,292
You all suck.

784
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:37,653
The two of you,
took 14 hours to find a car.

785
00:41:38,775 --> 00:41:42,738
You forgot to mention the guy
with no memory had memories.

786
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,298
If you keep on thinking that insane guys

787
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:49,358
have hidden wisdom, you're gonna
wind up shooting people on a subway.

788
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,058
- Something.
- So...

789
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:56,824
Which one of us sucks the most?

790
00:41:57,457 --> 00:41:58,473
It's a tie.

791
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,290
- Between?
- All of you.

792
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:02,068
We're all fired?

793
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,582
None of you are fired.

794
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:15,894
That was nice of you.

795
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:17,932
Sure.

796
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:19,548
Why didn't you fire anyone?

797
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:21,385
They're good doctors.

798
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,299
Right. Why didn't you let Brennan quit?

799
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:26,273
- He's a good doctor.
- Right.

800
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,545
By not letting anyone go,
you made six people happy,

801
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,925
and one person happy and rich.

802
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,994
Chase won every one of those bets.

803
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:37,699
So, either you're
just really nice, or...

804
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,194
What's your cut?

805
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:42,089
50%.

806
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,392
How bad do you wanna keep your job?

807
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:46,523
I'll keep my mouth shut.

808
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:53,089
You actually do wanna stay, don't you?

809
00:42:54,046 --> 00:42:55,160
I think I do.

810
00:42:56,117 --> 00:42:57,680
Everyone of those idiots,

811
00:42:57,778 --> 00:43:00,186
got some insight about themselves from
the pig salesman.

812
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,071
Not one of them did anything about it.

813
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,002
People don't learn. They don't change.
But you did.

814
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,300
You're a freak.
