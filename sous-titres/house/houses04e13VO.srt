1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,499
Whoever thought walking in a circle at
two miles an hour would be draining?

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,698
Fresh air,
exercise.

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,299
You know, some things
do have their negative sides.

4
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:18,480
Our income just got cut
in half.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,180
And we get to spend
twice as much time together.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,444
More, if you don't leave
before your lunch hour's over.

7
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:27,334
Out of my way.

8
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:30,700
We have a legal right
to hold you up for 15 seconds.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,493
15...

10
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:32,952
- 14,
- One.

11
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:33,913
11,

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,330
<i>10,</i>

13
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:40,168
just trying to do my job.

14
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,946
Hey, relax...

15
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:45,757
Three more seconds,
and you can go.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,636
Are you telling me
what to do?

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,300
It's okay.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,391
Just take a breath.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,685
Get the hell off me.

20
00:00:58,193 --> 00:00:59,792
I think it's been 15.

21
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:04,317
You okay?

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,782
Oh, my god, Jeff!

www.house-fr.com

26
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:00,415
This place is a mess.

27
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:03,199
Welcome to a world without nurses.
Here, you can start with these.

28
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,200
<i>It's not my fault.
I didn't use nurses.</i>

29
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:07,730
Cuddy was looking for you.
Said she'd send you here.

30
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,321
I know, that's why I'm here.

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,676
Because Cuddy hasn't found you yet.

32
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:15,600
She's gonna look everywhere
except the place she wants me to be.

33
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:32,822
- I've got an aortic dissection here.
- What's with the idiot?

34
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:38,369
Fainting spell and recent
history of dysgeusia.

35
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,288
<i>Everything tastes
like lemon meringue pie.</i>

36
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:41,539
You wanna take him?

37
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:42,582
No.

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,754
Sir.

39
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:50,733
Why do you have
two lunches in front of you?

40
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:52,675
Been here for two meals.

41
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:55,720
- And you're happy with that?
- No.

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,972
I just don't see much use
in complaining.

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,349
Seriously?

44
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,112
It's a very useful tool.

45
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:06,114
Complain, you make people
miserable.

46
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,691
They do what you want
to make the misery go away.

47
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:10,600
You probably should say something.

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,105
- Maybe I can call one of the doctors...
- They're doing their best.

49
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:20,568
What the hell?

50
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,873
I'm sure
it was an accident.

51
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,045
Is he canadian?

52
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:28,243
He's a low priority...

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,129
Is that a yes?

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,257
- He's just...
- Happy.

55
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:36,893
I gotta stop this
before it spreads.

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,181
You guys are done.

57
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:44,580
This could be
a metabolic disorder,

58
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,159
toxic exposure,

59
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:50,099
carcinoma of the tongue, metastasized
the brain, epilepsy, M.S.

60
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,499
Or it could be the flu, and we should
all be back in the ER.

61
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,900
No, you're ignoring
the big symptom.

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,304
What if we're looking at both
the flu and decent parenting?

63
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,288
Okay, you two
are perfectly healthy.

64
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,261
This guy wasn't pandering.
He wasn't vanilla nice.

65
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:07,917
He was nice without any aspiration,

66
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:09,168
<i>personal gain.</i>

67
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:11,202
I'm thinking genetic defect.

68
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:12,881
Niceness is a defect?

69
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,414
Three cavemen see a stranger

70
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:18,720
running towards them with a spear.
One fights, one flees,

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,680
one smiles and invites him over
for fondue.

72
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,099
That last guy didn't last
long enough to procreate.

73
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,879
And how long
has the patient been suffering?

74
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,399
At least as long as his wife
has known him. 11 years.

75
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,524
The chances of him having
an undiagnosed pathology

76
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,407
<i>- for that long-
- What are you saying?</i>

77
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:35,180
that evolution is wrong?

78
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,148
Where do you think we are?
21st-century america.

79
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:40,797
<i>He's saying that statistics
are true too.</i>

80
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,327
The world is a bell curve.

81
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,704
<i>Most of us fall within the standard
deviation,</i>

82
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,199
<i>but there are outliers,</i>

83
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,299
and if we believe
in the existence

84
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,234
of extreme jerkiness,
which I suspect that we do...

85
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,099
Then we also have to accept
the existence

86
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:57,550
of the opposite extreme.

87
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,678
You want it to be a symptom because
then we're supposed to be jerks,

88
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:03,510
<i>which means you don't even
have to try to be nice.</i>

89
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,361
Okay. Maybe I'm biased.

90
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,599
Let's take a vote.

91
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,938
Who thinks that niceness
is not a symptom?

92
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,857
And who thinks

93
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:14,738
that their vote counts?

94
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,199
You two,
check out his home for toxins.

95
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:23,034
- <I>taub and thirty-one...
- Thirty-one?

96
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,913
oh, I'm sorry, I thought that either way
was good with you.

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
Taub and thirteen,

98
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,498
mri for tumors
and eeg for nerve damage.

99
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:34,009
Test whatever comes out of him
for everything else.

100
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,435
<i>Too much axis tilt.</i>

101
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,022
Don't release until your thumb's
at the bottom of the ball.

102
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:56,574
I assume wilson was busy.

103
00:05:56,869 --> 00:05:57,762
Again.

104
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,000
No axis tilt.

105
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,244
With amber?

106
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,300
Again.

107
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,120
Still, it was nice of you
to invite me.

108
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,200
This is fun.

109
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:27,073
No, it wasn't.
No, it isn't.

110
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,037
I didn't invite you to be nice.

111
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:31,770
I invited you because bowling
isn't one of the two things

112
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,563
guys do by themselves.

113
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:35,067
What's the second thing?

114
00:06:35,432 --> 00:06:36,626
Other hand.

115
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:42,613
<i>If people are incapable of</i>

116
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,449
being nice,
why bother having the word?

117
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:47,499
The ontological proof of niceness.

118
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:50,200
The existence of the word
proves the existence of the concept.

119
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,957
Look out for those minotaurs
on your drive home.

120
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,878
And I thought motives didn't matter.
Only results mattered.

121
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:00,256
So what are you gonna do

122
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,999
to screw up wilson's relationship

123
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,391
so you don't have to listen to me
while you bowl?

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,280
I wish the best
for them

125
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,900
and their tragically deformed
children.

126
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:13,061
Well, she's good
at being bad.

127
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:16,355
You might not be able
to destroy her.

128
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:18,380
As long as I give it
my best shot.

129
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,948
I'm gonna hold my head high.

130
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:22,905
Cameron had
this one insufferable friend.

131
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:26,000
She wasn't gonna get rid of her,
and I sure wasn't gonna join 'em.

132
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,785
So I just said,
"see her on thursdays."

133
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,205
<i>I know it's not as exciting
as an exploding birthday cake,</i>

134
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:33,599
but, hell,

135
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,918
I don't want to hang out
with her every night anyway.

136
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:38,379
That's amazing.

137
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:41,230
Cameron only has
one insufferable friend?

138
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:00,446
Joint custody.

139
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:02,280
Of wilson?

140
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,195
Unless we have
another love child.

141
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,080
Deal with him.

142
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,900
He needs
a mother figure.

143
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,425
I'm not saying you're not entitled
to spend time with him.

144
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:13,275
I'm just saying I'm entitled too.

145
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,041
I don't know how to deal with him
when he's being reasonable.

146
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:18,334
<i>This is reasonable?</i>

147
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:19,689
this is crazy.

148
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,900
You're not a child.
You can make your own plans.

149
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,299
No, crazy is

150
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,341
<i>what House would normally do
in this situation</i>

151
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,220
swap your lubricant with superglue.

152
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,344
The man knows me.

153
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:31,639
This is his way of accepting us.

154
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:33,980
It's actually
a very touching moment.

155
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,686
I'm proposing I get
every other day

156
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:38,454
and every other weekend.

157
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:44,400
I have yoga wednesdays.
You can have him then.

158
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,471
But you have to have him
home by 11:00.

159
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,158
We can swap weekends.

160
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:53,828
Mondays and wednesdays,
and midnight.

161
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:56,455
If he's not home till midnight,
we won't be asleep till almost 2:00.

162
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,478
Wilson, make a ruling.

163
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:01,367
no.

164
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:03,421
You two are like dogs

165
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:05,239
circling each other
in the park.

166
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,884
And I say that
with all the love in the world.

167
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:09,734
<i>You need to sniff each other's butts,</i>

168
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:12,299
<i>bare your teeth, and arrive
at some strange detente.</i>

169
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,780
Otherwise, you'll end up
biting each other's eyes out.

170
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,813
Again...

171
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:17,768
with all the love in the world.

172
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,148
I'll let you sniff first.

173
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,859
Take my deal,
or get out of my apartment.

174
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,450
Take my deal,

175
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:28,362
or I move in.

176
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,079
This guy worked
for habitat for humanity

177
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,642
<i>- in Costa Rica.
- And coaches handicapped kids.</i>

178
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,857
You think we should do a work-up
on the other coaches?

179
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,502
it is possible
he's too perfect.

180
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:45,961
I'm not saying he's perfect.
I'm saying he's trying to be.

181
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,256
That's what people do.

182
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,169
What?

183
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,700
That's not what people do.

184
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,798
People usually suck,
but they want to be good,

185
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,390
<i>- want to be nice.
- House?</i>

186
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,559
exception that proves
the rule.

187
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,729
- What sort of argument is that?
- A bad one.

188
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,770
That might be relevant.

189
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,080
Hydrofluoric acid.

190
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,900
Lowers his calcium, causes
the fainting and taste issue.

191
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,405
But not the niceness.

192
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,674
Wouldn't that be nice?

193
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,957
You are king solomon.

194
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:24,980
If you want us to cut him
in half, we're cool with that.

195
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,769
My boyfriend's too much of a wuss
to make the call for himself.

196
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,174
And I mean that with all the love
in the world.

197
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:33,234
I'm gonna piss off one of them,
and they both scare me.

198
00:10:51,012 --> 00:10:53,572
"your treatment of patients
is reprehensible."

199
00:10:53,732 --> 00:10:55,866
- you're reading his performance review?
- I'm busy.

200
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:57,464
We have a nurses' strike.

201
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,121
"Your management of employees
borders on abuse."

202
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,622
Let's go.

203
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:03,571
No, why...

204
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:05,668
I want to hear it.

205
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:07,420
<i>"You are overtly contemptuous</i>

206
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,047
- of hospital hierarchy."
- And covertly.

207
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,591
I suppose you didn't know about that.

208
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:16,095
"your attitude towards
supervisory personnel

209
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:19,080
"is disrespectful, and a disturbingly
large proportion of your comments

210
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,390
are racist or sexist."

211
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,977
that top makes you look
like an afghani prostitute.

212
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:25,855
Would be an example
of that.

213
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:27,023
Sign this.

214
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:30,759
<i>I got the-
It can wait.</i>

215
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:33,299
I will sign,
if you will give us a ruling.

216
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,866
I will give you a ruling, if you do
the reviews on your team.

217
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:43,856
I'd be happy to continue
the mockery of this process.

218
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,017
What'd you offer him?

219
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,252
Wednesdays till 11:00 and
alternate weekends.

220
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:50,671
Wednesdays till 11:00 and
alternate weekends.

221
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:51,844
Yes.

222
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,383
Wednesday nights
are ladies' nights at cheetah's.

223
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,757
- Calcium's normal.
- Wow, it really could wait.

224
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:01,017
- Everything's normal.
- And you thought it wouldn't be.

225
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,529
He's a carpet cleaner. He's got a home
full of hydrofluoric acid.

226
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,437
That doesn't mean his calcium
should be low.

227
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,399
It kinda does.
Hf causes lower levels of-

228
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,814
Lower,
not low.

229
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:10,813
- Lower than normal.
- Lower than yesterday.

230
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:13,610
Yesterday might have been high.
What's lower than high?

231
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:17,080
He actually has hypercalcemia,

232
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,999
which is being lowered to normal
by the hf.

233
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,712
So what gives us elevated calcium,
bad taste, and fainting?

234
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:22,953
I take it you know?

235
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:25,580
Get the team.
This is gonna be fun.

236
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,322
Hello, again.

237
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:34,700
These people think
you are not too nice.

238
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:36,763
Too nice?

239
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:38,037
For what?

240
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,721
For life as we know it to have evolved
without an intelligent designer.

241
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,390
<i>I'm going to prove them wrong.</i>

242
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,199
Your wife is very ugly.

243
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,300
- Get out of here.
- Deb.

244
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,764
He's obviously trying
to prove a point.

245
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:53,192
I think I just did.

246
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:55,900
<i>You're either perfect
or you're sick.</i>

247
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:57,863
In my experience,
sick is much more common.

248
00:12:58,023 --> 00:12:59,799
He's not sick. He's nice.

249
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,681
Nice in the sense that
your toaster is nice

250
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:03,099
<i>for making you breakfast.</i>

251
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:05,180
It's the only thing his wiring
will let him do.

252
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,892
He has williams syndrome.

253
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:08,582
<i>Your husband is missing
the genes</i>

254
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:10,501
that make him suspicious.

255
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:11,794
You're wrong.

256
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,671
- <I>He's...
- relax, there's no cure.

257
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,507
<i>He's gonna go right on
tasting lemon meringue pie,</i>

258
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,384
fainting,
and being a sap.

259
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:21,303
- What about the other symptoms?
- He has no other symptoms.

260
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:22,721
But williams does.

261
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,348
He's got teeth,

262
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,767
- glasses.
- Williams cuts iq by 20.

263
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:28,978
He doesn't work
in the physics department.

264
00:13:29,138 --> 00:13:31,199
<i>Except when they spill
a black hole on their carpet.</i>

265
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:32,356
Elfin appearance?

266
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,680
Yeah, he's more legolas
than keebler,

267
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,321
but I bet you he can still crack
off a batch of pecan sandies.

268
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:40,600
Perfect pitch?

269
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,173
You love to karaoke,
right?

270
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:44,577
I suck.

271
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,204
- Modest. Another symptom.
- No, he really

272
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:48,414
does suck.

273
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:49,915
Give us a warble.

274
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,180
- You know any cher?
- No.

275
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,377
But I know bread.

276
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,002
What's the matter?

277
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:16,044
He's stroking.

278
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,600
Had a moment too soon.

279
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:32,264
<i>You were wrong.</i>

280
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,753
Why do people say that
with such pleasure?

281
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,399
It's very hurtful, you know.

282
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:39,437
It means the patient gets
to keep being nice.

283
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:41,699
- Why does that offend you?
- It's the way he said it.

284
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:43,781
He wasn't relieved,
he was excited.

285
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,931
He was also wrong.

286
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,004
And I say that
with no sense of pleasure.

287
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:51,685
Patient's negative for williams which
means the stroke and everything else

288
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:53,938
- wasn't caused...
- You have a friendly demeanor,

289
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:56,148
but you sometimes get
too involved.

290
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:58,734
You relate well
to your peers and patients.

291
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:00,611
<i>And you complete tasks</i>

292
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:02,029
in a timely manner.

293
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,572
Please sign.

294
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,407
What the hell was that?

295
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,646
I have to give each of you
performance reviews.

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,996
Plenty of other conditions
can cause debilitating niceness.

297
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:12,706
How is that supposed
to help him?

298
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,167
I don't know.
How's it supposed to help wilson?

299
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,431
Cross out wilson's name and the date,
and then fill in your own name.

300
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,099
The point of a review
is to give feedback to help.

301
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,591
I'm thinking neurosyphilis.

302
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,300
Wouldn't show up on the MRI
without contrast.

303
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,476
I'll go run the tests.

304
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,099
He doesn't think
it's syphilis,

305
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:39,149
but he's gonna go run
those tests anyway.

306
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:41,337
Because he doesn't know.

307
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,695
- That's why we do tests.
- Because he's a wimp.

308
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,322
Because he's afraid
of you.

309
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,842
You want me to intimidate him
into not being afraid?

310
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,299
- Not sure I know how to do that.
- Reviews make a difference.

311
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,270
People have to listen,
so they have to learn.

312
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,999
I don't think that the right time
to tell the dog not to pee on the rug

313
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:56,166
is semi-annually.

314
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,938
You don't want to do
the paperwork.

315
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,045
I am concerned
about the rainforest.

316
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:03,621
I'll do it.

317
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:05,104
I know.

318
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,200
I don't have syphilis.

319
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,396
You don't know.

320
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,399
How many ways are there
to get it?

321
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:18,199
You can know
who you had sex with.

322
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,190
- <I>you can't know who she...
- I do.

323
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,536
Not for sure.

324
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:23,480
It's a waste of time.

325
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,570
I had a stroke.

326
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,654
You can't keep wasting time.

327
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,100
- We were tested for the peace corps.
- Ten years ago.

328
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,453
You haven't been with your wife
every minute of every day.

329
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,538
You think I'm naive,
don't you?

330
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:37,359
I think you're-
Yeah.

331
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:39,126
I know my wife.

332
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,599
She's not perfect.

333
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:42,046
I'm not perfect.

334
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:43,462
But she loves me.

335
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,822
And she's always loved me.

336
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,397
Every minute,
every day.

337
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,941
You're 15 minutes late.

338
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,659
Have you heard
the good news?

339
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,703
Miley cyrus is playing
a third night at the spectrum?

340
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:16,899
Happiness is possible.

341
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,799
And not just in this life,
but in the next-

342
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:20,699
Oh, you're selling
religion.

343
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,878
I'm sorry,
I bought some islam yesterday.

344
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,006
Well, it's where your light
shows signs before mending-

345
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,500
<i>Have a good evening.</i>

346
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,592
- You're late.
- 15 minutes.

347
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:31,594
16 minutes,
my 16 minutes.

348
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:33,639
So keep him
an extra 16 minutes.

349
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,766
You hear that?
She doesn't care.

350
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,018
You're going mini-golfing.
What's it matter?

351
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:40,436
- You got a tee off time?
- It matters because you don't get

352
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:41,737
to decide what matters.

353
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:44,023
It was my fault.
I had to take a shower.

354
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,792
Which was my fault.

355
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,424
I had to take a dump.

356
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:50,906
Anything else I don't need to know
before you leave?

357
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,500
Have fun on your playdate.

358
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,262
You've got mommy's numbers,
right?

359
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,874
Daddy needs a drink.

360
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:10,052
I was thinking

361
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,800
- if we discount the niceness issue...
- Sit down.

362
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,899
- I think it's a heart defect.
- Nothing on the echo.

363
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:22,354
Could be a patent foramen ovale.
It explains the stroke,

364
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:25,020
and the syncope, and a pfo wouldn't
show up on a routine echo.

365
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,692
I'm gonna do a bubble test.

366
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,193
You got a minute first?

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,872
Sure.

368
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,480
I think you've shown remarkable strength
in a difficult situation.

369
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:37,494
Are you giving me
a performance review?

370
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:38,954
A good one.

371
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,248
I'm gonna do a bubble test.

372
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,753
There was enough blood left over from
his admission work-up to run the vdrl.

373
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:47,237
You doubted your patient.

374
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,131
No, what I thought
didn't matter.

375
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,199
House said he wouldn't let us go on
until we ruled out neurosyphilis.

376
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,179
It's not neurosyphilis;
it's a pfo.

377
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:56,900
It's neurosyphilis.

378
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,599
The tests were positive.

379
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,999
It's always the same conversation.
They tell you you must be mistaken,

380
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,399
which is why I always run
the tests twice,

381
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,199
and then they blame the other guy,
which makes sense if they're innocent,

382
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,924
but obviously,
half of 'em aren't.

383
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,818
They don't seem to get
that they're busted.

384
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:17,074
Scientifically proven.

385
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:18,980
Unless your spouse
cheated too.

386
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,223
Exactly. That's what you're praying for
in that moment.

387
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:22,456
That she cheated too.

388
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:24,494
If she doesn't kill you,
you know that she did.

389
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:25,920
You know
she betrayed you.

390
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,837
And then, you realize
that that sucks worse.

391
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:37,638
- The test must be wrong.
- I ran it twice.

392
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:39,803
Not that test.

393
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,001
The one I took ten years ago.

394
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,645
What other explanation
is there?

395
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,242
- He really sees no other possibility.
- Did you have an affair?

396
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,578
- No.
- Then why aren't you angry with him?

397
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,752
You ever know anybody
who's just too nice?

398
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:09,833
No.

399
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,880
It's annoying.
Then you realize

400
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,716
it's annoying because they
remind you of what you are not.

401
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,664
That you'll never be
as good as they are.

402
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
And then you think,
why can't i?

403
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,963
And before you know it,

404
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,367
that naive idiot
you laughed at

405
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:31,736
has made you
a better person.

406
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,980
You really think

407
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:38,419
I've been in love
all these years with a symptom?

408
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,160
If syphilis caused
lesions in his brain,

409
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,888
<i>and the lesions caused
personality changes,</i>

410
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,833
you may notice a change in him
as his condition improves.

411
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,213
I know my husband.
He's not gonna change.

412
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,227
You should get yourself
tested.

413
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,580
So much for the bell curve.

414
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,199
How can house be an ass
without it being an illness,

415
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,310
but niceness
is a biological crime?

416
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,057
You got five bucks?

417
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,354
Uh, yeah.

418
00:21:11,864 --> 00:21:13,391
Niceness just cost you
five bucks.

419
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:15,193
Being an ass
generally turns a profit.

420
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,499
Kutner, could you excuse us?

421
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:20,299
I need to do
taub's review.

422
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:21,617
You can stay.

423
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,620
I think it would be better
if this was done privately.

424
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,163
This isn't gonna be done.

425
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:28,602
What is it with you guys?
I've given you advice before.

426
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:29,799
Not as our boss.

427
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,099
What's the difference?
Advice is advice.

428
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,384
Fair enough.
I'll go first.

429
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,742
You demonstrate a great air
of confidence,

430
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:40,141
- which is really pissing me off.
- House authorized me...

431
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:42,075
How long have you known him?
He's using you.

432
00:21:42,195 --> 00:21:44,986
- I volunteer cause I knew he wouldn't.
- He could care less about paperwork.

433
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:46,618
He's using you
to screw with you.

434
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,018
He knows it'll annoy us.

435
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,646
We'll stand up to you, which
will force you to confront the fact

436
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,526
that even though you think you're our
superior, you're no different from us.

437
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,901
He gave you authority to keep you
in your place.

438
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:58,453
It's true.

439
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,258
Thanks.

440
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:02,099
Not him,
what'd he say?

441
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,500
Nothing,
what's true?

442
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:05,337
There's something
wrong with this guy,

443
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,778
it means there's something wrong
with house.

444
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,639
Are you trying
to get me drunk?

445
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:21,885
- What time is it?
- 10:30.

446
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,971
Ooh.
She'll kill you.

447
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,847
I'll get you home
before lights out.

448
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,099
Great. Then she'll kill me.

449
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:31,436
If I get...
If I get any more drunk,

450
00:22:31,596 --> 00:22:32,923
then I'm...

451
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:34,522
It...

452
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:36,962
Might not work.

453
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:40,529
If you, uh,
know what I mean.

454
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:42,332
Really?

455
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,599
You'd think that one or more
of your ex-wives

456
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,995
- would have mentioned that to me.
- They told you?

457
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,621
<i>Wait.</i>

458
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:52,099
Why do you want to get
amber angry?

459
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:54,251
- Because I'm your friend.
- No, no, no.

460
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,545
You said you approved,
you said you were taking-

461
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:59,399
the high road.
For how long, the first exit?

462
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,137
Hello, and thank you
for saving me

463
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:03,580
from being righteoused
to death.

464
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,199
- Patient's vomiting blood.
- Hematemesis could indicate...

465
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,806
<i>Don't put it on the board.</i>

466
00:23:08,358 --> 00:23:10,892
- You don't think it's a symptom?
- I think it's my marker.

467
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:13,590
He has syph. And what?

468
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,899
And syph, it can cause hematemesis.

469
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,600
<i>Not everyone agrees.</i>

470
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:20,126
How-how could you-

471
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:22,195
Cause if you all though
it was just syph,

472
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:24,528
You wouldn't have woken me up
in the middle of the night.

473
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:26,612
If it was just syph,
he wouldn't be getting worse.

474
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:28,744
- He's already on penicillin.
- Bleeding's probably

475
00:23:28,904 --> 00:23:30,999
from liver damage,
probably caused by ethanol

476
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,980
in the cleansers
or the penicillin.

477
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:35,125
Two more probablys
than I like to hear.

478
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,420
Liver tests and serologies
are gonna take a full day.

479
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,838
Full night,
actually.

480
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,965
<i>Guy might not make it
to brunch.</i>

481
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,512
Yes, I knew about your issue
with alcohol.

482
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,780
<i>Yes, I intentionally</i>

483
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:52,599
got you drunk to provoke an
argument between you and amber.

484
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,978
Why I would do such a thing
is an interesting question.

485
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,499
What's more interesting

486
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,565
<i>is that you knew
as much as I did</i>

487
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:00,858
and you're the one
who's pouring down the drinks.

488
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:01,957
Why?

489
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,199
Because I thought I was out
having fun with a friend.

490
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,900
I didn't know
the drinks had subtext.

491
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,118
I gotta get home.

492
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,199
Ggt's normal.

493
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,499
Rules out alcohol.

494
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:18,835
How about serum protein?

495
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,920
It's positive.

496
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,318
Kinda assumed he had protein.

497
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:24,299
It's how much protein he has
we care about.

498
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:25,873
It's positive
for syphilis.

499
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,617
You mind if I give you
a performance review?

500
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,580
Not the patient.

501
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,473
House.

502
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,184
He has syphilis.

503
00:24:39,182 --> 00:24:40,900
What happened?

504
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,600
Every time I searched
my soul...

505
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:45,400
I found Anna.

506
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,399
Are you gonna tell Marie?

507
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,700
I have to.

508
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,867
<i>It will destroy her.</i>

509
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,578
<i>Could it be any worse on her</i>

510
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:55,985
Yes?

511
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,375
You might want
to turn off the tv.

512
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,377
I'm multi-tasking.

513
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,399
Also doing my taxes.

514
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,799
And Cuddy.

515
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,099
What'd you find out?

516
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:07,099
The patient has hepatitis.

517
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:09,499
<i>I assume from your omission
of the word'viral'</i>

518
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:12,299
before the hep
that it's not another std.

519
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,218
Put him on steroids
and test him for sarcoid

520
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:16,601
before the liver failure
becomes liver failed.

521
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,771
We're all doing this.

522
00:25:21,234 --> 00:25:22,107
There's more?

523
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:25,277
You have syphilis.

524
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:34,661
No, I don't.

525
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,451
One of us found a vial
of your blood in the lab-

526
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:38,800
Which one of you?

527
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,208
It's treatable.

528
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,920
We filled a prescription.

529
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,629
You okay?

530
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:19,789
So this is why he is
who he is.

531
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,167
- We don't know.
- We know.

532
00:26:22,328 --> 00:26:23,835
It's not just a coincidence.

533
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:25,754
Wilson says
he's always been a jerk.

534
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,080
- But he got worse.
- After his leg.

535
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,646
The leg was
a coincidence.

536
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:31,343
Did you sleep with him?

537
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,643
So what's gonna happen?
What's gonna change?

538
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,479
- Maybe he'll be less of a jerk.
- Or less of a doctor.

539
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,580
You gotta be a jerk
to be a good doctor?

540
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,305
I don't know.
Maybe house does.

541
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:47,999
Why aren't you answering me?

542
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,098
Because it's none
of their business.

543
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,365
It's none of your business.

544
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:56,284
I think the STD
makes it my business.

545
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:01,380
Humans are complicated.

546
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,799
Humans are simple.

547
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:04,879
A million different things
make us who we are.

548
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,799
You change one,
you change everything.

549
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,100
If mozart was better adjusted,

550
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:13,260
decides to play catch one day,
maybe there's no magic flute.

551
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,225
You did, didn't you?

552
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,564
There's something
I need to tell you.

553
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,026
<i>You returned him drunk.</i>

554
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:31,486
On time.

555
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:33,556
- Drunk.
- On time.

556
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:34,799
No tag backs.

557
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,825
The purpose of the time
was to give me time.

558
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:38,285
So you didn't have sex?

559
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:40,412
- I like sex.
- Then you can have it tonight.

560
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:41,830
<i>The L word is on.</i>

561
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,915
You don't get to decide
what matters.

562
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:47,499
Either you're genuinely afraid

563
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:49,078
i'm gonna make him
miserable,

564
00:27:49,198 --> 00:27:51,089
or you're afraid
i'm gonna make him happy,

565
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:53,080
<i>or you simply can't stop
screwing</i>

566
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,499
with anything that moves-
It doesn't really matter because

567
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:58,500
whatever the reason,
you'll only get worse.

568
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:01,800
Until either I stop seeing
wilson,

569
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,727
or I stop you.

570
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:09,566
What do you think
i'm gonna choose?

571
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:11,780
If you terminate
the agreement,

572
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,637
it's not gonna bring peace
in the mideast.

573
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:15,599
I'm not terminating
the agreement.

574
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,700
I'm amending
the agreement.

575
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:20,744
I'm adding penalty clauses.

576
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,203
Fine.

577
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:24,914
Whoever violates it
gets their finger cut off.

578
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,458
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

579
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:29,252
You want people to drive safer,
take out the airbags

580
00:28:29,412 --> 00:28:31,280
and attach a machete
pointing at their neck.

581
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,284
No one will drive
over three miles per hour.

582
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,316
- I'm not cutting-
- We'll figure it out.

583
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:36,600
On your time.

584
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,439
You know she's certifiable,
right?

585
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:52,900
I got the forms
in my desk.

586
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,822
Where is she wrong?

587
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,236
<i>What were you gonna
tell me?</i>

588
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,808
nothing.

589
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,899
You're punishing me?

590
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:07,107
I needed to tell you something
privately.

591
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,459
I'm not gonna tell her.

592
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,002
You'll tell her.

593
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:12,391
She's your girlfriend.

594
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:14,273
- You should tell her.
- You're my friend.

595
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:16,591
It's not the same.

596
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,551
Don't sulk.

597
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,400
Where am I wrong?

598
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:29,899
<i>Your management style
is counterproductive.</i>

599
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,699
You gave me authority over the team,
just so they could undercut-

600
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,798
Ticking the clap-addled?

601
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,778
That's sort of tasteless.

602
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:39,322
I didn't feel like waiting
until your genitals cleared up.

603
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,158
You need to formalize
my authority over the team.

604
00:29:42,318 --> 00:29:44,661
- No, I don't.
- You don't think I'm qualified?

605
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:46,496
Compared to those three?

606
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,139
You wanna punish Cuddy
for hiring me without...

607
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,500
I like cuddy.

608
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,309
I like parts of her.

609
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,796
You wanna crush the team
by crushing me?

610
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:56,800
I want to empower them.

611
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:00,468
Those three idiots need to respect you.

612
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,300
<i>They should respect you.</i>

613
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,955
<i>They should be afraid of you.</i>

614
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,778
So I have to humiliate you.

615
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:07,961
<i>If the team fears you,
they won't question you,</i>

616
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:10,111
if they don't question you,
they won't get answers

617
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:12,166
if they don't get any answers,
they're useless.

618
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:13,472
Mocking me saves lives?

619
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:15,886
The hospital will probably
build you a statue one day.

620
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,456
You know, with a "kick me" sign
on the back.

621
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:20,418
<i>When you think about it,
the more I mock you,</i>

622
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:22,243
the more it shows I have respect
for you.

623
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:25,241
Or you made up that b. s.
Because you like humiliating me.

624
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:27,912
Wouldn't rule that out completely.

625
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,406
<i>- You busy?
- Almost done.</i>

626
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,797
So just remember,
the rabbit goes around the tree

627
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,296
and jumps down the hole.

628
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:40,662
Negative for sarcoidosis.

629
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,544
Run him for everything you can think of.

630
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,606
Lepto, schisto, hemo,

631
00:30:48,476 --> 00:30:51,040
and the fourth marx brother
nobody ever heard of.

632
00:30:52,455 --> 00:30:53,277
You bitch!

633
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,579
<i>I just went to get us some lunch,
you were asleep.</i>

634
00:30:58,701 --> 00:30:59,858
You moved my book.

635
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,052
Jeff. Calm down.

636
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:04,270
It's just the drugs.

637
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,400
The drugs didn't move my book

638
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:08,842
Jeff?

639
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,634
My husband's having a heart attack
Can somebody help me,

640
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:14,792
<i>please?</i>

641
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,423
Somebody help me, please!

642
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,700
She saved his life.

643
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,944
Or she scabbed.

644
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,960
Depends on your point of view.

645
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,450
<i>So what do we think?</i>

646
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,472
New symptom?

647
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:34,445
Or just a wife beater?

648
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:36,756
Hey.

649
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:39,952
Time for you to take
this baby for a spin.

650
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,176
We, loaded him full of prednisone

651
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,799
<i>to try to fix the liver.</i>

652
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:50,941
Good news is, he's running out
of organs to fail.

653
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:52,672
Prednisone could cause

654
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,499
'roid rage, which could cause
hypertension,

655
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:58,199
- which results
- 'roid rage after six hours?

656
00:31:58,332 --> 00:32:00,896
At that rate, by sundown,
he'll have eaten most of us.

657
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,628
It still could be penicillin.
Allergic reaction

658
00:32:06,748 --> 00:32:08,513
How does a fried liver
put him into a rage?

659
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,557
It's not frying his liver,
frying his syphilis.

660
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:13,363
<i>The penicillin's working.
The real patient is emerging.</i>

661
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:16,747
So syphilis prevents domestic violence.

662
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:19,461
I'm gonna be
more attractive to the ladies.

663
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:22,018
<i>I was gonna test for a heart issue
before the syphilis.</i>

664
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,036
<i>Pfo could explain the heart attack and </i>

665
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:26,363
reduced blood flow to the
brain could explain the rage.

666
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:29,215
Well, all good ideas.

667
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,778
<i>Okay, let's take a vote.</i>

668
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:33,705
How many think it's the'roids talking?

669
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,374
And who's for the penicillin?

670
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,965
<i>And how about whatever she said?</i>

671
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,334
Someone hasn't raised their hand.

672
00:32:47,645 --> 00:32:48,684
Whatever I decide?

673
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,030
You're setting me up.

674
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
Why would I do that?

675
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,042
Pfo.

676
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,100
The pfos have it.

677
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,746
I just hope the bubble test is positive.

678
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,645
Or it's no more mr. Nice guy.

679
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:20,052
We gave van gogh chelation therapy.

680
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:22,332
Turned him into a house painter.

681
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,370
<i>Maybe not.</i>

682
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:26,289
<i>Maybe we just put hitler on ritalin.</i>

683
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,153
Are you comparing house to hitler?

684
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:30,110
Oh god.

685
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:33,524
Just because I don't think he's hitler
doesn't mean I slept with him.

686
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:36,279
I don't sleep with everyone
who's better than hitler.

687
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:38,937
Maybe taub is right.

688
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,931
Maybe this is good.

689
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:42,263
This is not good.

690
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,158
Well, he respected our opinions,

691
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:47,082
<i>he mocked himself,
he was civil, he shared.</i>

692
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:48,801
He didn't care.

693
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:49,870
He never cares.

694
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,409
He didn't vote.

695
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,274
<i>He always cared about one thing.</i>

696
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,826
Solving the puzzle.

697
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:56,943
But he was irrelevant to that diagnosis.

698
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:58,450
He had no opinion of his own.

699
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,274
He now cares about...

700
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:02,189
nothing.

701
00:34:02,468 --> 00:34:04,502
You had no choice; you had to treat him.

702
00:34:05,688 --> 00:34:06,878
What's done is done.

703
00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:17,700
You know that thing
I was gonna tell you,

704
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
I gotta tell you. I gotta tell someone.

705
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,759
You've got to swear not to tell c. b.

706
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,209
Whatever.

707
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,018
That's not swearing, that's shrugging.

708
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,915
It's actually the opposite of swearing.

709
00:34:29,142 --> 00:34:30,701
I won't tell amber.

710
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,275
My team thinks that I have syphilis.

711
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:42,119
- Do you?
- Not yet.

712
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,678
Why do they think you do?

713
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,422
'Cause i knew that they had access

714
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:47,814
to an old blood sample,

715
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:49,937
and I knew they'd test it
sometime for something.

716
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:52,557
Why would you swap your blood?
What are you afraid they'll find?

717
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:56,155
Shut up, ou're missing the point.
Now, they think that I'm on penicillin.

718
00:34:58,156 --> 00:35:00,953
Is this some clever practical joke
that I'm not aware of?

719
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:02,922
And as I get better,

720
00:35:03,344 --> 00:35:04,480
I get nicer.

721
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:10,945
That's brilliant.

722
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,500
Foreman thinks
I actually value his opinion.

723
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:16,750
Thank god he said pfo, or I'd
have had to do some dancing.

724
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:18,820
You got time for bowling?

725
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:22,508
Come on, it's work hours.

726
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
I'll get my shoes.

727
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:30,558
- So we don't need to talk about
- No.

728
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,700
- You're gonna keep screwing
- Yeah.

729
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:35,491
You're gonna keep talking about it.
We are who we are.

730
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:38,600
I'll get my shoes.

731
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:42,800
Okay, got a good view of the heart.

732
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:47,020
What if we lower house's dosage?

733
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:49,570
Maybe stabilize him,

734
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,652
he doesn't get worse,

735
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,017
he doesn't get better.

736
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,766
Quite the line to walk. If we're wrong,

737
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,270
he dies of neurosyphilis.

738
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,870
If we don't, other people die.

739
00:35:58,117 --> 00:36:00,099
Other people who aren't our boss.

740
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:01,000
People.

741
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:02,690
This sucks.

742
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:04,648
The guy had a gift. I'd kill

743
00:36:06,236 --> 00:36:06,978
Hi, what

744
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:08,711
House doesn't have syphilis.

745
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,881
He switched the blood samples.

746
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:13,832
- How do you know?
- House told wilson.

747
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:15,800
I wanted to ruin house's day.

748
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:16,896
See ya.

749
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:20,799
- We're idiots.
- We're not idiots.

750
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:22,908
Positive blood test means
positive blood test.

751
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,000
Apparently not.

752
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:26,602
There they are, let's see if they

753
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:29,137
What are you doing? We're not done.

754
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:30,817
He doesn't have syphilis.

755
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:32,404
I know.

756
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:39,655
<i>Patient tested positive
for syphilis, right?</i>

757
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,375
Is this some sort of recap?

758
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:43,886
But why did he test positive

759
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:45,000
for syphilis?

760
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,212
Oh, I know this.

761
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:49,682
???? He has syphilis-

762
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:51,387
- I was gonna say that.
- Or two,

763
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:53,056
The test was wrong twice,

764
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,397
or three, he gave us
someone else's blood.

765
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:04,281
- Who?
- Amber.

766
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:09,486
Get that idiotic smile out of my face.

767
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,653
I gotta go on a killing spree.

768
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,957
Or, four, he has something that
tests positive for syphilis.

769
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:17,699
It's not chagas.

770
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:19,970
He worked in costa rica
before he was married.

771
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,329
Is two a spree,
or do I have to kill you too?

772
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,464
Chagas wouldn't explain the niceness.

773
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:27,630
I've heard of remote tribes
that actually practice

774
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,299
acts of kindness.

775
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:31,719
Or the chagas caused encephalitis.

776
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:33,201
The mri showed no sign

777
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,858
Until we started him on steroids,
compromised the immune system,

778
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,432
and let the infection flare up.

779
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,900
I did another one.

780
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:40,872
It's not much.

781
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:45,203
It's plenty.

782
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,221
You figured this out
because I don't have syphilis?

783
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:53,220
Damn.

784
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:57,266
That should have been my epiphany.

785
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,978
Good news, bad news.

786
00:38:03,711 --> 00:38:05,300
<i>Good news is</i>

787
00:38:05,556 --> 00:38:06,692
we know what you have,

788
00:38:06,822 --> 00:38:08,700
it's treatable, you're gonna live.

789
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,907
Really?

790
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:13,890
What's the bad news?

791
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,950
The cure is a grueling course of pills.

792
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:20,248
It's like one a day for a month.

793
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:24,155
Now you're just trying to make me laugh.

794
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:25,887
Yeah, like that's a challenge.

795
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:28,005
You have chagas disease.

796
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:29,320
It's a parasite.

797
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,307
<i>It's been asymptomatic for ten years.</i>

798
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:33,852
Not quite. Your brain's been swollen.
Not enough to see,

799
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,082
<i>but enough to alter your personality.</i>

800
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:37,324
We're back to that.

801
00:38:37,552 --> 00:38:39,996
He screamed at you. You don't think
he could change?

802
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:41,812
That was because of the drugs.

803
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:45,297
So you think drugs are more
powerful than parasites?

804
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,899
<i>I mean, </i>

805
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:49,826
the ones we're gonna give you to treat
the parasites obviously are

806
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:53,098
I stand by the principle.

807
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,323
I'm not worried.

808
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:01,495
Neither am i.

809
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:04,949
Neither am i.

810
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,175
But that's because I don't care.

811
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,861
Reviews?

812
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:27,429
<i>It was brought to my attention
that on occasion, I am not respectful</i>

813
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:28,818
of hospital hierarchy.

814
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,377
<i>The word was "contemptuous."</i>

815
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:39,729
Well-phrased, thoughtful.

816
00:39:43,545 --> 00:39:44,984
Identically phrased.

817
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:48,955
- These are all the same.
- Because, underneath it all,

818
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,268
we are all the same.

819
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:52,933
And foreman refused to type his up.

820
00:39:54,861 --> 00:39:56,539
Well, it's more than I expected.

821
00:39:57,063 --> 00:39:58,545
There's an extra one in there.

822
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,984
"Your treatment of patients
is non-existent

823
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:15,675
because you're not a doctor,
you're an administrator."

824
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,066
Foreman convinced me
that these could be helpful.

825
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:19,970
<i>"Your management of employees is</i>

826
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:23,542
well, let's face it,
they're outside carrying signs."

827
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,268
The strike ended.

828
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,563
<i>The nurses have been back
for two shifts already.</i>

829
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:29,099
You'd think I'd have noticed.

830
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:31,200
What exactly did they do around here?

831
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,599
"You act like employees

832
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:40,600
<i>should fear and respect you,
but your eyes tell us</i>

833
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,668
but your eyes tell us nothing
'cause we're looking at your boobs,

834
00:40:44,162 --> 00:40:46,704
<i>which tell us that you're desperate
to have someone jump on you</i>

835
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:49,752
and tell you they love you
one grunted syllable at a time."

836
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:52,253
<i>"What you want, you run away from"
"What you need,</i>

837
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,699
you don't have a clue."

838
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,327
"What you've accomplished,
makes you proud.

839
00:40:58,275 --> 00:40:59,855
But you're still miserable."

840
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,600
Please sign.

841
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,240
I got a call from amber today.

842
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,993
Says there's been
a violation of your contract.

843
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:12,219
You've been seeing wilson on her time.

844
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:15,081
She breached confidentiality.

845
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:16,633
You can let it slide, officer.

846
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,200
We're even.

847
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,460
Yes, you are.

848
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:21,744
You're both losing fingers.

849
00:41:25,198 --> 00:41:26,432
Look what I found.

850
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:27,511
Nice.

851
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:33,533
They think you might be able
to come home tomorrow.

852
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,495
Oh, yeah? That's good.

853
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:39,835
What's the matter?

854
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:41,099
The ketchup.

855
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:43,298
There's something wrong with that.

856
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,245
Tastes fine.

857
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:51,439
- Anything else?
- Everything else is great.

858
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,417
I'm just I don't know.

859
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:55,780
I guess I don't like ketchup anymore.

860
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,334
Wonder what else I don't like.

861
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:19,113
Roll over.

862
00:42:22,078 --> 00:42:23,766
We need a tougher punishment.

863
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,859
Come over to the poopy side.

864
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:30,278
Where are you two going friday night?

865
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,068
Dinner at l'auberge.

866
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,749
You're lying.

867
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,153
Of course I am.
