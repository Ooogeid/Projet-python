1
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,880
I'll be right there.

2
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,208
Take your time.

3
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,431
You mind if I get a drink of water?

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,448
No, not at all. Help yourself.

5
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:33,115
Not exactly beach reading.

6
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:35,883
Do you understand?

7
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:38,496
Most of these I can get through,
but that one?

8
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,136
Can't get past the dust jacket.

9
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,539
- Where's Ted?
- Laid off.

10
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:44,001
Company's going
with per diem workers.

11
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,253
You don't have to pay overtime,
health insurance.

12
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,156
- That sucks.
- I don't mind. Really, I'm not...

13
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,231
a 40-hour-a-week kind of guy.

14
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:56,013
If I could just get you to sign.

15
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:56,963
Right.

16
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:01,070
Hang on one second.
I want to show you something.

17
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:06,774
You're gonna laugh,

18
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:10,519
but I swear, this guy James Sidas
looks exactly like you.

19
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:14,448
Wait a second.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,995
This guy is you.
I saw a profile <i>Nova</i> did on you.

21
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:21,768
You're, like, the youngest guy
to ever graduate MIT?

22
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:24,916
- Standards were lower back then.
- You got an IQ of 178.

23
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,210
Published three books and 35 papers

24
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,085
all before the age of 18?

25
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:34,271
Sorry, I really need to get going.
So if I could get you to sign off.

26
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:36,061
All right. I'll trade you.

27
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:38,135
I'll sign...
if you'll sign.

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,056
- I'm not that guy anymore.
- Come on.

29
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,019
This is the most exciting thing
that's happened in this place in years.

30
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:53,231
Come on.

31
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:56,258
Don't be like that.
I'm paying you a compliment.

32
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:59,471
It's not that...

33
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,246
My hand's not working.

34
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:05,332
You okay?

- $2.32.
- Put it on Dr. Wilson's tab.

41
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:53,798
I don't know who Dr. Wilson is,
and we don't have tabs.

42
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,299
Do you know who I am?

43
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,426
Good.

44
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,601
But, sir...

45
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:00,872
I got it. It's all right.

46
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:03,648
Thanks.

47
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,412
Although I should make it clear

48
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:08,822
that for two bucks all you get
is top half, over the clothes.

49
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:11,311
Any plans for turkey day?

50
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,091
Go to my sister's for dinner. Why?

51
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:16,385
Just making pleasant conversation.

52
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,422
I've heard tell of folks doing such.

53
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:20,282
How'bout we talk about this?

54
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:21,575
15-year-old.

55
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,286
- Recurring migraines, blurred vision.
- Great.

56
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,704
- Really?
- Sure.

57
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,683
There's no point in putting
a band together if we don't play.

58
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,042
Hold on.
Take this instead.

59
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,921
- I was expecting more resistance.
- That was the old me.

60
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,965
New me is static-guarded
and friction-free.

61
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:38,691
Enjoy your drumstick.

62
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,975
Ready to save some lives?

63
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:48,185
32-year-old courier.

64
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,564
Ataxia, anemia, mild cough.

65
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:53,732
- CT was clear. Tox screen negative.
- What're you so excited about?

66
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:55,150
Why not?

67
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,320
Got all my starters back,
and a couple of first-class free agents.

68
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,097
I feel like Mike Tomlin.

69
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:03,918
Probably not as much as you do,
but you get the idea.

70
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,511
Ataxia and anemia could be viral.
Maybe West Nile?

71
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:08,765
No fever, lymph glands were normal.

72
00:04:09,388 --> 00:04:11,458
- Anybody seen Wilson?
- Hyperbilirubinemia?

73
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:13,861
Yeah, like that's a real thing.

74
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,342
- Meningitis.
- Anemia's a stretch.

75
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,701
Page Dr. James Wilson at 558.

76
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:20,184
What about sickle cell?

77
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:21,848
- Guy's white.
- Whites can get it.

78
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:24,489
We get the tennis elbow
and all the money.

79
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,027
Let them have sickle cell.

80
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,142
- TTP's a better fit.
- He's right.

81
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,420
You thought I wouldn't agree with him?
Ever?

82
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,276
You didn't.
That's why he dumped you.

83
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,304
Oh, sorry. It was mutual.

84
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,672
We're cool, okay?
Nobody's angry, nobody's hurt.

85
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,115
Sounds passionate.

86
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,451
- TTP makes sense to me.
- Not to me.

87
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,177
- What if he had a history of...
- One big, happy family.

88
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:49,302
TTP it is.

89
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:53,123
Confirm with a blood smear
and adamts13 antibodies.

90
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:56,198
<i>Dr. James Wilson, please dial 558.</i>

91
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,481
- Can you cure it?
- TTP isn't completely curable,

92
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,880
but the symptoms are manageable
with the treatment.

93
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:03,217
Is this the treatment?

94
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:05,262
No, first we do a blood test
to confirm it.

95
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:08,265
- But he's gonna get better.
- Honey, that's what she's saying.

96
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,769
- I'm gonna be okay. Don't worry.
- How? You're in the hospital.

97
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,271
I'm gonna be fine.

98
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,599
You're sure
everything was fine before?

99
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,323
Given your educational background,

100
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:19,585
you'd could at least
find a job with a medical plan.

101
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,277
We have money.
Don't worry.

102
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,988
It's not that, it's just...

103
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,774
I want to make sure we have
all the information we should.

104
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:29,245
- My husband wouldn't lie.
- It's okay. He's just doing his job.

105
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,586
He just wants to make sure I'm not
a secret drug addict or an alcoholic.

106
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,168
Or hiding a history
of mental illness?

107
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,464
I work as a courier
because I want to.

108
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,384
- It's easy. I don't have to think.
- It's too hard to think.

109
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:45,053
No, just unpleasant.

110
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:49,340
No matter what I did,
it really wasn't good enough.

111
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:50,516
Then I met Dara.

112
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,811
She didn't care how smart I was
or what I might accomplish later.

113
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:57,823
It was the first time in my life
that I was really happy.

114
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,183
So I decided
I would rather be happy than smart.

115
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,285
You all right?

116
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,210
Sorry. I know you're not okay.
I mean...

117
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,546
She left.

118
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:23,238
Went back to Chicago.

119
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,314
Any chance of reconciliation?

120
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,180
Sure you don't want to grab a drink?

121
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,601
We could talk
about the perils of dating doctors.

122
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,415
- I wasn't dating Cameron.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

123
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,166
I know what you're doing
and I appreciate it,

124
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,291
but I've got it under control.

125
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,401
That's what you said
about the Dibala incident.

126
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:44,194
And obviously you didn't.

127
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,815
And talking about it
obviously made things so much better.

128
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:56,357
Didn't you think there was
something weird about that guy?

129
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,984
Not really. In fact,
he seemed pretty normal.

130
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:00,409
That's my point.

131
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,121
Guys with IQs off the chart
are usually completely...

132
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,299
abnormal.

133
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,422
Speaking of House,
why'd you come back?

134
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,650
- You must've taken a major pay cut.
- Life's too short to worry about money.

135
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,766
- And your wife?
- She's happy

136
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,437
to cut back on some things...

137
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:16,798
like sex.

138
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,738
- Why'd you come back?
- Why wouldn't I?

139
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:22,691
Like Foreman said, nobody's angry.

140
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,061
Nobody's hurt.

141
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:25,595
Schistocytes.

142
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,052
That means TTP.

143
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,614
Which is what we thought it'd be.
Remember? This is a good thing.

144
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:33,535
This is an easy thing. And House
doesn't take cases that are easy,

145
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,204
which means it's not TTP,

146
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:38,541
and he wants to see
how long it takes us to catch up to him.

147
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:43,241
Schistocytes suggest TTP.

148
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:45,116
Good. Now what?

149
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:47,544
Normally, we'd try plasmapheresis,

150
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,816
but the patient
has an albumin colloid allergy.

151
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:50,751
So?

152
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:53,196
So that means we have
to give him a splenectomy.

153
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,408
Yes, it does.

154
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:12,866
- Do you know where he is?
- Not in here.

155
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,062
You're sure you want us
to take out his spleen.

156
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:18,419
Is that what a "splenectomy" is?
I thought it was an ice cream treat.

157
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,691
So you do really think he has TTP?
You're not just testing us.

158
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:23,966
Yeah, like I have time for games.

159
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:28,757
- So why did you really take this case?
- Isn't it obvious?

160
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,717
I'm fishing for a dinner invite.

161
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,396
Missed you
at breakfast this morning.

162
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
And lunch.

163
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:46,820
I had a dentist appointment.

164
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:49,134
You know where Cuddy's sister lives?

165
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,508
You see, this is why
I don't answer your urgent pages.

166
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,384
Because they're not urgent pages.

167
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:57,359
I've decided what I'm gonna do
about Cuddy and Lucas.

168
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:59,891
- I'm going to break them up.
- Of course.

169
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:03,416
It's given me a purpose in life,
a goal, a <i>raison d'etre</i>.

170
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,962
Albeit a selfish,
mean-spirited, childish <i>raison</i>.

171
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:10,559
I think of it more as benevolent.

172
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,188
There's only two outcomes
for their relationship.

173
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:15,413
They split, or they stay
together forever.

174
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:17,973
If it's split, then the sooner
it happens the better for everyone.

175
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:19,477
If it's stay,

176
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,687
then my meddling won't matter.

177
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,535
In fact, if they survive it,

178
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,766
it might even make
their bond stronger.

179
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,474
How you manage
to elevate your narcissism

180
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,133
to beneficence is masterful.

181
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:34,876
And I've decided
to do a Thanksgiving dinner.

182
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:36,958
Just 'cause I'm sentimental.

183
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,521
Dinner is at Cuddy's sister's,
which brings us back...

184
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,143
House, don't.

185
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:44,458
I fished for an invite.
Cuddy wasn't biting, I'll have to crash.

186
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,233
I have no idea
where Cuddy's sister lives.

187
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:49,462
Ask and thou shalt receive.

188
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,835
You can't honestly think
I would help you with this.

189
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,210
Not help me, help Cuddy.
Remember?

190
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:59,473
If you don't get it, I'll be forced
to use more nefarious methods.

191
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:00,898
Happy holidays.

192
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,500
Looks great.

193
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,350
So he's all better?

194
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:13,527
Probably be on some long-term meds,
and he's about ten ounces lighter.

195
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:16,242
Other than that,
won't even know it's gone.

196
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:20,785
Did you hear that, honey?
You're gonna be just fine.

197
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,091
When can I get out of here?

198
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:25,082
Everything checks out,
less than a week.

199
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:28,001
Good, 'cause those boxes
aren't gonna deliver colors.

200
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,297
- Colors?
- Green...

201
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:33,994
and orange...

202
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,051
and ceiling.

203
00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:39,930
- Mr. Sidas, do you know where you are?
- Chewing.

204
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:42,391
Shirt...

205
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,747
He's stroking.
Call the cath lab now.

206
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,228
My God.

207
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:51,018
Blood flow's restored.
There appears to be no permanent damage.

208
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:52,803
Good news is it turns out to be

209
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,404
an exciting, action-packed
thrill ride of a case after all.

210
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:58,657
Bad news is
we took out his spleen for nothing.

211
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,826
Thank God he's still got
his appendix and tonsils.

212
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:04,746
So what looks like TTP,
acts like TTP,

213
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,353
tests like TTP, but isn't TTP?

214
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:10,335
CNS vasculitis explains ataxia,
and anemia,

215
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,671
- maybe the stroke.
- CT would've picked up something.

216
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:15,964
Hi, I'm Greg House,
a friend of your sister Lisa.

217
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,442
Could be DIC.

218
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:18,926
Lisa Cuddy.

219
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,337
Sorry. Wrong number.

220
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,873
- You gonna ask?
- He's got a logical explanation.

221
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:24,983
Can't be DIC.
No hemorrhaging.

222
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:28,645
And I'm calling all 12 Julia Cuddys
within a 100-mile radius.

223
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,693
See?
Completely reasonable.

224
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,025
- Acquired pancytopenia.
- WBC's normal.

225
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,986
You're...

226
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,653
You're Lisa's sister, right?

227
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,531
You sure?
'Cause you are number 12.

228
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,924
Maybe she got married
and changed her name.

229
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:45,754
- Otis Campbell.
- Probably kept her first name.

230
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,194
The mnemonic for toxins.
O for organophosphates,

231
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:52,108
- t for tricyclics, i for insulin.
- Or as I remember it, "moist place".

232
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,785
That's "place" spelled
with two "l"s and a silent "b".

233
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,090
- Except the tox screen was negative.
- Standard...

234
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,009
Unstandard toxins
don't show up on it.

235
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:02,136
You two do an unstandard tox screen,
you two search his home.

236
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:04,879
Otis Campbell's
got to be hiding somewhere.

237
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:09,240
Smartest guy in the world,
and this is the best he can do.

238
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:13,231
Maybe he's doing what he loves.
Delivering boxes was a childhood dream.

239
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:16,555
Soda, processed cheese,
marshmallow spread.

240
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,528
Nothing in here
is capable of going bad.

241
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,464
Ibuprofen, eye drops,

242
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,215
cough syrup.

243
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,675
You want to come over
for Thanksgiving dinner?

244
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:29,909
You never asked me over before.
Why now?

245
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,509
I never thought of it.

246
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,623
But now that we're both
on the team...

247
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:35,432
And my wife left me?

248
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:39,186
Is that a bad reason?

249
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:41,251
But I'm okay.

250
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,412
On both the food and friends.

251
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:45,938
Mice.

252
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,719
Leptospirosis could explain
the ataxia and the anemia.

253
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,638
But not without a fever.

254
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,894
You have someone to talk to?

255
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,649
- Yeah.
- Who?

256
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:59,283
What, you want names?

257
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:01,779
Look, you lost a friend.
I get it.

258
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,192
But I'm not Kutner.

259
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:06,336
Good, 'cause Kutner never
used to come over for dinner.

260
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,789
I'm gonna pretend there's something
interesting over here so you'll shut up.

261
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,939
Actually, there is.

262
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,221
He's got sketches
of atomic structure,

263
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:30,638
This one's full of math proofs.

264
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,797
They're all old.
Nothing since '96.

265
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:36,898
This isn't some homework assignment
his parents forced on him.

266
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:40,235
This is passion.

267
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,025
Why would he stop?

268
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,905
Marriage destroyed his soul.

269
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:00,084
Maybe...

270
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,249
it was just the booze.

271
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:08,680
- Thank you, you've been wonderful.
- As have you.

272
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,780
- Be well.
- Thank you.

273
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,039
You're helping.

274
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:14,264
Voluntarily.

275
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,898
- He's done six already.
- Figured you might be backed up.

276
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:19,816
Holiday season and all.

277
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,944
Which one of us slipped through
the wormhole into another dimension?

278
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:25,739
I have always loved to travel,
and paint.

279
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,567
Lucky number seven.

280
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,303
You're trying to be nice,

281
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:33,023
but I know you have an agenda.

282
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:35,599
Sexy and smart.

283
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:38,688
- Lucas is a lucky guy.
- The question is,

284
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:41,503
is this a bad agenda or a good one?

285
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,003
Either you're trying
to screw with me,

286
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,601
or you're trying to show me
that you've really changed.

287
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:52,752
So which is it?

288
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:54,277
I'm dying to know.

289
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,610
What are you doing for Thanksgiving?

290
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:06,792
Peace in our time.

291
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,200
Cost me 45 minutes of clinic duty.

292
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:14,913
This is a three-hour drive.

293
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:18,064
Have you considered the possibility
this is a fake address?

294
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,836
She'd send me
to a vacant lot for Thanksgiving?

295
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,088
- If she's smart.
- She is.

296
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,006
I ran it through motor vehicles.

297
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:28,468
- Good as gold.
- This cannot end well.

298
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:32,013
I don't want it to end well.
You should come as my date.

299
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:35,049
You're not gonna want to miss this.

300
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:36,984


301
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:39,960
The unstandard tox screen
was as clean as the standard one.

302
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,110
But we found vodka
stashed away in his place.

303
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,700
What's with the ties?

304
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,738
Makes me look adorably
non-threatening.

305
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,098
Party or party hearty?

306
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:53,285
Liver failure
would explain the symptoms.

307
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:56,997
Party.

308
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:01,463
So, guy's a brainiac,

309
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,837
and his secret drug of choice
is booze?

310
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,883
- Kinda pedestrian, don't you think?
- Talk to him, he's a pedestrian guy.

311
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,656
With pedestrian alcoholism.

312
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:11,785
Biopsy can wait
until after Thanksgiving.

313
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,209
Assuming the biopsy's gonna tell us
exactly what we expect,

314
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:16,933
it can wait till after New Year's.

315
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,227
On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen

316
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,520
can do it today.

317
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,898
- Why us?
- Juniority.

318
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,340
Welcome back.

319
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:27,371
- What do you want us to do?
- Same as me.

320
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:29,296
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

321
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:33,839
I'm not an alcoholic.

322
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,485
You just hide vodka
around the house for fun.

323
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,580
I drink, just not a lot.

324
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:40,902
Since when do you drink at all?

325
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,835
I have one shot when I get home, baby,
that's it.

326
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:47,422
- So why lie about it?
- Because it's not important.

327
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,968
- What difference does it make?
- That you drink every day by yourself?

328
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,428
I have one lousy drink, okay?

329
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,679
Ever seen me drunk?

330
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,765
You've obviously
been drinking enough to hurt your liver.

331
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,726
- My liver is fine.
- Hold still.

332
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:04,807
There we go.

333
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,600
This test is a waste of time.

334
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,850
All right. Very good.

335
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:34,933
Here, we got this.

336
00:17:58,602 --> 00:17:59,602
Julia?

337
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:01,477
No, I'm the house sitter.

338
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,763
They're in Hawaii for the week.

339
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:14,785
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.

340
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:19,373
You must be Dr. House.

341
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,144
I was told I should offer you
a turkey sandwich.

342
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:39,272
Tuna salad.
Closest thing they had to turkey.

343
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:41,570
Thanks, but I'm hoping
I can get out of here

344
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,519
to catch the end of dinner
with my wife.

345
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,192
- Anything?
- No cirrhosis,

346
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,167
- no scarring, no infection.
- Blood panel?

347
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,214
Elevated albumen: 7.2.

348
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:52,630
- That's it?
- Everything else is fine.

349
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:55,316
So it was a waste of time.

350
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,888
Unless it's not his liver
that's elevating his albumen.

351
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,709
- It's his kidneys.
- Renal failure. Explains the anemia.

352
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:07,103
If he developed hyperkalemia,
that would explain the ataxia.

353
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:09,481
- But the stroke...
- Ischemic encephalopathy.

354
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:11,173
Nice.

355
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:14,528
Except we have to stay
and test his kidneys.

356
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:29,952
Key under the mat.

357
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,921
- There's no key under the mat.
- Right.

358
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,965
You need to replace
one of your kitchen windows.

359
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:41,427
I helped myself to your wine cellar.
I'll leave a buck on the way out.

360
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:45,183
- You're not right for her.
- And you are?

361
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:46,528
Less wrong.

362
00:19:49,962 --> 00:19:51,762
Then I started thinking...

363
00:19:57,249 --> 00:19:58,649
What was I saying?

364
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:01,157
You were saying it's late, and...

365
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,575
She invited me.

366
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,080
She didn't know if she should.

367
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,705
She was trying to figure out
if I really have changed or...

368
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:14,039
if I'm still the same old S.O.B.
I've always been.

369
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:19,639
She always gave me a chance.

370
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:24,340
832 chances.

371
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:27,396
And I used up every one of them.

372
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,768
832's her limit.

373
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,770
Make a note.

374
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,267
How 'bout a cup of coffee?

375
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:38,361
It's just instant, but...

376
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:47,013
I'm pathetic.

377
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,660
I don't deserve her.

378
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,619
Maybe you should crash here.

379
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,579
It's a sofa bed.

380
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:08,628
I love her.

381
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:12,103


382
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:15,068
Patient's liver's fine.
His kidneys are shot.

383
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:16,577
And where is House?

384
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:18,986
He left a message.
He's not coming in today.

385
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,635
What causes kidney failure?

386
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
- Rhabdomyolysis.
- No edema.

387
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:26,564
- You had a wonderful Thanksgiving?
- I don't remember.

388
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:28,632
So I guess I did.

389
00:21:29,032 --> 00:21:30,382
Multiple myeloma.

390
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,734
- No bone pain.
- You got drunk alone?

391
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:36,079
That would be a sign
that I need to talk to you about this.

392
00:21:36,204 --> 00:21:39,404
- Polycystic kidney disease?
- No UTIs or flank pain.

393
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,721
What if his cough
is more than just a cold?

394
00:21:43,964 --> 00:21:45,568
He hasn't been coughing.

395
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:48,604
It's in his history,
and we found cough syrup in his cabinet.

396
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:51,414
It could mean Goodpasture syndrome,
affects kidneys and lungs.

397
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:53,970
Start him on immunosuppressors
and dialysis.

398
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:56,950
- After we run it by House.
- He's not answering his pager.

399
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:59,925
- Looks like he's leaving it up to us.
- Us, not you.

400
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,950
And since we don't disagree,

401
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,280
you can save your fight
for another case.

402
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:13,065
How long
do I have to be hooked up for?

403
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,749
Four to six hours a day

404
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,043
- until we see an improvement.
- What if you don't?

405
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,421
- We keep doing it until a transplant.
- You were sure it was his spleen,

406
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,548
and then you were sure
it was his liver,

407
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,009
which he told you it wasn't,
and now it's his kidneys!

408
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,678
It's definitely his kidneys.

409
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,347
We just don't know
why it's his kidneys.

410
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:34,537
Any word from Cameron?

411
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:41,381
I started seeing a counselor
after my diagnosis.

412
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:43,289
She's really good.

413
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:47,781
Why does everyone assume
everyone works in the exact same way?

414
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:49,306
We pretty much do.

415
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:51,991
Our egos want us to think
we're all snowflakes, no two alike,

416
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,384
but really
we all want the same things.

417
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:56,605
Love, forgiveness...

418
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,479
Chocolate.

419
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:01,510
What I want
is for everyone to leave me alone.

420
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:03,035
How do I get that?

421
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:14,434
What did you say
to Lucas last night?

422
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:19,591
I know there were
a lot of consonants.

423
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:24,507
I don't remember how I got here,
never mind what I said.

424
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:25,777
I talked to him.

425
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:29,042
And he said it'd be better
if we stopped seeing each other.

426
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:33,667
Said he didn't realize how much
there still was between you and me.

427
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:37,245
And he didn't want to get caught
in the middle of us.

428
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:42,281
I was drunk.

429
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:45,996
- Whatever I said, he can't...
- I've had enough, House.

430
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:49,271
I actually felt bad
about scamming you.

431
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,218
But then you lived down
to my expectations

432
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:55,710
and then some.

433
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,489
There is no "us".

434
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:05,466
There never will be.

435
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:14,776
It worked.

436
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,698
Tell me you're talking
about a medical procedure.

437
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,958
They split up this morning.
You're the very first one I've told.

438
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,818
And you think
she'll start dating you?

439
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:25,593
I'm sure she hates you.

440
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:27,563
But her eyes say,

441
00:24:27,688 --> 00:24:30,362
"How will I ever pay you
for that tennis lesson?"

442
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,209
- What a shame.
- They'll get over it.

443
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:37,269
- I meant for you.
- I'll get over it faster than they do.

444
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,652
Can't believe Lucas fell for my

445
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:42,914
"I never say this
because it's so personal

446
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,183
"except that I'm drunk"
profession of love.

447
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:46,878
Second-oldest trick in the book.

448
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:49,487
You're right.
It's his fault because he's stupid.

449
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:56,145
He certainly is.

450
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,044
You're stupid.

451
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,299
Well, I'm rubber, and you're glue.

452
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,343
He's not pedestrian, he's stupid.

453
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,096
At least stupider than he should be.

454
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,664
He's a DXM junkie.

455
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:19,561
Dextromethorphan, as in cough syrup?

456
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,351
He wasn't taking it for his cough.

457
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:24,426
It's cheap,
available at your corner drug store,

458
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:27,500
and taken in high doses,
it's a dumb drug.

459
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,054
Dumb drug.
Well, he obviously hasn't...

460
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:32,780
He's smart compared to you.

461
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,348
He's a moron
compared to what he was.

462
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:37,368
Robotripping

463
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,647
lowers the IQ.

464
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:40,204
It also causes brain damage.

465
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:43,541
Unless taken with the proper amount
of ethanol.

466
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,600
About one drink per day.

467
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,804
He wasn't abusing the booze
and taking the cough remedy medicinally.

468
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,942
He was abusing the cough meds,

469
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,801
and taking the booze medicinally.

470
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,637
Bravo.

471
00:25:57,685 --> 00:25:59,056
Why would you do that?

472
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:02,947
If you had a gift,
why would you just throw it away?

473
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,722
I didn't throw it away.

474
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,772
I just turned it down a little.

475
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,766
When my brain was on low,

476
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:11,402
everything didn't seem
so miserable anymore.

477
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,970
Life was bearable.

478
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:15,923
I thought that I did that.

479
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,011
You do.

480
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:22,413
Long-term abuse of DXM
explains all your symptoms.

481
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,791
Even, oh, sweet irony, your cough.

482
00:26:26,258 --> 00:26:28,002
Whole bowel lavage,
activated charcoal.

483
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:31,047
We get all traces of it
out of your system.

484
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,424
You'll be the unhappiest
little courier in no time.

485
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:37,285
I don't think I can live without it.

486
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,791
You'd be surprised
what you can live without.

487
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,820
Make him a genius.

488
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:44,894


489
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,520
I can't believe it.

490
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:50,335
He looks so much better already.

491
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:53,701
We were thinking about calling <i>GQ</i>.

492
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:57,175
Lavage has removed all traces
of DXM from his body.

493
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:00,348
You're drawing again.
What is it?

494
00:27:00,473 --> 00:27:02,245
- Just doodles.
- No, it's not.

495
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,463
Come on, Jimmy, I want to know.

496
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,975
This is a toroidal
helicon plasma device.

497
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:16,900
It determines
the amount of energy expended

498
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,262
by he subatomic particles.

499
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:25,239
I'm thirsty.
Could you get me a juice or something?

500
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:26,948
Of course.

501
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:30,004
I'm so happy, Jimmy.

502
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,660
I told you.

503
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,870
Do you know what the difference
between her IQ and mine is?

504
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:43,995
91 points.

505
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,700
In relation, she's closer to a gibbon
than she is to me.

506
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:51,168
Having sex with her
would be an act of bestiality.

507
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:55,217
I assume you didn't marry her
for her skill in applied physics.

508
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,924
I wish she could spell it.

509
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:00,803
You think you'd be happier
with someone who could spell better?

510
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,016
That's the problem.

511
00:28:05,636 --> 00:28:07,386
I'm the one who's a jerk.

512
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:10,243
But I owe her everything.

513
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:14,522
I want to want to be with her.

514
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:17,527
And when I'm clear, I...

515
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:21,959
I can't.

516
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:27,013
Fainting, dizziness,
shortness of breath?

517
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,138
Sometimes.

518
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:31,038
Is the wait always this long?

519
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:32,877
Only on days that end in "day".

520
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,558
Diarrhea, weight loss?

521
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:35,483
A bit.

522
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,453
Don't you ever shave?

523
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:40,593
Yeah. Once a week.
How'bout you?

524
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,472
- Stomach pain, tenderness?
- Every now and then.

525
00:28:44,645 --> 00:28:46,307
Are you this rude
to all your patients?

526
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,225
Yes. Don't think you're special.

527
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,974
So we've got a lot of vague,
unverifiable symptoms.

528
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:55,263
Yet all the physical signs
are perfectly normal.

529
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:58,876
- What do you think I have?
- I'm not sure, but I think it's...

530
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:00,321
a lame job.

531
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:01,452
What?

532
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:03,032
You're a rat.

533
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,301
Insurance company sends you out
to check on the quality of medical care.

534
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:08,579
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it really?

535
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,707
'Cause you seem a lot more interested
in asking questions than answering them.

536
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,127
Handwriting on your medical records
isn't a doctor's, I can almost read it.

537
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,089
When you went out
for a urine sample,

538
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,799
I looked in your purse.
Found the questions you were supposed

539
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,078
to memorize
before you came to the clinic.

540
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:25,118
- I was looking for gum.
- You're an ass.

541
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,257
Put it in your report.
I tell you what.

542
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:31,185
I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend
that I'm not when we leave this room.

543
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,613
Remember, first ice, then heat.

544
00:29:37,187 --> 00:29:39,408
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call me.

545
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:41,083
Thank you, Dr. House.

546
00:29:43,754 --> 00:29:45,754
Wait a second.
Where's Cuddy?

547
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,297
Gone for the day.

548
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:55,920
I can't remember if I've mocked you yet
for being a male nurse.

549
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,150
I think this counts.

550
00:29:58,684 --> 00:29:59,784
Fair enough.

551
00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:05,407
That isn't the man I married.

552
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,179
Yes, he is.

553
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:09,024
He's just smarter.

554
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,928
- Give him some time. I'm sure...
- He hates me.

555
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:13,978
His body is going through
withdrawal.

556
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,106
- He's adjusting.
- Maybe he never loved me. Not really.

557
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:20,610
Maybe we never really
had anything at all.

558
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,311
Somebody help!

559
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:29,504
I can't feel my legs.

560
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,246
I can't feel them.

561
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:36,920
Anywhere.
Nothing.

562
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,773
We have to talk about this.

563
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:47,272
It's late. I'm tired.

564
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:53,267
I know it's a big pay cut, but I'll
always have the chance to make money.

565
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,980
I won't always have
the chance to do this job.

566
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,818
That's what you think?
That it's about the money?

567
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,695
So it's that I didn't consult you
before I took the job?

568
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,315
That was offensive,
but it's not about that either.

569
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
So then...

570
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,997
Can you give me the first letter?

571
00:31:14,877 --> 00:31:16,377
When we got married,

572
00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:19,585
you were an intern working
30-hour shifts doing grunt work.

573
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:22,885
We both put up with it because we knew
that it was leading to something better.

574
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,747
In your private practice,
you are the boss.

575
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,092
You call the shots,

576
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:30,137
but now you're 40 years old,
you're still doing grunt work.

577
00:31:31,577 --> 00:31:34,433
That's what this is about?
You think I'm a wuss?

578
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,839
He made you miss
Thanksgiving dinner.

579
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:52,030
Vitamin B12 deficiency?
Gives us anemia, numbness.

580
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:54,433
- Not a stroke.
- If he has a vascular malformation...

581
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:55,996
Anemia's not macrocytic.

582
00:31:58,813 --> 00:32:01,640
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Dying patients can be so thoughtless.

583
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:02,950
Don't.

584
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:06,302
Great comeback. Is that Oscar Wilde?
Come on, people.

585
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:08,857
- Bone marrow malignancy.
- Wouldn't produce schistocytes.

586
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,719
- Lupus.
- Thanks for coming in.

587
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:12,253
ANA was negative.

588
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:14,321
What about you?

589
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:16,990
Got any predictable drivel
you'd like to add?

590
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:20,062
- They've given you enough already.
- At least they're trying.

591
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,850
They're not sitting there like roadkill.
Give me something.

592
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:24,233
Something,

593
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,695
or I'll get your ex-smarter half
on the phone and ask her.

594
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:04,982
You're gonna be pressing charges?

595
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,175
Against the ottoman I tripped over?

596
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,493
Against Chase.

597
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:12,022
I'm pretty sure the ottoman
was acting alone.

598
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:17,036
- You free for dinner this weekend?
- At least three other people saw him.

599
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:19,330
Mass hysteria.
Either night?

600
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,332
I can't have doctors
punching each other out.

601
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,916
My God, who got punched?

602
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,563
And more importantly,
for Chase's sake, I need to know

603
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:29,636
if he's able to handle himself
or if I should be getting him some help.

604
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,421
He couldn't have punched anyone.

605
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:33,466
He was with me
when I tripped over the ottoman.

606
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:36,055
If you're not planning on eating,
maybe a movie?

607
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:38,479
I'm not doing this.

608
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,970
It's not fun anymore.

609
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:43,498
Just do your job.

610
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:58,375
I need your help.

611
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,065
What happened to your face?

612
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:04,185
I was mowing the lawn
when the phone rang.

613
00:34:04,804 --> 00:34:05,995
You're a computer.

614
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,375
I'm gonna feed you data,
and you analyze it.

615
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,340
What, are you gonna feed me
20 years of medical knowledge too?

616
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:13,884
It's not gonna work.

617
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:15,582
I know.

618
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:18,701
But I don't have anyone else to ask.

619
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:23,909
It's lonely, isn't it?

620
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:26,728
It's not that bad.

621
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,505
Then you're not that smart.

622
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,611
You ever tried to kill yourself?

623
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,071
- Not quickly.
- I did.

624
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:38,350
12 years ago I jumped off
the top of my eight-story building

625
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:41,078
into a dumpster bin
the day before pickup.

626
00:34:41,387 --> 00:34:42,971
I broke my collarbone,

627
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:45,742
my leg, and three ribs.

628
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:49,309
When I was in the hospital
they put me on narcotics

629
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:51,984
and suddenly everything
was just better.

630
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:56,529
I didn't feel isolated or lonely.

631
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:01,879
That's where I met my wife.
She was... so happy.

632
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:04,356
And dumb.

633
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:07,702
And I was...

634
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:10,698
smart...

635
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,386
and miserable.

636
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:16,436
You tell me who the genius is.

637
00:35:16,962 --> 00:35:20,003
I fell in love with her
buzzed out of my head,

638
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:23,518
and I knew I wanted
to stay that way forever.

639
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,160
Enjoy.

640
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:37,991
Easier on your conscience
if I die an idiot?

641
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:40,502
What's a conscience?

642
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,032
Which ribs...

643
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,278
did you break in the fall?
They on the left side?

644
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,596
Bottom three.

645
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,673
That was 12 years ago.

646
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:07,633
This probably cost me my marriage,
so it better be awesome.

647
00:36:07,993 --> 00:36:09,666
Ferrous oxide contrast?

648
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,698
Gets absorbed by the spleen.

649
00:36:12,558 --> 00:36:14,076
Unless he doesn't have one.

650
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,060
In which case
it's absorbed by the liver,

651
00:36:16,185 --> 00:36:18,198
- and fries that.
- You're killing him?

652
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:20,623
I opened him up
and didn't take out his spleen?

653
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:23,928
All organs do look kind of the same...
red and squishy.

654
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:32,872
Accessory spleens.

655
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:35,393
Okay, that is amazing.

656
00:36:35,518 --> 00:36:38,070
12 years, eight stories,
and a dumpster ago,

657
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:39,696
he broke three ribs,

658
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,858
damaged his spleen.
Bits of it split off,

659
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:43,624
circulated through his bloodstream

660
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:45,769
until they landed
and attached somewhere else.

661
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:47,737
So it is TTP.

662
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:50,376
I just didn't remove...

663
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:54,554
- All of his spleens.
- 16 splenectomies.

664
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:58,206
Pretty sure he gets
a set of steak knives with that.

665
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:10,941
I can outrun you.

666
00:37:15,174 --> 00:37:18,152
Sorry about the nose.
And the eye... and the...

667
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:19,833
eyebrow.

668
00:37:21,597 --> 00:37:22,698
Guess I deserved it.

669
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,159
If I thought that,
I wouldn't be apologizing.

670
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,120
Your fist slipped?

671
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:31,140
Everybody kept bugging me,
asking if I was okay.

672
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:35,792
So you busted my nose
to keep people off your back.

673
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:40,257
Pretty much.

674
00:37:40,652 --> 00:37:42,480
Making people even more
worried about you.

675
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:43,468
Maybe.

676
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,831
But at least
they're not talking to me about it.

677
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,584
Fair enough.

678
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:50,876
Cheers.

679
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,412
- Thank you.
- Don't be so grateful.

680
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:05,575
You'll be delivering packages
for 70 years to pay for it.

681
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,661
Well, thanks for our talk.

682
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:12,739
It's been a while
since I had a stimulating conversation.

683
00:38:12,864 --> 00:38:14,958
- So what're you gonna do?
- Go back to my life.

684
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,940
Which one?

685
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,533
The one that has my wife in it.

686
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:22,962
Robo tripping.

687
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:26,929
- How's she feel about that?
- She doesn't have to know.

688
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:28,847
It's worked for 12 years.

689
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:36,933
Tell your brain I said good-bye.

690
00:38:46,334 --> 00:38:49,854
Einstein's giving himself a lobotomy,
and you're cool with that?

691
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,057
Ignorance is bliss.

692
00:38:57,928 --> 00:38:59,178
Hold that pose.

693
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,844
I'll start with t-shirts and mugs,

694
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,469
and see how it goes.

695
00:39:17,013 --> 00:39:18,063
Home early.

696
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:23,635
What happened to him?

697
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,981
- You beat up House?
- Just one right hook.

698
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,677
Why? What happened?

699
00:39:32,802 --> 00:39:35,747
You were right. I told him we need
to lay down some ground rules,

700
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:38,743
- got a little heated.
- That's not what I meant.

701
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:42,803
Is he okay?
Are you gonna be fired? Arrested?

702
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:44,328
Everything's fine.

703
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,246
Can we at least be civil?

704
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,900
How's your nose?

705
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:20,125
It's okay.

706
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:22,085
Does your kid like animals?

707
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:26,992
I got tickets to that holiday carnival.
I hear they have a nice petting zoo.

708
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:31,887
- I think I was pretty clear before.
- I don't mean with me.

709
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,517
Here. Take 'em. Enjoy.

710
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,133
No, thanks.

711
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:42,583
They're not fake.
I didn't steal them.

712
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:46,618
One of the nurses was selling 'em
for her kid's scout trip.

713
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:48,653
It doesn't make
things right between us,

714
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,659
I just wanted to do something nice.

715
00:40:54,027 --> 00:40:55,427
I don't want them.

716
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,518
I'll see you tomorrow.

717
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:14,565
They didn't split up.

718
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:16,890
She wouldn't take the tickets.

719
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,950
Of course.

720
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:21,675
Wind talker code
for "we never split up."

721
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:25,175
She told you multiple times
she wants nothing to do with you.

722
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,000
I wasn't gonna be there.

723
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:30,028
She just felt guilty
that I felt guilty,

724
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,748
so she couldn't take them.

725
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:34,324
Either that
or she didn't want to appease you.

726
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,342
These weren't reparations.

727
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,542
Just a simple gesture of remorse,

728
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,367
and she slapped it down.

729
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:43,128
They didn't break up.

730
00:41:44,214 --> 00:41:46,586
She just wanted me
to think that so I'd back off.

731
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:51,232
Dare I ask what you're gonna do?

732
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:54,811
Nothing.

733
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:58,157
I said they'd either break up
or they'd stay together.

734
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,933
They didn't break up.

735
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:03,594
And you're okay with that?

736
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:05,972
It is what it is.

737
00:42:09,357 --> 00:42:10,507
Good for you.

738
00:42:20,103 --> 00:42:21,672
House knows I lied.

739
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:23,331
Why? What'd he say?

740
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,025
Nothing.
I could just tell.

741
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,400
You want to stage another breakup?

742
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:34,718
It seems like
he's gonna leave us alone.

743
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:37,471
Why would he do that?

744
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,264
I'm not completely sure.

745
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:41,755
So...

746
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:45,163
we have his blessing?

747
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,049
I guess so.

748
00:42:47,174 --> 00:42:49,107
I made you some meatballs.

749
00:42:52,692 --> 00:42:54,942
Maybe House isn't so bad after all.

750
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,108
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

751
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:06,249
