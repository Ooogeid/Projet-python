1
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,279
- Who is it?
- It's Tom.

2
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:32,948
Tom, your husband?

3
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,251
What's he doing here?

4
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:47,296
- What's going on?
- Sorry, I'm not supposed to be here,

5
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:50,143
but Evelyn's school contract
is due tomorrow.

6
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:52,876
I knew I was forgetting something.
Let me find a pen.

7
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,644
Not quite sure what Emily post
recommends in this situation,

8
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:02,812
but I'm Tom.

9
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:05,064
Damien. Hey.

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,442
Sorry to intrude. I wasn't quite sure
when she'd be coming home.

11
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:11,904
- No problem.
- Thank you so much for catching this.

12
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,577
I'll get out of your way, it was good
to meet you, I'll see you later, hon.

13
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,387
Seems like a nice guy.

14
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:38,139
- Jules, you okay?
- No, my stomach.

15
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:39,640
Here. Lie down.

16
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:45,534
Try to...

17
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:46,969
Get Tom.

18
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,356
.:: La Fabrique ::.

19
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:57,949
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

20
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,270
You know what would be perfect?

21
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,845
French toast tower.

22
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:33,235
You still go to Mickey's?
What's your cholesterol?

23
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,695
It's my one vice.
I'm keeping it.

24
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,647
As much as I would love
to clog my arteries,

25
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:41,707
I have a 10:00 CT
and I still have to race home,

26
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:43,222
get changed.

27
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,645
Maybe you could keep
some clothes here.

28
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:51,723
Maybe I could.

29
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:56,185
He's just trying
to get into your skirts.

30
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:58,975
And I don't mean metaphorically.

31
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:01,526
He's got the legs for it.

32
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:06,274
So I will see you tonight?

33
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,071
Have a nice day.

34
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,368
"Have a nice day."

35
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,301
- How civilized.
- I said I'd stay out of it.

36
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,044
- What?
- Nothing.

37
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,462
Clearly something.

38
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,173
On a list of your attributes,

39
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,424
there's nothing
that even rhymes with "coy".

40
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,929
Okay, I may have seen something
in the fridge.

41
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,558
Like the end of your relationship.

42
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,712
She put the milk in the door
and not on the shelf.

43
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:52,365
- It's not a big deal.
- You hate that she did that,

44
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,899
but you didn't say anything.

45
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:57,101
- You're trying to get us to fight.
- No, I'm trying to help.

46
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:58,854
If you got an issue, let her know.

47
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,355
I should have known
that you weren't done sabotaging this.

48
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,534
Fine.
Stew in your irritation.

49
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,038
And sure, last time it bubbled over
into resentment and rage,

50
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,880
leading ultimately
to a painful divorce

51
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:12,294
that neither of you ever
really recovered from,

52
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:15,241
but I'm sure this time
it'll be great.

53
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:30,983
Interesting case. 35-year-old woman
with fever and abdominal pain.

54
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,521
E.R. ruled out
all the usual suspects.

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,566
Stop before you interest me
to death.

56
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:37,693
And she's in an open marriage.

57
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,072
- Not interesting. It's just weird.
- Know what's weirder?

58
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,074
That other humans are monogamous
in the first place.

59
00:04:45,592 --> 00:04:47,620
No other species on the planet
mates for life

60
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,553
and if you're gonna bring up swans,
they cheat like everybody else.

61
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,487
They just have better PR
than rabbits.

62
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:55,365
Animals also eat their young
and kill their rivals.

63
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,376
That make it weird
that most of us don't?

64
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,055
Says the guy whose opposable thumbs

65
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,843
have been all over how many women
who aren't his wife?

66
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,118
A functional open marriage
is like a Unicorn.

67
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:07,280
A mythical creature that doesn't exist.
Someone always ends up unhappy.

68
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,310
She's unhappy because she's suffering
from an intestinal blockage.

69
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:14,605
Boring. Then we have to find a reason
to rule it out.

70
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,682
What about herpes colitis?

71
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,152
She picks up it from one partner.
It takes root in her colon.

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,322
- STD panel was clean.
- Chances are, this couple was unhappy.

73
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,408
This is their attempt
to save something that never...

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,173
- Go on.
- Herpes might not register

75
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,167
if she was exposed
in the last six weeks.

76
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:39,296
But it would show up
on a barium enema.

77
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,750
Wait.

78
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,812
- You're gonna do it?
- Gotta see if our patient's a Unicorn

79
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,587
or just a slutty horse.

80
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,350
Think how much fun
Taub could be having.

81
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:54,463
Barium coats the inner lining
of your colon.

82
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,629
Lets us get a good look
at it on the X-ray.

83
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,366
Somebody else can pick up Evelyn.
I feel like I'm abandoning you.

84
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,964
I'm on painkillers.

85
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,399
I'd rather this not be what you think
of every time you look at my butt.

86
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:15,749
Roll onto your side.

87
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:19,311
It's fill'er up time.

88
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:26,802
So is Evelyn his new squeeze?

89
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:30,556
- She's our daughter.
- Must be interesting

90
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,975
growing up in a production
of <i>Oh! Calcutta!</i>

91
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:34,323
She's six.

92
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,520
She knows as much about our sex life
as any other kid her age.

93
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:42,151
You can explain that she's the reason
the two of you stayed married.

94
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,695
You've been in the room five minutes.
You got us all figured out.

95
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,449
Of course, you left out the part
where we love each other

96
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,994
- and we want to grow old together.
- You don't want to be young together.

97
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:55,622
When you think about it,
tons of couples do what we do.

98
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,933
It's just that with most of them,
one spouse doesn't know about it.

99
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:02,963
We decided things work better
when people tell each other the truth.

100
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:07,555
Tank's full.

101
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,670
I'll page the radiology elves.

102
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,395
I'm not saying I hate it.
Just doesn't go with your eyes.

103
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,849
- You hate it.
- Little bit.

104
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,318
Any more heartless critiques
of my general appearance?

105
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:25,986
Nope. All done.

106
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,756
So is she as bendy as she looks?

107
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,030
- Maya and I are just friends.
- No, you and I are friends

108
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,414
and you don't have coffee with me
three times a week.

109
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,218
She's an interesting person.

110
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,380
She grew up in Ohio.
She has three brothers.

111
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,656
Fascinating.
Last week, that Cambodian lab tech

112
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:47,152
was telling us
how he survived the Killing Fields

113
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:49,087
and you left to go get a donut.

114
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:52,033
- So we flirt. It's fun.
- It's dangerous.

115
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:55,158
- That woman would totally do you.
- You think?

116
00:07:55,972 --> 00:07:58,908
- Nothing is gonna happen.
- If you want to be on a diet,

117
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:02,029
you might want to stop
hanging out by the dessert cart.

118
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:07,149
X- ray was clean.
She doesn't have herpes colitis

119
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:08,362
or abdominal pain.

120
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,614
It stopped hurting during the X-ray,

121
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,889
which means it was
an intestinal blockage that passed.

122
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:15,195
- We should discharge her.
- Absolutely.

123
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,302
There's no need to find
any underlying cause

124
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:19,783
'cause these things
never happen twice.

125
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:22,167
Take her digestive system
for a test drive.

126
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,102
Give her a radio-opaque milkshake.
X- ray every 15 minutes to see

127
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,339
if it makes any unscheduled
stops on the way through.

128
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,758
- We'll be here all night.
- No, Taub will be here all night.

129
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:32,718
Talk to the Unicorn

130
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,618
and then tell me you don't believe.

131
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,381
I did an abdominal CT on a kid today

132
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:39,101
and found a six-inch bezoar

133
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:41,478
made entirely of gum.

134
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,393
I mean, who gives a three-year-old
an endless supply of g...

135
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,221
You okay?

136
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,727
I mean, there was hair in it
and maybe a piece of paper.

137
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,865
<i>How long you been married?</i>

138
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,752
<i>One of the few drawbacks
of having an open marriage.</i>

139
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:11,675
<i>Nobody ever asks me
about current events or the weather.</i>

140
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:14,344
<i>Yankees look good this season.</i>

141
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:18,984
<i>Seven years.</i>

142
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,438
<i>How long have you...
You know?</i>

143
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:28,445
<i>After three years, we realized
that traditional marriage</i>

144
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,194
<i>was making us both miserable.</i>

145
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:33,801
<i>Most people
get divorced at that point.</i>

146
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:36,116
We didn't want to get divorced.
We still loved each other.

147
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:37,683
<i>We just realized</i>

148
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,622
<i>that expecting one person to fulfill
your needs forever is unrealistic.</i>

149
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:45,930
<i>There are happy monogamous
couples out there.</i>

150
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,275
Sure.

151
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,033
One or two have the perfect marriage.
Everybody else has figured out

152
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:51,808
how to settle for less.

153
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:55,135
I don't want to settle
and end up resenting my husband.

154
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,329
I'd rather get the 10%

155
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:01,200
he doesn't give me somewhere else
so that I can...

156
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:04,862
really appreciate him
for the 90% he does.

157
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,129
I think something's wrong.

158
00:10:11,874 --> 00:10:14,260
- <i>With your stomach?</i>
- My heart is racing.

159
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:22,537
Try and take deep breaths.
I'm gonna try to slow your heart down.

160
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:28,274
- Is this because of the blockage?
- No. It's not working.

161
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,692
Need a crash cart in here!

162
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:37,707
I need a list
of all your sexual partners

163
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:39,582
from the last six months.

164
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:42,516
- Why?
- Your wife had an arrhythmia.

165
00:10:42,706 --> 00:10:44,706
The progression of symptoms
from bowel to heart

166
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,801
makes a parasitic infection
most likely.

167
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:48,811
Since Julia hasn't been out
of the country...

168
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:51,649
The only place that I've been recently
is a business trip to Nebraska.

169
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:54,611
But either of you could have picked up
a bug from one of your partners.

170
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:58,834
It's kind of...

171
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:00,784
complicated.

172
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:03,460
How many partners
are we talking about?

173
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:04,585
Ballpark.

174
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,445
- None.
- None?

175
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,213
We have a great sex life.

176
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,337
I don't need anyone else.

177
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,424
So why not just tell her that
and close this whole thing up?

178
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,926
- You married?
- I was.

179
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:21,952
Did you ever agree to go see
a chick flick with your wife

180
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:23,932
or pretend to enjoy classical music?

181
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:27,227
Stravinsky never groped my wife
in a Midtown hotel room.

182
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:29,215
She needs this.

183
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:31,278
I don't.

184
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,942
But I don't want her
to feel bad about that.

185
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,376
He's lying.

186
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,726
Guy's got a license to drill.
Why would he lie about not using it?

187
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:42,897
That's not the lie.

188
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,399
The lie is that he gives a crap
about how his wife feels.

189
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,944
If they're both screwing around,
that's one thing.

190
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:50,083
But if she has a piece on the side
and he doesn't,

191
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,712
the only way he'd be okay with that is
if he's betraying her in some other way

192
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,546
that, in his mind, makes them even.

193
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:57,909
My Unicorn isn't a Unicorn.

194
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:00,629
It's a donkey with a plunger
stuck to its face.

195
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,438
Even the guy who's not cheating
is doing it for underhanded reasons.

196
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:05,976
He's not being cynical.

197
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,889
He's assuming the husband
is doing something to even the score,

198
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:12,439
which means he thinks
there is a score, which means,

199
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,607
cheating swans aside,
House believes in monogamy.

200
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,443
He's being romantic.

201
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,864
What I believe is that men are
genetically engineered to be jealous.

202
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,307
Doesn't matter if there's a score.
I guarantee you he does.

203
00:12:24,432 --> 00:12:25,952
Any of the wife's partners pan out?

204
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:29,243
She's been with two people
other than Tom in the last six months.

205
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:31,415
Neither of them have been
outside the tri-state area.

206
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,710
- We're back to the husband.
- You said you believed...

207
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,809
He's doing something
behind her back.

208
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:38,810
What better cover
than a business trip to Nebraska?

209
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,800
Like that's really a place.

210
00:12:41,313 --> 00:12:44,094
Let's find his travel records
and get back to work.

211
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:49,499
You seem pretty mellow
about this couple's deal.

212
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:51,996
Thought you'd be first
in line to shake a finger.

213
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,189
They're still married. I'm not.

214
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,349
Not that I could ever do it.

215
00:12:57,474 --> 00:13:00,153
I was jealous of House
and Cameron never touched him.

216
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:01,988
Not counting the emotional fondling.

217
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:06,868
When my mom was dying,
my dad had an affair.

218
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:12,655
- He told you this?
- I'd seen them get out of his car.

219
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,960
Two years after mom died,
they got married.

220
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:18,185
- That must have sucked.
- At the time, yeah.

221
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,348
But looking back...

222
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:22,297
It makes sense.

223
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:25,470
My mom never knew about it and he needed
someone to make him feel less alone.

224
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,305
He took care of my mom

225
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:30,306
day in and day out
for 21/2 years before she died.

226
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:31,643
He was devoted to her.

227
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,266
Loving someone else
didn't change that.

228
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:38,715
So loving two people at once is fine
as long as one of them is dying?

229
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,903
Whoever's taking care of me
when I get sick, I hope they've got

230
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,712
someone else to take care of them.

231
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:50,267
Tom was telling the truth.
He really did go to Nebraska.

232
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:53,148
Plane ticket and restaurant seats.

233
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:54,994
Forget Nebraska.

234
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,844
Maybe they just bought
their parasites at the mall.

235
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:03,758
We should really throw away
that loofah.

236
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,470
Sometimes they're not sterilized.

237
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:08,680
We think our patient
got amoebiasis from hers.

238
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:10,521
Is she gonna be okay?

239
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:12,476
We're treating now.
She should be fine.

240
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:16,241
It's actually kind of bizarre.

241
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:19,608
She and her husband
have an open marriage.

242
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,449
- They sleep with other people?
- She does. Her husband's fine with it.

243
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,310
It's crazy, right?

244
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,264
And you're bringing this up because?

245
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:41,419
I thought it was interesting.

246
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,050
More interesting
than your other cases, I guess.

247
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:50,471
I mean, you talk about your colleagues,
you rant about House.

248
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:53,395
You don't usually mention
your patients.

249
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:58,537
Is open marriage something you want?

250
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,610
I mean...

251
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:05,582
I know you'd never...

252
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:11,648
All this time

253
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,242
and energy you spent convincing me
you weren't cheating...

254
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:18,379
- And there's somebody else.
- I'm not...

255
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,499
There's a woman at work.

256
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:40,139
People say she's attracted to me,
but nothing's happened.

257
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:42,941
Nothing's going to happen.
I'm not having an affair.

258
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:46,052
- But you want to.
- No, honey.

259
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:49,573
I'm trying to be honest.
I don't want to make the same mistakes.

260
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,967
Be honest then.

261
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,954
Are you attracted to her?

262
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,254
She's attractive.

263
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:05,922
There's an attraction.

264
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,557
Aren't there men
who make you feel that way?

265
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:11,109
Of course there are,
but it never occurs to me

266
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:14,264
to act on it because I'm married,

267
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,516
to you.

268
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:19,411
And that's enough for me.

269
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,234
- Aren't I enough for you?
- Of course you are.

270
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:30,238
Our patient's lost all movement
in her legs.

271
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:33,347
There are other doctors, Chris.
We're talking.

272
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:35,873
I'm sorry.

273
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:38,934
The woman's paralyzed.

274
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,458
I'll get a cab.

275
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,511


276
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:57,759
Tests show no spinal cord injury,

277
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,934
no cerebral lesions, no hemorrhage.

278
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,312
Finally got a stool sample.
The loofah's innocent.

279
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,900
No sign of amoebas
or any other parasites.

280
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,218
So paralysis, arrhythmia,

281
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:08,943
and intermittent abdominal pain.

282
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,155
And he nicked himself shaving.

283
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,235
Sorry. That was Taub.

284
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:18,370
But it was easier to solve.

285
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,956
He used the crappy razor in his locker,
which means he slept here.

286
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,440
Thanks to you.

287
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:28,254
I brought up open marriage
with Rachel.

288
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:29,714
It was a disaster.

289
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:34,552
On the medical front,

290
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,596
we've knocked out sex
and foreign travel.

291
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,628
Could be an electrolyte imbalance.

292
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:41,685
The only time you're not interested
in my marriage is after you blow up?

293
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,187
You moron took marital advice
from Tila Tequila.

294
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,055
You pushed me into this.

295
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,733
Figured it would blow up your marriage
or make it more honest.

296
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:50,944
- Either way, you win.
- What about sex?

297
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,447
I'm talking about the patient.
Is that cool?

298
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,699
- We've ruled out sex.
- We ruled out sex with other people.

299
00:17:57,824 --> 00:18:00,286
He and Julia have been doing it
three or four times a week

300
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,436
and she's got boys on the side.

301
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:06,034
Increased libido can be a symptom
of adrenocortical carcinoma,

302
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,056
which also explains
her other symptoms

303
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:10,255
A woman who likes sex must be sick?

304
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,966
Because everybody here

305
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,593
wishes that all women
were horny all the time

306
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:17,215
doesn't make it so.

307
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:19,806
Get an MRI of her adrenal glands.

308
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,777
Okay if I take the sports page?

309
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,763
Sure.

310
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:41,870
Would you mind using a coaster?

311
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:44,762
Sure.

312
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:46,812
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

313
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:53,965
Also, it'd be great

314
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,426
if you'd replace the toilet paper
when you finish a roll.

315
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,011
And with the dishwasher,

316
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,528
you can't put a big, flat bowl
on the bottom.

317
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:03,963
It traps the water
so nothing on the top gets clean.

318
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:06,473
And don't throw banana peels
in the bedroom trash.

319
00:19:06,598 --> 00:19:09,439
I haven't done any of those things.

320
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,859
- You're probably not even aware of...
- I hate bananas.

321
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,492
My God, it was House.

322
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,977
I'm sorry.
He's been trying to get us to fight.

323
00:19:25,323 --> 00:19:27,540
Why would he think that stuff
would make us fight?

324
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:29,276
Because of the milk.

325
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,877
You put it in the door.

326
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:34,464
The body of the refrigerator
is the coldest part.

327
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,769
The temperature in the door fluctuates,
which decreases shelf life.

328
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:39,844
When did you get all OCD?

329
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,543
I just want clean dishes
and unspoiled milk

330
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:45,181
so we can all stay healthy.

331
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,936
It's about health.
What about the coaster?

332
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,941
Does that replenish my B12
or something?

333
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:54,045
- Can we just drop it?
- Sure.

334
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:06,442
You have this list of annoyances
the entire time we were married?

335
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:10,126
Get better, mommy.

336
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:12,544
I love you, rabbit.

337
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,337
You have a guest.

338
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,246
This isn't a good time.

339
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,350
Dr. Hadley, did you say
there was a video game in the playroom?

340
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:30,312
Maybe you can teach me
how to play one of them.

341
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,272
See you in radiology.

342
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:38,862
Get out of my wife's room.

343
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,198
Your relationship
stays out of our space.

344
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,950
- I was worried about her.
- Tom's right. You should go.

345
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:48,913
So it's fine if we have sex,
but if I drop by

346
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,031
- to see if you're okay...
- This is our family.

347
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:10,211
I spent two years of residency
wearing shirts a size too small.

348
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,037
How hard is it to ask me
not to put them in the dryer?

349
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:15,435
And I only did it
because you were never home.

350
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,355
- I didn't ask you to.
- Of course!

351
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,652
You got annoyed
when you didn't have clean underwear.

352
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,361
- I never said I was annoyed.
- That's the point.

353
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:25,867
- You didn't say anything.
- I'm getting a lecture on communication

354
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:29,120
from someone who had her lawyer
inform me our marriage was over.

355
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:34,311
Asking for an open marriage.

356
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:35,752
You got stones.

357
00:21:36,147 --> 00:21:39,505
Conversation sort of got away from me.
It was a train wreck.

358
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,266
It's good you brought it up.
I read a study

359
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:45,352
that found men who have multiple copies
of a certain vasopressin receptor

360
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:47,516
are twice as likely
to be unfaithful.

361
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:49,974
Maybe you're one of those guys.

362
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:53,033
So my cheating
is biologically predetermined?

363
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:54,331
Fantastic.

364
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:56,481
Multiply times five.
We need a better look.

365
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,942
I thought you'd be relieved.
This gets you off the hook.

366
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,226
It's just genetics.

367
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:03,404
I'm 5'6" and have a receding hairline.
I hate genetics.

368
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,872
Medulla's clean.

369
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,633
You don't wear lifts or hair plugs.

370
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,785
Being short and bald
doesn't hurt anybody.

371
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,588
The only thing hurtful
about your other genetic predisposition

372
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:13,212
is that you keep denying it.

373
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:15,437
It's not good for you or Rachel.

374
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:18,975
There's nothing there.
It's not adrenal cancer.

375
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:21,128
And maybe you're right about me.

376
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:23,633
But I'm not gonna stop trying.
Rachel's worth it.

377
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:25,081
Look up there.

378
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:27,544
The lung. What is that?

379
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,580
You served me with divorce papers

380
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:32,708
in the middle of a conference
in New Orleans.

381
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,870
- I threw a bottle into a mirror.
- You exhibited an emotion?

382
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:38,142
- I wish I'd known you were capable.
- I loved you.

383
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:40,638
I thought I was gonna be following you
to Baltimore.

384
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:42,876
I called about apartments.
I set up interviews.

385
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,904
How could you think
we still had a marriage?

386
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,934
We hadn't had a conversation
in months.

387
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:49,158
I was working two jobs
to support us.

388
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:52,682
It's because when you were home,
it was like talking to a block of ice.

389
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:56,082
- You were so pissed off at me.
- I was killing myself so you could take

390
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,435
- a non-paying internship.
- That you said I should take.

391
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,753
To be supportive!
Do I have to be the bad guy?

392
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,273
Expressing yourself
doesn't make you so.

393
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:05,717
Okay, then.
You were being a selfish bitch.

394
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,347
VQ scan confirmed the spot
on Julia's lung was a clot.

395
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:14,132
Think there's a chance
the husband's a plushie?

396
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,645
If he has a secret, I highly doubt
it's more relevant than the clot.

397
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:19,897
Clotting disorder
would explain everything.

398
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:21,774
Question is, which one?

399
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,642
Do you read
any of your departmental memos?

400
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,946
Only the ones labeled, "NSFW".

401
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,835
Accounting notified you two days ago
about your patient's insurance.

402
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,827
Sorry, that's "NNSFW".

403
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:33,995
Here.

404
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:37,240
He doesn't have any.
Try not to bankrupt them.

405
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:40,355
I'm long past the number of procedures
that'll bankrupt them.

406
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,068
Julia's got insurance.
I saw the policy number.

407
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:45,143
It lapsed due to non-payment.

408
00:23:45,268 --> 00:23:48,562
I already made three calls about this.
You should have been aware of that.

409
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,684
There's just a mistake.
Of course we have health insurance.

410
00:23:58,411 --> 00:23:59,611
We're actually

411
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,398
a little behind on the premiums.

412
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,401
But I pulled money
out of my retirement account

413
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,153
to cover it, we'll be fine in...

414
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:09,322
Why the retirement account?

415
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,950
We'll just give you
a few minutes to...

416
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,080
By "we", she means "she".

417
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,919
I lost all of our savings.

418
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,258
Sounds like a secret to me.

419
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,426


420
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:34,136
I started her on heparin
to prevent further clots,

421
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:35,973
but we still don't know
what's going on.

422
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,074
Of course the husband's secret
was money.

423
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,221
If it's not sex, it's always money.

424
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,042
Unless it's sex for money.

425
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:43,940
How did he lose it?

426
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,167
It's not relevant,
you're not gonna care.

427
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:48,194
Wilson's been teaching me. Try me.

428
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:51,546
He builds wind turbines and leases them
out to local power companies

429
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:54,117
You're right, I don't care.
Clotting disorder:

430
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,385
DIC, Factor Five Leiden,
antiphospholipid syndrome.

431
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,107
Vitamin K deficiency also fits.

432
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,375
Causes thrombophilia
and is consistent with abdominal pain.

433
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,041
Congratulations, House.

434
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:06,129
- Sam ended it.
- What happened?

435
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:08,610
Go test our patient's blood.

436
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:09,835
It can wait.

437
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,201
For everything we discussed.

438
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:19,258
I'm sorry.

439
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:24,305
At least you're taking responsibility
for once in your life.

440
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,024
Sorry that she left.
It's not my fault.

441
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,638
I didn't even want to get involved.

442
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:31,105
You dragged it out of me.

443
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,389
What about the dishwasher,
and the banana?

444
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:37,052
She left because of the banana.

445
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,871
I just wanted you
to stand up for yourself.

446
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,622
Tell her what you want.

447
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,947
If doing that causes her
to walk out for the second time,

448
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:46,919
your relationship wasn't gonna last
anyway.

449
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:50,339
Or you could have stayed out of it.
I could have kept my mouth shut,

450
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,462
been annoyed sometimes,
but I'd be happy with her.

451
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,686
Now all I have is cold milk.

452
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,433
As long as you're free,
you wanna grab some dinner?

453
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,647
Did Tom go home?

454
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,940
For starters. I told him to leave.
I don't want him here.

455
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:15,783
Money is a complicated subject.

456
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:18,223
It's not the money.

457
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:20,244
I mean, the money's bad, but...

458
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:26,747
When we first opened our marriage,

459
00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:29,495
I got involved with a guy
who lied about being single.

460
00:26:31,268 --> 00:26:32,757
Then one day, his wife calls me.

461
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:37,637
She's crying and screaming
and totally out of control.

462
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:40,151
And I felt,

463
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:43,588
superior.

464
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,354
I thought
I don't have to worry about

465
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,132
feeling this way
because we are honest with each other.

466
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,010
Well, here I am.

467
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,253
Sorry I didn't make it home last night.
I needed to run some tests.

468
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:14,476
You know what the worst part was?

469
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,467
When you had your affair.

470
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,304
Wasn't the sex.

471
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:22,989
It was the lies.

472
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,599
Realizing
that the narrative of my life was

473
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,725
totally wrong.

474
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:32,435
You weren't stuck in surgery.

475
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:34,292
You weren't out of town.

476
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:37,130
I don't want
to go through that again.

477
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,811
- I told you nothing's...
- Thursday nights.

478
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,347
You have to be home by midnight.

479
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:49,213
You don't bring her here.

480
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,727
You don't talk to her about me

481
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:55,715
and I don't want to meet her
ever in any context.

482
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:05,725
Are you giving me permission
to sleep with other women?

483
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,852
It's what you want, no?

484
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:10,534
I want you.

485
00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:13,097
You want more than me.

486
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,853
You want that thrill.

487
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,489
But I love you.

488
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,736
And I really believe
that you love me...

489
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:26,996
And we have a good life together.

490
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,222
And at this point, either I
walk away

491
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:34,939
or I try to accept
who you really are.

492
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,091
Tomorrow's Thursday.

493
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,351
Yes, it is.

494
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:51,280
All our tests came back negative.
It's not a clotting disorder.

495
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:54,190
Which means
we need to come up with a better idea.

496
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:58,475
So what causes problems
in the stomach, heart, nerves?

497
00:29:04,108 --> 00:29:05,510
You know what it is?

498
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:14,168
Taub's wife gave the green light
for an open marriage.

499
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,797
He's wearing cologne,
but not the stink of shame.

500
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:19,840
You got a date.

501
00:29:20,449 --> 00:29:22,559
I am going out with Maya tonight

502
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:24,485
with Rachel's blessing.

503
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:28,023
Mazel Tov?

504
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,646
Maybe the problem isn't her blood.
Maybe it's the vessels.

505
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,639
No sign of schistocytes
or hemolysis.

506
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:39,602
You're actually going to sleep
with a woman then go home to your wife?

507
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:42,771
Thank God someone's keeping us focused
on what's really important.

508
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:46,617
Taub was gonna do all of that anyway.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.

509
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:49,370
Imaging showed normal diameter
in her pulmonary artery.

510
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:51,372
Here's a thought...

511
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,739
Taub's wife is now
totally on the market.

512
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,580
Mind hitting me with her digits?

513
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,717
She would love that, but duty calls.

514
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,059
- What's the matter?
- My stomach.

515
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,687
- Same pain as before?
- Yeah, but worse.

516
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:18,023
Get the portable ultrasound in here.
We need to get a look at her belly.

517
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:19,108
Help me!

518
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,209


519
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:26,734
Pain, pain went away,

520
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:28,868
came back another day.

521
00:30:29,187 --> 00:30:30,822
Question is, what brought it back?

522
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:33,451
Physical exam was unrevealing.
Ultrasound was clean.

523
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,127
Are you gonna shower
at your girlfriend's or at home?

524
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,210
Patient.
Abdominal pain.

525
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,306
Yeah, he's right.
Let's get this wrapped up before 6:00.

526
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,928
Taub turns back
into a faithful Pumpkin at midnight.

527
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:47,173
Patient was out with her boy toy
before she came in.

528
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:49,450
Maybe the pain was triggered
by sexual excitement.

529
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:53,434
Because lying alone in a hospital bed
contemplating bankruptcy... hot.

530
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:57,980
My point was that arousal is a function
of the parasympathetic nervous system.

531
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,257
If that's where the problem is, the pain
could be triggered by crying, which...

532
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:03,214
PNS. Also controls digestion,

533
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:06,049
which she's been doing without screaming
her head off since she's been here.

534
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,954
What if matters isn't when the pain
started, but when it stopped?

535
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,391
It was during an X-ray.
You think that cured her?

536
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:14,330
No, but House prepped her
for the X-ray with a barium enema.

537
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,910
That wouldn't
treat anything except...

538
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:20,169
Go.

539
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,284
You're in pain because your intestine
folded in on itself.

540
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:25,598
- It's an intussusception.
- It's cutting off blood flow.

541
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:28,037
We need to fix it before your bowel
gets necrotic and dies.

542
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:30,558
- After that, will I get better?
- When this happens in adults,

543
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:32,226
it's usually a sign of cancer.

544
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,017
We'll fix the overlap, and then
search your intestine for tumors.

545
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:42,608
Foam?

546
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,780
I have a bad feeling about this.

547
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,908
A friend can't spontaneously buy
an overpriced Italian espresso machine

548
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,757
for another friend?

549
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,549
What did you do?

550
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:57,331
Nothing.
That's the beauty.

551
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,020
I genuinely tried to help Wilson.

552
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:03,356
I told him to stand up for himself,
which you know is legitimate advice.

553
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:06,004
- And his relationship blew up.
- Is he okay?

554
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,926
He'll be fine. Point is,
I realized something.

555
00:32:09,321 --> 00:32:11,804
I do nice things,
nice things happen to me.

556
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:13,138
Karma works.

557
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,516
So you're paying it forward?

558
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:19,340
If this should somehow lead
to Lucas dying

559
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:21,516
or oral sex,

560
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:23,567
so be it.

561
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:25,444
<i>Namaste</i>.

562
00:32:33,612 --> 00:32:35,272
Think I should wear a tie tonight?

563
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:37,599
This isn't weird at all.

564
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:39,178
I mean,

565
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:41,458
where's Rachel eating tonight?

566
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,270
Home.

567
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,379
What if she's going out too?

568
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,703
She is allowed to, right?

569
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:51,532
Of course.
It's only fair.

570
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:55,889
- But I don't think she will.
- Your wife only eats dinner at home?

571
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,506
If she did

572
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:02,605
go out, that would be tough,

573
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,773
but I think I can handle it.

574
00:33:05,092 --> 00:33:06,483
Don't do it unless you're sure.

575
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:09,069
I know
I'd rather be jealous than a liar.

576
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,084
Got something here.

577
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,169
Kelly clamp and scalpel.

578
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:15,534
Biopsy showed
non-specific inflammation,

579
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,230
which suggests IBD,

580
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:19,341
only it doesn't explain
the cardiac problems.

581
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:21,435
Or her declining kidney function.

582
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,326
We ran panels during surgery.

583
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,021
Actually...

584
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,337
IBD does make sense,

585
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,210
'cause it could trigger
ankylosing spondylitis,

586
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:32,403
which would explain
the heart and the kidneys.

587
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:35,494
Start her on sulfasalazine
and TNF-inhibitors.

588
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm not gonna see you
before you head off for Gomorrah.

589
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,901
Just remember,
if you get disoriented...

590
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,924
Breathe through your nose
and look for the horizon.

591
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:02,891
I can't.

592
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:06,397
I really thought I could do this.

593
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:12,177
Logically, it makes perfect sense.

594
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:14,422
But...

595
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,921
all afternoon,

596
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:20,506
all I kept thinking about was

597
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:23,474
the two of you, together.

598
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:28,231
- And you touching her.
- Nothing's happened.

599
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:30,694
It's okay.

600
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:32,903
I'm sorry.

601
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:35,857
'Cause I really wanted it...

602
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:41,793
I've been an idiot, I don't need
anything else, I just need you.

603
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,282
You mean that?

604
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I do.

605
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,590
I love you, Rachel.

606
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,096
- I love you too.
- Let's go home.

607
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,647
Is that okay?

608
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:01,081
There are other doctors.

609
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,157


610
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:11,517
The treatment's not working.

611
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,153
Her left kidney failed last night.
The other one's right behind it.

612
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,297
It's not ankylosing spondylitis.

613
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,224
Kidney biopsy
showed she had IGA nephropathy,

614
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,911
which could be caused by or associated
with any of these conditions.

615
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:25,414
We've gone
from too few ideas to too many,

616
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:27,791
and our patient's
running out of time.

617
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,263
Why the lack of afterglow?

618
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,088
Physio girl not as freaky
as you'd hoped?

619
00:35:34,214 --> 00:35:35,912
I went home with my wife.

620
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,136
After all that, you chickened out.

621
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:41,054
I can't hurt Rachel like that.

622
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,601
Sickle cell anemia
would have shown on blood tests.

623
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,728
No flattened intestinal villi
rules out celiac.

624
00:35:50,622 --> 00:35:51,622
Seriously?

625
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:55,795
Our patient's dying,
and we can't move past my sex life?

626
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,989
Seriously, you'd think it'd kill her

627
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,948
if we spend 15 seconds mocking you?

628
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:01,678
Time's up.

629
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:04,995
Normal liver enzymes rules out hep B
and cirrhosis.

630
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,934
Alport and anti-GBM antibody
are both untreatable,

631
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,834
so if she has them
we can't help her.

632
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:13,295
And it can't be
henoch-schonlein purpura.

633
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,554
No inciting
respiratory infection and no rash.

634
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,259
I don't care what it's not.
I want to know what it could be.

635
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:22,296
Well, everything left on the list.

636
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,473
The list was not created equal.

637
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:27,619
- Neither was man, by the way.
- Hemochromatosis is a possibility.

638
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:30,646
Excess iron builds up,
causes problems throughout the body.

639
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,816
Weil's syndrome also affects
multiple organ systems,

640
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:37,096
and it wouldn't have been treated
by the antibiotic the E.R. gave her.

641
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:38,737
Sarcoidosis makes sense too.

642
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:40,756
Good.

643
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:42,481
Treat for those three.

644
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,233
I think you should call Tom.

645
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,960
Am I gonna die?

646
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,962
I don't know.

647
00:36:57,656 --> 00:36:59,042
If he walked in here right now,

648
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:01,677
I'd look in his face
and all I would think is "liar".

649
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,679
Don't you think
that's kind of unfair?

650
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:05,973
You say honesty's all-important,

651
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,674
but you conveniently ignore the truth
that some truths hurt people.

652
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,520
Tom lied to protect you.

653
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:14,106
He was covering his ass.

654
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:16,251
I'm not talking about the money.

655
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,558
Tom hasn't slept with anyone else
in over a year.

656
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:25,993
He told you that?

657
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,540
So my entire marriage is a sham?

658
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,187
Your husband, who only wants you,

659
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:38,781
lied so that you could be happy.

660
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:42,217
That seems pretty real to me.

661
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,989
Listen, I'm sorry.

662
00:38:05,198 --> 00:38:07,351
Me too.
I shouldn't have said...

663
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:08,944
No, you were right.

664
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,412
I was selfish back then.

665
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:13,457
I'm trying to change.

666
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,663
And I don't know
if it's House or what, but...

667
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:20,964
you're different too.

668
00:38:22,201 --> 00:38:23,251
I'm trying.

669
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:30,515
I always thought
that I was keeping the peace,

670
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:35,587
but I was just resenting you
and giving you a reason to leave.

671
00:38:41,593 --> 00:38:44,798
I wish we had this fight
ten years ago.

672
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:53,622
Is it okay
if we don't give House the credit?

673
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:56,977
I recommend it.

674
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,467
"O" for three.

675
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,595
Her kidney function is still declining.
We're gonna need to start dialysis.

676
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,390
Glad the husband's back.

677
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,601
After missing so many little deaths,
he should be here for the big one.

678
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,645
Top six, anyone?

679
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,489
Polyarteritis nodosa?

680
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:21,051
We'd have seen some improvement
on prednisone.

681
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:26,822
Guy's wife's dying,
and he stops to buy flowers.

682
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,699
They're from his garden.
Mercury poisoning fits.

683
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,218
Those are lilacs.

684
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:36,289
My mom used to grow lilacs.

685
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,503
My dad made her get rid of them,
'cause there were too many bees.

686
00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:43,704
We ruled out HSP

687
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:46,258
'cause there was no inciting
respiratory infection.

688
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,136
But in rare cases,
it can also be triggered by a bee sting.

689
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,513
We also ruled it out
because there's no rash.

690
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,416
Maybe we just didn't see it.

691
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:02,899
Have you been stung
by a bee recently?

692
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:05,302
About a month ago.

693
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:09,114
What's going on?

694
00:40:09,764 --> 00:40:12,993
I think your wife
has Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

695
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:15,495
Systemic vasculitis can cause

696
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,623
lesions and inflammations
throughout the body.

697
00:40:18,808 --> 00:40:20,084
It's pretty awful,

698
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,954
which explains
why it was named after a German.

699
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,796
Actually two Germans.

700
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:27,233
Lesions can pop up in the heart,

701
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,254
sometimes in the kidneys,
but always on the skin.

702
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,556
- Means you'd have a rash somewhere.
- I don't.

703
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,099
Not that you know of.

704
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:40,204
Okay, I'm gonna have
to check your holes.

705
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,564
I'll start with the mouth.
If there's nothing there,

706
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,733
then things might have to get kinky.

707
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:45,901
Say aah.

708
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:50,614
I was kinda hoping for kinky.

709
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:52,449
Is that good or bad?

710
00:40:52,974 --> 00:40:56,203
We'll treat her with high-dose IVIG
and cyclophosphamide.

711
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:58,161
You should be fine.

712
00:40:59,756 --> 00:41:01,291
I'm gonna be okay.

713
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:05,295
I love you.

714
00:41:06,455 --> 00:41:08,215
That is adorable.

715
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:11,426
Other than you still wanting
to have sex with other dudes,

716
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,762
and him bankrupting your family,

717
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:16,032
I think you kids
are pretty much home free.

718
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,340
And...

719
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:28,654
You two made up?

720
00:41:30,462 --> 00:41:32,112
You can thank me later.

721
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:33,789
I'm all-in.

722
00:41:35,213 --> 00:41:36,381
All right.

723
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:40,179
Fold.

724
00:42:23,518 --> 00:42:24,624
You need a hand?

725
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,370
Thanks.

726
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,733
Sorry about canceling
the other night.

727
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:39,396
Me too.

728
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:01,620
You wanna go somewhere?
