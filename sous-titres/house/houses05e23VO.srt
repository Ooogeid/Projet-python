1
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,818
- It's way too fast.
- It felt good.

2
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,987
If we could clear
the stage quickly, please.

3
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,364
Maury, it's too fast.

4
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,699
- It's exactly the same.
- Then slow it down.

5
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,963
- Everything all right, Jeremy?
- - Sure.

6
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:39,004
- Ready whenever you are.
- From the allegro, please.

7
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,317
- What's his problem?
- His back's not 100%.

8
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:50,320
He can't talk
to the conductor like that.

9
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:51,384
No, he can't.

10
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:53,814
She could.

11
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:01,227
You OK with the lift?

12
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,749
I'll be fine unless
you mess up the timing.

13
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:13,447
- My timing is perfect.
- It was last night.

14
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,120
Moment of truth.

15
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:42,852
Damn it.

16
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,465
Penelope, are you all right?

17
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,868
She... she can't breathe!
Call a doctor!

18
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:08,085
House - Season 5 Episode 23
"Under My Skin"

19
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:15,215
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm

20
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,486
The HTeam's AnonymHouse

21
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:48,250
Are you gonna ignore me
all day again?

22
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:49,693
I help you.

23
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,462
You tried to kill Chase.

24
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,164
Doing what you wanted,
that's all, boss.

25
00:02:57,822 --> 00:02:59,470
- I exist.
- No, you don't.

26
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:02,765
I acknowledge
my subconscious exists.

27
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,033
Now go away.

28
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:08,437
Saying it is one thing.
Living it is another.

29
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,017
You're not rational...

30
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:14,985
not completely.

31
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:22,396
Put the phone on the receiver,
send the hookers home, and get dressed.

32
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:24,432
- We've got a case.
- I'm taking a personal day.

33
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:27,084
21-year-old star at the New York Ballet
collapsed on stage.

34
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,629
I love ballet.
But as someone may have mentioned,

35
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:31,505
I'm taking a personal day.

36
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,952
Cuddy said get your ass in
or you're fired.

37
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,007
- She's not gonna fire me.
- She's not gonna fire you...

38
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:38,899
if you don't go to work?

39
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:41,824
How long do you figure
till I just disappear?

40
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Hold on.

41
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:49,562
No tumors or punctures in the lungs,

42
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,857
no bruising,
no sign of trauma, no STDs.

43
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,184
And supplemental oxygen's only gotten
her saturation level to 60.

44
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:58,070
Lungs keep collapsing
despite a chest tube.

45
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:01,365
E.R. ruled out the obvious. White count
and temp were normal, so no pneumonia.

46
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,205
Coffee's burnt. Thirteen's wearing
cherry-flavored lip gloss.

47
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,745
Foreman's staring at you.
Any of that helpful?

48
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,875
STD?

49
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,374
We said the tests were negative.
You think we should...

50
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:15,927
She's a dancer.
What about dehydration?

51
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,728
What about a pulmonary contusion?

52
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:21,343
C.T. showed no inflammation
on the lungs.

53
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,161
What about dehydration?

54
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:28,851
B.U.N. and Creatinine
are elevated but within range.

55
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:31,888
I'm just the irrational
part of your brain,

56
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:33,898
but elevated means high, right?

57
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,609
Dehydration could hide an infection.

58
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,821
Dehydration could hide an infection.

59
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:44,766
Go treat her for the obvious I.V. fluids
and antibiotics for the pneumonia.

60
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,272
We're like Magic and Kareem.

61
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:56,200
Mr. Pietramala,
you have kidney cancer.

62
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:59,673
Is that a bad one?
I mean, they're all bad, but...

63
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,594
The door was closed for a reason.

64
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,221
Well, now it's open for a reason.
We need to talk.

65
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,933
He just told me
I have kidney cancer.

66
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,352
Then you'll obviously need
a moment to process.

67
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,151
I'm hallucinating.

68
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:19,412
I'm...

69
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,530
I'll be right back.

70
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,173
I need you to sit in
on my differentials,

71
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:31,664
- double-check everything I do.
- You can't treat patients...

72
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,081
It's got to be sleep apnea.
I get a good night's sleep,

73
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:35,488
and I still feel exhausted.

74
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,711
Lack of delta sleep
can lead to hallucinations.

75
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,516
Do you have
any other neurological symptoms?

76
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,257
- I don't think so.
- Aphasia?

77
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:43,968
Memory loss?

78
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,719
- Irritability?
- Yeah, that one!

79
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,722
- Don't deflect. He cares about you.
- You shouldn't be practicing.

80
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,349
- At least...
- Enough!

81
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,076
Don't give me the look.
I told you I was hallucinating.

82
00:05:57,802 --> 00:06:00,567
- Who were you talking to?
- Someone who's not actually here.

83
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,107
Beyond that seems irrelevant.

84
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:04,279
Your mind made a choice.
It means something.

85
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,090
You know
he's just gonna keep asking.

86
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:12,871
Good choice.
He feels bad.

87
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:15,334
You gonna help me or not?

88
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:23,549
I could eat from this place
seven days a week.

89
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,117
We practically do.

90
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,430
You can order tomorrow night.

91
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,931
- Do you want some wine?
- No, thanks.

92
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,481
I have my husband's sperm.

93
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,231
Your dead husband's?

94
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:42,638
We froze it when he got diagnosed.

95
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:44,719
And you kept it?

96
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,073
All this time?

97
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,941
I used to think
if I didn't find anyone, then...

98
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,116
- You found someone.
- I know,

99
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:56,707
- but...
- What if it goes wrong?

100
00:06:57,161 --> 00:06:58,876
What if I turn out to be

101
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,796
a radical anarchist with a secret family
and that I age backwards?

102
00:07:05,736 --> 00:07:07,968
Nobody plans on getting divorced.

103
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,981
I didn't plan on my husband dying.

104
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:13,026
But he did.

105
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:17,161
So you're saying
you want a prenup...

106
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:20,616
in liquid form.

107
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:28,984
What if it's not sleep apnea?

108
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:31,705
Trauma from
your motorcycle accident?

109
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,030
Vicodin abuse?

110
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,508
- You need to be admitted.
- I know you're wrong about sleep apnea,

111
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,704
which means you know
you're wrong about sleep apnea.

112
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:40,584
You're scared.
Tell him you're scared.

113
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,968
I can't sleep with you here.

114
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:04,153
Did it work?

115
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:06,527
Do you see someone
standing beside me?

116
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:09,571
Then, no.

117
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,891
So what's next on your list
of things it's not?

118
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,994
Patient's not responding
to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.

119
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:18,122
So run a test
to confirm it's pneumonia.

120
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,752
We can't do a bronc because
her lungs are still collapsed.

121
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,459
Transtracheal aspiration.

122
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:25,768
- That's basically waterboarding.
- It is pretty radical.

123
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:27,214
It's a great idea.

124
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,884
Regular radical, me radical, or

125
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,678
me out of my mind radical?

126
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,305
Somewhere between regular and you.

127
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:37,559
So what's the problem?

128
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,571
Everything okay?

129
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,323
Our patient can't breathe.

130
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:46,733
Either do the test
or come up with a better one.

131
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,785
So we're down to infection,
trauma, M.S., schizophrenia,

132
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,956
or pills.

133
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,410
Schizophrenia
usually manifests younger.

134
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,470
That's why
it's further down the list.

135
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:06,315
I can confirm an infection
with a simple blood test.

136
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,006
An infection can be treated...
cured.

137
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,842
Means you still got a job.
Means you still got a life.

138
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:15,583
It doesn't make it
a better idea, just a nicer one.

139
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,181
This the rational you talking?

140
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:21,518
Can't do this on my own.

141
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:29,359
When we inject the water,
it's gonna feel like you're drowning.

142
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,278
But it'll be over in a few seconds.

143
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:34,316
- Then it'll be better?
- A little.

144
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,682
Hold her shoulders down a little.

145
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:41,872
Ready?

146
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:54,718
You're doing great.
Here comes the liquid.

147
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,143
I slipped.

148
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,645
- No.
- What?

149
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:06,146
Her skin came off.

150
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:23,997
Her skin is sloughing off faster than
we can replace it with the artificial.

151
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:26,792
- Could be autoimmune.
- A.N.A. was negative.

152
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,754
- Focus on the lungs.
- You want us to ignore the fact

153
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,673
that she's lost 80% of her skin?

154
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,508
We know it's not lung cancer.

155
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,177
Could be a liver tumor,
eats through to the lungs.

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,473
Get an ultrasound of her liver.
If you find masses, get a biopsy.

157
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,180
We can't just ignore the skin.

158
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:46,144
It's obviously the most significant
and dangerous symptom right now.

159
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,107
I don't think it is a symptom.
I think we caused it.

160
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:53,819
- By doing what?
- I prescribed antibiotics.

161
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,986
Toxic epidermal necrolysis
that's a one-in-a-million reaction.

162
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,700
Yeah, well, maybe this is the one.

163
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:03,620
Get swabs
of her old skin to confirm.

164
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,975
- Where the hell were you?
- I do have a practice.

165
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,811
Ballerina
has toxic epidermal necrolysis.

166
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:31,103
- Are you sure?
- About to be.

167
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:37,154
You didn't do anything wrong.
You prescribed antibiotics.

168
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,219
Any other doctor would've done
the same thing.

169
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:42,044
Any other doctor?
Words can hurt, you know.

170
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:47,964
I have no reason to feel guilty.
It doesn't make any sense...

171
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,625
unless there's something wrong
in the limbic area of my brain.

172
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,421
- Guilt as a symptom?
- It's consistent with M.S.

173
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:58,528
And since the blood tests
were negative,

174
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,385
I have to apologize.

175
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:03,327
If I feel better, then you're right.
I was feeling an emotion.

176
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:04,952
If I feel nothing...

177
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:08,138
it means my limbic brain is shot.

178
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:23,996
I'm Dr. House.

179
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:28,633
Anyone explain to you your status?

180
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:33,210
They found a mass
in my liver, cancer.

181
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,379
They said they think
they can treat it

182
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,361
and that the skin
is starting to take.

183
00:12:37,486 --> 00:12:39,384
I'll be able to dance again.

184
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,761
She's half dead, and she's wondering
if she'll ever plie again?

185
00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:44,513
Healthy priorities.

186
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,281
Let the mocking begin.

187
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,064
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,147
I...

189
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:58,026
treated you for an infection
before confirming that you had one.

190
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:00,984
That's why you lost your skin.

191
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:03,407
I know you're in pain.
I know that I caused it.

192
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,784
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:08,808
Very nice.

194
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:13,938
Thank you?

195
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:21,341
Nothing.

196
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:32,242
Maybe you didn't mean it.

197
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,517
I meant it.

198
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,848
Did you do a liver biopsy
to confirm...

199
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:39,042
Couldn't. The artificial skin
was too thin. She'd bleed out.

200
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,527
- Why were you talking to the patient?
- I think skinless women are hot.

201
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:46,104
Do a transjugular liver biopsy.

202
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:49,035
If she bleeds,
at least it stays in her veins.

203
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,081
Did you just check
with Wilson again?

204
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:02,132
I felt nothing.
It's M.S.

205
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:05,758
Apologies aren't supposed to make you
feel better, but the other person.

206
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:08,068
- In order to make you feel better.
- Fine.

207
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,281
You want to do an L.P. to confirm,
or is guilt enough

208
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:12,392
to start filling prescriptions?

209
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,065
Last mass about a centimeter
to your right.

210
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,571
- Problem?
- Short burst of flutter.

211
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,282
- We're almost done.
- Entering the right hepatic vein.

212
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:31,773
Cameron kept
her dead husband's sperm.

213
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,541
She doesn't like yours?

214
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,293
She likes his better.

215
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,858
Or at least she...

216
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,457
wants to hang on to it
in case mine is...

217
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:45,217
unfaithful or something.

218
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,933
Advancing two centimeters.

219
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:55,349
You got to let her do it.

220
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:57,646
If you don't, you'll be stuck
with her forever.

221
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,357
I want to be stuck with her forever.

222
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,401
She married a dying guy.
She has issues.

223
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,153
You...

224
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:07,142
cannot leave her...

225
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,824
ever, for any reason,

226
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,390
'cause then you're not just
the guy who left her, you're the guy

227
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,181
who killed her kids.

228
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,431
That's not a good rhythm.
Get out.

229
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:21,503
Narrow complex tachycardia...
she's gonna crash.

230
00:15:26,673 --> 00:15:28,884
The biopsy was negative for cancer

231
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,804
but the procedure
sent her heart into a-fib.

232
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,108
We don't know it was the biopsy
that caused the problem.

233
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,100
Maybe the heart
caused the lungs to collapse.

234
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:36,601
Why is Wilson here?

235
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,187
You were looking for cancer.
Thought it'd be helpful.

236
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,853
- We didn't find cancer.
- Yes.

237
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:42,774
Which you reported
to me 5 seconds ago.

238
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,531
I'd let him finish his hors d'oeuvre

239
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:46,568
before getting the bouncer
to take care of him.

240
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:49,406
Until we can regulate the heart,
we can't get any meaningful pictures.

241
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,579
So we can't...

242
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:52,409
Metoprolol can correct
irregular heart

243
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,076
Tried it.
Didn't work.

244
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,745
Is Cuddy making him oversee...

245
00:15:57,144 --> 00:16:00,166
Heart's too irregular for MRI.
Other scans would...

246
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,294
Then you're making him
oversee your choices.

247
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,816
You don't trust yourself.

248
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:06,653
Why?

249
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:12,512
- Wilson, get out.
- Are you sure?

250
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:15,098
Do I need your approval
to throw you out?

251
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,120
You happy now?

252
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,700
There's only one time her heart's
gonna be perfectly still

253
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,695
for our pictures,
and that's when she's dead.

254
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,085
If it's not M.S.,

255
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,160
severe mental illness
and vicodin are all that's left.

256
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:39,888
Mental illness means...
you can no longer practice medicine.

257
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,126
Vicodin means detox,
which means pain

258
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:45,283
for the rest of your life,

259
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:48,612
which means you can no longer
practice medicine.

260
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,645
Are you saying we should kill her?

261
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,442
If we stopped her heart, we could get
our pictures and then restart it.

262
00:17:08,323 --> 00:17:11,696
- What if we can't restart it?
- Then she stays dead.

263
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,491
We restart hearts all the time.

264
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,615
It'll take four minutes
for us to MRI her entire heart.

265
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,190
And we only have three minutes
until there's brain damage.

266
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,780
You sure about this?

267
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:30,934
We're gonna stop her heart
so I can MRI it.

268
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,899
I think it was her idea.

269
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:35,553
Pneumonia was her idea, and it
almost killed the patient.

270
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:37,305
Her?

271
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:42,806
Kutner was secretly a woman.

272
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,522
That's why he killed himself.

273
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:48,566
It's Amber.

274
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:53,319
Your subconscious picked
my dead girlfriend?

275
00:17:53,444 --> 00:17:55,415
The irrational part of my brain

276
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,834
works like the rational part of yours.
How about that?

277
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,203
It... raises questions.

278
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,652
- It answers questions.
- Who cares?

279
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,225
I've got competing ideas.
They can't both be right.

280
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,000
Everybody gets competing ideas.
Everybody has doubts.

281
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,256
So is it regular radical, me radical,
or me out of my mind radical?

282
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:14,926
It's on the upper end of you radical.
Do you have any alternative?

283
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:18,535
Nothing that anyone
in my head has come up with.

284
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,731
- Then you're as safe as you can be.
- Great.

285
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:28,266
- You get the L.P. results back?
- Yeah.

286
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:32,132
It's a big shock. You don't have M.S.
But while I had your blood sample,

287
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:34,946
I checked vicodin levels...
way too high.

288
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,906
- I need the pills.
- Not an argument.

289
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,408
He knows that.

290
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:40,827
It could still be schizophrenia.

291
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,130
If you're on anti-psych meds,
you're not gonna be able to practice.

292
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:45,263
I know.

293
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:48,565
You'd prefer
electroshock therapy to rehab?

294
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,901
I'd prefer something
that could actually work.

295
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:53,363
- You're rationalizing.
- No kidding.

296
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:56,968
I know that you're afraid
of the pain, but electroshock...

297
00:18:57,383 --> 00:19:01,264
Don't give me the cancer voice,
that overly earnest tone.

298
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:05,382
Heart attack, stroke,
seizure, death, or worse.

299
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,395
Worse?
Double death?

300
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,857
You live, but you damage the only thing
you care about... your rational mind.

301
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,449
I'll make some calls.

302
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:27,252
I'll actually be dead?

303
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,409
Just your heart,
just for a little while.

304
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:31,503
Hopefully.

305
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:52,023
I had an idea.

306
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:56,611
- Stop having ideas.
- Insulin shock.

307
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,532
That's marginally
less dangerous than E.C.T.

308
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,992
- <i>Puts you in a coma. Could cause...</i>
- Could work.

309
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,286
If you had psychosis,
which you don't.

310
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:08,505
I've had no diarrhea,
no sweating, no vomiting,

311
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,744
none of the symptoms
of Vicodin overdose.

312
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,002
Yeah, except
the "I see dead people" thing.

313
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,046
I've been popping pills for years.

314
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,049
I've only been seeing things for days.
Something changed.

315
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,552
Vicodin addiction
is still more likely.

316
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:24,848
- We're no longer dealing in absolutes.
- I'll be up in five minutes.

317
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,991
Then we can talk about how you'd rather
be in a coma than in rehab.

318
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:32,016
Actually, if you could be up here
in two, that'd be really helpful.

319
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:33,231
Why?

320
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,985
'Cause I'm about to put myself
into insulin shock.

321
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:40,882
- Left atrium is fine.
- Left coronary artery also fine.

322
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,490
- We're at 3 minutes.
- Continue.

323
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,576
- Chordae tendineae clear.
- Right is fine.

324
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,870
- I start her back up. It's over.
- We have time.

325
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,947
- Right coronary artery is fine.
- The 3-minute threshold is a guideline.

326
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:53,334
- She might have less. We have to stop.
- What's that by the aorta?

327
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,169
- I see nothing.
- I'm restarting it.

328
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,232
That's a shadow. Two centimeters...

329
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:03,684
You're only scared
because you know this is gonna work.

330
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:16,107
We're over three minutes.

331
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,556
I need glucose in here!

332
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:31,891
You could've died.

333
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:42,174
It worked.

334
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:45,625
Where are my pants?

335
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:50,490
Are you sure?

336
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:52,826
She's been everywhere
I've been for days.

337
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:57,083
- She's not here, ergo...
- This was not the next rational step.

338
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,089
Now who's being biased?

339
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:02,088
You wanted me to detox
as much as I wanted...

340
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,676
- I forgot how to do my zipper.
- Any other neurological deficits?

341
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:09,707
You don't seem to annoy me
as much as usual.

342
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:12,550
Not sure that's a deficit.
And...

343
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:14,965
I'm all better.

344
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:20,106
- Is she really gone?
- Absolutely.

345
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:23,067
I can feel myself repressing
all kinds of icky things.

346
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:25,895
I check out, don't I?

347
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:32,493
Damn.

348
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,884
He didn't see anything.
He saw an artifact on the monitor.

349
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:42,839
It was a shadow on her heart.

350
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,341
She'd already been technically dead
for three minutes.

351
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,842
I thought keeping her alive
took precedence

352
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,178
- over prolonging the photo op.
- Any brain damage?

353
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,138
- No, all tests indicate...
- Obviously you had more time.

354
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:56,074
Best of luck.

355
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:01,105
I assume we can't kill her again
and take more pictures.

356
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:03,740
- You'll want to check with Wilson?
- Good one.

357
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:07,320
- It's something, a lesion.
- Tumor, scar tissue.

358
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,782
Could be an abscess, infection.
Explains why it's invisible in blood.

359
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,296
It's doing its damage
behind closed doors, sealed off.

360
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:15,495
See, the problem with speculation

361
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:19,040
is you make a spec out of "u"
and some guy named "lation,"

362
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,044
- which really doesn't affect me at all.
- We have to guess. It's all we've got.

363
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,319
We can't do a biopsy.

364
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:27,389
Last time we went into her heart,
she had a major cardiac event.

365
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,593
Which just leaves...

366
00:24:36,271 --> 00:24:37,879
What are you looking for?

367
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:39,811
I don't know yet.

368
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:43,689
The picture doesn't change.
She lies there in pain.

369
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:45,983
He sits there worried.

370
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:50,836
Nothing changes.

371
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:57,032
I just had an epiphany...

372
00:24:57,494 --> 00:24:58,694
all by myself.

373
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,916
- Popped into my head out of nothing.
- Care to share?

374
00:25:02,244 --> 00:25:04,494
- He's too devoted.
- Too devoted?

375
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,203
- You think he feels guilty?
- Right, I'm being cynical.

376
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:10,753
People can care because they care,
not because they cheated,

377
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:12,328
theoretically true.

378
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:16,013
- But gonorrhea fits better.
- No. No STDs. We tested her.

379
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,881
- You tested her blood.
- That is the test.

380
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:21,156
That's not where her problem is.

381
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,415
Gonorrhea disseminated to her heart,

382
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:27,441
got walled off in an abscess.
It'd be invisible.

383
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:28,619
And...

384
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,319
would look like a shadow.

385
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:33,853
No need to test her again,
but we can check Prince Charming.

386
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:36,701
Once you confirm,
cut the abscess out of her heart.

387
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:43,428
Here are your onion rings,
extra well-done.

388
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:44,903
Thank you, Molly.

389
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:47,403
And another beer when you get a chance.
I'm celebrating.

390
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:48,528
Alone?

391
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:50,937
Thank goodness.

392
00:25:57,813 --> 00:25:59,374
Don't tell me.
I was right.

393
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:01,350
Yep.
Boyfriend has gonorrhea.

394
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:04,438
- And everyone's a winner.
- He's not too happy about it.

395
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,102
He insists he's never cheated
and must've gotten it from her.

396
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:09,382
- Don't think so.
- Timing would fit.

397
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:12,863
- He's got no symptoms, and she's dying.
- Lying would fit too.

398
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,652
He's not hanging out
in her room anymore.

399
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,134
What does it matter?
You were right.

400
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,394
<i>We're prepping her for surgery.</i>

401
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,830
I saw guilt in him.

402
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:30,849
If he's not actually guilty...

403
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,836
then I wasn't right.
I was lucky.

404
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,214
You made a brilliant deduction
about her heart.

405
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:40,139
And if I was just lucky...

406
00:26:51,998 --> 00:26:55,261
<i>Enjoy yourself</i>

407
00:26:56,993 --> 00:27:00,198
<i>It's later than you think</i>

408
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:04,710
<i>Enjoy yourself</i>

409
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:09,771
<i>While you're still in the pink</i>

410
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:12,964
<i>The years</i>

411
00:27:13,637 --> 00:27:15,132
<i>go by</i>

412
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:19,708
<i>As quickly as a wink</i>

413
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,858
<i>Enjoy yourself</i>

414
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,842
Wilson... come get me.

415
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,355
<i>It's later than you think</i>

416
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,497
I know a nice facility
outside Philly.

417
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:50,191
I went to undergrad
with one of the directors.

418
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:09,345
How many shirts do I need?

419
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:10,871
They said three.

420
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:12,892
They have laundry.

421
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:15,627
Like living with mom again...
delightful.

422
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,961
It's probably Foreman.

423
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:23,451
He's unavailable.

424
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,127
Tell her the infection's made her
septic. We can't remove the abscess

425
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:28,747
until we get her B.P. up.
And it's not responding to fluids.

426
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:30,750
- It's not...
- He's off the case.

427
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:35,963
- Patient okay?
- Yeah.

428
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,381
He's lying.

429
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:48,204
Why don't I feel scared?

430
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:53,579
I'd say you're unaware
of what you're feeling at this moment.

431
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:55,771
I feel like crap.

432
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:59,046
My life is falling apart,
but I don't feel scared...

433
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:01,247
not of the rehab anyway.

434
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:03,741
We've always been able
to find a way to cheat.

435
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,374
It won't work.

436
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:13,376
You want it to work this time.

437
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,685
Do we?

438
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,714
It's your only option.

439
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:22,134
What do I do
if my only option won't work?

440
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,584
You don't give up.

441
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:32,478
It's either that
or electroshock every six hours.

442
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,431
Good night, Wilson.

443
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:40,511
- Let's put her on a heart-lung machine?
- She's septic.

444
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:42,192
We don't need a heart-lung machine.

445
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:44,532
We need a "blood vessel
holder together" machine.

446
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,325
We could try high-dose dopamine.

447
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,861
It's a vasoconstrictor.

448
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,230
It'll close the blood vessels
so she won't bleed out.

449
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,665
Her heart can't take
that much dopamine. It'll explode.

450
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:55,459
And if we don't use the dopamine,
it'll implode.

451
00:29:55,702 --> 00:29:57,252
Is House really done?

452
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,346
It sounded that way.

453
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:03,523
Dopamine it is.

454
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,401
It's late, and I'm tired.

455
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:27,825
Can we get to the talking part
of this conversation?

456
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:31,896
I quit.

457
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:33,645
Great.

458
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:38,836
My nanny is off the clock at 7:30,

459
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:39,970
so...

460
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:41,853
your week off,

461
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,741
bigger desk...

462
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:47,240
tighter nurses uniforms,

463
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:50,744
or whatever other stupid thing
you're about to demand

464
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:52,748
is gonna have to wait until...

465
00:30:52,873 --> 00:30:54,944
You can go suckle
the little bastard child

466
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:56,980
who makes you feel good
about yourself.

467
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,205
Screw you.

468
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,323
Don't do this.

469
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,049
I'm hallucinating.

470
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:13,079
From the vicodin?

471
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,650
Ruled out everything else.

472
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:26,197
We can...

473
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:29,694
admit you through the E.R.
under a pseudonym.

474
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,121
- No one has to...
- I'll cheat...

475
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,516
Scam,

476
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,145
find some way to keep using.

477
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,145
- These people know what they're doing.
- These people don't know me.

478
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:40,920
You do.

479
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:43,859
She's not your keeper.
She has no responsibility for you.

480
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:49,365
I need you.

481
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:57,081
Let me call my babysitter.

482
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,306
- Blood pressure's 90 over 60.
- We know.

483
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:15,949
I'm just saying.

484
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:19,388
- It's still 90 over 60. It's holding.
- Abscess is intact.

485
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:21,772
Doesn't look like any of the
surrounding tissue is affected.

486
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,357
She's gonna be fine.

487
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:24,931
Doctor.

488
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:40,541
We've got a problem.

489
00:32:48,337 --> 00:32:50,487
Lie down.
I'll get you some tea.

490
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:55,867
Then I'll be better.

491
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,310
Do you really think
she hasn't searched this place

492
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:08,135
for your secret stash?

493
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,199
I already did this room...

494
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:17,296
and the bathroom and your bedroom.

495
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:20,956
Where should I look, in the kitchen?

496
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:27,129
Coffee cup in... in the top shelf.

497
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:30,174
That was a test.
I already did the kitchen.

498
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:34,525
Nicely played... She'll think
you've come clean, given her everything.

499
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:40,142
- There's more.
- Don't! You're hurting already.

500
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,643
It'll only get worse.

501
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,198
House, you should tell me
where it is now,

502
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:47,608
because you won't have the will
to tell me in two hours.

503
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:54,636
My shoes in the closet.

504
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,036
It's like I don't even know
who you are anymore.

505
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:09,822
It's okay.

506
00:34:10,336 --> 00:34:11,486
Hold my hand.

507
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:32,901
Am I okay?

508
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:37,282
We were able to successfully remove
the abscess from your heart.

509
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,452
But the dopamine caused
the blood vessels in your hands and feet

510
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,648
to clamp shut.

511
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,416
We need to amputate,
or the gangrene will spread.

512
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:46,892
You'll die.

513
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:50,104
My feet?

514
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,210
And your hands.

515
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:53,924
I'm sorry.

516
00:34:57,682 --> 00:34:59,569
No.
I'm a dancer.

517
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:02,599
The tissue can't be saved.

518
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:12,238
We know what House would do.

519
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:14,738
House would have never woken her up
to ask for consent.

520
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,735
If you can't live with the answer,
don't ask.

521
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,110
- We should accept her decision?
- Bold idea, I know.

522
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,453
Maybe we can get the boyfriend
to convince her.

523
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,580
Yeah, boyfriends
get everything they want.

524
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:27,583
Forget it.

525
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,934
The boyfriend doesn't want
to talk to her anymore.

526
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:33,422
- Where are you going?
- Home. The case is over.

527
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,740
No, it's not.

528
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:37,545
Not until we come up
with something that might work.

529
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,996
It's a shame that she might die

530
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,723
because House has some
personal crap to work through.

531
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,455
Technically, if she dies,

532
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,937
it's because House has some
personal crap to work through,

533
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,605
and we weren't smart enough
to get the answer without him.

534
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:07,736
False alarm.

535
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:09,503
Drink this.

536
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,461
That's your advice... drink this?

537
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:15,986
It's Ginger.
It'll ease the nausea.

538
00:36:16,546 --> 00:36:18,588
You know what would calm the nausea?

539
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:19,713
Vicodin...

540
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:21,729
marijuana...

541
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:23,624
a coma.

542
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:28,194
Don't pretend you didn't see it.

543
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:30,103
I saw it, which means you saw it.

544
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:32,836
Send her away.

545
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,531
Too bitter.

546
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:42,862
I already had enough bitter.

547
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:44,548
I'll add some Honey.

548
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,634
You're pathetic.

549
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,295
If you want the pill,
just send her home.

550
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:57,735
But you can't,

551
00:36:57,956 --> 00:37:00,601
because that would be
admitting defeat to her.

552
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:15,899
Now, this is interesting.

553
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:19,127
If you take the pill,
you don't deserve her.

554
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,488
If you secretly take the pill,

555
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,019
you don't deserve anyone.

556
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:57,283
This isn't gonna work.

557
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,860
It might work.
That's all we're going for.

558
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:01,570
Vasodilators can...

559
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,156
Big jump from reopening
to reanimating.

560
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:06,138
I'm out of the ulnar.

561
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,906
I'm not seeing any clearing.
This won't work.

562
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:11,788
This probably won't work.

563
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,499
- Radial artery's really tight.
- Don't go too fast.

564
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,251
If it clots, she loses the hand.

565
00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:18,492
If it clots, she's dead.

566
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,529
- I can't believe it.
- What?

567
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,973
It might be working.

568
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:45,402
Can you stop?

569
00:38:46,777 --> 00:38:47,977
The breathing.

570
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,470
Air goes in, air goes out.

571
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,316
Then use your nose.

572
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:57,528
You're supposed to feel like crap.

573
00:38:57,653 --> 00:38:59,103
You're doing great.

574
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,373
And after?

575
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,119
You come back to work.

576
00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:07,094
What if I can't?

577
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,225
Opioid dependency can make you think

578
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,714
you have more pain
than you really have.

579
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,772
You're gonna be okay.

580
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,191
You're telling me what I want
to hear with no evidence.

581
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:23,610
I'm telling you
what I believe to be the truth.

582
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,903
With no evidence.

583
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,239
You're hardly
the most unbiased observer.

584
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,657
Neither are you.

585
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:32,631
I'm your hospital's biggest asset.

586
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:37,961
Is that why you think I'm here?

587
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:40,502
It's why you're here.
It's why you're lying to me about...

588
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,870
I haven't lied to you in 20 years.

589
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:44,965
Sure you have.

590
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:50,369
Which means that you said that

591
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:53,819
because you want to tell me
what you lied to me about 20 years ago.

592
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:57,149
You're an ass.

593
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,238
Am I wrong?

594
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,651
I wasn't
in your endocrinology class.

595
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,675
You sat next to me.
I cheated off you on...

596
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,450
I audited your endocrinology class.

597
00:40:14,054 --> 00:40:15,304
Why would you...

598
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:19,708
Because I thought
you were an interesting lunatic

599
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:20,953
even then.

600
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:26,631
I'm not here
protecting hospital property.

601
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:39,686
We're alone.

602
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:44,524
We've been alone all night.

603
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:48,001
No, I mean Amber.

604
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:51,592
She's gone.

605
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:12,235
Where's Jeremy?

606
00:41:13,143 --> 00:41:14,143
He left.

607
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,470
You okay?

608
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,625
The surgery worked.

609
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:37,321
Congratulations.

610
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:43,751
I can't do it.

611
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:49,297
You have doubts.

612
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:51,783
You don't?

613
00:41:57,138 --> 00:41:58,241
Well, that's...

614
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:01,977
naive.

615
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,894
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

616
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:06,898
I love you.

617
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,525
That's how I feel right now,

618
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,502
but...

619
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:11,201
I don't...

620
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:13,785
know.

621
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,853
I'll wait until you do.

622
00:42:21,755 --> 00:42:22,831
I can't know.

623
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:25,926
No... no one knows.

624
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:30,291
I do.

625
00:42:38,868 --> 00:42:42,240
I'll see you in later?
I have some papers to push for you.

626
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,983
You want to kiss me, don't you?

627
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,280
I always want to kiss you.

628
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:26,209
