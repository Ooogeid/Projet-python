1
00:00:01,615 --> 00:00:02,883
We just arrived.

2
00:00:03,994 --> 00:00:04,865
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:06,518
The kid's okay on your end?

4
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:08,229
Good.

5
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:10,684
Yeah. He's very excited.

6
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:14,029
Hey, listen. I got to go, okay?
I'll call you tomorrow.

7
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:15,293
Excuse me.

8
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:21,189
Get away.

9
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:22,881
Get away.

10
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,578
Sorry about that. Sorry.

11
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,335
What's wrong with him?

12
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,016
Excuse us.

13
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:33,462
I'd got to go back kick the hell
out of that guy.

14
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:35,673
She's old enough.
She didn't have to scream like that.

15
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:37,774
It's okay, dad.
It didn't bother me.

16
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:40,081
For the first time,
none of these people bother me.

17
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,127
I just think 36 more hours.

18
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,689
36 more hours.
How do you figure that, Kenny?

19
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:46,844
Tomorrow at this time,
I'm scheduled for surgery.

20
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:49,751
It's a ten-hour procedure,
throw two in it for prep.

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,809
36 until I'm just another
face in the crowd.

22
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:31,155
Kenny has a frontonasal encephalocele.
It's a midline deformity.

23
00:01:31,346 --> 00:01:33,597
He's here to undergo a facial bipartion.

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,074
And what does that mean?

25
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,645
Well, we have five surgeons,
four nurses.

26
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:39,745
It's going to require 6 units of blood.

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,781
Will it fix him?

28
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:42,950
It'll repair a lot of the damage
done by...

29
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,061
We need a sound bite.
Would you say he'll be ready

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,440
for the junior prom?

31
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:49,448
Yeah, yeah.
That's probably true.

32
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:51,421
No, I mean I need you to say it.

33
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:53,973
Dr. Chase, we got an issue.

34
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,966
Heart rate's sky rocketing.
He's over 180.

35
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:59,802
He's in V-fib.
Paddles. Charge to 300.

36
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:02,477
Turn that camera off.
Is this a reaction to anesthesia?

37
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,201
Haven't given it yet.

38
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:05,869
Clear.

39
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:08,489
Crank it to 360.

40
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,321
I said turn that damn camera off!

41
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:12,322
Clear.

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,842
Season 4 - Episode 7
"Ugly"

44
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:51,154
A teenage boy with a cranial
facial deformity was about to undergo

45
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,743
a reconstructive procedure when
he had an unexplained cardiac arrest.

46
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:56,610
Good.

47
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,133
Good?

48
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,405
I mean, go on.

49
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,441
We have the patient on a pacing wire.

50
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:09,116
It's the only thing
keeping his heart going.

51
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:11,439
Yeah, we know, we're doctors.

52
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:14,859
- Right. It was... Just for them.
- Just be yourself.

53
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:20,809
Until we are able to figure out
exactly what is causing the heart block,

54
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:24,107
the reconstructive surgery
is on hold, obviously.

55
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,287
That's yourself?

56
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:28,952
Fascinating case.

57
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:32,530
I will see you again
after I have saved his life.

58
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:34,767
Have a warm bath waiting.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,640
Are you following me?

60
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,310
Darnell will be trailing you
throughout the case.

61
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,974
Pretend we're not here.

62
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:48,741
- If I do that, won't I bump into you?
- We'll stay out of your way.

63
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,175
That's a joke.

64
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:54,271
See, I became a doctor because
of the moviepatch Adams.

65
00:03:55,965 --> 00:04:00,063
Listen, you wanna get ahead of me?
Maybe back up, I don't know, low down,

66
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,241
- so I look more powerful?
- That's perfect.

67
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,154
Yeah?

68
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:05,745
Also my eyes look better
in rooms with summer colors.

69
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,066
You know what?
It's black and white...

70
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:12,758
You think I like the cameras?

71
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,540
You think I want the whole world
watching you check out my ass

72
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,661
and question my wardrobe?

73
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:22,144
Would it be better if I checked out
your wardrobe and questioned your ass?

74
00:04:22,198 --> 00:04:24,627
- A little part of me...
- There is no little part of you.

75
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,992
Thought that maybe you would see

76
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,201
what great PR this could be
for the hospital,

77
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,019
and not make me force you
to act like a human being.

78
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,847
You using force on me is intriguing.

79
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,782
On the other hand,
cameras make people act.

80
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,324
Sometimes like human beings.
Sometimes just weird.

81
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:44,758
Sometimes they wear open-tip bras.

82
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,903
It's cold in here.

83
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,566
A less obvious point is that
I need my team

84
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,706
to be unafraid of the metaphorical fart.

85
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:55,784
That production company is covering all
the medical costs for this kid.

86
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,444
So either you let them continue filming,

87
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:01,237
or the kid goes home with the same face.

88
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:09,658
Sorry about that.

89
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:11,297
Private. She...

90
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:15,008
Waxes her moustache once a month and...

91
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,322
Sometimes gets some pretty
gnarly ingrown hairs.

92
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,281
So did he hire you flat out,

93
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:31,519
or are you competing
for one of the spots?

94
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,523
- I'm not sure what you mean by that.
- She's not competing.

95
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:37,958
She was hand-picked by House.
She's safe, like Foreman.

96
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,085
So that takes three spots down to one.

97
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:46,880
Where's Foreman?

98
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:49,968
- He's in the bathroom.
- Good. Come on. Let's go for a walk.

99
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,114
Walks look good on camera.

100
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,927
They give the illusion
of the story moving forward.

101
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,963
New patient.

102
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:10,377
16-year-old boy with second degree
infranodal heart block post-arrest.

103
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,614
Any reports
of lightheadedness or syncope?

104
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,284
- It's really not lightheadedness.
- Why did you hire her?

105
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,930
- Not in front of the company.
- Are we gonna be on TV?

106
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:21,214
I'm making a music video.
Come on, a little faster. More energy.

107
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:24,600
- Why are you glad Foreman's not here?
- Because he would object

108
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:26,141
to what I'm about to do.

109
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,450
Hey, Buddy.

110
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:38,913
You stay in there.
We'll be out here making sure

111
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:42,249
he doesn't move again.
God! Finally hear myself think.

112
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:45,211
- Our patient...
- Why did you hire her?

113
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:49,793
Because she has way more
diagnostic experience

114
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,264
than the other swimsuit models
I was considering.

115
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:54,907
Our patient has
a frontonasal encephalocele

116
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,502
with a midline cleft.

117
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,180
Don't stare directly at it.

118
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,149
So what caused big head's heart to stop?

119
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,087
Simple... His big head.

120
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:08,394
Increased intracranial pressure
would cause heart block.

121
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:12,477
Wrong, 16 years they've been testing
that insane noggin to death.

122
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:16,652
What about a congenital heart defec?
He has a midline anomaly on his head.

123
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,370
Makes sense he'd have a midline
anomaly in his heart too.

124
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,743
- That 16 years of testing didn't show?
- Why did you bring her in so late?

125
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,290
- It's not fair. The rest of us...
- Hey, you wanted fair,

126
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:28,877
you picked the wrong job.
The wrong profession.

127
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:31,259
The wrong species.
Forget the deformity.

128
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:34,218
Treat the patient like he's any
other really, really ugly kid.

129
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,215
Infection could be endocarditis.

130
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,664
Well, since he doesn't have
a prosthetic heart valve,

131
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,730
I assume you're thinking
he's an IV drug user?

132
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,139
House said assume he's normal.

133
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:44,563
Dealers don't ask for ID and
don't care what you look like.

134
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:46,423
Nice. You're right about the habit.

135
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:49,647
You're wrong about the substance.
Blackened skin under the nose

136
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,459
equals frostbite from huffing freon.
Freon's toxic.

137
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:53,543
Damages the heart.

138
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:55,762
Discoloration could be
acanthosis nigricans.

139
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,799
It's a common side effect
of these deformities.

140
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,153
There's also discoloration
on the cheeks and forehead.

141
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,549
Do a nuclear study.

142
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:04,051
If I'm right,
you'll see scarring of the heart.

143
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,831
I'm not part of some game, am I?

144
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,092
I gave up a career because
I thought this was a firm offer.

145
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,745
Yes. This is a real offer.

146
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,069
I think she might be an idiot.

147
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:29,420
- Who?
- She can't be an idiot.

148
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:31,979
She was in the CIA, for god's sake.

149
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:36,282
- The bay of pigs was a daring triumph.
- She had good ideas in Langley.

150
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:39,046
- All your ideas.
- She was able to identify

151
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,295
- that they were good ideas.
- Stab in the dark here.

152
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:42,787
- Is she pretty?
- She's new.

153
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:44,495
- She's nervous.
- She's a "c" cup.

154
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,448
She said one dumb thing
in a differential.

155
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:48,229
They all say dumb things
in differentials.

156
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:49,159
A "d" cup?

157
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,689
- She's no good. Just fire her.
- I can't.

158
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:53,861
I just hired her.

159
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:55,836
She left a career.

160
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:02,871
You know, that's actual guilt,
or I've got to see this woman.

161
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,577
- My son is not huffing freon.
- Mr. Arnold, Dr. House is like a savant

162
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,431
when it comes to diagnostics.

163
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,174
What's his genius theory?

164
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:16,404
Because Kenny's not normal,

165
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:18,403
he's doing drugs to deal with his pain?

166
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:22,255
Maybe the way to look at this
is that you are normal.

167
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,916
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- You're like any other parent.

168
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:30,272
Who thinks his kid can't be doing drugs.

169
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,605
We're doing this 'cause
my dad thinks I'm on drugs?

170
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,341
I was doing drugs
behind my parents' back

171
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,426
at your age, and I had
a lot less reason to be...

172
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:44,933
Not that your life must be miserable.

173
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,890
Not that I'm suggesting
that you should be doing drugs.

174
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,583
- How's school going?
- I'm homeschooled.

175
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:52,506
Really?

176
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,285
You're lucky.

177
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,845
- Going to school was boring.
- My dad took me out,

178
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:58,415
and it wasn't 'cause it was boring.

179
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,183
Well, I had a rough time in school too.

180
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:02,477
Maybe not like you, but...
You know...

181
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:05,073
I don't mean to compare our situations.

182
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:08,379
Actually, I guess I am
comparing our situations,

183
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:10,413
but only to show you how yours is worse.

184
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:14,345
- You can edit that out, right?
- So I don't look like an idiot.

185
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:16,979
Relax.
Everyone acts like an idiot around me.

186
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,241
What makes you think it's not an act?

187
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,716
- Can I have something for my headache?
- Yeah. Is that new?

188
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:24,001
16 years old.

189
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,992
Has the same birthday I do.

190
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,234
I'm gonna start the test now.

191
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:32,336
Study showed no signs
of scarring in Kenny's heart.

192
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,715
- It wasn't drugs.
- Well, then give me something better?

193
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,476
- What's causing heart block?
- Could be toxoplasmosis.

194
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:39,203
We should do an lP
to test for infection.

195
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:41,722
If it was toxoplasmosis,
we would have seen enlarged lymphs.

196
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:44,536
And because you're not an idiot,
you already know that.

197
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:47,922
Meaning you said it because you wanna do
an LP looking for intracranial pressure.

198
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:50,448
- Because it is intracranial pressure.
- I'm not done.

199
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,521
You thought I wouldn't notice, which
means either you think I'm an idiot...

200
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,693
Do I look like one?
I'm doing my hair differently...

201
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:58,153
The kid's got headaches. He's been
popping acetaminophen.

202
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,024
How could you possibly
think that I was done?

203
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,658
I prefaced that with an either.
It needs an "or". Or...

204
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:07,060
You are an idiot... Which is possible.
I'm not great at judging men's looks.

205
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:10,508
- The OR?
- And the MRI room.

206
00:11:12,294 --> 00:11:13,161
Yes.

207
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,747
Dr. House frequently conducts

208
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:18,982
differential diagnoses
in a variety of places.

209
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,948
He feels that a... Change in venue,

210
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,328
often leads to a change
in thinking processes.

211
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,298
I have to go take care
of something else.

212
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,206
Just let me do a CT scan,
see if I'm right.

213
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:36,340
The sooner we fix the problem,
the sooner we can get

214
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,052
- to his reconstructive surgery.
- Yeah, who cares if you're dead?

215
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:40,157
It's how you look.

216
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:42,758
Well, since you've given me
nothing better, we're back to drugs.

217
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,746
The one thing we know it's not.

218
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,107
Decreased uptake
on the membranous septum.

219
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,948
Could be an artifact.
We can redo it, but...

220
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:51,408
Nothing's nothing. Do an EP study.

221
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,932
EP study means we have
to stop this kid's heart.

222
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:58,024
I'll set it up.

223
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:00,002
<i>House.</i>

224
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,899
You have a minute to be disemboweled?

225
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:09,287
I'm gonna thread this catheter
through different areas in your heart,

226
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:11,594
and once I've found the right pathway,

227
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:13,705
I'll apply some electrical energy.

228
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,056
It'll stop my heart?

229
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,387
It sounds worse than it is.
You'll be fine.

230
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:20,676
- Is it gonna hurt?
- There'll be some discomfort.

231
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,724
If you've done drugs...

232
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:26,473
I understand.

233
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:28,553
Being different's really hard.

234
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:34,962
Kenny...

235
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:36,476
It's...

236
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,160
More important for you to get better
than to worry about getting in trouble.

237
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,643
If I did drugs, that could explain
my heart problem?

238
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,653
It could.

239
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,088
Then you can do the surgery
to fix my face?

240
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:48,501
That's why we're here.

241
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,264
You know how famous people...

242
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,656
Everywhere they go,
people are watching them...

243
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Staring?

244
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:01,708
They never have a chance to just be.

245
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:06,071
You know, and a lot of them
turn to drugs.

246
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:09,397
People stare at them because
they're beautiful, but...

247
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:11,065
Me, they just stare.

248
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:12,910
You okay?

249
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:17,397
I need to know
what kind of drugs, Kenny, and how much.

250
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:19,223
Coke,

251
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:20,691
mostly.
A lot of coke.

252
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:24,327
And then, when I run out,
I usually go to LSD...

253
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:25,723
Or acid.

254
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:28,947
Those are the same thing.

255
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,428
They are?

256
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,055
You don't do drugs, do you?

257
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:36,157
- I drink from my dad's liquor...
- We're not gonna do this test.

258
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,529
I need you to turn on your side.

259
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:42,230
We need to intubate.
I need some help in here!

260
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,580
Too bad you guys are going
for a theatrical release.

261
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,045
Vomiting blood would have made
a great act out.

262
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,413
- Likely causes.
- Mallory-Weiss tear.

263
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:56,871
No pallor, no melena.

264
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,651
Why are you wearing a tie?

265
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,408
I always wear ties.

266
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,041
- I'm a doctor.
- Please don't look at the camera.

267
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:04,222
Sorry.

268
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:06,394
Nasal papilloma.

269
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:08,330
Hemorrhage could have
overwhelmed the heart.

270
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:09,504
Nice lipstick.

271
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:11,192
- Thank you.
- Bad idea.

272
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,227
- Hemorrhage came after the block.
- House, let them do their job.

273
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:18,551
Anybody here,
more interested in the medicine,

274
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,377
a little less interested
in the paparazzi?

275
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,582
Upper GI Bleed.

276
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,484
Could be something he ate or drank.
Maybe a peptic ulcer.

277
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:26,773
Good.

278
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:29,211
Except no abdominal pain.

279
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,638
Patient hasn't lost his appetite,

280
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,802
and the last I checked,
the gastrointestinal tract

281
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,290
isn't connected to the heart.

282
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:36,069
Yeah.

283
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:39,166
- But other than that, real good.
- Nasopharyngeal angiofibrosis.

284
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,675
I just said it wasn't a nasal tumor.

285
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,800
Stomach cancer.
Tumor causes bleeding.

286
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:46,232
Body's reaction to the tumor
causes paraneoplastic syndrome

287
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:47,481
which leads to heart block.

288
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:50,262
Finally!
Someone who is not just a pretty face.

289
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,980
You and Taub run the scope,
find the tumor.

290
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:54,559
Could be dangerous.

291
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,640
If the bleeding was caused

292
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:57,823
by liver failure as the result
of the intracranial...

293
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:01,030
Liver is the one organ you can't ascribe
to intracranial pressure.

294
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:05,825
True.

295
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:13,130
Intracranial pressure
cancause liver problems.

296
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,386
It causes an increase
in the cavernous sinus pressure

297
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,326
which causes pressure
in the superior vena cava

298
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:18,771
which shuts down the liver.

299
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,177
- You just think of that?
- No.

300
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:23,785
- Why didn't you say any...
- Think it's change his mind?

301
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:24,904
Not a chance.

302
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:27,318
House would have undercut me,
ordered me to do a procedure

303
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:29,914
I just argued against,
and then I'd look like a hypocrite

304
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:32,813
in front of the thousands of people
and potential future employers

305
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:33,836
watching this film.

306
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:36,048
If you're right,
and we stick a scope back down

307
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:37,490
a kid with liver failure,

308
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,429
he could bleed again.

309
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:41,114
I know.

310
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,305
He just vomited blood.

311
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,548
Isn't that dangerous?

312
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,411
No. You're in good hands.

313
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:56,393
Okay.

314
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,109
All right.

315
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:05,503
Well, it's great how he
rebounded from that setback.

316
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,890
What setback?

317
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:10,144
He didn't tell you about the...

318
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,807
Well, it's his right.

319
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:13,644
Records were sealed.

320
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:15,570
Personally, I think he was just

321
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:17,647
tapping his foot and reaching for
the toilet paper.

322
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:19,587
Obviously, it was a witch hunt.

323
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:22,831
Do you think
they singled him out because...

324
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:24,523
No, literally a witch hunt.

325
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,223
Dr. House is a practicing wiccan.

326
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,430
It's a beautiful religion.
It's very caring.

327
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,856
You have an all-access pass to the case,
not my fave five, so go.

328
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,582
Come on, come on, let's go.

329
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,139
I think I'm going blind.

330
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:45,611
Hairy Palms too?

331
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,636
She said something idiotic again,
and I didn't even notice it.

332
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,271
Foreman had to point out
that it was idiotic.

333
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:53,798
She's making mean idiot.

334
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:55,184
That's cute. You have a crush.

335
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:58,178
- No, I think it's something systemic.
- Thirteen's pretty.

336
00:16:58,409 --> 00:16:59,791
You're obviously okay with her.

337
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:01,228
She killed a patient.

338
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,494
- The bitch is pretty.
- The bitch is a bitch.

339
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:05,324
- Ask her out.
- The bitch?

340
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:07,881
- She's a bitch.
- No the one that's making you an idiot.

341
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:10,142
The story of life.
Boy meets girl. Boy gets stupid.

342
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:12,133
Boy and girl live stupidly ever after.

343
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:15,482
- Pretty girl kill again?
- Nope.

344
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:17,838
Elephant boy just
vomiting up blood again.

345
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,359
No tumors
in the patient's stomach, so...

346
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:28,576
But the scope caused variceal bleeding.
Took 20 minutes of banding to stop it.

347
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,623
Taub was right about the liver failure.

348
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:31,620
Yeah.

349
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:34,179
His craniofacial deformity
is causing intracranial pressure...

350
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:35,040
No.

351
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:37,885
Where are the nose bleeds?
Where's the labored breathing?

352
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:41,056
You're right about me being wrong.
You're wrong about you being right.

353
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,475
I need new ideas.

354
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,649
Anybody.

355
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,914
Does it bother you
that this kid's gonna die

356
00:17:57,949 --> 00:18:00,375
'cause you won't put down that camera?
At all, you know?

357
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:02,712
Your people should be extra motivated.
I'm sure they all

358
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,961
wanna look good in the film.
No, 'cause now they're

359
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:06,195
too worried about looking bad.

360
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,669
Dr. House,
heart block plus liver failure

361
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,161
could mean autoimmune.

362
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,766
Maybe scleroderma.

363
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:14,649
Foreman,

364
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,347
- does that make sense?
- Not without tight skin on the hands,

365
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,845
muscle weakness,
and a 30-year-old patient.

366
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,024
Liver failure plus heart block could be
a mitochondrial disorder.

367
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,348
Say what she just said.

368
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,857
Liver failure plus heart block
could be a mitochondrial disorder?

369
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,570
Go look for signs
of retinal degeneration.

370
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:39,013
No, it's ICP.
You're only gonna see swelling.

371
00:18:39,062 --> 00:18:41,754
Take him with you, so he can see
the degeneration too.

372
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,345
So before you worked here in the ER,
you worked for House, right?

373
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,460
- Three and a half years.
- Why did you leave?

374
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:52,507
Hey, I don't wanna be on TV.
I'm not signing a release.

375
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,166
- We'll blur you out.
- Take off your pants.

376
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:58,550
You gonna be able to use any of this
if I start swearing?

377
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:01,793
Did House treat you as badly
as he treats his current fellows?

378
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:03,435
Loaded question.

379
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:06,906
That's not even a word.

380
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,414
Fork!

381
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,157
Very clever.

382
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,881
I learned how to be a doctor from House.

383
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,465
Or at least a doctor who learned
how to be a doctor from House,

384
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,155
- if that makes any sense.
- Any you left his team because

385
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,460
- you couldn't stand him anymore?
- No, no.

386
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:22,283
I... I love Dr. House.

387
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:24,571
That's something we haven't heard.

388
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,772
I mean...

389
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,564
What did you ask me again?

390
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:30,021
Why you left.

391
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:31,508
I...

392
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:32,794
I loved

393
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:34,243
behing around

394
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:35,212
him...

395
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,230
Professionally, you know.
It was always...

396
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:39,699
Stimulating.

397
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:40,529
Not...

398
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,265
In an erotic sense of the word.

399
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:44,111
Fork.

400
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,655
They forked.
And then they spooned.

401
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,033
Lean forward and place
your chin on the rest.

402
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:56,517
I can't reach it.

403
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,042
Scooch in a little.

404
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,519
I'll take care of it.

405
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:03,176
Just like last time?

406
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:07,428
Maybe we should try this
the old-fashioned way?

407
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:11,513
Okay, look up to the ceiling

408
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,328
and try not to blink, okay?

409
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,860
Okay, good.
Now straight ahead.

410
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,337
There it is.

411
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,530
Swelling.
No degeneration.

412
00:20:30,348 --> 00:20:31,536
It's not mitochondrial.

413
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:33,836
Swelling proves there's
increased pressure in his brain.

414
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:34,837
Absolutely.

415
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:36,692
So now we can schedule
the reconstruction.

416
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:37,940
Absolutely not.

417
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,858
Your test proved you wrong.

418
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,639
We found exactly
what I predicted we'd find.

419
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:43,672
Swelling means there's
increased pressure.

420
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,292
You get a gold star of David

421
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:47,212
for proving that, yes,
this kid has a big head,

422
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:48,726
and big heads cause pressure.

423
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:51,483
- But it doesn't explain the liver.
- Too much acetaminophen does.

424
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:54,353
JRA explains all of it,
including the liver.

425
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:56,785
One theory's better than two.
Treat with steroids.

426
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,492
If you're wrong, steroids are gonna mess
with his immune system,

427
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,144
put off his surgery for months.

428
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:05,426
You really wanna lose this argument
in front of the camera?

429
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:10,920
I'll speak to the father.

430
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:16,046
Dr. House believes that Kenny has JRA,

431
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:17,802
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

432
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,852
We need to start administering steroids.

433
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:22,165
Will the steroids fix it?

434
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:29,400
I don't think he has JRA.

435
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,872
I think Dr. House is wrong

436
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,623
and that the steroid treatment
could be dangerous.

437
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,500
I think I can get House
thrown off the case,

438
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:41,388
and get Kenny
the facial surgery he needs.

439
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:49,260
The father refused steroids
until we're sure about the diagnosis.

440
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,411
I am sure.

441
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:51,871
It's JRA.

442
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,878
And why would he even doubt that,

443
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:57,249
unless a former fellow of mine
was chirping in his ear.

444
00:21:57,264 --> 00:21:59,416
The decision was his.
I merely voiced my concern.

445
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:01,761
- Why'd you take this job?
- He's got a bulging cyst.

446
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:03,776
You had a perfectly good plastic
surgery practice

447
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,845
- lots of money.
- Fluids aren't draining properly.

448
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,392
Temptation to come screw with me
just too much for you?

449
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:11,092
- There's gotta be a better reason.
- He needs surgery to drain it.

450
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:13,846
And I think I mentioned this earlier.
You're fired.

451
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:20,322
What you did was over the line.

452
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Get out.

453
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,300
But don't go anywhere.
You're not fired.

454
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,728
Yet.

455
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,273
No one is firing anyone
in the middle of this case.

456
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:35,738
Not while those cameras are here,

457
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,542
and not while taub is the only
person that this father trusts.

458
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,276
Where you going?

459
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,292
To do what I always do in these
situations.

460
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:44,836
Treat my patient behind his back.

461
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,294
That's one option.

462
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:48,892
Or you can do a CT scan
of the kid's head.

463
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,383
If there's no midline shift,
we know taub was wrong,

464
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:53,960
and you get your consent
to give the kid steroids.

465
00:22:55,677 --> 00:22:56,681
Just a warning.

466
00:22:57,027 --> 00:22:59,717
We have to start getting consent
every time we do a procedure,

467
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:02,269
soon they'll be asking
for informed consent.

468
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,095
Didn't think you had the guts
to stage a coup.

469
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:12,166
Coup failed.

470
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,092
I'm scheduled for execution at dawn.

471
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:15,116
No, you're not.

472
00:23:15,135 --> 00:23:16,714
No reprieve from the governor.

473
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:19,362
You're a test result away from
becoming House's frontrunner.

474
00:23:19,394 --> 00:23:20,914
He doesn't care about what you said

475
00:23:20,937 --> 00:23:23,952
or what you did five minutes ago.
He just wants the next good idea.

476
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:26,615
Show me 20% magnification
of the forebrain.

477
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:28,948
I look at our patient...

478
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:31,342
Soon as I saw his face,

479
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:33,052
I saw a regular kid.

480
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:35,657
One thing about being a plastic surgeon.

481
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:37,410
You don't see what is,

482
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,640
you see what could be.

483
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,338
You talk like that around House,

484
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,542
doesn't matter how many
good ideas you come up with.

485
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,652
So...

486
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:49,603
Tell me what you don't
like about yourself.

487
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,108
Gosh,

488
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,686
There's so many things.

489
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,450
Is Dr. Taub available?

490
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,292
Because he was very highly recommended.

491
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:00,216
Well, he's no longer practicing with us,

492
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,040
but I've taken over all his files
so if you tell me what needs work.

493
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,263
Do you know why he left?

494
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,892
He had personal issues to deal
with, so if we could just.

495
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:08,706
My goodness.
Is he okay?

496
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:10,036
Yeah, he's fine.

497
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,200
Cause my Friend
had his ears done by Dr. Taub.

498
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,700
Should he worry that they may...
Pop back?

499
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,434
No, it wasn't a professional issue.

500
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,404
I'm sorry I really can't
go into more detail.

501
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,276
Shall we discuss your needs?

502
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,708
You know that toe next to the big toe?

503
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:27,302
Mine's bigger than my big toe.

504
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,762
Is there any way to shorten it?

505
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,639
Or make my big toe bigger,
like a toe-augmentation?

506
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,742
Did he lie, cheat, or steal?

507
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,752
You're not here for a consultation,
are you?

508
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,617
What gave me away?

509
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:42,345
Was it my obviously perfect feet?

510
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,809
Hi.

511
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:54,182
- CT shows.
- Let's go.

512
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:00,392
What are you two doing here?

513
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,655
Skipping three scenes.
CT's back.

514
00:25:02,688 --> 00:25:04,732
He's gonna say that there's
evidence of an anomaly.

515
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:06,513
I'm gonna say he's wrong.
He's gonna go back

516
00:25:06,528 --> 00:25:08,264
to the father,
and we'll all end up here.

517
00:25:08,742 --> 00:25:11,038
Defect is pushing on the right
frontal lobe.

518
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,695
This bend is a sign of herniation.

519
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:15,190
Or it's a sign of increased pressure
from JRA.

520
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:20,770
Dr. Taub would rather distract
you from the truth with sparkly

521
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,096
things like 4-carat diamonds.

522
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:24,524
House.

523
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,939
Your partner said that you left
for personal reasons.

524
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:28,573
But your wife said you lost a patient.

525
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:30,392
Son of a bitch.
You spoke to my wife?

526
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:31,593
See, that confused me.

527
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:33,077
Why would you give her a diamond

528
00:25:33,092 --> 00:25:34,603
if you screwed somebody else over?

529
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:36,985
If you screwed her over,
I mean, I could.

530
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:39,000
Get that camera out of here.

531
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:44,786
You say anything to her?

532
00:25:45,637 --> 00:25:46,755
Just asked questions.

533
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,094
Get them out of here too.

534
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:49,256
We're doctors.

535
00:25:52,724 --> 00:25:54,518
I screwed around with a nurse.

536
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:56,348
It became a deal.

537
00:25:57,804 --> 00:26:00,312
My partners found out, and I resigned.

538
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,233
There. Happy?

539
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:05,405
If you could be a bit more descriptive,
I'd be happier.

540
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,037
Some people pop pain pills.

541
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,021
I cheat.

542
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,971
We all have our vices.

543
00:26:17,883 --> 00:26:18,693
Taub.

544
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,802
I don't see it.

545
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:22,295
Stay away from the family.

546
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:23,429
House,

547
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:25,828
start steroids,
and stay away from his family.

548
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:39,366
You are ugly.

549
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,135
You're an ass.

550
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:43,848
I have a deformity.

551
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,528
I know.
That's why you're ugly.

552
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,081
But you're a lucky boy.

553
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:48,692
Anywhere else in the animal kingdom,

554
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,540
your parents
would have eaten you at birth.

555
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:52,517
Your son needs steroids.

556
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,548
Dr. Cuddy agrees.

557
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,852
Does Dr. Taub?

558
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,792
He's... Not a real doctor.

559
00:26:58,824 --> 00:27:00,001
He's a plastic surgeon.

560
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:03,073
All he cares is that your son looks
good in his coffin.

561
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,609
So I'm supposed to believe you.

562
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:06,904
The doctor who cares.

563
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:08,311
You shouldn't care if I care.

564
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:09,863
I don't trust you.

565
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:13,388
Because
I don't think the surgery's important?

566
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:18,106
You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.

567
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:20,104
You're willing to take chances,
to risk his life

568
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,353
- for something he doesn't need.
- I do need it.

569
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,510
I can't have real relationships.

570
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,183
I can't even have a real conversation.

571
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:32,923
Not even with my dad.

572
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:38,564
Dad...

573
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,759
I know you love me.

574
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,272
But you don't treat me normal.

575
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:47,159
You're always protective.

576
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:50,000
The world can always go to hell.

577
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,472
But you never yell at me...

578
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,100
Even when I screw up.

579
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:00,797
I wanna be normal.

580
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,200
Take your steroids.

581
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:07,725
You get to live.

582
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:10,018
Then you can do your surgery.

583
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,700
And it'll only change your face.

584
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,481
It won't change who your face made you.

585
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,692
We're gonna get caught.

586
00:28:25,758 --> 00:28:26,820
Not on film.

587
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:29,088
All their camera equipment's in here.

588
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:31,800
Where did you get those keys?

589
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:33,200
Blue, the janitor.

590
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,129
What?

591
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:38,281
That's his name.

592
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,500
His name's Lou.

593
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,109
Owe him an apology.

594
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:49,734
Just watch 20 minutes of the stuff.
tell me if I'm out of my mind.

595
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:52,143
Finally, we have video evidence.

596
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,319
<i>Dr. House,</i>

597
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:56,007
<i>heart block plus liver failure</i>

598
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,099
<i>could mean autoimmune,
maybe scleroderma.</i>

599
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:00,566
<i>Foreman, does that make sense?</i>

600
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,409
<i>Not without tight skin on the hands,</i>

601
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,992
<i>muscle weakness,
and a 30-year-old patient.</i>

602
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,943
Can I see that again?

603
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,156
What did you miss?
She screwed up. I didn't.

604
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:11,921
No, just the part where
she leans forward.

605
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:13,731
I think you can see through her dress.

606
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:19,600
<i>Upper gi bleed.</i>

607
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,529
<i>Could be from something he ate or drank.</i>

608
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,355
<i>- Maybe a peptic uicer.
- Good.</i>

609
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,427
- You... Thought that was a good idea?
- What am I gonna do?

610
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:29,979
Just enjoy.

611
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:33,729
I'm gonna keep her around because
she makes me an idiot?

612
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:36,187
Well, you're protected.
Foreman seems immune.

613
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:37,657
You think he's gay?

614
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,576
Did he become an idiot around Chase?

615
00:29:39,608 --> 00:29:40,992
<i>Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.</i>

616
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:42,581
<i>I just said it's not a nasal tumor.</i>

617
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:45,100
Wait a minute.
Rewind that. Was that thirteen?

618
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:53,218
- I can't believe I'm that guy.
- Every guy is that guy.

619
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,021
- I'm not every guy.
- What, is this semantics here?

620
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:58,176
Okay.
All guys are that guy.

621
00:29:58,273 --> 00:29:59,746
I'm not all guys.

622
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,665
Cameron was smart.

623
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,766
You know, I'm...
Beginning to doubt that.

624
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,620
I wanted to clarify something
I said earlier.

625
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,300
"I love Dr. House."

626
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,192
and then I qualified it,

627
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,446
which, after thinking about it,

628
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,339
I... Didn't really need to do.

629
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:26,300
I did love being around him.

630
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,004
I guess

631
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:30,288
I just wanted to qualify

632
00:30:30,984 --> 00:30:31,988
what I

633
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:34,369
qualified before.

634
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:39,424
- I'm looking defensive, aren't I?
- No, no. I think that's great.

635
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:40,921
Clears everything up.

636
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,818
It's no big deal, really.

637
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,287
There's a mass lesion

638
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:56,300
in the left anterior temporal
lobe surrounded by edema.

639
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,361
Did you just insult me in pig latin?

640
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,469
Dr. House, please.

641
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,000
Would you just take a look at this?

642
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:08,614
The defect is causing
this nodular shadow here.

643
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:09,706
You see it?

644
00:31:11,374 --> 00:31:12,378
You're right.

645
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,454
I didn't see that before.

646
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:17,291
Come on, let's go.

647
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,681
I know you think you're feeling better

648
00:31:23,896 --> 00:31:25,256
on account of feeling better.

649
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,872
But this trusted family doctor thinks

650
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,758
that he's found a mass lesion.

651
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:31,983
So if you could lie back down

652
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,745
- and struggle to breathe.
- Okay.

653
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:36,310
You were right.

654
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm thrilled I'm wrong.

655
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,775
This is great, Kenny.

656
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:43,506
You're gonna get your surgery now.

657
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,091
First person I'm coming back to see
is you.

658
00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:49,442
Cause compared to me,

659
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:50,857
You're gonna look like butt.

660
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:53,400
What, no comeback?

661
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:57,009
Look at that.

662
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:58,276
What?

663
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,076
His little finger.
It's twitching.

664
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,230
No, it's not.
Just give it a second.

665
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:08,214
There.

666
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,153
And?

667
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:11,056
He's not better.

668
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,319
What's wrong?

669
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,259
My diagnosis.

670
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,173
I don't know what he has.

671
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:21,914
Cancel the surgery.

672
00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:30,534
New symptom.

673
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,892
Involuntary muscle movement.

674
00:32:32,962 --> 00:32:34,485
A twitching finger is a symptom?

675
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,235
The body doing something
it's not supposed

676
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,793
is the definition of a symptom.

677
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:39,692
Kid's about to have
a life changing operation.

678
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:41,437
- He's nervous.
- Or he's not.

679
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:42,700
Or you were right.

680
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:44,873
The kid got better
when we put him on steroids.

681
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,000
This is JRA, and it's under control now.

682
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,500
Or the steroids have just tempered
his condition.

683
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:52,983
- He had a haircut, still got bad hair.
- What about lyme disease?

684
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,041
It explains everything.
The heart issues, internal bleeding,

685
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:57,625
even why it'd get better on steroids.

686
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:00,003
On the other hand,
if he has lyme disease,

687
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:01,789
there would be other subtle clues,

688
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:04,792
like a huge, target-shaped rash.
But thanks for playing.

689
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:07,269
Why can't you just accept the fact
that you cured this kid?

690
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:08,824
You want to stop his surgery.

691
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,400
You're not normal,

692
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,397
so you don't want anybody else
to be normal.

693
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:15,303
You don't think normal's healthy.

694
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,955
Could be rheumatic fever.
Also explains why the steroids helped.

695
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:27,592
It's a similar inflammatory disease.

696
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:29,592
Rheumatic fever doesn't explain
liver failure.

697
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:33,114
- Taub thinks that acetaminophen does.
- Fine. Let's test your theory.

698
00:33:33,188 --> 00:33:34,592
Remove his pacing wire.

699
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,056
If he's better,
his heart'll beat just fine on its own,

700
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,024
and then he can have his operation.

701
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:42,852
If I'm right, his heart will stop.

702
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,451
Kutner, have the paddles on standby.

703
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,328
Another chance to blow someone up.

704
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:53,261
There'll be some minor discomfort,

705
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,556
and you'll feel a slow,
steady pulling sensation.

706
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,483
Are you sure his heart
is ready for this?

707
00:33:58,727 --> 00:33:59,731
Absolutely.

708
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:01,669
He's convinced he's sure.

709
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,657
Whereas...

710
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,400
I care about your son

711
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,740
and have, therefore,
brought a professional defibrillist.

712
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,215
We're not gonna need those.

713
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:18,121
Dad, I feel fine.

714
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:19,888
My finger hasn't moved in a while.

715
00:34:25,171 --> 00:34:25,981
Okay.

716
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:27,743
Take him off.

717
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,629
Here we go.

718
00:34:52,017 --> 00:34:53,507
Heart rate's 85 beats per minute.

719
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,387
BP 110 over 70.

720
00:34:55,628 --> 00:34:56,762
Is he okay?

721
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:58,579
I feel the same.

722
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:01,829
He's fine.

723
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
You're fine.

724
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,210
Thank God!

725
00:35:07,046 --> 00:35:10,389
What do you mean, thank God?
God's the guy who gave it to him.

726
00:35:17,774 --> 00:35:18,778
Thank you.

727
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:21,132
Thank you.

728
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,021
Can you tell us about the procedure?

729
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,506
We have to use both an extra
and intracranial approach

730
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,782
to get enough exposure
to reduce the encephalocele CYST

731
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,270
and do the bony reconstruction.

732
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:25,187
And how are you participating
in the procedure?

733
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:26,263
She's not.

734
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:30,364
They don't want me here,
because they think the kid's cured.

735
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:32,901
- I don't.
- And what do you think the problem is?

736
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,300
Wish I knew.

737
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:37,561
I just know that if Dr. House is right,
something's gonna go wrong.

738
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,700
Dr. House doesn't think he's right.

739
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:43,094
Well, then, I'll just waste a few hours
watching a surgery.

740
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,322
The danger is we have to reconstruct
all the way down to the cranial base.

741
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:50,600
And there are some big vessels
down there.

742
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:52,963
So what we'll do is we'll work
our way down to here.

743
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:54,409
When were these pictures taken?

744
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:56,494
About...

745
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,383
Three weeks ago. Why?
What do you see?

746
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,007
The acanthosis nigricans
was already there.

747
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:03,396
It's been there a lot longer than that.

748
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:04,738
Probably his whole life.

749
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,305
What about around his hairline?

750
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,202
What?
There's no discoloration.

751
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
There is now.

752
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:21,159
I have a new theory.

753
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:25,800
Their bad ideas
don't indicate a lack of intelligence.

754
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:27,589
It indicates an open mind,

755
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:30,143
the willingness not to be trapped
by conventional.

756
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,364
- You've got a problem.
- Tell me something I don't know.

757
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,649
You hire beautiful girls enslave them,
force them to be around you,

758
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:39,904
because you don't know how
have an actual relationship.

759
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,444
If they're qualified, keep them.

760
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:43,610
If not, fire them and ask them out.

761
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:45,856
You do realize that
"tell me something I don't know"

762
00:37:45,988 --> 00:37:47,181
is just an expression.

763
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:48,368
13.

764
00:37:48,398 --> 00:37:50,614
You think that just
because she's as beautiful, Ergo...

765
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,336
That because she hasn't had
a decent idea.

766
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:55,391
No, my point is she's about to enter
your office, so you should shut up.

767
00:37:58,393 --> 00:37:59,947
You were right about the diagnosis.

768
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:01,414
Yes.

769
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,952
It was JRA.
I'm very proud.

770
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:04,582
I mean you were right about being wrong.

771
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:06,550
He's got lyme disease.
It explains everything.

772
00:38:08,148 --> 00:38:12,075
Could you just hold up some fingers.
So I can see if I'm literally blind?

773
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:15,752
- We ruled out lyme disease hours ago.
- All the symptoms fit.

774
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,226
I am so ashamed.
Is she really that good-looking?

775
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:19,264
Apparently.

776
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:21,440
How many lives have been lost
because of pretty girls?

777
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:22,852
The target rash is hiding.

778
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:25,233
No one ever looked
at him closely enough.

779
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:08,262
She's getting uglier by the second.

780
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,452
We can try and pretend we're above it.
We can try and intellectualize it away,

781
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:17,387
but ultimately, shiny,
pretty, perky thingsare good,

782
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:22,477
and's ugly,
misshapen teenage boys are repulsive.

783
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,179
The question was

784
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:29,460
do you resent Dr. Cuddy's
interference in your practice?

785
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:35,315
Well, then I guess my answer
wasn't very helpful, was it?

786
00:39:44,564 --> 00:39:45,868
Mini-stud,

787
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:47,442
stand up.

788
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,192
I spoke to your other partner.

789
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,118
- After Cuddy told you.
- No, I stayed away.

790
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,629
Did it all over the phone.
I asked for a reference,

791
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:01,655
said you were applying
for a plastic surgery job.

792
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:03,811
- God!
- Yeah.

793
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:08,176
He went nuts.
Apparently, you signed a non-compete.

794
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:10,276
Now, why would you agree to that?

795
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,942
I don't wanna practice plastic surgery.

796
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,461
You sign a contract
because someone's making you.

797
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,061
Someone's getting something from you.
What did they give you in return?

798
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,762
- They agreed to keep their mouths shut.
- So you gave up your chosen career

799
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:26,149
just so they'd be quiet?

800
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,962
I love my wife.

801
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,637
And you risked this job
with nothing to fall back on?

802
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:43,726
I thought you were wrong.

803
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,494
Sit back down.

804
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:54,685
You're keeping him
because he's a philanderer?

805
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:57,022
- Where do I sign up?
- Ask the Mormon.

806
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
I'm keeping him because
he's interesting.

807
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:02,830
Dr. Terzi, would you please stand up?

808
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:11,797
Nice.

809
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,790
I have treated you unfairly.

810
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:17,394
Prejudged you.

811
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:22,869
And for me to be a better person,
I have to rectify that situation.

812
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,612
You're fired.

813
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,800
You wanna...
Grab some dinner?

814
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:34,712
Maybe a movie?

815
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:37,794
Seriously.

816
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:54,136
<i>Just days ago,
with Kenny's condition worsening,</i>

817
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,351
<i>it was Dr. Gregory House
reassuring Kenny and his father.</i>

818
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,990
<i>I care about your son.</i>

819
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:03,298
<i>The charming House,
who happens to be a film buff</i>

820
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:06,504
<i>with a soft spot in his heart for
children, told us how he got his start.</i>

821
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,200
<i>See, I became a doctor
because of the movie patch Adams.</i>

822
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:12,192
<i>Determined to save the boy's life
as well as...</i>

823
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,330
Horror...

824
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:17,000
Well, it's nice of them to send
us an early copy.

825
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,427
- Not so much sent as stolen.
- <i>In the end, it was Dr. Gregory House</i>

826
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:26,094
<i>who served as not only a doctor,
but a rock for Kenny and his father.</i>

827
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:29,350
<i>You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.</i>

828
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:32,044
<i>- House, one of those rare doctors.
- God.</i>

829
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:33,971
<i>Wears his heart on his sleeve...</i>

830
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,520
I was saying that was a stupid
thing to do.

831
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:40,435
- It's difficult not to be moved.
- Stop it!

832
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:43,400
Suddenly I don't feel like I can trust
Michael Moore movies.

833
00:42:44,886 --> 00:42:47,338
Where are you going?
Kittens to get out of trees?

834
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:48,836
Deaf kids to read to?

835
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:50,574
I owe it to the world

836
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:53,100
to make sure this evil
never sees the light of day.

837
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,812
<i>Is there anything else?</i>

838
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:05,727
<i>Thank you, Dr. House.</i>

839
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,543
<i>Thank you.</i>
