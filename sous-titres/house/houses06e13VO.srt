1
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,244
- Slow down, sister.
- I need to speed up.

2
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,887
Rachel woke up early with a fever

3
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:06,292
and she's been terrorizing me
all morning.

4
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,918
I'm already late.

5
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,243
Sorry, stakeout went longer
than I thought.

6
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,715
- Have you ever been to a rave?
- Good-bye.

7
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,944
You're already late
and Rachel's sick.

8
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,843
Neither of which can be solved
by you leaving right this second.

9
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,618
The entire hospital is depending
on a proposal I've yet to finish

10
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:22,151
and need to present at 8:30.

11
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,261
It's 7:30.

12
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:24,408
It's 7:37.

13
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,219
I'll have you on the road in 10 min.

14
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:28,439
You don't want to go
into your meeting all tight

15
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:31,088
and stressed out, do you?

16
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:44,602
That's yours.

17
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:46,707
- It's House.
- Ignore it.

18
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,538
It says "emergency page".

19
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:49,976
I said ignore it.

20
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,201
Sweet.

21
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,569
I'm sorry.
It's hard to pace yourself

22
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:06,386
when you've been thinking about it
for ten hours straight.

23
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:07,661
That's great.

24
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,879
Now I'm late, stressed out,

25
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,507
and frustrated.

26
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,748
Sorry.
If you give me a minute, I can...

27
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:15,736
It'll wait.

28
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:23,752
You can do it.

29
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:25,482
Do what?

30
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,127
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

31
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:36,131

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,269
mpm

36
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,028
- I thought you were coming in at 7:30.
- Rachel woke up with a fever

37
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:14,295
and then I... just couldn't
get here any sooner.

38
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:17,590
- There's a problem in the pharmacy.
- Hey, boss lady!

39
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,246
You don't answer
emergency pages anymore?

40
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:23,029
Tell them all I'll be
by as soon as I can and tell him

41
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:25,482
I assumed it was either
about the wolf again

42
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:28,557
or the procedure I refused
to approve yesterday.

43
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,623
Turned out
it wasn't a resistant staph,

44
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,744
but I still say that if it had been,
infecting him with malaria...

45
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,418
- Seriously, I don't have time for this.
- You're lying.

46
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,278
- I have a meeting in 20 minutes.
- Not talking about your meeting.

47
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:43,479
- I'm talking about the phone call.
- I don't care.

48
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:49,503
I was with your boy toy
on a stakeout last night.

49
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:51,667
You were with Lucas?

50
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,693
He needed someone who could diagnose
a soft injury from across the street.

51
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:58,112
Apparently he doesn't know
any good doctors.

52
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:01,317
Or the ones he does know
actually have lives outside of work.

53
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,193
Things got a little slow,

54
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,317
so we made some wagers.

55
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:08,042
One being
whether I could get you to stop

56
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:10,048
the miscegenation

57
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,936
with an emergency page.

58
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:14,939
- What made you think...
- He said you do it every morning.

59
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,192
- Everybody lies. Remember?
- So you weren't actually...

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,401
Good-bye, House.

61
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:22,154
I'm gonna need a definitive answer
before any money changes hands.

62
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,639
Sorry to interrupt,
but the GRC called about the budgets,

63
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:29,137
The pharmacy is still waiting,
and your 8:30 just arrived on campus.

64
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,913
He should be here in ten minutes.

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,013
Figured this would be the one day
he comes early.

66
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:35,626
Can you proofread this for me?

67
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,951
- When are you gonna find an assistant?
- Not today. Thank you.

68
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:40,256
I'll be back in five.

69
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,140
We're usually fine
with two C.S. reps,

70
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,391
but I want a few extra hands
today just in case.

71
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,265
And have I.T.
recheck the network.

72
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,428
I don't want to hear later
that the new lines

73
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,645
can only dial out
or the computer crashed.

74
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,188
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

75
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:59,566
Just make sure you're ready
if people start calling.

76
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:03,631
You wanted to see me?

77
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:06,857
Yeah, I wanted to let you know
there's a problem with one of the orders

78
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:08,387
that came in last night.

79
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:09,474
Which is?

80
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,870
They sent double
the amount of meds we ordered.

81
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,581
- Did you call and ask why?
- They insist it's not a mistake.

82
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,119
- So fax them the original P.O.
- That's what I was planning on doing,

83
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,461
but I can't find it.
Actually, I can't find any of them.

84
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:25,175
Oscar, I don't have time
to straighten out your paperwork.

85
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,639
- Where's Stan?
- He doesn't get in till 9:00

86
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:29,121
and it's not my paperwork.

87
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:31,137
It's Gail's paperwork,
she's out sick today.

88
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,654
Put it on her desk and let her
figure it out when she comes back.

89
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,830
All right,
but it's not my problem if...

90
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,541
Not today, okay?

91
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:42,588
Was it the whole shipment
or just one med?

92
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:44,486
- It's just one.
- Vicodin?

93
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,447
No, 25 milligram ephedrine tablets.

94
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,705
Call Gail. Tell her I want to see her
in my office ASAP.

95
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:56,158
But she's sick.

96
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,495
This place is full of sick people.
Just get her in here.

97
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,720
Dr. Cuddy, your 8:30
is waiting in your office.

98
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:01,743
Now.

99
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:05,033
I got to make a quick trip upstairs.

100
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,276
Can you get the guy a cup of coffee?
I'll be right back.

101
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:10,370
I've gotten you coffee before.

102
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,788
What's wrong?

103
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:17,574
<i>It's freezing in here.
I can hardly feel my fingers.</i>

104
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,912
Please tell me
you didn't send a 911 page

105
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:22,691
- <i>to tell me the heater's broken.</i>
- It's not broken.

106
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,361
<i>House bribed the physical plant
to turn on the AC</i>

107
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,732
so I'd hurry up.

108
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,823
- <i>So hurry up.</i>
- This man's abdomen is wide open.

109
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,242
- <i>His core temp is down to 95.</i>
- Fine.

110
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,855
<i>I will deal with it.</i>

111
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,030
You better or I'm gonna file...

112
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:39,394
I don't care what he told you.
Turn it back up now.

113
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,764
- Thought you had an important meeting.
- You're an idiot.

114
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,949
What are you gonna do the next time
your patients needs a liver transplant?

115
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:50,360
Go talk to Wilson about something
completely unrelated

116
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:51,984
and see what happens.

117
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:54,437
Mystery infection guy
is now covered in boils

118
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:57,232
and has an abscess big enough
to put your fist in.

119
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,907
He needs to get into
an O.R. <i>tout suite</i>.

120
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:01,796
Hourani will be done soon.

121
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:04,621
Good.
I'll have some hot chocolate waiting.

122
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,952
Marina, hey.

123
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,788
How's she doing?

124
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:11,651
She vomited?

125
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,552
Give her some more ibuprofen
and put her in the bath for a bit.

126
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:18,097
Call me in a half an hour
if it doesn't go down.

127
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:19,664
Sorry, I have another call.

128
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:22,027
Just call me
in a half an hour either way.

129
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:23,966
What's up?

130
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,832
Tell him I'm halfway there.

131
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:30,488
He's the one who insisted
on the early meeting.

132
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,511
All right, I'm coming.

133
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:43,204
Morning, Eli.

134
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:45,232
- Sorry about the wait.
- It's all right.

135
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:47,837
I hear you got a sick kid.

136
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:51,238
Yeah, I know what that's like.
Or I should say my wife does.

137
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:55,645
So you guys ready to give some ground
so we can make this deal?

138
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:59,376
- Why would we do that?
- We've been going at this for 8 months.

139
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:03,121
- Soon as you decide to get reasonable.
- I'm the one that's unreasonable?

140
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:05,811
You've taken weeks to respond
to every proposal I've presented.

141
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,949
Atlanticnet insurance is the largest
healthcare provider in New Jersey,

142
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:11,300
and you're not the only hospital
whose contracts are up.

143
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:14,464
So is your team
ready to come back to the table?

144
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:16,377
We're not going to.

145
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:17,931
Our final offer.

146
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,684
We're willing to go
with a capitated structure,

147
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,937
But we need at least 12% increase
in reimbursements across the board.

148
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:28,542
The good news is
I can give you a quick response.

149
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:30,244
Not a chance.

150
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,883
But as always, nice talking to you.

151
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,380
Say hi to your sister for me.

152
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,447
If you don't accept the offer,
we're gonna terminate the contract.

153
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:49,611
Gonna be hard to keep this place open
If all your patients have to pay cash.

154
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:52,883
Princeton Plainsboro is the smallest
hospital in our entire network.

155
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,884
- We're also the best.
- Doesn't matter.

156
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,999
We are responsible
for covering 13 million people.

157
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:59,147
We don't have enough cash
to buy them all Maseratis.

158
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:01,058
I know what you paid Bergen,

159
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,045
Newark Beth Israel,
Robert Wood Johnson...

160
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,575
'Cause they have leverage.

161
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,620
You can be expensive or small,
but you can't be both.

162
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:09,810
I've engaged Jones/Curtin
to handle the P.R.,

163
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:12,444
and I'm prepared to make
the announcement at 3:00 p.m. today.

164
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:18,445
First lesson every good poker player
learns is don't get emotional.

165
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,516
You don't have the cards.
And the sooner you realize that,

166
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:24,510
the sooner a reasonable contract
will get signed.

167
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:28,585
You have until 3:00 p.m.
to change your mind.

168
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,283
I always did like your style.

169
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,933
Gonna be sad to see you go.

170
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:55,045
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

171
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,170
Thanks.

172
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:02,067
Take this up to the call center

173
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:04,011
and tell Claudia to give one
to each C.S. rep

174
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:07,172
and to start going over
the answers to each question.

175
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,425
Under no circumstances is
any of this info to go outside here.

176
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,350
The scripts are numbered, I want a list
of every person she gives one to.

177
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,840
Got it.
Anything else?

178
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:22,679
If you really wanted to make a deal,
you should have ditched the push-up

179
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:24,338
and gone with a demi.

180
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:26,744
Nothing makes a guy
wanna close like high beams.

181
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,812
- You heard?
- Your meeting with the weasel

182
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,485
lasted less than five minutes,

183
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,089
which means you either agreed
to a completely sensible

184
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,559
30-day extension

185
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:38,660
or one of you issued a completely
ridiculous ultimatum.

186
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,827
Oh, goody.
You or him?

187
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:44,972
Me.

188
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:47,389
- Way to go, boss.
- You just said it was ridiculous.

189
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,749
Ridiculous to make.
Fun to watch.

190
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:52,873
As long as it's not just a bluff.
Please tell me it's not a bluff.

191
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,666
It is not a bluff,
and it is not ridiculous.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,091
Just because we're not some huge...

193
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,876
Mr. Pluta started hallucinating
before we could put him under.

194
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,968
His B.P. is plummeting.
Elevated heart rate.

195
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:06,725
- Looks like congestive heart failure.
- Interesting.

196
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:10,938
I don't care how interesting it is.
You are not infecting him with malaria.

197
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:13,273
Since when is malaria
a cure for heart failure?

198
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,441
It's not.

199
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:17,273
It's not congestive heart failure.

200
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:18,904
It's gotta be...

201
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:25,118
Just got off the phone with Hourani.

202
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,080
Sorry, Dave.
I don't really have time...

203
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,160
Think I had time to listen
to him go for 20 min

204
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,726
- about the temperature in the O.R.?
- I took care of it.

205
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,338
It's not an "it".
It's a "him" you need to take care of.

206
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,921
You got the entire staff catering
to House's every whim,

207
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:40,712
and I can't get approval
to hire a replacement for the surgeon

208
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:42,528
he stole from my department?

209
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:45,527
A doctor I only took on
because of pressure from you.

210
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:49,182
So you didn't want Chase,
but you're pissed you can't have him?

211
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:52,448
You want to convene a search committee
and look for a new chief of surgery?

212
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:56,595
Then you better stop spending
all your time putting out his fires

213
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,674
and start doing your damn job.

214
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:08,361
There a problem with Dr. Thomas?

215
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,832
No, just refereeing
a dispute about the O.R.

216
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:17,387
We don't yet have
a contract with Atlanticnet.

217
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,173
We gave you an extra week

218
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,591
and you assured us
you'd have a deal by today.

219
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,303
We could have a deal,
just not the deal we deserve.

220
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,051
So what do you want,
approval for an extension?

221
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:31,393
We've been at this for eight months.
Extension isn't gonna change anything.

222
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,506
- So what's your plan?
- I presented a final offer.

223
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,363
I told them that we would agree
to a capitated structure

224
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:40,444
if they increase
reimbursements by 12%.

225
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:42,737
A final offer?
What does that mean?

226
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:46,366
If they don't accept it by 3:00,
we're gonna terminate.

227
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,224
Are you out of your mind?

228
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:51,616
If we don't accept
Atlanticnet insurance,

229
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,457
we'll lose 80% of our patients.

230
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,001
- We'd be lucky to last three months.
- We're not asking

231
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,170
for anything they can't afford.

232
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:01,013
Their last offer was a 4% increase,

233
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:02,622
and you're demanding 12.

234
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:05,057
They're paying even more
at some places.

235
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:07,083
Units that have lower ratings
than ours.

236
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,599
- In a perfect world, that would matter.
- Sanford, they're all about growth.

237
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:14,337
They know they don't get new customers
by marketing themselves as the biggest.

238
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,360
They do it by claiming
they're the best,

239
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,608
and they can't do that
if their patients can't come to us.

240
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,404
What was Morgan's reaction
when you told him?

241
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,531
He didn't give in, but he will.

242
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:31,119
I told him
I'd make the announcement at 3:00.

243
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:32,662
He'll call back before then.

244
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:36,781
They need us.

245
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,711
- We need them.
- We need each other.

246
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:45,315
The negotiation
is your responsibility.

247
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,173
So we can't stop you
if this is what you want to do.

248
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:49,954
But just so we're clear,

249
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,589
if we don't have a contract
with Atlanticnet,

250
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:55,314
you're not gonna have a contract
with us.

251
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:37,034
Guess who didn't show up
for clinic duty?

252
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,202
Don't tell me.

253
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:41,439
The guy with all the boils
needs a liver transplant.

254
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:44,129
His doctor needs a nap.
You want me to try to find him?

255
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:46,306
- You really need him?
- I need someone.

256
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,447
I have cancer.

257
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:53,196
- Why do you think you have cancer?
- I don't think I have cancer.

258
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:54,871
I know I have cancer.

259
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:57,887
I had surgery
to remove a malignant polyp

260
00:15:58,012 --> 00:15:59,416
in my colon six months ago.

261
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:01,758
And now it's spread
to my liver and lymph nodes.

262
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,045
So you're under the care
of an oncologist?

263
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,298
He won't give me
the prescription I need.

264
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,924
Do you need more painkillers?

265
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,010
I need breast milk.

266
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:14,431
Human breast milk?

267
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,752
It has cancer-fighting qualities.

268
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:20,228
In newborns,
it's been shown to reduce future risk.

269
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,353
No, in adults with cancer too.

270
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,319
I've read studies.

271
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:27,561
Look...

272
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:30,280
I know a place where I can buy it.

273
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:34,641
I need a prescription to get reimbursed
by my insurance company.

274
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:39,509
They said they'd reimburse the cost
of breast milk as a cancer treatment?

275
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,548
They reimburse prescriptions.

276
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:44,201
If you write me a prescription,
they have to pay.

277
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:46,463
Well, actually, they have a choice.

278
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:49,841
What are you, some type of shill
for the insurance company?

279
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:52,677
I've been paying premiums
for 30 years,

280
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,472
and I've never been sick in my life
till this happened.

281
00:16:56,486 --> 00:16:57,836
Now I can't work.

282
00:16:58,605 --> 00:16:59,855
I got no money.

283
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,062
You wanna help them screw me over?

284
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,957
- I'm not.
- Then give me the script.

285
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:05,662
- It won't help.
- Will it hurt me?

286
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:07,734
Okay, so it won't harm me

287
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,736
and it won't harm you,

288
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,947
- It's this company...
- This is not about that.

289
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,823
Then give me the damn script!

290
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:21,566
I'm sick.

291
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:24,709
I need help.

292
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:28,107
I need something.

293
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:30,564
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:37,332
Bitch.

295
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:47,542
Anyone call?

296
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:53,726
The ER. They said the vascular
who's on call doesn't have privileges.

297
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,392
Then why is he on call?

298
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,367
Dowd's at a conference,
got him to fill in.

299
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,510
Be nice if he got somebody
who can work here.

300
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:00,923
Call Ereshefsky.

301
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:03,081
Ereshefsky? She's not gonna do it.

302
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,449
- She owes me a favor.
- Still...

303
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:08,103
All right.

304
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,793
There's a guy in your office.
A lawyer.

305
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:13,625
- In my office?
- Didn't wanna sit around sick people.

306
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,250
I tried to stop him.

307
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:23,667
- I'm Dr. Lisa Cuddy.
- Ronald Westbrook.

308
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,520
Thanks for taking the time
to meet me.

309
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,439
Hard to avoid
since you're in my office.

310
00:18:27,878 --> 00:18:30,525
Sorry about that, I just got over
a wicked cold...

311
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,235
How can I help you?

312
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,977
I represent Martin Acevedo.

313
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,079
He's filed a suit against PPH

314
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:39,559
and Dr. Robert Chase
for performing surgery without consent.

315
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:44,080
I saw that, I also saw
the consent forms. They were all signed.

316
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,022
Yes, but my client was assured

317
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:48,168
the procedure
would be a few minor sutures.

318
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:49,765
Wait.

319
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,088
Your client cut his thumb off
with a table saw, right?

320
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,990
And Dr. Chase reattached it?

321
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:58,011
He didn't want it reattached?

322
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,305
No, he most certainly did not.

323
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,141
His insurance only covered 60%
of inpatient expenses.

324
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:08,160
- So he agreed to the cheapest option.
- What did you tell him?

325
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:11,247
I said I'd sew up the skin
over the exposed bone.

326
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:15,376
Then I put him under, got his thumb
from the paramedics, and reattached it.

327
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:18,499
Is he gonna tell the judge
I harmed him

328
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,196
by reattaching a vital digit?

329
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:23,244
He and the insurance company
are suing to get out of paying the bill.

330
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:25,861
It's over $80,000.

331
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,336
It was his thumb.

332
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:30,293
I couldn't let him toss it
in the trash to save a few bucks.

333
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:36,840
The pharm tech who called in sick
is here.

334
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:38,515
She's in your office.

335
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:42,803
He barely even looks at me anymore.

336
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:45,395
We haven't had sex in months.

337
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,840
You don't need pills to lose weight.

338
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:52,065
There are healthier ways,
legal ways.

339
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,533
You don't understand how hard it is.

340
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:57,195
Ever since our second child,
no matter what I do.

341
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:01,312
I just wanted to lose ten more pounds
and then stop.

342
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:03,606
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,621
Forging pharmaceutical orders...

344
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,938
- Stealing...
- Don't fire me, Dr. Cuddy.

345
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:11,116
Please, I'm begging you.

346
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,171
If Sam finds out, he'll divorce me
for sure, and my kids...

347
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:20,426
I will never do it again, I swear.
Just give me a second chance.

348
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,311
I won't report the theft to the DEA.

349
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:27,642
But I have to fire you.

350
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,401
Just take a few minutes
to compose yourself,

351
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,395
Then go down to HR
and they'll give you your last check.

352
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,074
I've been a perfect employee
for seven years.

353
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,382
I know, but this is too big.

354
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:48,116
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:07,678


356
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:11,188
How's it going?

357
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,044
Got three hours to save this place
from bankruptcy,

358
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:15,690
I fired one of my best employees,

359
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,316
and the woman taking care
of my child isn't returning my calls.

360
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:22,873
Rachel's gonna be fine, I'm sure
whoever he or she is deserved it,

361
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,721
and we're not going bankrupt.

362
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:26,623
- Are we?
- Don't worry.

363
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,892
The board will fire me before
that happens.

364
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:30,617
They'd never fire you.

365
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:33,790
I just told Atlanticnet insurance
I'd terminate

366
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:35,710
unless they gave us a 12% bump.

367
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,744
They might fire you.

368
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,282
Marina, it's me.

369
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:43,273
I haven't heard back from you,
call me as soon as you can.

370
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:46,529
You try Lucas?

371
00:21:46,654 --> 00:21:48,954
He's either sleeping or avoiding me.

372
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,851
- You in a fight?
- Not yet, but we're gonna be.

373
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:03,293
What should I do about Atlanticnet?

374
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:07,120
You're asking a guy who paid
full sticker price for his last car.

375
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:08,445
You ask House?

376
00:22:09,853 --> 00:22:12,080
He's a manipulator
who always gets what he wants.

377
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,763
This situation
is out of control enough already.

378
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:17,531
House is the last person
I want to get involved.

379
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:28,051
Get out of my chair.

380
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:29,486
And the answer is no.

381
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:33,260
You ever noticed how many porn sites
have "mom" in the domain name?

382
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,340
Hot moms, hungry moms, mature moms.

383
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,725
That ought to make you feel
pretty good.

384
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:44,412
What do you want?

385
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,937
Looks like boils,
altered mental status,

386
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:49,448
and heart failure
was called by renal cell carcinoma.

387
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,577
I need your signature
to treat him with malaria.

388
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,157
- Don't worry, I'm giving him chemo too.
- What is your obsession with malaria?

389
00:22:56,282 --> 00:22:58,615
Trying to play my part
cutting costs.

390
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,814
Malaria is the simplest, cheapest
method of delivering hypothermia.

391
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,355
The only money you care about...

392
00:23:05,137 --> 00:23:07,593
You bet someone you could use malaria
as a diagnostic tool?

393
00:23:08,994 --> 00:23:11,644
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Forget it.

394
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,578
Let me see
if I've got this straight.

395
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:16,586
A bet that puts one patient
at minor risk is juvenile?

396
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,354
And irresponsible and dangerous.

397
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,857
But going all-in
against Atlanticnet...

398
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:22,692
Is not a bet.

399
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:25,695
That is a carefully considered
negotiating position.

400
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,550
I'm gonna put this in your inbox.

401
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,479
Hope it doesn't get lost

402
00:23:31,604 --> 00:23:34,558
Underneath all the other stuff
you're carefully considering.

403
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,892
Take a look at these schedules.

404
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:45,428
- Let me know if you see any conflicts.
- Got it.

405
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:47,653
Ereshefsky actually did come in.

406
00:23:47,778 --> 00:23:49,677
You catch her
leaving a sponge in a guy?

407
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,768
- Wasn't a medical mistake.
- What was it?

408
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:53,483
Can't tell you now. She came in.

409
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:57,107
Have you audited
the ephedrine orders yet?

410
00:23:57,232 --> 00:23:58,353
Why? She confessed.

411
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,263
- I will.
- Today.

412
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,317
- He's cussing you out in there now.
- As long as he does it.

413
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:07,817
- What a bitch.
- What are you doing here?

414
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:09,655
You were gonna be too busy
for lunch.

415
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,407
So my specialty, spinach lasagna.

416
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,452
Didn't come looking for more people
you could brag about our sex life too?

417
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:19,856
From now on, I got nothing
but bad things to say about that.

418
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:21,572
Or nothing to say.

419
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:24,467
What's going on with Marina?
She hasn't called me.

420
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:27,914
She was gonna call. I told her
I'd let you know everything was okay.

421
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,489
So her fever broke?

422
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,844
What exactly does that mean,
when a fever breaks?

423
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:34,305
I'm very busy.
Does she have a fever or not?

424
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:37,850
That was gonna be your lunch?
And you didn't have breakfast either.

425
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:41,051
No, she doesn't have a fever,

426
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,231
and the rash was a diaper rash.

427
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,191
- She has a rash?
- Little one.

428
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:48,694
Lisa, don't worry, I'm telling you.

429
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:57,161
I must've grabbed Marina's cell
by mistake.

430
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,710
And I turned the ringer off
on the home phone

431
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,228
so I could sleep.

432
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:09,423
- What are you doing to me?
- Your deal's not done.

433
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:10,962
Not yet.

434
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,943
How about I take a quick look into
the guy in charge of the negotiations?

435
00:25:15,068 --> 00:25:16,718
Or better yet, the CEO.

436
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,503
If I get some dirt,
you can use it as leverage.

437
00:25:19,628 --> 00:25:20,928
There's no time.

438
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:26,232
How do you even find these guys?

439
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,635
You should have seen his face.

440
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,641
I thought he was gonna have a coronary
in the tee box.

441
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:39,745
Excuse me, you're Keith Tannenbaum,
CEO of Atlanticnet insurance, right?

442
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:43,757
- That's me. How can I help you?
- I think we can help each other.

443
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:47,587
I am Dr. Lisa Cuddy, dean of medicine
at Princeton Plainsboro.

444
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:51,844
- How are you?
- I'm a little unhappy.

445
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,469
You're aware our contract
with your company is up this week?

446
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,071
We have a negotiating team
that's working all that out.

447
00:25:57,196 --> 00:25:59,970
Princeton Plainsboro
has the highest-rated ER in the state,

448
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,695
the most advanced ICU,

449
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,381
and the most innovative
diagnostic medicine department

450
00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:05,646
in the country.

451
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:07,134
Good to know.

452
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:09,901
- Now if you don't mind...
- While Atlanticnet insurance

453
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,582
has a marketing budget
that's more than our pediatric ICUs

454
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:14,189
and transplant units combined.

455
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:16,646
Your PGA sponsorship
could pay for our walk-in clinic,

456
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:20,534
and the money spent on your jets
could fund our air ambulance service

457
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:23,313
- for the next three years.
- Your point being?

458
00:26:23,438 --> 00:26:25,288
Your growth may be good
for your bottom line,

459
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:26,792
but ours saves lives.

460
00:26:27,342 --> 00:26:30,492
And I would rather
not have to announce to the press

461
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:34,746
how selective your company appears to be
when it comes to cutting costs.

462
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:39,752
Morgan was right.

463
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:41,933
You are tough.

464
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:49,433
You can portray me as a rich bastard
in the press all you want.

465
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:51,458
Just as long as I stay rich.

466
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,284


467
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:04,981
- Stan is looking for you.
- Busy.

468
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:06,606
He said it's urgent.

469
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:13,969
I don't understand how it's possible.
I've checked it twice.

470
00:27:14,094 --> 00:27:15,964
- How much?
- Ten cases.

471
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,345
- Ten cases?
- Going back three years.

472
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,974
What have you been doing?
You're supposed to be managing.

473
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,922
The paperwork I signed was correct.

474
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:27,007
She must have altered
the orders afterwards.

475
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:29,730
Didn't you ever cross-check it
with the bills that came in?

476
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,594
I delegated it.

477
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:33,054
To whom?

478
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:35,278
Gail.

479
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:38,315
She seemed perfectly trustworthy.
How was I supposed to know?

480
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,116
- By doing your job.
- Sorry.

481
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,339
- Have you notified the DEA?
- The DEA?

482
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,039
Geez, Stan. Hello!

483
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:47,123
You don't steal $50,000 worth of pills
because you want to lose weight.

484
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,339
She's supplying a meth lab.
Just get her back in here.

485
00:27:50,948 --> 00:27:52,448
- All right.
- Now.

486
00:27:58,322 --> 00:28:02,138
You ever want a job, trust me.
He'll double what you're making here.

487
00:28:02,493 --> 00:28:04,262
Take it he liked my proposal.

488
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,265
Enough to tell me
to get my ass back over here today.

489
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:08,642
Here.

490
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:10,771
He's willing to go to 8%.

491
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:13,536
- Eight?
- We were at four.

492
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:15,985
Your board's gonna think
you walk on water.

493
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:18,562
I want 12.

494
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:23,036
You're not gonna get 12.

495
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:27,330
- There's just no way.
- 8% barely covers our cost inflation.

496
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,023
Capitated structure
should allow you to hold down inflation.

497
00:28:30,148 --> 00:28:33,232
And shifts all your risk onto us,
which is why we deserve 12.

498
00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:36,422
Lisa, come on. The guy who mows my lawn
makes more than my kid's teacher.

499
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,439
The two guys whose lunch
you interrupted could get fired,

500
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:42,784
and their severance would be more than
most of their employees make.

501
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:46,182
It doesn't have anything to do
with what you deserve.

502
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:49,018
This is it.

503
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:54,119
Take it or leave it.

504
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:24,428
What are you doing?

505
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,222
Know any good transplant surgeons?

506
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,996
Turns out his kidneys
aren't the only thing failing.

507
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:30,773
And I know what you're thinking.

508
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:33,391
Malaria wouldn't destroy
his liver that fast,

509
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:35,828
especially since
we never infected him.

510
00:29:35,953 --> 00:29:37,381
- I thought...
- Foreman thinks

511
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:41,510
that he has the authority to overrule me
because the FDA wouldn't approve.

512
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:45,497
Don't worry. I'll deal with him.
If you could just talk to Hourani...

513
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,037
What would you do?

514
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:53,040
If you paged me during sex?

515
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,558
About the contract with Atlanticnet.

516
00:29:56,823 --> 00:30:00,423
I got them to come up to 8%,
but we should get at least 12.

517
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,461
It's all numbers.
Do the math

518
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,094
and nothing else.

519
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:08,234
It's not about my pride.
It's about the principle.

520
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,441
They're trying to screw us over
because we're small.

521
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:12,620
- They're supposed to do.
- They should be pressuring

522
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:15,893
other hospitals to be more like us,
not trying to make us more like them.

523
00:30:16,018 --> 00:30:17,118
It's stupid.

524
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,819
Putting your job on the line in
an effort to stamp out stupidity isn't?

525
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:24,567
You would.

526
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:26,721
Probably.

527
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:28,918
But then I also wanted
to try to cure cancer

528
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:31,829
by infecting a guy with malaria
to win a $50 bet.

529
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,997
You really want to be like me?

530
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:02,974
As you know,
for the past eight months,

531
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:06,517
we've been trying to renegotiate
our contract with Atlanticnet insurance.

532
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:09,930
It's been a difficult process,
but I wanted to let you all know,

533
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:13,293
before we made the formal
announcement that as of 5:00 p.m. today,

534
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:15,828
our contract with Atlanticnet
will be terminated.

535
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,614
We've doubled the number
of customer service representatives

536
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:21,078
in our call center.

537
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:25,025
Current patients will still be allowed
to remain in our care for 30 days,

538
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,121
but starting tomorrow,
we will no longer

539
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:30,513
be accepting patients
with Atlanticnet health insurance.

540
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:37,561
Why weren't
we told about this sooner?

541
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:39,778


542
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,387
Come on, Marina.
Pick up the phone.

543
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:46,733
I'm busy.

544
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:52,785
- We found a liver match.
- All right.

545
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:55,481
Get him prepped.
I'll straighten things out with Hourani.

546
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:57,730
Hourani's not the problem.
House is.

547
00:31:57,855 --> 00:31:59,633
Now he wants Chase
to do the surgery.

548
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:01,586
To prove to Hourani
he doesn't need him?

549
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,570
To prove to Thomas that Chase
was his department's best surgeon.

550
00:32:04,695 --> 00:32:06,952
- What does Chase want to do?
- He wants to do the surgery.

551
00:32:07,077 --> 00:32:09,134
- And you don't want him?
- I don't care who does it.

552
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,525
- What's the problem?
- To get our patient into the O.R.,

553
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,465
we've to get him on surgery schedule.
To do that, we need someone

554
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,389
to put him there who neither House
nor Thomas can overrule.

555
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,580
What?

556
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:37,913
- Would you rather I go back on Vicodin?
- She's not massaging your leg.

557
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,139
She will... Eventually.

558
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:43,961
Why am I the only person here
who cares what happens to this hospital?

559
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:47,339
Get off your ass
and get your department under control.

560
00:32:47,621 --> 00:32:49,564
At least for the next few days.

561
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,094
Gonna take longer
than a few days for a company

562
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,645
of the size of Atlanticnet

563
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,671
to start feeling
the squeeze of your P.R. campaign.

564
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:59,134
- If they ever do.
- And you know this how?

565
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:02,001
From all the time you've spent
researching them and their contracts?

566
00:33:02,126 --> 00:33:05,190
- How they handle their press relations?
- I know they have a nascar team.

567
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:09,528
Despite what you may have learned
at Hebrew school or from Jimmy Cliff,

568
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,696
sometimes the bigger they are,

569
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,760
the harder they kick your ass.

570
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,231
I'm not trying to be greedy.

571
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:27,004
But he's also not interested in being
forced into a medical bankruptcy.

572
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,855
Mr. Acevedo, I am sorry
you're having financial difficulties.

573
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,218
But because of us,
you still have a thumb.

574
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,960
I assume that's something
a carpenter might need.

575
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:39,308
I assume you didn't ask for this meeting
so you could lecture my client.

576
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:42,239
You have insurance.

577
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,938
But by filing this suit,

578
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,732
you've caused us to get paid
nothing by them either.

579
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,326
- That's not our problem.
- Actually it is, since he's responsible

580
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:51,278
for any expense
we're not reimbursed.

581
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:54,848
But if you drop this suit
and make it clear that Dr. Chase

582
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:57,618
was acting in your best interest
when he reattached your thumb,

583
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,732
- we'll be able to resubmit the claim.
- And you'll cover his deductible,

584
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:03,496
attorney's fees, and 50 grand
for pain and suffering?

585
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:06,823
Actually, I was thinking more like
we'd cover half his deductible,

586
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,129
which means you'd only owe $16,000.

587
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:11,993
You want him to pay you?

588
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,406
Do you have any idea
how much it costs?

589
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:17,429
How many years it takes
to train someone in microsurgery?

590
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:19,991
We gave you back your life.

591
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:23,268
You can still work.
You can button your own shirt,

592
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,572
- hold a fork.
- Martin, let's go.

593
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:28,918
I'm sorry.
I know I should pay.

594
00:34:29,538 --> 00:34:30,289
But,

595
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:31,860
I just can't.

596
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:34,002
I still cannot work.

597
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:37,825
I'm already underwater on my house.
And I have two kids with braces.

598
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:41,453
You think you'd be in better shape
without a thumb?

599
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,721
Right now...

600
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:44,251
Financially?

601
00:34:45,837 --> 00:34:46,750
I would be.

602
00:34:48,957 --> 00:34:50,170
Well, so would we.

603
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,920
But when you came in, we didn't think
about that, we just took care of you.

604
00:34:54,045 --> 00:34:56,719
Made sure we did
whatever you needed to get well.

605
00:34:56,887 --> 00:35:00,014
Yeah, right, all you doctors
care about is healing.

606
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,438
That's why there's those BMWs
and Porsches in the parking.

607
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:05,032
- Damn it.
- Come on, we're out of here.

608
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:08,098
- We'll see you in court.
- You're right, you will.

609
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,388
You still have a thumb
because of us.

610
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:13,366
And like everyone else,
we don't work for free.

611
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:17,334
We earn this money. And if we have
to take your house to get it, we will.

612
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:26,999
- What's going on?
- I think they're fighting.

613
00:35:27,914 --> 00:35:30,092
Out of my way, now.
Out of my way.

614
00:35:33,026 --> 00:35:34,757
What the hell is going on?

615
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,025
I told them to use their words.

616
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:49,664
That pharm tech is back.
She's in your office.

617
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:52,204
You, there.
You, over there.

618
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:55,425
I don't wanna hear a word out
of either one of you until I get back.

619
00:35:59,052 --> 00:36:00,646
- You lied.
- So?

620
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:03,082
What're you gonna do about it?

621
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:07,419
Well, for one...
Notify the DEA.

622
00:36:07,544 --> 00:36:09,792
Good. I'm sure
they'll be very interested to hear

623
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,443
how doctor House forced me
to help him steal the meds.

624
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:14,646
And the administrator
who he's having sex with

625
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:16,381
has been helping him cover it up.

626
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,468
You think
you can lie your way out of this?

627
00:36:19,707 --> 00:36:20,757
Yeah, I do.

628
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:24,190
Anything else
you wanna know... bitch?

629
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:36,523
- HBC wants to speak to you.
- Tell him I'm busy. I did, but...

630
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:37,948
Tell him I quit.

631
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,614


632
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:18,775
You owe Lucas the money.

633
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:22,345
We were having sex when you called.

634
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:31,603
The breast milk guy finally found
a doctor to give him what he wanted.

635
00:37:32,308 --> 00:37:34,958
If it works,
it's way better than malaria.

636
00:37:38,232 --> 00:37:39,732
It was worth a shot.

637
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,109
I thought
they were the ones bluffing.

638
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,492
No way they'd let us terminate.

639
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:56,935
They're not gonna fire you.

640
00:37:57,968 --> 00:37:59,687
And you're not gonna quit.

641
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:02,663
Why not?

642
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,543
Because you're an idiot.

643
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:09,772
This place needs you.

644
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:11,756
And that matters to you.

645
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:20,882
What do you think
of that pharm tech?

646
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,384
- She's a sociopath.
- You knew she was stealing meds?

647
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:28,472
But have you seen
the way she opens the mail?

648
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,974
Why didn't you ever tell me?

649
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,102
Figured it might
come in handy one day.

650
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:49,085
Gail, I like you.
I always have.

651
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,733
And I know you must've gotten sucked up
into a situation you couldn't control.

652
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,291
Really, is that what happened
with you and House?

653
00:38:57,522 --> 00:39:00,796
I'm not gonna back down
just because you threaten to smear me.

654
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:06,287
Now, if you agree to tell the truth,
there are things I can do to help.

655
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,165
Think about your husband, your kids.

656
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:14,492
I know you're a good person
deep down inside.

657
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:19,094
You can't completely hide everything
about yourself in seven years.

658
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,361
You're an idiot.

659
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:29,018
I started stealing from here
six months after you hired me.

660
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,577
You still don't even know
the half of it, and you never will.

661
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:36,208
You wouldn't have even found out
about this if I hadn't gotten sick.

662
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:39,270
And you aren't
as tough as you think you are.

663
00:39:39,683 --> 00:39:42,436
There's no way
you'd let this job get taken away.

664
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,081
And if I go down...

665
00:39:46,387 --> 00:39:47,718
You're going down.

666
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:06,998
Can you tell Stan to give this
to the DEA agent when he comes by.

667
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:09,724
- A flower?
- Yeah, Lucas gave it to me.

668
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:11,734
I thought he might
come in handy one day.

669
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:15,120
I started stealing from here
six months after you hired me.

670
00:40:15,865 --> 00:40:16,705
Nice.

671
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,993
Least I came out on top once today.

672
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,503
Where you going?

673
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,962
To hand the board of my resignation.

674
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:27,759
Hopefully whoever they hire
to replace me can still get the 8%.

675
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:37,140
I've been trying to get
in touch with you all day.

676
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:40,480
All right, I understand.

677
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,055
Just how is Rachel?

678
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,316
And the rash?

679
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:46,693
Great.

680
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,311
I'll be home early.

681
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:54,969
You bitch.

682
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,449
I didn't think you'd actually do it.

683
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:02,417
I told you I would.

684
00:41:03,437 --> 00:41:04,837
Call the dogs off.

685
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:09,758
You got your 12.

686
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:13,079
Congratulations.

687
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:04,623
You gonna get that?
