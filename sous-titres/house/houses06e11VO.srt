1
00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:03,649
How am I supposed to walk
into that meeting with no presentation?

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:06,133
- How the hell did you screw this up?
- It wasn't me.

3
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:08,480
- She's lying.
- No, we agreed.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,548
- Her team had all the financials.
- We were swamped modeling them.

5
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:13,903
That's why we agreed
that you would do the slides.

6
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:16,703
One of you screwed up,
so please try to figure it out.

7
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:19,458
'Cause when the client dumps me,
I need to know who to fire.

8
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,604
I confirmed it in an email.
Hold on.

9
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:23,268
Here.

10
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:28,861
She did tell you, Russ.

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,060
What the hell?
I never got this.

12
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:39,705
Russ, are you okay?

13
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:43,222
Are you drunk?

14
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:44,460
I'm not drunk.

15
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,351
I'm not drunk.

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,388
I had no idea he was drinking again.

17
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:01,264
You should have.

18
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:04,027
Give me 5 minutes.
I'll go to the business center

19
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:05,341
and print the graphs.

20
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,356
Run.

21
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,358
And bring me some paper towels.

22
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:13,262
What?

23
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:16,285
It hurts.

24
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:18,832
Don't tell me you were drinking too.

25
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:20,788
My ears.

26
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:21,956
My God.

27
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,257
27 year old female

28
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:01,132
intense, intermittent ear pains
saw six doctors.

29
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:03,164
Tell her to stop lurking
in the front row.

30
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,916
If she wants to hit on musicians
that's what four buses are for.

31
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:07,445
Next.

32
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,130
If I ask why we're in Wilson's office
is there any chance I'll get a answer?

33
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:12,548
Try it.

34
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:16,854
14 year old boy
joint pain and excess hair growth.

35
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,887
Tell him to masturbate,
no more than 3 times daily.

36
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:21,825
With meals.
Next.

37
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,686
Did I mention that the 27 year
old female is really hot.

38
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:28,382
And her husband is really not...

39
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:30,077
Wild guess.
He's rich.

40
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:33,851
Not unless social workers have begun
pulling in the big money recently.

41
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:37,016
Gimme...

42
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,942
You're taking it because she's hot?

43
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,993
No, that would be
an accident of genetics.

44
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,641
It's because she's hot
and her husband is ugly.

45
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:46,582
It's a fascinating window
into the mysteries of human psychology.

46
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,550
Also, she's really hot.

47
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:51,045
Or she, you know, loves her husband.

48
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:53,339
- She loves something about him.
- Vitamin deficiency?

49
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:56,350
- She changed her diet a few months ago.
- To a healthier diet.

50
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,116
Raw foods, lots of nuts.

51
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,171
It's not the ear,

52
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:01,555
it's the heart.

53
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:04,623
Her protein is cheese,
which can raise cholesterol.

54
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,823
Hers was already elevated.
Gave her arterial blockages.

55
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,815
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting
as ear pain. Very rare.

56
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,561
Cool.

57
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,286
Beauty and the beast.
Who wants to go see?

58
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:36,507
Let's see... Dr. Taub, Foreman,

59
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,551
Chase, and Hadley.

60
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:41,345
- Four for four.
- I can't believe I get these doctors.

61
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:43,689
And such good-looking ones too.

62
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:45,837
It's almost like
we don't all need to be here.

63
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:49,406
Your case presented a very interesting
diagnostic challenge.

64
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,866
You can't sleep in your own office?
Or bedroom for that matter?

65
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:04,689
Got to avoid my natural habitat.

66
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:08,361
Some idiot I went to med school with

67
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:10,820
keeps leaving messages
and wants to drop by for lunch.

68
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:11,834
Tell him no.

69
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:15,462
- It's complicated.
- It's too complicated for you

70
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,672
to tell someone
you don't like to screw off?

71
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:19,675
That's practically your hobby.

72
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,430
A few months ago he was...

73
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,862
sort of part of my therapy.

74
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:27,015
My shrink told me

75
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:30,185
to write a letter of apology
to someone I hurt.

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,410
And how did you hurt him?

77
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:34,660
We were in a seminar
on flatworm genetics.

78
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:36,660
I switched my final paper with his.

79
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:38,723
You plagiarized?
Doesn't sound like you.

80
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:40,237
I was testing a theory.

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,975
I thought that our professor
was biased against me.

82
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,097
I assumed he'd get a high grade
with my paper

83
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:46,981
and I'd get a low grade with his.

84
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,714
Interestingly, I was wrong.

85
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,625
- I got an "A".
- So you're in this mental hospital,

86
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,351
delving into your subconscious,

87
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:56,919
and this is who you choose
to apologize to?

88
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,539
- Lorenzo Wibberly.
- Of all the people you've hurt?

89
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:03,662
Not everyone has a name that's so easy
to find in the white pages.

90
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,854
I'm in there, and so is Cuddy.

91
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,855
- And yet, I picked him. It's funny.
- It's hilarious.

92
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,187
Great to see
what a success your therapy was.

93
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,514
We said
we'd never go to sleep angry.

94
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,296
We did find an arrhythmia.
It's not from your arteries.

95
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,196
- They're clean.
- Will the pain come back?

96
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:24,539
We'll start her on cardiac meds.
That should help.

97
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:27,312
But we still need to figure out
what's causing the arrhytxmia.

98
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:28,587
Hey, Valerie.

99
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:34,453
It's so nice of you to stop by.

100
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:37,753
- I got lots of free time now.
- You don't blame me, do you?

101
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,538
You were drunk in front of Norris.

102
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,321
I'm drunk now.

103
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,080
It was like someone

104
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,560
poisoned me or something.

105
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,186
Maybe you should come back later.

106
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,026
I wanna say good-bye.

107
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,114
Thank you for coming by.

108
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:09,994
What are you doing?

109
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:14,873
You poor son of a bitch. She doesn't
love you any more than she loved me.

110
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,805
You need to leave right now.

111
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,053
You're pretending
you had an affair with my wife?

112
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,339
Yeah, we're all pretending.
You got nothing to worry about.

113
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,846
Tell him where you were
six months ago, Russ.

114
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:27,511
I had a breakdown.

115
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:29,596
I had some paranoid tendencies,

116
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,864
as they say.

117
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,182
But it turns out,

118
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,727
I had a right... to be paranoid.

119
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:35,936
You need help.

120
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,149
Get him out of here.

121
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,165
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

122
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,001
We'll keep an eye out.
He's not getting back here.

123
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:03,086
He's making all that up.
You know that, right?

124
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:04,506
Yeah, of course.

125
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,981
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Undisclosed location.

126
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:16,351
- <i>Who are you hiding from?</i>
- Wilson.

127
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,497
<i>And the lunch date
that Wilson is, no doubt,</i>

128
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:20,295
<i>right now trying to sic on me.</i>

129
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,359
<i>But in the great game of chess
that is our relationship,</i>

130
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,582
Wilson sees only one move ahead.

131
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,278
I see dozens.

132
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,490
<i>That is why he will never mate me.</i>

133
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,633
That's a chess term.

134
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:33,908
<i>That's great.</i>

135
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,206
<i>A co-worker confronted our patient.
Altered mental status.</i>

136
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,124
<i>Basically accused her
of poisoning him.</i>

137
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,863
- We think he was projecting.
- <i>So he's poisoning her.</i>

138
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:45,172
What could he get his hands on
to cause supraventricular tachycardia?

139
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,715
Does he have dry skin?

140
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,092
<i>Thin eyebrows?</i>

141
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,341
If you're sharing an amazed look,

142
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,263
- please do it louder.
- <i>He might have.</i>

143
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:56,814
- How did you know that?
- <i>If he has hypothyroidism</i>

144
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,978
<i>and he dumped his meds in her coffee,
That would make her heart go boom.</i>

145
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,272
- In a bad way.
- <i>We'll treat with beta blockers.</i>

146
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:03,857
Sorry, but I disagree.

147
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,984
<i>- With what?
- With everything.</i>

148
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,379
Why are we assuming he's lying
and she's telling the truth?

149
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,939
Because she's a successful,
happily married consultant,

150
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:13,700
and he's a crazy, drunk weirdo
who we tossed out of the hospital.

151
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,578
- And she's hot.
- <i>She picked him 'cause he's vulnerable.</i>

152
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,747
There's something off about her,
I can feel it.

153
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:20,368
If you had any evidence...

154
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:23,502
Why didn't she tell us he puked
on her shoes right before she collapsed?

155
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,262
It's medically irrelevant.
He was drunk, she was sick.

156
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:29,293
<i> You don't think it's suspicious
she didn't mention it to her husband?</i>

157
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,833
<i>Why did you break up with thirteen?</i>

158
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,722
The non-subtextual thing
she was saying, why that?

159
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,142
This is about the case,

160
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,066
not some imaginary issue
that you think Foreman and I have.

161
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,325
Great, start her on beta blockers.

162
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:49,731
You'll do it?

163
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:53,240
- I don't think he was talking to me.
- Well, I am.

164
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,993
I'm the only one
who thinks you're wrong.

165
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:57,911
Maybe that's why
I'm asking you to do it.

166
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,975
Lorenzo Wibberly.

167
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:23,621
Dr. Wilson said you'd be here.

168
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,030
How ya been?

169
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:27,626
Check and mate.

170
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:38,923
I'm sorry this is awkward
or whatever.

171
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:41,663
I thought it was nice of you
to write that letter,

172
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,511
and I wanted to tell you
that you don't have to feel bad.

173
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:51,540
So where are you working these days?

174
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:54,051
You got your own practice
or you at a hospital?

175
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,470
I thought you knew.

176
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:59,521
Dani's,
the organic supermarket chain.

177
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:01,246
As an in house doctor?

178
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,152
I actually never got licensed.

179
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,396
I didn't graduate med school.

180
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,889
I planned on going back,

181
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:11,235
and my father got sick
and I had to take care of him

182
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,779
and had some bad luck.

183
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:15,688
Why didn't you graduate?

184
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,658
I was one credit short.

185
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,224
And I was sort of already
on academic probation.

186
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,871
Which credit?

187
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:24,964
I got a...

188
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:30,036
He failed me
on that paper you switched.

189
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,348
I thought you knew.

190
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:36,343
So I'm guessing you're the CEO
of this supermarket chain?

191
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:38,830
I bag groceries.

192
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:43,156
Life works out weird sometimes.

193
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:51,149
We were gonna do it in Santa Barbara
because of his parents.

194
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,734
<i>But then I found this beautiful
hotel in Montauk and...</i>

195
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:57,602
- You're testing her for a brain tumor?
- That's what I told her.

196
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,700
You can chastise me
after you look at the monitor.

197
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,828
- Look what's lighting up.
- Lateral frontal cortex.

198
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,289
- Broca's area... So what?
- I told her it was customary

199
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,207
to talk during MRIs, to relax.

200
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,034
I spent the last 30 minutes
asking her about everything in life

201
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,378
that she loves, then hates,

202
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,756
then feels any emotion about at all.

203
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,175
There's nothing in the
paralimbic system, amygdala.

204
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,219
She's using the language part
and bypassing the emotional.

205
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,042
She can understand love
and pain and empathy,

206
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,766
But she can't feel them at all.

207
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,239
She's a psychopath.

208
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:36,426
- Why do you want to meet her so badly?
- Psychopaths always fascinate me.

209
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:40,201
I think it's their cultural literacy
and strong family values.

210
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:42,653
- Or is that Jews?
- We're not gonna be able

211
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:45,495
to get an honest read on her
unless her husband is out of there.

212
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:47,581
I got an idea.

213
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,284
Can you get out of here?

214
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,244
Thanks.

215
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,342
It was the "thanks" that did it.

216
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,165
I'm Dr. House.

217
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,389
How long have you been a psychopath?

218
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:09,621
- Are you kidding?
- He's not.

219
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:12,185
Are you saying
I'm like Ted Bundy or something?

220
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,109
Psychopathy can get a bad rap.
It doesn't mean you're violent.

221
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,155
Just that you're without conscience,
You lack any normal emotion,

222
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,572
you manipulate everyone,

223
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:23,158
you're promiscuous,
you lie pathologically.

224
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:25,535
Any of this ringing bells?

225
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:28,368
Is that why you were asking me
those weird questions?

226
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,415
Though you have Darwin
to thank for that.

227
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,409
She got the creeps around you.

228
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,501
Which oddly, is an actual medical
phenomenon around psychopaths.

229
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,632
Probably an evolved response
to predators.

230
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,343
I'm sorry,
you're really freaking me out.

231
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,580
- I have no idea what...
- Relax.

232
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:44,792
We have a duty of confidentiality.

233
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:48,307
You have an undiagnosed heart problem
that could kill you at any moment.

234
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:52,382
We believe that your mental abnormality
is related to your physical one.

235
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,907
So if you want
to keep on predating...

236
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,122
What do you want to know?

237
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,293
Your co-worker's story was true.

238
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,811
You poisoned him.

239
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:20,425
I gave him a little Valium
and an emetic.

240
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,251
You understand
what the word "no" means?

241
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:25,846
- I've had them before.
- So you were helping him out?

242
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:29,913
And I assume he was cool
with the seducing and firing part too?

243
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:32,144
Russ knew what he was getting into.

244
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,950
He got sex every Thursday night,

245
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:36,148
and I got to take credit
for his best ideas.

246
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,651
- What do you get out of your marriage?
- Same thing you get out of your job.

247
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:41,555
Bill has a trust fund.

248
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,755
And I have a prenup
his parents made me sign.

249
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,366
Told you he was rich.

250
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,091
She's not that weird.

251
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:49,995
I'm not so different than anybody else.

252
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,167
Everyone I've ever known, my family,
my classmates, the people I work with.

253
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,206
They're out for themselves.

254
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:58,213
But I could admit it to myself.

255
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,047
- She reminds me of someone I know.
- Tell me about it.

256
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,092
Some of my co-workers will insult people
right to their faces.

257
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,386
How long have you been this way?

258
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:10,223
Just how I am.

259
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,379
Are you gonna cure
my heart problems now?

260
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,575
So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia.
Go!

261
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:23,199
I thought you were bluffing.
You really think they're connected?

262
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:26,600
Two rare conditions in one patient,
it's a fair assumption they are.

263
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,806
Psychopathy is generally genetic,
nothing you can do.

264
00:14:29,931 --> 00:14:32,698
Something that hits 30 years after birth
isn't gonna be connected.

265
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:34,811
Her disease isn't gonna lie dormant
that long.

266
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:37,914
- Did her heart warp her brain?
- Maybe a handful of diseases.

267
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,192
It'll be super awesome
when we find it.

268
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,881
Tertiary syphilis can cause
pseudopsychopathic syndrome

269
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,979
- and cardiomyopathy.
- Fits best. Start her on penicillin,

270
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:47,928
And rule out Wilson's
and Hashimoto's.

271
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,626
There's your handful.

272
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,401
Wasn't so hard, was it?

273
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:01,191
Do something about thirteen.

274
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,033
She flouted both
my authority and yours.

275
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,699
Yes, and she got it right
and you got it wrong.

276
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,323
Which aggravates the problem.

277
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,243
She'll do it again.
Next time it won't work out so well.

278
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:14,791
You gotta punish her.

279
00:15:15,203 --> 00:15:16,503
You're her boss.

280
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:19,556
In some vague,
never to be usefully defined way.

281
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,920
- You punish her.
- I'm also her ex,

282
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,527
Which makes it a little complicated.

283
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:28,552
The fact that you also fired her
takes it from complicated to moronic.

284
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,621
- It was the only way...
- It wasn't because you loved her.

285
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:33,431
It was because you loved your career.

286
00:15:33,744 --> 00:15:35,605
We're almost at my floor
so I'll summarize.

287
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,380
Your problem, not mine.

288
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:47,521
- You cut up my only copy of that photo.
- That rare daguerreotype.

289
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:51,020
Charge me for the effort it takes
to search your HD for a new copy.

290
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:53,045
Not the one of me and Lucas.

291
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:54,894
The one from Ecuador.

292
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:58,191
I'd forgotten your attachment
to lemurs.

293
00:15:58,316 --> 00:15:59,316
To my dad.

294
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,420
- You got his tail.
- He was holding the camera.

295
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,388
That was the last trip
we ever took together.

296
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,775
And I don't have a digital copy.

297
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:15,016
Well, I could stand here all day
apologizing,

298
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,767
but I'd rather expiate
my sins with good clean work.

299
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,996
You ignoring my texts?

300
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:25,705
The ones you sent
trying to get me to make you feel better

301
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,569
about destroying your classmate's life?

302
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,337
No, I never got those.

303
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,822
Who's this?

304
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,428
He is a doctor of medical.&

305
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,684
Also of medicine.

306
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,526
Dr. Wilson called me in
on a consult.

307
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:42,792
Wibberly's got some agenda.

308
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,107
To guilt me
into getting him a better job.

309
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,339
- How pissed was he?
- Not at all.

310
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,858
Hence the agenda.

311
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:52,445
It hurts a lot.

312
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:55,569
Then you shouldn't have hit it.

313
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,450
Very dangerous working conditions.

314
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,477
Do something to help.

315
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,541
You are responsible.

316
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,691
Don't worry.

317
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,409
Dr. Wilson is a very good physician.

318
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,866
Who has enormous empathy
towards patients

319
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,643
which stems from his crippling battle
with sexual dysfunction.

320
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,249
I'm responsible for the foreseeable
consequences of switching papers.

321
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,360
A bad grade or a sleepless night.

322
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:27,035
Worst case, a retest.

323
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,469
There was no way to know
that one seminar paper

324
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:31,421
was gonna destroy this idiot's life.

325
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:34,969
If there's any karma in all this,
he's probably happier than you are.

326
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,091
Good point.

327
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:40,600
If he's happier,
there's no harm done.

328
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,118
I'll go find out.

329
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,022
- That is absolutely not what I said.
- Always with the modesty, this one.

330
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:50,652
Next time you want to get
secretly stoned at work

331
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,154
and mistake your thumb for a nail?

332
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,324
Eye drops are a good call,

333
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,592
but useless,

334
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,906
that's why
you're tearing up so much.

335
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,311
He says you are a very good doctor.

336
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:17,423
You want something to eat?

337
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:18,863
I'm cool.

338
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:22,286
How's work?

339
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:25,063
You happy with it?

340
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:28,011
You know... It's a job.

341
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:32,398
I don't need to take any work home
with me at least.

342
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:33,623
Free time...

343
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:36,871
Wouldn't have any
if you were a doctor.

344
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:38,826
True.

345
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:42,692
You like chili? I could reheat some.

346
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,217
Is that your yard?

347
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:46,415
That's nice.

348
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:52,338
That sugar maple,
100, 150 years old.

349
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,454
Most beautiful leaves in the fall.

350
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:57,635
Sitting underneath on the bench...

351
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:00,312
It's like paradise.

352
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:02,763
I don't have a yard, myself.

353
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:05,634
You got a good thing going.

354
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:08,172
I know.

355
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:10,261
So what are the boxes for?

356
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:14,205
I'm moving.

357
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:16,262
From paradise?

358
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:18,104
Well, my dad's medical bills

359
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:20,765
and me having
an adjustable mortgage.

360
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:23,745
You're losing your home?

361
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:26,623
It could be worse, right?

362
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:30,212
How?

363
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,803
Even if the tests are positive,
you don't have to worry.

364
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:36,332
You're testing for syphilis,
not a cold.

365
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:40,512
- At this stage, it's not communicable.
- You think I'm worried about myself?

366
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,428
- I want her to get better.
- She might have caught it at birth.

367
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:47,060
So it doesn't prove she was cheating,
if you were worried about that.

368
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,856
- Of course not.
- How many weeks am I gonna have to...

369
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,972
You okay? Why is she coughing?

370
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:53,858
- I don't know.
- Want some water?

371
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,252
Are you threatened by me?

372
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,829
- Not at all.
- Well, you should be.

373
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,048
You let him know what I told you,
I will have your license pulled,

374
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,584
and I will sue you
for everything I lose in the divorce.

375
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,462
So the fun you get
out of making those snotty comments,

376
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,330
is it worth $19 million?

377
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:18,716
Wait, will you hold that look?

378
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:21,023
I'm really bad at showing emotions.

379
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,198
How's this?

380
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:26,236
Thanks, baby.

381
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,852
Can I have your arm please?

382
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,264
My arm! You broke it!

383
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,521


384
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:44,826
- I don't know what happened.
- Me neither.

385
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:48,955
But after that, she called Cuddy
and demanded you off the case.

386
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,417
I backed you up,
because I trust you.

387
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,430
But you're gonna have to earn
that trust now.

388
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,755
Actually, he backed you up

389
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,091
Because of the new
BUN creatinine numbers.

390
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:02,952
Brittle bones
were from kidney failure.

391
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,106
There is that.

392
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,848
- So heart and kidneys.
- And brain.

393
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,517
- Psychopathy is not a symptom.
- It was yesterday.

394
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:12,000
In the meantime,
kidney failure ruled out syphilis

395
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,938
and testing
ruled out the other ideas.

396
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,940
Protein levels, kidneys, arrhythmia.

397
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,758
Could be paraneoplastic.
I'd say lymphoma.

398
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:20,361
Get her to radiotherapy.

399
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,281
We can't start radiation
without immunoassays on her urine.

400
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,728
So cast a spell
and magically fix her kidney

401
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,242
so she gives us some urine.

402
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,371
- We have some from admission.
- Not enough for an accurate reading.

403
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,155
How about partially accurate?

404
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,626
Those of you
who haven't slept together, you can go.

405
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,940
Everyone else, stay behind.

406
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,535
Sorry.

407
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,688
That was our secret, right?

408
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:54,979
- Go have sex.
- No, thanks.

409
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,857
Fine, I'll cover the Viagra
and the lubricants. Get me a receipt.

410
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,360
- We have zero feelings for each other.
- Too bad.

411
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,904
Because things worked much better
then.

412
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,573
- What if I slept with her?
- We were getting to a diagnosis.

413
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,742
We were already at the diagnosis.

414
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,411
You were creating a fake argument
about a treatment issue,

415
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,227
'cause you can't stand each other.

416
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:14,952
So have sex, fight or quit,
I don't care.

417
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:17,377
What you're doing now isn't working.

418
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:28,184
You okay?

419
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:34,185
Look, I get that you gotta act fast.

420
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:37,384
Radiation?
You ruled out everything else?

421
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:38,859
I'm sorry, but...

422
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,069
We could still check
for environmental toxins.

423
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:46,496
Where does she spend
most of her time?

424
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:48,992
- Mostly at work, at home.
- Hobbies?

425
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,120
- Recurring activities outside the home?
- Not really.

426
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:54,414
She took a landscaping class.

427
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,582
- At the Y.
- When did it meet?

428
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,426
Every Thursday night this summer.

429
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,137
You dig in soil,

430
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:06,162
You can be exposed to pesticides,
heavy metals, lots of bad things.

431
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:08,359
Can you find out
all about her landscaping class,

432
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:10,584
where it was, details like that?

433
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:12,272
I'll do it now.

434
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,358
So when you watch <i>Star Wars</i>,

435
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:24,777
which side do you root for?

436
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:30,452
What are you doing?

437
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:33,027
Just checking in
on your radiotherapy.

438
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:36,718
From what I hear,
you never visit patients.

439
00:23:37,392 --> 00:23:40,092
And now,
you've come to chat with me twice.

440
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:43,344
I want to know how you like
being a management consultant.

441
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,237
I'm thinking of getting into it.

442
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:47,212
That or psychopathy, maybe.

443
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:49,064
Which pays better?

444
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:52,138
I think you're already
into one of them.

445
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,575
Dr. Hadley made a joke yesterday.

446
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,500
She said I sound like you.

447
00:23:58,072 --> 00:24:00,622
I'm sure you understand
what joke means.

448
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:02,690
So you're not just out for yourself?

449
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:06,340
For example, you would never interrupt
a sick woman's treatment

450
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:09,015
just because of some
personal obsession?

451
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:11,990
Of course I'm self-interested.

452
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:14,215
We all are. We're born that way.

453
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,662
The rest of us
are born with consciences.

454
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:20,787
Which is something
you just sound ecstatic about.

455
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,796
I'm not saying it's logical,
it's human.

456
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:27,984
So if you know your conscience

457
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:31,427
is just an animal instinct,
you don't need to follow it.

458
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,270
I think you realize that.

459
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:37,571
That's why you're talking to me.

460
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,788
You lied
about your landscaping class.

461
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:02,375
Dr. Hadley thought the soils
might be poisoned.

462
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:05,519
- You told him that?
- I just thought...

463
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:07,338
Russ said you were having an affair.

464
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:10,779
Was that your cover?
Every Thursday night you'd...

465
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,470
I'm so sorry.

466
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:19,387
It's not what you think.

467
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,714
Do you remember that telecom case
I said that we didn't get last year?

468
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:25,089
In fact, we did, and I was swamped.

469
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,927
Every Friday morning
we had a conference call with London,

470
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:29,264
so the night before...

471
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,488
That's your excuse? You expect me
to believe that you were at the office?

472
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,782
What's the biggest argument
we've ever had?

473
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,410
You said I spend too much time
away from home.

474
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:40,221
That I don't need a job,
that you would take care of me.

475
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:43,467
- That's all true.
- You yelled at me.

476
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,680
You made me feel like

477
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:47,670
you didn't value anything
that I did.

478
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,031
I need this job

479
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:52,256
to feel like I'm accomplishing something
on my own.

480
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:54,375
That's why I lied.

481
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,665
If I call your office tomorrow
and I check...

482
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,514
Call my office, call my secretary,

483
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,982
Call my clients.

484
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,978
Interrupt their dinner, wake them up.
I just want you to know the truth.

485
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,731
You know I love you.

486
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,611
Come here.

487
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:13,933
Please.

488
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,289
It's okay.

489
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:32,508
Fire her.

490
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,253
What for? You seemed to have lied
your way out of any trouble.

491
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:36,928
'Til Bill checks up on my cover.

492
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,096
I've to create a new one
to cover that one up.

493
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,848
I've done it before but it's a pain.

494
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,476
And I would like Dr. Hadley
to share that pain.

495
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:46,034
She didn't reveal confidences,
she had a medical reason

496
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,688
to ask about your landscaping class.

497
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,683
We can see what a jury
says about that.

498
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,895
And admit to your husband the truth?
You're not gonna sue us.

499
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,989
We will remove Dr. Hadley
from all patient contact.

500
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:56,845
What?

501
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,243
But it's for Dr. Hadley's benefit,
not yours.

502
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:03,334
We have no obligation
to inflict you on her.

503
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,872
Fine.

504
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:08,586
But just so you know,
this is not for your benefit.

505
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,640
Dr. Cuddy's furious at you
put her hospital at risk.

506
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:14,841
She just knows it's a bad idea
to admit it in front of me.

507
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:17,619
Think what you want.

508
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:19,613
By the way, your orderly's outside.

509
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,534
I'd wait about another 10 minutes
if you want your husband

510
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,660
to think you're having
radiation treatments.

511
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,817
Are you by chance gonna cry?

512
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:36,403
'Cause that's one I just can't do.

513
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,056
Hello?

514
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,149
This is dr. Hadley.

515
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,014
What?

516
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:10,148
- You called the medical board?
- What is she talking about?

517
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,274
Accusations of sexual harassment.
You don't think I know it's you?

518
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,191
Come on.

519
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,945
You already got me fired from the case.
What else do you want?

520
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,431
Get out here now.

521
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,877
- You're an idiot.
- She wants to make me lose my license.

522
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,986
She'll fail, unless you're stupid enough
to go in there and scream at her.

523
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:38,257
Sexual harassment accusations
are serious.

524
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,551
If she made them anonymously,
the case goes away.

525
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,823
If she used her name,
we all back you up, It goes away.

526
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,503
You're completely overreacting.

527
00:28:45,628 --> 00:28:47,685
You'd be pissed off too
if you were me.

528
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,521
Or maybe not. You're just about
as emotional as she is.

529
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,648
- I'm doing you a favor.
- When you try to do something nice,

530
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,158
You sound like a jerk.

531
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:58,377
I'm sorry.

532
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:01,497
For what?

533
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:04,325
For firing you.

534
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:07,171
Don't do that,
that's not what this is about.

535
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,038
I'll apologize anyway.

536
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,323
I did it for me. Not for you.

537
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,709
I realized that
right after I fired you.

538
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,257
But I couldn't admit it.

539
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:22,009
Screwed everything up.

540
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,797
I hope that we can still work
together.

541
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,501
Something's wrong.

542
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:34,898
Blood flow is backing up,
spilling into her esophagus.

543
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,607
- The cancer?
- This isn't lymphoma.

544
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,203
We don't know what it is.
We can wrap bands around the veins,

545
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:42,403
But , that might not work.
I want to try something called a "tips,"

546
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,741
a shunt that makes
the blood bypass the liver.

547
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,242
That'll save her?

548
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,146
It should preserve her liver
and heart. The liver cleans out toxins,

549
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:51,831
Bypass it too long, she'll get
brain damage, eventually die.

550
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,709
That's still probably less dangerous
than bleeding out now.

551
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,464
- She usually makes the decisions.
- You gotta step up now.

552
00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:05,761
- Was she cheating on me?
- I can't discuss...

553
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,431
Just tell me she wasn't lying.

554
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,206
Just tell me that.

555
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,682
I'm supposed to make this decision?

556
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,559
I don't even know
who she is anymore.

557
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,754
Either way,
you gotta do it right now.

558
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:26,900
Do whatever you think is right.

559
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:39,400
I'd give her a day.
Two days at the most.

560
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:41,380
Great. You be the clock.

561
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,030
Everyone else will be the doctors.
Heart, kidneys, now liver.

562
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,927
- Amyloidosis?
- No speckles on the MRI.

563
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,555
- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?
- Too much kidney failure.

564
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,711
Primary hepatic fibrosis?

565
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,763
That's our best guess.
Start her on steroids.

566
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,064
Even if we're right,
the liver's probably too scarred.

567
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,865
- We've got to list her for a new one.
- With an unconfirmed diagnosis?

568
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,405
- Not gonna happen.
- A family?

569
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,952
I don't think the husband is
the right blood type. Even if he was,

570
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:08,520
- He's not gonna give his liver.
- He left her, I assume?

571
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:09,645
Not yet.

572
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,748
Says he won't abandon her
while she's sick.

573
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,760
She have any other family members?

574
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:17,249
No one's gonna risk their life
to save hers.

575
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:21,368
One false accusation from a psychopath,
and you turned out to be a real bummer.

576
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,347
I'm gonna go see if
Wilson has the liver left.

577
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:38,591
What are you doing?

578
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:41,548
Paying Wibberly's mortgage
for a few months.

579
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:45,209
Congratulations on another
successful round of hectoring.

580
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:48,026
Wait a minute, is that
actually a check for him?

581
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:51,663
It's a giant novelty item
for winning the lottery.

582
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:53,705
You're just
standing really far away.

583
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:56,833
Of all the people
to go the extra mile for,

584
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,670
- why this guy?
- I don't know.

585
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:01,416
He just kinda smells
good and makes me laugh.

586
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:04,696
Why not Cuddy? You never apologized
after you defaced her photo.

587
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:07,502
Maybe because I recognize
that sending someone to the poor house

588
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:10,047
is a little more serious
than editing a snapshot.

589
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:12,818
No, it's because Cuddy actually
means something to you,

590
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:15,016
Which makes it
much harder to apologize.

591
00:32:16,987 --> 00:32:20,106
If it will make you shut up,
I'll tell her I'm sorry about the photo.

592
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,398
Forget the photo.
She was in love with you.

593
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,762
And all she got in return was abuse.

594
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:27,189
For years,
you toyed with her emotions.

595
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:29,488
- She wasn't in love with me.
- You still can't admit it.

596
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,270
That proves my point.

597
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:33,049
What do you want?

598
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,475
- Helping the guy was your idea.
- No, help the guy, whatever...

599
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,373
I'm just pointing out
that it's much easier

600
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,322
to soothe your guilt
by throwing money at a stranger

601
00:32:42,447 --> 00:32:45,713
than by making amends
to a person you actually cared about.

602
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,715
You had me at "much easier."

603
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,993
I'm gonna pretend to go to work now.

604
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:22,969
I'm Dr. Hadley.
I'm sorry to bother you,

605
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:25,505
But I was told
you're Valerie's sister?

606
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:28,526
I was just surprised
you came to visit.

607
00:33:30,453 --> 00:33:32,353
So is the rest of my family.

608
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,220
I was even more surprised
you got tested as a donor.

609
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:37,541
- Wrong blood type.
- But why?

610
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,975
I mean, you know what she's like.

611
00:33:40,837 --> 00:33:41,977
She's not that bad.

612
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:43,898
Yes, she is.

613
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:50,539
Our dad was a mean drunk.

614
00:33:51,757 --> 00:33:53,175
I was the older sister.

615
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,032
I was supposed to stand up for her,

616
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:57,579
not the other way around.

617
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:00,049
She protected you
when you were kids?

618
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:02,393
Yeah, and then all of the sudden...

619
00:34:02,894 --> 00:34:04,466
All of his crap

620
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:06,425
and all his abuse...

621
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:09,129
It just changed her.

622
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,183
It made her cold.

623
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,259
When?

624
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:21,225
We were wrong.
Psychopathy is a symptom.

625
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,644
I spoke to her sister.
She wasn't always like this.

626
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,480
She changed,
and right around adolescence.

627
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:32,778
So liver, heart, brain,
can lie dormant,

628
00:34:33,055 --> 00:34:34,805
And it starts at puberty.

629
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:44,581
The raw food diet
made it go fulminate...

630
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:46,625
Nuts are high in copper.

631
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:49,286
It's wilson's disease.

632
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:51,547
We ruled that out.
No keyser-fleischer rings.

633
00:34:54,055 --> 00:34:55,426
There is one other sign.

634
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:57,973
I know there are lipstick lesbians.

635
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:01,339
Are there
nail polish remover bisexuals?

636
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,605
She's not supposed to be here.

637
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:09,413
As a doctor. You didn't say anything
about her capacity

638
00:35:09,538 --> 00:35:10,983
as a beautician's assistant.

639
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,338
Her fingernail's blue?

640
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:31,188
Start her on chelation.

641
00:35:32,357 --> 00:35:34,677
- What just happened?
- You're gonna get better.

642
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:37,980
Your body has an inability
to process copper.

643
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:42,104
It caused all of your problems.
Even what's wrong with your brain.

644
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,849
And that's gonna change too?

645
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:47,806
It's probably rewired
her neurons permanently by now.

646
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,438
But it's possible?

647
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:51,910
Maybe.

648
00:35:52,714 --> 00:35:56,285
I've to go get the chelation equipment.
Bill, I need you to sign some forms.

649
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:06,580
You don't see what she's doing?

650
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:09,754
She's laying the groundwork
to get her treatment,

651
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:11,835
wake up
a completely different person,

652
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:15,631
So that you and all of your money
stay with her.

653
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:17,757
It's a lie.

654
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,344
You said there was a chance.

655
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:22,658
There's a teeny chance.

656
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:26,356
But even if it cures her,
It's not going to make her love you.

657
00:36:30,406 --> 00:36:31,956
I was happy before...

658
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:35,547
I know. And I'm sorry,

659
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,890
But it wasn't real.

660
00:36:39,191 --> 00:36:40,609
It felt real.

661
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:46,498
I don't know...

662
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,410
Maybe that can be enough.

663
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:02,536
You're really doing this for me?

664
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:06,312
Tax shelter.

665
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:10,602
I'll take some of that chili now.

666
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:18,652
- I can't accept this.
- Fine.

667
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:20,415
Forget the chili.

668
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:21,822
Bye, Wibberly.

669
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:24,941
I got an "A+" with your paper.

670
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:32,040
I was an orthopedic surgeon
for ten years at New York mercy.

671
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:34,292
I had a gambling problem.

672
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:37,228
I tried to cover it
by over-billing some medicate patients.

673
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:38,380
Lost my license.

674
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:40,396
That's why I'm here.

675
00:37:40,798 --> 00:37:41,958
Not because of you.

676
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,303
Why are you telling me this now?

677
00:37:47,313 --> 00:37:51,127
Because I thought you'd be the same
bastard you were in med school, but...

678
00:38:03,788 --> 00:38:04,722
Keep it.

679
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:06,575
No, I can get another place.

680
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,243
Just take it.

681
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,787
- I screwed you over.
- You got me an "A+".

682
00:38:11,178 --> 00:38:12,178
Take it.

683
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:15,959
Do I have to shove it down your throat?
Take the damn check!

684
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:43,820
Your vitals are up.

685
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:49,974
- Treatment's working?
- I'm not sure we can fix your liver,

686
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,602
but we can definitely
list you for a new one.

687
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,880
When you're better,
We're gonna take a long vacation.

688
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,960
You wanna go to vietnam, one of
the beaches, we're gonna get a hut.

689
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:02,558
Just you and me,
nothing to worry about.

690
00:39:07,184 --> 00:39:08,387
You're pathetic.

691
00:39:12,424 --> 00:39:13,249
What?

692
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:15,936
I mean, when you had a suspicion,
fine.

693
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,896
But you know now.

694
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,212
How can you be this pitiful?

695
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:22,985
You don't mean this.

696
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,476
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

697
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:28,648
I almost died and I still might.

698
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:30,701
And who knows, maybe it's
focusing my mind

699
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,983
because the idea of spending
the rest of my life with you...

700
00:39:52,488 --> 00:39:53,874
Why did you do that?

701
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,429
Because he's pathetic.

702
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:57,238
He hasn't changed...

703
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:04,026
But you have.

704
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:07,395
The treatment actually worked
on your brain.

705
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,532
If you were still a psychopath,
you would've just kept draining him dry.

706
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,168
- What do you want?
- You're feeling something.

707
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:14,853
What is it?

708
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:17,321
What do you feel?

709
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:22,992
I don't know.

710
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,230
It hurts.

711
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:36,539
It will.

712
00:40:53,899 --> 00:40:55,699
Heard about the diagnosis.

713
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:56,703
Nice job.

714
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:58,161
Thanks.

715
00:40:58,746 --> 00:41:00,340
Why are you here so late?

716
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:01,865
Discharge summary.

717
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,944
Taub's handwriting
isn't helping much.

718
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:07,889
Apparently on the third day
of admission, the patient underwent

719
00:41:08,414 --> 00:41:10,000
rabbit thumping.

720
00:41:15,113 --> 00:41:16,263
Radiotherapy.

721
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:23,429
Third day after admission,
patient underwent radiotherapy

722
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:27,029
including...
external beam radiation...

723
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,149
to treat b-cell lymphomas.

724
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,407
First treatment was...

725
00:41:40,795 --> 00:41:42,499
Full mantle therapy...
