1
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:39,250
Bring it up about six more feet.

2
00:00:40,553 --> 00:00:42,921
Okay, you can go ahead
and start dropping it.

3
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:13,187
Class is over.

4
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:15,930
What's going on? Who are you?

5
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:17,353
I'm a doctor.

6
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:19,601
Did you have a corneal transplant
5 years ago?

7
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:20,643
Yes.

8
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:23,813
Every patient who had a transplanted
organ from that donor is dead or dying.

9
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:25,796
You got a purse?

10
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,048
I feel fine.

11
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:32,642
I don't mean to scare you,
but so did the others.

12
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:38,536
House - Season 05 Episode 02
"Not a cancer"

13
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,454
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak.

14
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:02,395
www.house-fr.com

15
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:10,443
One living, one almost dead.

16
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,107
Four fully dead.

17
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:14,280
Nothing in common
except their donor.

18
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,082
Carl got a new heart and lung.

19
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,604
Liver kills him.

20
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:20,258
Tibalt got a new liver,
lung killed him.

21
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:22,831
Holly got a new kidney,
her heart blows up.

22
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:25,654
And Frank, the old guy
gasping for breath upstairs,

23
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:28,007
he got an intestinal graft,
his pancreas is failing.

24
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,934
All within eight months
of each other.

25
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:32,924
And in each case, serious complications
came on suddenly and without warning.

26
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:36,678
Which means arrhythmia, massive
pulmonary embolus, or cerebral bleed.

27
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:38,847
What did Wilson do for me?

28
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,708
If the donor had an infection
that somehow slipped by a screening,

29
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:47,856
- it could lay dormant.
- Five organ systems hit.

30
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:50,873
Would need five infections for it
to somehow slip by screening.

31
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:53,570
Oh, sure, he made me laugh
on a rainy day,

32
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,968
made me see the colors
I never knew...

33
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:57,655
None of the donated organs were hit.

34
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:59,574
Whatever they got is
from the donor's blood.

35
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:01,786
- That wouldn't help us narrow down.
- To who.

36
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:04,510
Corneal transplants are bloodless.
It means Apple's gonna be fine.

37
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,267
You secure enough in that theory
to send her home?

38
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:09,878
I guess we could wait till we figure out
what's wrong with Frank.

39
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:13,339
On the other hand...
Gilbert Gottfried makes me laugh.

40
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:15,124
And how many colors
are there really?

41
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:16,757
Once you got red, blue and green...

42
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:19,500
He paid for your lunch, liked monster
trucks, and was your conscience.

43
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,104
- Autoimmune disease.
- A.N.A.

44
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:22,765
Autopsy of all victims were normal.

45
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:24,282
Wouldn't cover vasculitis.

46
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:27,604
- Henoch-Schonlein purpura...
- Antiphospholipid antibodies, normal.

47
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:29,817
- Then that leaves cancer.
- Cancers have names.

48
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,442
They have a progression.
They affect specific organs.

49
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:34,569
Bone cancer can't turn into
liver cancer.

50
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:35,778
Forget cancer.

51
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:38,060
It's cancer.

52
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:40,282
It's not cancer.

53
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,903
You're right, of course.
What was I thinking?

54
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:45,346
No single type of cancer blew up
three organs in the chest

55
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,408
while also herniating
in the fighter's brain stem

56
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:49,723
- The fighter's irrelevant.
- You don't like coincidences.

57
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:51,975
It'd be a coincidence
if six transplant recipients

58
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,544
had nothing else wrong with them.

59
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:56,085
Like being an idiot, which leads
to getting your head knocked off.

60
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:57,355
The others had cancer.

61
00:04:57,475 --> 00:05:00,887
Four autopsies and about
1,000 lab tests say it's not cancer.

62
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:03,348
Redo the thousand tests
and the four autopsies.

63
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:05,686
Taub, Kutner, check out the donor.
Find out which cancer.

64
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,013
He didn't die of cancer. His head got
chopped off in an industrial accident.

65
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,980
Find out which cancer
would've killed him.

66
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,232
Check the home and
office for carcinogens, toxins.

67
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:16,486
He's been dead for four years. I guess
his home's been rented to someone else.

68
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:18,633
Find out which cancer killed them.

69
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,271
Did I forget you?

70
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:24,994
You can check out the patient's eye.

71
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,429
Put this on Dr. O'shea.

72
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:40,093
And some chips.

73
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,359
- Forget your wallet, House?
- No.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,429
I'll take care of it.

75
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:50,466
Check.

76
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,745
Are you following me?

77
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,073
Word is...

78
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,486
you're into monster trucks.

79
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:00,863
- My kids like it.
- But not you?

80
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:04,158
Predator's okay, but I think
the California crusher is overrated.

81
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,375
Are you checking me out?

82
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,043
You're astute.

83
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:16,549
No.

84
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:19,799
- How many pills did you just take?
- Vicodin, opioids,

85
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,291
some b12.

86
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,526
Need a little kick in the afternoon.

87
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,851
You got a problem with that?

88
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:28,725
I think I'm falling in love.

89
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:30,834
Her right eye's failing.

90
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,371
No, it's not.

91
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:35,148
Everyone else's transplanted organs
were fine. It means her eye is fine.

92
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:38,089
- We need to remove the eye.
- It's her only working eye.

93
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:40,803
We could remove the other one,
but since it's not killing her,

94
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:42,912
I thought this way was less insane.

95
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,363
Do you have some...

96
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:49,027
ethical problem with what I'm doing that
you could express in a unique way which

97
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:51,822
might  make me think that I'm wrong
even though I'll never admit it?

98
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:52,832
Yes.

99
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:55,272
You are funny.

100
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,983
The problem's not in her eye.
It's in her head.

101
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:02,341
You wanna come over, watch Prescription
Passion at my place tonight?

102
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:05,084
- You know I'm not gay, right?
- Neither am I.

103
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,513
If you don't want to have sex,
that's cool with me.

104
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:10,617
- I'm not coming over to your home.
- I'll grow on you.

105
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:15,939
L...

106
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:17,163
P...

107
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,333
E...

108
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,101
Do I have to be
in the same room as him?

109
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,023
Whatever he's got, you've got.

110
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,031
- Fifth line.
- Are you sure?

111
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,229
Pretty sure.

112
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:27,894
Fifth line.

113
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:32,406
Am I gonna die?

114
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,333
Can we talk about something
besides you for a moment?

115
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:37,001
Like maybe the fifth line?

116
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:40,474
F... E...

117
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,507
O... S... P.

118
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,090
Damn.

119
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:48,971
I'm sorry.
We need to remove your eye.

120
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:50,306
My eye?

121
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,433
A moment ago,
you thought you were dying.

122
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,257
Blind's actually good news.

123
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:56,079
Unfortunately, he's wrong.

124
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,527
- You just did the test.
- She didn't squint.

125
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,399
Which means
the eye thinks it's fine.

126
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,609
- It was wrong.
- I know. The eye doesn't think.

127
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,921
The brain thinks, which means if
the thinking's wrong, the brain's wrong.

128
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,745
Which means
it's spread to the brain,

129
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:10,201
which means it's too late for us
to remove the eye.

130
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:11,774
Which means...

131
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,831
We're gonna have to remove
your whole head.

132
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,265
Don't worry. It doesn't hurt.

133
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:24,805
Hallucination.

134
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,087
That's a brain thing, right?

135
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:30,599
500 different things
can cause hallucination.

136
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,152
Doesn't mean it's neurological.

137
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:35,519
It does if one of the other organ
recipients also had a brain issue.

138
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:39,030
- Did he just drop his hands?
- No, none of them had brain issues.

139
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,679
If his pupils dilated, if his pupils
were fixed, if there was a twitch...

140
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,597
He got hit in the head,
he died, no mystery.

141
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:47,591
- That was your point.
- Yesterday.

142
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,148
You live, you learn.

143
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:50,283
Who shot this?

144
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:52,034
Guy who runs the gym has a camera.

145
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:54,495
Uploads the nasty stuff online.

146
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:57,506
Can't see the dead guy's face.

147
00:08:57,783 --> 00:08:59,241
I can't see his face,

148
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,077
can't see the twitch,
can't see the pupils.

149
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:04,130
We know the tennis player
had a heart problem.

150
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,221
We can maybe tie that
to the tuba player's lungs,

151
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,469
and then somehow tie both those things,
to the construction worker's liver,

152
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:13,669
and then possibly meander over
to Frank's pancreatic failure, but

153
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:17,208
nothing causes simultaneous
brain and heart problems.

154
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:18,594
Cancer made no sense.

155
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:20,832
The head and heart
make less than no sense.

156
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:22,641
That makes no sense.

157
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:28,446
I know... I was making a point.

158
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,449
Oh, good.
I thought you were an idiot.

159
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:34,535
Why are you talking?

160
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,289
Oh, the guy doing manual labor
can't have an opinion?

161
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,211
I might be a genius
who just happens to have a passion

162
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:44,930
for fixing coffee machines.

163
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,758
No, I'm obviously not, but that's rude
to make assumptions about people.

164
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,226
Donor's history came up clean.

165
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:57,516
- Did he just laugh?
- No, no, I sneezed.

166
00:09:57,676 --> 00:09:59,727
He's a genius coffee repairman.

167
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:02,293
Coffee repairman
who wears argyle socks?

168
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:05,858
I thought I already talked
about not judging.

169
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:11,374
What kind of idiot wears argyle socks
with construction boots?

170
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:12,961
I'm not an idiot.

171
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,283
I'm just...

172
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:16,976
I'm not good at disguises.

173
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:19,626
Who is he?

174
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:22,166
He's apparently a very bad
private investigator.

175
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:24,502
Why is he pretending
to fix the coffee machine?

176
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:27,033
Because I wanted to find out
what you guys found out

177
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:28,973
before I find out what he found out.

178
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:31,588
So I can find out if I need
a private investigator.

179
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,193
So, nu?

180
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:36,522
There's no history
of unusual infections, no...

181
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:38,933
international travel
in the 12 months...

182
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:44,072
No, seriously, that's how I sneeze.

183
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:48,317
He was in Madrid and the Bahamas.

184
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:51,070
- Credit card receipts showed no...
- Girlfriend paid.

185
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,496
- There is no girlfriend.
- She was his high school sweetie.

186
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:55,284
She's married to his best friend.

187
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,333
I know.

188
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,861
She had a kid four years ago.

189
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:01,372
Timing fits.
She's still pretty hot though.

190
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:04,083
- You find out anything medical?
- The kid has a tummy ache.

191
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,862
Also, the dead guy
was exposed to mercury,

192
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:10,584
mold,
and hydrous perchloric acid because

193
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,005
their sex pad was next
to a garage that was demolished

194
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,765
after those toxins were found.

195
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:16,765
Oh, yeah, that will be

196
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:18,725
$2,300.

197
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:23,019
- I'll get you a check.
- No, I don't take checks.

198
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:25,521
- You think I'm gonna stop payment?
- Aren't you?

199
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:28,816
Of course, I am.
$2,300. That's insane.

200
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:31,186
Actually, that price includes
footage of the boxing

201
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:32,864
match from four different angles.

202
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,573
30% of the crowd paid by credit card.
I got their names.

203
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:38,576
Four of them had digital cameras,
which I composited like NASA did for

204
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:41,537
the pics of Mars.
You know, the rovers and all that.

205
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,002
Pupils were dilated.

206
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:50,646
He didn't drop his hands, which
means he maintained muscle tensity.

207
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:51,765
Say it.

208
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:53,347
You were right.

209
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:54,980
God, that was petty of me.

210
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,993
He maintained muscle tensity, but was
momentarily distracted when he got hit.

211
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:00,303
- That's a temporal lobe seizure.
- Does that P.I. guy

212
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:02,698
mean we don't have to break
into people's homes anymore?

213
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:05,742
It's why you went to medical school.
I'm not gonna take that away from you.

214
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,658
- He's better than we are.
- And costs more.

215
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:09,786
- Gonna biopsy the brain.
- No.

216
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:12,943
- Say it.
- You were right, but no.

217
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,864
Temporal lobe controls speech,
hearing, memory.

218
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:20,541
She loses those things, she's gonna be
a terrific date, but beyond that...

219
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:23,020
We cut out a piece of it,
good chance she's a vegetable.

220
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,013
Nothing to hear, nothing to say,
nothing to look back on.

221
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:28,590
You're right.
She has so much to live for.

222
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,706
Do we have another patient who's
almost finished with all their living?

223
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:35,049
So it's okay to stab
his brain because he's old?

224
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:38,685
No, it's okay to stab his brain
because he's dead if you don't.

225
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,115
Get the widow to say yes.

226
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:43,852
No.

227
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,645
The lung inflammation is a complication
of the pancreatic failure,

228
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,003
which is reversible.

229
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,690
This is actually his best chance.
If we can find out what's wrong...

230
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,950
How can a test
that will probably kill him?

231
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,278
- I didn't say.
- You said it was extremely risky.

232
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,741
- What does extremely mean?
- Please.

233
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,922
I'm sorry. I can't.

234
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,079
I have a husband.

235
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,165
I have a two-year-old daughter.
Her name is Julia.

236
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,114
You'd be saving her mother.

237
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:13,929
I think you're lying.

238
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,527
You haven't had one visitor.

239
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,790
Not one phone call since
you've been here. Does she have a child?

240
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:25,224
No. But her life is still worth...

241
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:28,477
- More than my husband's?
- I lied to save my life. Wouldn't you?

242
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:30,319
Not at another
human being's expense.

243
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,184
No, you'd just rob me
of my only chance

244
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,542
your husband can struggle
to breathe for a few more days.

245
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,625
Just shut up.
I don't want to hear from you.

246
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:38,571
You want to hate me
so you won't feel guilty.

247
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:39,655
Frank?

248
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:41,115
Give me a scalpel.

249
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:48,137
Charge.

250
00:13:58,302 --> 00:13:59,175
He's coding.

251
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:02,254
Clear.

252
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,203
Clear.

253
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:05,821
Clear.

254
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,024
Clear.

255
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:10,031
Clear.

256
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:11,907
Clear.

257
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:22,686
- Did you get the consent?
- No.

258
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:25,784
Tell Foreman to get it.
Old people are scared of black people.

259
00:14:25,944 --> 00:14:27,703
It won't matter. Patient's dead.

260
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:31,950
Save the brain.

261
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,960
Don't need consent for an autopsy.

262
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,409
Well, at best, we're gonna bat
one for six on this one.

263
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,354
Thin slices through the parietal
and temporal lobes were clean.

264
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,802
Occipital and frontotemporal
regions were also...

265
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,835
Brain's clean. Moving on.

266
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:11,199
To where? We've gone
from making no sense,

267
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:13,582
to making less sense,
and then taken a step backwards.

268
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:17,962
Each of these people were killed
by one thing that attacked one organ.

269
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:19,505
But never the same organ.

270
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,508
- The donor had two things wrong?
- Or six things wrong?

271
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:25,576
Metabolic diseases specialize.

272
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:27,115
Everything else specializes,

273
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,557
- but cancer plays the field.
- You're back to cancer?

274
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:32,601
Metastasis is just a fancy word
for screws around.

275
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:34,732
- Any type of cancer?
- I don't know.

276
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,355
There would be evidence of cancer.

277
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:38,177
There is.
We just haven't found it yet.

278
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:40,985
You need it to be cancer
so you have an excuse to talk to Wilson.

279
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:44,409
Give me something else that explains
this constellation of patients,

280
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,942
- then you can call me an ass.
- I didn't call you an ass.

281
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:48,611
Perforated intestine.

282
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:52,658
If this thing started as normal
bacteria living in the intestines

283
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:56,667
but got into a blood vessel through
a vascular anomaly in the bowel wall,

284
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,128
then they would affect every
organ through the blood stream.

285
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,422
It screws up everything.
For everyone.

286
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:07,344
It's a long shot,
it is possible I'm an ass.

287
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:11,114
Ironically, we need to do
a colonoscopy to confirm.

288
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:14,043
We checked apple inside and out
when she came in. She's clean.

289
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:16,947
The anomaly must be intermittent
or they would've died within a day.

290
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,439
She's getting abdominal pain,

291
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:21,126
shove a tube up her rear
before it can get away.

292
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,943
And test anyone else
with stomach pain.

293
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:25,443
- Everyone else is dead.
- Not everyone.

294
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:29,043
The one thing the donor gave
to each of these people is his DNA.

295
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:31,326
Anyone else have his DNA?

296
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:37,249
You want to do a colonoscopy
on a healthy four-year-old?

297
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:40,019
She has a tummy ache. If Kutner's right,
it's not a tummy ache,

298
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,010
it's a fatal brain or heart
or lung or liver or pancreas ache.

299
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,230
I'm not gonna scare the hell
out of the poor kid's mom

300
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,762
because of a long shot corollary
to a long shot theory.

301
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:52,134
Fine.

302
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,877
Tell her the truth.

303
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:57,563
Then ask if Daddy knows
who the real Daddy is.

304
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,911
Does she have to be awake?

305
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:16,918
We need her to tell us
when it hurts.

306
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,167
She'll get over it.

307
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:22,750
Your husband might not have.

308
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:32,350
What if a kid wants ice cream?

309
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,347
The sign outside says "closed".

310
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:36,777
Dr. O'shea's not right for you.

311
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:39,770
- What'd you find out?
- Why are you investigating him?

312
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:44,608
'Cause I need to know
if he lends money interest-free.

313
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,725
What did you find out?

314
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:48,946
I want some ice cream.

315
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,074
Not until you learn to read.

316
00:17:55,247 --> 00:17:57,482
- You're supposed to trust friends.
- I don't know the guy.

317
00:17:57,614 --> 00:17:59,586
- I got no logical reason...
- To be his friend?

318
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,504
Have you never seen
an after-school special?

319
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:03,711
That's part of the pleasure
of friendship: trusting

320
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,122
without absolute evidence
and then...

321
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:07,981
being rewarded for that trust.

322
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:11,142
You're taking pictures of a guy
who's having an affair with his sister.

323
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:13,262
And you're lecturing me
about the rewards of trust.

324
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:15,576
There are two types of people
that hire me.

325
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,565
Actually, there are three,

326
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:19,810
but the third's irrelevant
to the point I want to make.

327
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,095
You have a special rate plan
for being a pain in the ass?

328
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:24,060
One type wants to find out
that they're right,

329
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,733
the other type that they're wrong.

330
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:28,246
- Which type am I?
- You're the third type.

331
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:30,019
You lead with the irrelevant types?

332
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,619
The one that doesn't care


333
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:34,116
because they've hired me
to investigate the wrong person.

334
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:37,209
- That's an actual type?
- You want me to check out Wilson.

335
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,150
- You want to find out if...
- How do you know about Wilson?

336
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,676
What do I do for a living?

337
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,879
Have you been checking me out?

338
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:48,660
- I've been paying for that?
- So far, you haven't paid for anything.

339
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,329
You want to find out he's pining,

340
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:54,720
if there's something about him
that will tell you he's gonna come back

341
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,180
or something you can use
to make him come back.

342
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,071
Is there?

343
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:05,986
No, no, there's nothing.

344
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:08,776
Sorry.

345
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:15,610
That will be $900.

346
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,543
I gotta go. I'll get you a check.

347
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:35,803
Colonoscopy was clean.

348
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:37,638
Then that just leaves cancer.

349
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:40,724
The fact that the kid's colonoscopy
was negative doesn't prove anything.

350
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:44,086
Yes, the fact that it didn't prove
anything didn't prove anything.

351
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:45,165
Excellent point.

352
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,077
We don't know if the kid
inherited anything.

353
00:19:47,197 --> 00:19:49,942
Even if she did, Kutner's theory
is that the thing's intermittent.

354
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,277
The opening would have
to be open shortly before death.

355
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:55,106
Unfortunately, we can't know
when shortly before death is

356
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:58,116
until shortly after death.
And that seems like an obstacle.

357
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,410
What if there was a way
around that?

358
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:03,413
Then we're kind of all sweating
over nothing.

359
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,500
Not around death,
around death as an obstacle.

360
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,459
We need to see his colon
at work.

361
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,894
You do know
what death means, right?

362
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:13,459
Without a living system, there's not
enough pressure to get fluid.

363
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,676
Life we can't create, yet,
but pressure's easy.

364
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:21,014
We use the same high pressure water jet,
we use to test cardiac workload.

365
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:26,403
I mean, he's not gonna be awake
to tell us where it hurts...

366
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,167
- It's not gonna...
- Do it.

367
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:49,510
- It's kinda stuck.
- It's more than stuck.

368
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,348
The bowel's been dead
for six hours.

369
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,770
No matter what
you shoot up there, it's closed.

370
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:07,561
- This is nuts.
- It's adjustable.

371
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:13,817
It's working.

372
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:19,323
- Not much.
- Increase the pressure.

373
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:24,832
The endoscope's bowing.
Push on the stomach.

374
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:29,374
Those are normal bodily fluids.

375
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:31,293
Yeah, normal bodily sewage.

376
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:32,883
Put the pressure back on.

377
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,551
That's the end. No leaks.

378
00:21:40,406 --> 00:21:41,887
Wait. What's that?

379
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:45,130
- That's dark 'cause I'm at the end.
- What if you're not at the end?

380
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,050
What if it's a core lesion?

381
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,083
Maybe a little more pressure?

382
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:51,563
Not too much.
If it is the end and we...

383
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,978
It's finally accelerating.

384
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,205
Apple's heart rate
has become irregular.

385
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:02,950
Breathing is labored.

386
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,984
Colonoscopy's still showing
no leaks.

387
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,395
What if it is autoimmune?

388
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:09,725
What if we don't have
conversations we've already had?

389
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,960
Four out of the five didn't linger.
They got sick and died.

390
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,545
We don't have time to dismiss things
we've already dismissed.

391
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:16,880
Nothing fits.

392
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:19,893
See, that's an example
of a conversation we've already had.

393
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:21,885
She's sick. Something fits.

394
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,637
- MS?
- No!

395
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:28,363
From now on, no one says anything
unless no one's said it before.

396
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:40,654
- Where are you going?
- You guys start immuno-gels

397
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:43,991
on her CSF to look
for hidden protein markers.

398
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,159
Start sequencing her genes.
I start treatment.

399
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,795
- Treatment for what?
- Cancer.

400
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:49,830
It's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.

401
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,143
It's something.

402
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,880
Which means we should treat her
for something.

403
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,334
She's fine.

404
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:15,480
- Where's her chart?
- You rang emergency to get her chart?

405
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,920
I know. That was bad of me.

406
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,029
But I'm sure the chart must be
attached to the bed

407
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,583
so that gimp doctors don't have
to look all over the place

408
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:23,147
while patients die.

409
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:29,870
Thank you so much.

410
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:32,873
And some peppermint tea
when you get a chance.

411
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,976
I need you to sign something.

412
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,846
Consent to chemotherapy.

413
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,332
You found cancer?

414
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:50,256
Then,

415
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,225
- you have tests indicating...
- Nope.

416
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:54,816
- Then why should I sign it?
- That's a good question.

417
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,527
It deserves a complicated answer.

418
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,540
Placebo effect.

419
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:03,779
People have confidence in doctors,

420
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,223
they have confidence in diagnoses,
confidence in medicine.

421
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:10,702
Sometimes they get a little better
just because they think they will.

422
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:13,933
And that can make us think that
the wrong answer is the right answer.

423
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:15,540
Which is very bad.

424
00:24:17,062 --> 00:24:19,924
So you do have proof
that it's cancer

425
00:24:20,613 --> 00:24:22,538
but you can't tell me
because it might affect

426
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:24,382
the way I react to the medicine?

427
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,810
If that were true, and it would
certainly make sense,

428
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:30,358
do you think I could tell you
that it's true?

429
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:42,901
I was practically blind
before the transplant.

430
00:24:44,145 --> 00:24:45,445
2200 vision.

431
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:47,989
Didn't you cover all this
personal stuff with Dr. Foreman?

432
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,243
You don't care who I used to be?

433
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:54,280
You're a post-corneal transplant
math teacher.

434
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,082
I deduced that you were
a blind math teacher.

435
00:24:58,389 --> 00:24:59,584
I was an architect.

436
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,454
You gave up architecture
after you could see?

437
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:09,553
The world was ugly.

438
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:15,568
You think the world would be
any different if your leg was fine?

439
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:21,148
Think you'd be any different
if your leg was fine?

440
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:23,252
I mean,

441
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:26,363
the doctors told me that my life
was gonna be so much better

442
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,780
once I could see.

443
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:30,155
I would date,
I would dance,

444
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:32,033
but...

445
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:35,787
the guys I hated dancing with before
I hate dancing with after.

446
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:38,290
My parents were still dead.

447
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:40,343
I was still alone.

448
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,796
- You're fun.
- You don't seem all that different.

449
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:51,414
I haven't given up.

450
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:58,268
Wilson's got a new job,
hasn't started yet, but...

451
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,521
- So who are we following?
- See that lady up there?

452
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,757
- You point at the target?
- No.

453
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:07,027
No, I'm following the one halfway
in between that point and that point.

454
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,400
Pretty.

455
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:13,705
Who hired you?

456
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:15,412
No one. I just like her.

457
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:17,521
- You're stalking her?
- No.

458
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:20,112
I followed her out
of that bookstore back there.

459
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:22,792
You are stalking her,
just not for very long.

460
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:26,247
So what else can you tell me
that I might care about?

461
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:29,428
He attends this grief counseling
thing twice a week

462
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,407
where they go around the room
and cry about who's dead.

463
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:35,564
Cameron's been to his house
several times, they...

464
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:38,850
talk about death
and losing loved ones.

465
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:53,466
What...
What are you...

466
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:57,786
If she turns her head, she's gonna see
that we're walking the wrong direction.

467
00:26:57,906 --> 00:27:00,074
No, she won't.
I'm very nondescript.

468
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,666
- I'm not.
- Then you stay four feet behind me.

469
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:05,138
How do you know
what they're talking about?

470
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:07,536
I'm in the same
grief counseling group.

471
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:09,172
I recently lost my mother.

472
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:12,328
You'd get laid more often
if you told them you lost a kid.

473
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:13,847
I didn't lose a kid.

474
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,470
You're a P.I. who can't lie?

475
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:18,861
I can lie.
I'm just not all that good at it.

476
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:21,572
Dr. Cuddy's been over
to Wilson's twice

477
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:24,590
and phoned a bunch of times.
Foreman called him.

478
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:27,942
And the rest of the time
Wilson's been reading meditation books

479
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:30,196
and magazines
about restoring barns.

480
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:31,861
Are you following me?

481
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:34,179
Are you lying?

482
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:37,617
Lesson one:
commit.

483
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:39,624
It's making me uncomfortable.

484
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:40,929
Sorry.

485
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:44,666
You're very pretty.

486
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,743
More uncomfortable.

487
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:48,985
She's not your type.

488
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:51,408
Your type is much stupider
than her.

489
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,801
- What did Wilson say about me?
- You've never come up.

490
00:27:56,494 --> 00:27:58,276
In the grief counseling
or in the other...

491
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,932
Anywhere, I got three bugs
in his home and one in his car.

492
00:28:01,236 --> 00:28:04,291
If I didn't know you, I wouldn't even
know you existed.

493
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:05,899
Which is good news.

494
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,357
Only two things you ignore...

495
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,212
Things that aren't important
and things you wish weren't important,

496
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:11,934
and wishing never works.

497
00:28:26,891 --> 00:28:28,834
- She's better.
- I can tell at once.

498
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,670
Vomiting's a side effect of the chemo.

499
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,131
Her heart rate's stabilized,
breathing's good.

500
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,425
Amylase and triglycerides
are both coming down.

501
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:37,092
I guess it's working.

502
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:39,554
Can't believe it.
It's cancer.

503
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:41,786
It's not cancer.

504
00:28:51,726 --> 00:28:53,610
Labs show that our patient is healthier.

505
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:57,155
She's gonna get sicker.
Then she's gonna die.

506
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:58,864
I brought thai food.

507
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:00,809
- What did you see in her?
- Nothing.

508
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,127
It's not cancer.
All the tests say it's not cancer.

509
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:06,121
- They've always said it's not cancer.
- Treatment proves it's cancer.

510
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:09,125
Treatment proves it could be cancer.
It's not cancer.

511
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:10,794
This was your diagnosis.

512
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:13,255
- I never thought it was cancer.
- You treated for cancer.

513
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,382
I thought that what
she had acted like cancer.

514
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,686
If it acts like cancer,
maybe it'll respond like cancer.

515
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,134
It did.
'cause it's cancer.

516
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:23,306
We have to find something that
walks like cancer, talks like cancer,

517
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:26,017
tastes like cancer, but isn't cancer.

518
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:27,142
No, we don't.

519
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:28,833
Better is better.
Who cares why?

520
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:29,689
I do.

521
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,939
And so does tetrault.

522
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,440
Who?

523
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,359
The dead tuba player.

524
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,359
Tibalt.

525
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:39,254
The point is, he died last, but he died.

526
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:40,824
Which means she's gonna die too.

527
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:42,793
Tibalt wasn't receiving
cancer medication.

528
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:45,495
There's a cancer drug that's
used off-label for arthritis.

529
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:48,706
- There's no record of arthritis.
- You interviewed all the tuba students?

530
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:50,708
With pain in his hands,
he can't play.

531
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:53,471
- Then it wasn't in his hands.
- So why do we care about his students?

532
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,907
One of them is canadian.

533
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,597
Brought him methotrexate
so he could hide his arthritis.

534
00:29:57,717 --> 00:29:59,342
Already couldn't afford his insurance.

535
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:02,512
And that little piece of business
cost me $700.

536
00:30:02,672 --> 00:30:04,806
I'll pass it on to
the patient with a steep mark-up.

537
00:30:05,108 --> 00:30:06,516
This makes no sense.

538
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:07,986
I know.

539
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:11,124
She's dead unless we
can find what's cancer...

540
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:13,565
but not cancer.

541
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,867
Something's missing.

542
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:29,194
I need an epiphany.

543
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:34,919
What are you billing out at?
$300 an hour?

544
00:30:35,686 --> 00:30:36,588
Here's four.

545
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:38,422
There are other oncologists.

546
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:40,550
Better oncologists.
But I need you.

547
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:48,892
Let me describe the symptoms,
problems, issues,

548
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:50,642
and say whatever you feel like saying,

549
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:52,604
until something triggers
an idea in my head.

550
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,445
- That's not the way it works.
- You have a way of thinking things.

551
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:59,002
It's sloppy, it's undisciplined,
it's not very linear.

552
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:00,319
It complements mine.

553
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,780
It drives me down avenues
that I wouldn't otherwise...

554
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,611
- Please go away.
- Cancer, but not cancer.

555
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:08,828
Responds to cancer treatment,
but there's no...

556
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:15,895
How are you?

557
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,085
Don't do this.
Please.

558
00:31:19,813 --> 00:31:20,924
Please.

559
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:22,634
Don't do this.

560
00:31:23,177 --> 00:31:24,677
I'm trying to move on.

561
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:28,389
By hanging out with Cameron,

562
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:31,851
talking to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me.

563
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,195
I paid a private
investigator to spy on you.

564
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:45,458
You didn't.

565
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,034
You wanna move on from me,
you got to deal with me, talk to me.

566
00:31:48,194 --> 00:31:49,536
You had no right...

567
00:31:49,696 --> 00:31:52,401
We're not friends anymore.
There's no trust to be breached.

568
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:56,334
I can have you followed,
I can call you names, tell your secrets.

569
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:00,767
Foreman did a CT.

570
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:03,776
Temporal and frontoparietal
regions are normal.

571
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:05,173
Occipital lobe, normal.

572
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:07,948
I have the right to
walk away from you, House.

573
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:10,196
There's a world beyond you.

574
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:13,155
You need to realize that,
and even if you don't...

575
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:14,978
I'm moving on.

576
00:32:15,662 --> 00:32:18,229
The next time you knock,
i'm not answering.

577
00:32:22,842 --> 00:32:24,680
Nothing yet.
Keep talking.

578
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:36,416
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,253
You charge me for listening
in on my own conversations?

580
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:42,450
Yeah, why wouldn't i?

581
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,799
- How many friends do you have?
- 17.

582
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:46,654
Seriously?

583
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:48,345
You have a list?

584
00:32:48,465 --> 00:32:51,168
No, I knew this conversation
was really about you, so I just...

585
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:53,998
gave you an answer so you could get back
to your train of thought.

586
00:32:54,118 --> 00:32:55,403
Well done.

587
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:57,311
I have one.
Had one.

588
00:32:57,473 --> 00:32:58,645
Friends are important.

589
00:32:58,765 --> 00:33:00,472
- You're gonna miss...
- Shut up.

590
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:03,026
Friends allow you to
not sit in a room by yourself.

591
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,972
- Are you charging me for this?
- Are we friends?

592
00:33:06,092 --> 00:33:07,363
- No.
- Then yes.

593
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:09,525
Do you wanna be my friend?

594
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:11,067
No. You scare me a little.

595
00:33:11,187 --> 00:33:13,639
He thinks if he's not a friend,
he can't talk to me. We can talk,

596
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,887
- we can be two human beings talking...
- I'm with him.

597
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,248
Didn't mean to interrupt.

598
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,528
Yes, you did.
I was in the middle of a sentence.

599
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:22,295
Yes, I did.
You're repeating yourself.

600
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:23,930
I'm grateful.
Make your point.

601
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,591
It's like that "cancer, but not cancer"
thing you were talking about.

602
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:28,050
Friends are friends,

603
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,762
customers are customers,
and everything else is everything else.

604
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,218
If it's not, nothing's nothing.

605
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:38,617
And anything can be anything.

606
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:43,775
10:10. Stop the clock.

607
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:44,810
What?

608
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,705
The world is not as
ugly as she thinks it is.

609
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,453
Cancer, but not cancer.

610
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:00,204
Doesn't make any sense unless...

611
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,877
Brain, but not brain.

612
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:04,660
Occipital lobe's normal.

613
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,215
But her eyes suck.
That lobe should be compensating.

614
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,411
Since it's not,

615
00:34:08,531 --> 00:34:11,350
that tells me that something's in there
that shouldn't be in there.

616
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,428
Brain,

617
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:14,222
but not brain.

618
00:34:14,382 --> 00:34:15,654
Why are you in my office?

619
00:34:15,774 --> 00:34:18,914
To find the anomaly,
I need to chop off the top of her head.

620
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,853
Pretty sure I need
your approval for that.

621
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,898
I'm gonna trust your first instinct.

622
00:34:24,058 --> 00:34:26,317
I'm not usually confused
when you say things like that.

623
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:29,737
I'm ordering her cancer
treatment to be continued.

624
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:34,282
Why does it cost $2,300
to fix a coffee machine?

625
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:36,274
Cancer stem cells are real.

626
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:38,240
They explain everything.

627
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,957
They're like embryonic stem cells.
They become whatever they want.

628
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:43,663
Donor had them, the recipients got them.

629
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:45,613
They floated around,
they landed on an organ,

630
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,979
got bathed in cytomes
and partially differentiated.

631
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:49,674
And the key word there is partially.

632
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:52,844
In the tuba player,
they became lung, but not lung.

633
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:54,983
In the tennis player...
Heart, but not heart.

634
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:56,973
Stop me if you've
figured out the pattern.

635
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,632
They looked as if they belonged,
but they weren't doing their jobs.

636
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:01,436
And when they were really needed, boom.

637
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:04,976
Chemo worked because
cells are basically tumors.

638
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:06,440
Chemo shrunk them.

639
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:10,778
You're still gonna say no, aren't you?

640
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:12,192
You've no proof.

641
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:14,755
- I have the brain scan.
- The normal brain scan.

642
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:16,826
This is why I need to take off her head.

643
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:19,686
- To treat or to prove you're right?
- To treat.

644
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,165
Chemo's not killing anything.

645
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,067
It's just hiding the real problem.
She's gonna crash.

646
00:35:25,187 --> 00:35:28,086
If we wait until she does crash,
it might be too late.

647
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,253
So the next step is what?

648
00:35:31,373 --> 00:35:34,092
I say no, and then you do something
to make her crash

649
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:36,512
so that I'll think you've proven
your theory?

650
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:39,061
- I would never do that.
- No, you won't.

651
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:46,521
You might want to check her I.V.

652
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,796
from here,

653
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:52,023
it looks like saline instead of chemo.

654
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,650
Yeah, they look identical.

655
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,777
Still.
You should probably check.

656
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:01,365
You switched her meds?

657
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:03,451
How could i?
I had no access.

658
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:06,245
- Close her back up.
- Do the surgery.

659
00:38:06,878 --> 00:38:09,332
- There's no reason to...
- No reason not to.

660
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:11,834
The stupidly dangerous
part is already over with.

661
00:38:11,994 --> 00:38:14,029
We're ready with the neural net.

662
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:37,518
Is that someone's brain?

663
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:40,430
Except for the part that isn't brain.

664
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:48,034
Hey, that's the patient I...

665
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:51,248
you said she'd be fine.

666
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:52,917
I'm a better liar than you are.

667
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:54,435
I swapped her meds.

668
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,337
I mean, she's got a brain problem.
I coulda killed her.

669
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:00,633
The neural net...

670
00:39:00,794 --> 00:39:03,219
will show us how fast
her neurons are firing.

671
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:05,792
If there's something in the way, say...

672
00:39:05,912 --> 00:39:07,264
brain that's not brain,

673
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:10,851
the normal neural impulses
will be sucked into a vortex

674
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:13,166
because they're not able
to do their job.

675
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:17,080
The computer will then process it
and give us a picture of where to cut.

676
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,442
Cool.

677
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:20,541
Excuse me?

678
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:23,105
Sorry, I thought that's
what you wanted to hear.

679
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:25,917
You think all this is amazingly cool.

680
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:29,953
And you have no one else,
so you're paying a guy to listen.

681
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:33,708
Sorry... Just trying
to save you some cash.

682
00:39:33,868 --> 00:39:35,981
- I'm on the clock.
- Why wouldn't you be?

683
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,379
You think this is interesting to me?

684
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:41,458
I see it.

685
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,968
- Can you get it?
- I think so.

686
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:46,227
Turns out you didn't kill her.

687
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:47,850
Cool.

688
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:50,558
You owe me $5,000.

689
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:08,738
Why are you just standing there,
dr. House?

690
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:13,784
How'd you know who it is?

691
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:15,967
I can smell you.

692
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,296
Like you're a field of roses.

693
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,053
Peppermint tea.

694
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:29,764
You ever hear of the boy who cried wolf?

695
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:31,801
Never really bought that.

696
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:34,226
I don't care how often a kid cries

697
00:40:34,386 --> 00:40:37,203
he's being eaten by a wolf,
mom's gonna come running.

698
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:43,039
The world is ugly.

699
00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:46,113
People kill.

700
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:47,940
They go hungry.

701
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:53,913
Just proving a point.

702
00:40:59,327 --> 00:41:02,546
- People are asses.
- Why are you telling me this stuff?

703
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:05,299
Because the world is not
as ugly as you think it is.

704
00:41:05,808 --> 00:41:08,718
Your transplanted cornea's fine,
your eye is fine,

705
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:10,903
but your brain wasn't working right.

706
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:14,445
I'm gonna take the
gauze off your eyes now.

707
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:17,184
- It's gonna be bright.
- I know.

708
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:19,438
The brain cells that weren't brain cells

709
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,033
were in the way of processing
visual information correctly.

710
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:26,778
After the transplant,
you could see, but not see.

711
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:29,114
I could see.
I could read.

712
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:32,765
Yeah, but it was dull,
or foggy, or gray.

713
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:34,414
I don't know.

714
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:38,082
What I do know is that you were not
seeing what everyone else was seeing.

715
00:41:38,603 --> 00:41:39,776
And now?

716
00:41:40,576 --> 00:41:41,983
Things are gonna be...

717
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:44,839
Beautiful?

718
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:47,550
Things'll be what they are.

719
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,734
How do I look?

720
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:16,002
You look sad.

721
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,637
Hey.

722
00:42:41,357 --> 00:42:43,631
Is there any way I could put you
on retainer?

723
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,336
