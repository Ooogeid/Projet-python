1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:03,939
The trick to onions...
cut them in half lengthwise,

2
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:05,775
but leave the roots on.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,798
Then make your vertical slices.

4
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:13,763
Need a dozen.
Think you can handle this?

5
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,742
A dozen is 12, right?

6
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,726
Next, we add mustard greens...

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,729
spicy, and they pack a nice punch.

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,050
Plus, they're really good for you.

9
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,942
Improve mental function,

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,902
protect against
rheumatoid arthritis.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,742
Even inhibit
certain types of cancer.

12
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:33,908
Are you going to chop those onions
or give them a thai massage?

13
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:36,994
Well, i guess a happy ending
is out of the question.

14
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:39,801
I don't recall adding
making snide remarks

15
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:41,496
to your list of duties.

16
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:43,626
Just taking initiative.

17
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,879
Secret ingredient:
porcini mushrooms.

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,715
You want to reconstitute
them in a bowl of water.

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,809
You also want to hire an assistant

20
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:53,886
who can stay focused for
longer than 30 seconds.

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,673
- Why don't I hear you chopping?
- Just give me a second.

22
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,255
- You're kidding me, right?
- So sorry.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,936
Are you OK?
You want to sit down?

24
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,271
My lips are blue. Cyanosis.

25
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:08,609
Pain in my back and chest.
Spontaneous pneumothorax.

26
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,611
- What are you talking about?
- I'm a doctor.

27
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,488
- You are?
- And I need a doctor.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,206
House - Season 05 Episode 14
"The Greater Good"

29
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:29,230
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

30
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:47,606
www.house-fr.com

31
00:02:02,203 --> 00:02:03,164
You drool.

32
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:05,224
Shut up.

33
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:06,685
I know gas is expensive,
but i could've given you a ride.

34
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,816
- Elevator's broken.
- It was fine

35
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,413
when I came up from admitting.

36
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,526
Dana miller, the cancer researcher.

37
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,779
- Spontaneous pneumothorax.
- Awfully thin file.

38
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,032
- She just got admitted.
- Lots of things can cause pneumothorax.

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,785
Why don't we let eight or ten
other doctors rule out the boring stuff?

40
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,275
We wanna take this case.
She's maybe 5 or 10 years away

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,884
from curing retinoblastoma.

42
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:29,342
Which would make this
case attractive to anyone

43
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,118
who has some vested interest
in people curing the incurable.

44
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:34,609
She hasn't suffered from COPD.
She doesn't smoke.

45
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:36,197
She hasn't been scuba diving.

46
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:38,676
O2 sats are low even
after chest tube insertion.

47
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,184
Pneumothorax could be
secondary to a bunch of things.

48
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:43,175
Cystic fibrosis, lung cancer.

49
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,934
Or, to be slightly more optimistic,

50
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,092
late-onset asthma triggered
by an unknown allergen.

51
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:49,270
- We have a case?
- Did you just get to work?

52
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:50,646
Am I in trouble?

53
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,149
- Did you take the elevators up?
- Yes.

54
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:56,360
So, steroids for asthma?

55
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,314
Yeah.

56
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,300
Do a CT looking for
hyperinflation to confirm.

57
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:11,196
I thought my hospital was high-tech.
I'd have to wait all day for a CT.

58
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:14,753
- Dr. House gets a few perks.
- He has his own scanner?

59
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:18,674
No, just very loose interpretations
of hospital procedure.

60
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,642
- I appreciate the extra effort, but...
- Our gift to society.

61
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,135
We want to get you back to
work as soon as possible.

62
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,842
Well, i'm not working.

63
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,093
At least not as a doctor.

64
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,060
I quit.

65
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:32,213
I left eight months ago.

66
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,316
You mean, like, a sabbatical?

67
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,193
I had a uterine myoma. Benign.

68
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:41,191
But it ruptured
and I needed emergency surgery.

69
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:43,185
I was lying there
on the table thinking,

70
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,534
"I can't die now.
I haven't been happy yet."

71
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:50,500
Couldn't you just buy an overpriced
german sports car, or have an affair?

72
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:54,111
My sports car is doing
what I want when I want.

73
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,491
Now I'm learning how to run a kitchen
from one of the best chefs in New York.

74
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,342
You're washing pots
and smashing garlic?

75
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,385
Smashing garlic makes me happy.

76
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,764
Before that it was eight years
studying, 12 years in that lab.

77
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:10,601
It was always what I was supposed to do,
and never what I wanted to do.

78
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,760
Come here. Look at this.

79
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,241
Come here.

80
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,415
Adorable. Elevators keep crashing.

81
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:37,211
- Is mercury in retrograde or what?
- Elevators can be capricious.

82
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,883
Sometimes it just seems
like they're out to get you.

83
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:42,925
She keeps playing with the blanket.
Why would she do that?

84
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:46,595
Why do you think the elevators
would be out to get me?

85
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,773
I don't know.

86
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,090
Maybe they wanted to take time off
to spend with their little dumbwaiter.

87
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,946
But they the had to leave it
at home with an elevator sitter

88
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,547
because you drove the
replacement elevator to quitting

89
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:01,360
because you're incapable of
listening to anybody but me.

90
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,070
That's just a theory.

91
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,233
You're wrong.
I don't even listen to you.

92
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:08,367
Either do your job or go home.
Leave me out of it.

93
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,078
I am gonna do my job.
It doesn't mean I have to do it happily.

94
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:13,414
Doesn't mean I have to
do it without resentment.

95
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,916
It definitely doesn't mean
I have to do it without seeking

96
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,918
vengeance on the person
making me be here.

97
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,142
Congratulations.

98
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,755
You've officially dragged
me down to your level.

99
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,901
Okay.

100
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,576
Hey, blue.

101
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,376
It's not asthma.

102
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:01,240
Lung volume is normal.

103
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:03,922
She did have a uterine myoma
removed eight months ago.

104
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,809
Central line IV could have made a hole
near the lung that slowly expanded.

105
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,936
No pleural thickening.

106
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:13,422
- I can't believe she quit.
- People have the right to be happy.

107
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:15,834
I saw a four-year-old
with retinoblastoma

108
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,654
on my oncology rotation.

109
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,767
The cancer had eaten through
her eye and into her brain.

110
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:23,401
Horrible diseases exist.
It doesn't mean people

111
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,294
should give up
recreational anything.

112
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:26,700
Why not? Big picture...

113
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:29,175
I don't care if Jonas Salk's life
is a miserable shell.

114
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,866
I just want him to cure polio.

115
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:32,860
You can't live your life
"big picture."

116
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,269
You've gotta look out for yourself
and people you care about.

117
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:37,776
Why are you a doctor?
Why aren't you sitting by a pool in fiji

118
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:39,208
knocking back mai tais?

119
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,293
People act in their
own self-interests.

120
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,587
You're all here because
you're happy to be here.

121
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,755
- At least `cause it's your best option.
- I'm here `cause I want to help people.

122
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,719
No, you're here because
it makes you feel good to help people.

123
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,475
Taub and Foreman are here because
they've got no other viable choices.

124
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
And Thirteen is desperate to make
her life matter before it's over.

125
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,438
- So... you're happy to be here?
- Does it show?

126
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:05,109
Are those... increased
interstitial markings?

127
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,071
- Could be pulmonary fibrosis.
- Do a biopsy.

128
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:18,545
"You've got to look out for
the people you care about."

129
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,241
That wouldn't have anything to do
with you screwing your clinical trial

130
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,629
by slipping Thirteen
the real drug, would it?

131
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,465
You said that would be stupid.

132
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,842
Does she know?

133
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:32,469
Because Jonas Salk
would not approve.

134
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:34,867
There's nothing to know.

135
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:42,987
Got it?

136
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:48,735
- Good?
- Yep.

137
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:52,097
- You okay?
- Just a headache.

138
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:54,658
- I took some ibuprofen, but...
- Where's the pain: front or back?

139
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:55,826
Front.

140
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:58,454
Why are there never any interesting
pictures on these cards?

141
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,624
- They should make a dirty version.
- Sharp pain, or more of a throbbing...

142
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,712
Relax, it's not a side effect.
People get headaches.

143
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,089
True, but I can get you an MRI.

144
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,214
If I'm on the drug, it's been weeks.

145
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,303
It's not like something's
going to suddenly crop up now.

146
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,445
First card.

147
00:09:19,697 --> 00:09:21,742
Train, duck...

148
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:25,147
You can't remember?

149
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:26,778
Piano.

150
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,716
We need a biopsy to confirm...

151
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:34,865
You need an open-lung biopsy
to confirm pulmonary fibrosis.

152
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:38,619
That's invasive surgery.
I'd be out of commission for weeks.

153
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,595
No offense, but you're not working.
What does it matter

154
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,012
if you spend time in bed?

155
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:45,125
Doesn't mean
I don't have places to go.

156
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,045
I've got my book group, piano
lessons, cooking classes.

157
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,421
They make me happy.

158
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,839
A warm apple fritter makes me happy.
It doesn't fulfill me as a person.

159
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:55,442
- And working here does?
- If it didn't, I'd have found a way

160
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,852
- to go back to tucking tummies.
- Well, good for you.

161
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,849
If your job fulfills you and
makes you happy, that's rare.

162
00:10:01,526 --> 00:10:03,296
I didn't say I was happy.

163
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:05,944
I loved being a plastic surgeon.

164
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,300
The money, the lifestyle.

165
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:10,981
And in a lot of ways
this job stinks.

166
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:13,362
I'm making five bucks, I'm
always annoyed...

167
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:17,036
- But...
- You can look yourself in the mirror

168
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,576
and think
"I did something worth while today."

169
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:21,793
Exactly.

170
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,013
That's important.
And i do miss that.

171
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:26,258
But...

172
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:29,044
it just wasn't enough anymore.

173
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,343
That doesn't feel right.

174
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:37,678
Sit up.

175
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,097
Oh, that's weird.

176
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:44,977
What is it? Ascites?

177
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:51,692
Your belly's full of blood.

178
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:58,573
First her lung deflates,
like me after a cold shower.

179
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:01,727
Now her liver starts to
bleed, like me after...

180
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:08,000
You okay?

181
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,585
Great.

182
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,675
Just practicing my
clown college audition.

183
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,716
Someone set a trip wire.

184
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:20,679
- We were with the patient whole time.
- We were in the grc.

185
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:22,498
Lung, liver, go.

186
00:11:22,623 --> 00:11:24,725
Shouldn't you be obsessing
over who did this to you?

187
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,853
Nope... anybody bother
mriing our patient's liver for tumors?

188
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:31,273
No tumors, no
cysts, no clear etiology.

189
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,632
If you're not obsessing,

190
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,876
you must have already
figured it out.

191
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:37,607
Yes.

192
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:39,785
So I'm obsessing about
why you're not obsessing

193
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,159
about why our patient's
liver suddenly sprang a leak.

194
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:46,079
There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe.
Could be a granuloma.

195
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:49,286
Erodes into the hepatic artery,
causes the bleed.

196
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:52,659
- What caused the granuloma?
- Blastomycosis.

197
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:54,755
Could have been
asymptomatic for months.

198
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,954
It hits her lungs,
we give her steroids.

199
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,308
It blossoms and attacks her liver.

200
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:02,286
Get a piece of her lung,
stick it under a black light.

201
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:05,599
If it glows, sick children who need
her souffles can breathe easier.

202
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,810
Again?

203
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:17,903
- You have a problem.
- I told you, i didn't...

204
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,800
then you really have a problem.

205
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:22,712
They way she turned her
head to look at the MRI...

206
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:25,071
I think she's losing
her peripheral vision.

207
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,079
Because she turned her head?

208
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,541
I'm happy for you.

209
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,165
A love so deep you're ready
to chuck your medical license

210
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,942
to give her powerful, unproven drugs
with dangerous side effects.

211
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,405
I don't want to make any assumptions
about your feelings for me, but

212
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,468
I do have a birthday coming up.

213
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:56,408
I hear cuddy's seal training
finally came in handy.

214
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,043
Should I be investing
in a flak jacket?

215
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:00,612
You're safe.

216
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:02,723
No carpet bombing?

217
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,538
No burning of dresden
to teach her a lesson?

218
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,366
Since you're incapable
of taking the high road,

219
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,391
I assume there's some deeper,
more long-term strategy in effect.

220
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:15,385
Cuddy's not playing games.

221
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,357
She's not looking for leverage.

222
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,923
She wants pure,
unadulterated vengeance.

223
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,759
And your counter-move
is to let her have it?

224
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,299
The only time to strike back
is when i want something.

225
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:27,964
All I want now is to get
things back to normal.

226
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,088
Which i can't get by escalating.

227
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:32,234
The only way to win
this war is to lose it.

228
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,241
Let her punch herself out.

229
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:37,168
Yeah, that makes sense too.

230
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:38,922
"Too"?

231
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:42,647
I was thinking you actually feel guilty
about taking her away from her baby.

232
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:44,990
Your explanation's good too.

233
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,780
It's completely inconsistent
with your character, but...

234
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,080
Thank you, rationalization man.
You have saved the village.

235
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,592
You wanna eat?

236
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,000
You forgot your file.

237
00:13:58,351 --> 00:13:59,617
Dana miller?

238
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:01,965
The cancer researcher?

239
00:14:02,394 --> 00:14:03,467
Not anymore.

240
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,690
Dr. Miller, I doubt
if you'll remember me...

241
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:18,482
James Wilson, right? Chicago.
The adenocarcinoma conference.

242
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,950
Impressive.

243
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:24,718
- You want some cortisone for that itch?
- Liver failure.

244
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,823
Itching is one of
the lovely side effects.

245
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:30,410
Why did you quit?

246
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,746
The worst thing is
is now every time I get sick,

247
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:35,749
I have to listen
to a dozen people judge me.

248
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,639
Do you want me to congratulate you?

249
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,058
I've got four kids in ped-onc
right now who are gonna die.

250
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:45,008
Three of them within a year,
the other in a few days, probably.

251
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:46,850
Breakthroughs will happen.

252
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:49,596
With or without me,
someone will find the answer.

253
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,813
Maybe.

254
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,303
I... I...

255
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,102
I'm in the trenches.

256
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,350
I'm... I'm doing triage
as best I can.

257
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,106
You had the chance to end the war.

258
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:04,524
How is someone like me
supposed to keep fighting

259
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:06,445
when someone like you just...

260
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,948
Walked away?

261
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:11,130
When I left my job,

262
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:13,370
a lot of people were furious
with me.

263
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:16,591
It was easier to be angry than
to admit they weren't happy.

264
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,878
That they were stuck in a rut somewhere
in their lives, unable to move forward.

265
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:25,374
What's your rut?

266
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:39,992
Okay, you're freaking me out.

267
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,265
Do you think we should have kids?

268
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,400
- We've had this conversation.
- Ten years ago.

269
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,327
Things change.

270
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,047
On our third date I told you
that I didn't want to have kids,

271
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,194
and you said that
you were okay with that.

272
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,167
I said it because
I wanted to sleep with you.

273
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,472
And then I fell in love with you.

274
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:06,685
And I realized that I really
could be okay with it.

275
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:11,553
It wasn't like I had this
burning desire to have children.

276
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:13,805
God, have you been
resenting me all this time?

277
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,447
- Is that why...
- No.

278
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:17,573
Of course not.

279
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,540
I'm just...

280
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,606
I'm just... revisiting.

281
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,033
This isn't

282
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:29,613
a whim for me.

283
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:32,179
It's not a decision
that I made lightly.

284
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:34,356
Don't you ever wonder
what it would be like?

285
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:35,631
All the time.

286
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:40,165
Just not enough to make me
want to do it.

287
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:43,127
I like our life.

288
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,840
Are you okay?

289
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,322
Could you turn the tv back on?

290
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,710
Look straight ahead.

291
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,659
Why didn't we
do this test this morning?

292
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,203
You see that?

293
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:21,206
Damn.

294
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,375
I'm losing my peripheral vision?

295
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,508
I am on the drug.

296
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:34,844
Does this mean you have
to tell them and take me off it?

297
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,473
No, and yes.

298
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:42,072
As far as they're concerned,
you're on the placebo.

299
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:43,687
I found out last week.

300
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:46,691
The trial was getting
positive results...

301
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:49,567
So I switched you.

302
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:54,063
So my headaches...

303
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:01,510
I'll stop taking the drug,
and everything should be fine.

304
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,284
Specimen's negative
for blastomycosis.

305
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:11,798
That's it?

306
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:16,186
I'll go give House the test results.
You can tell the patient.

307
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,838
We've been dating for two weeks.

308
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:29,009
You just broke trial protocol
and risked your entire career

309
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,265
to give me a drug we're
not even sure will help me.

310
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:36,520
I don't think I'm ready for that.

311
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:46,646
Dr. Miller?

312
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,087
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:53,715
The test was negative.
So I'm gonna take you off...

314
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:57,886
- What happened to your head?
- I don't know. I was sleeping.

315
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,306
It's so itchy.

316
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:02,115
You were scratching it
in your sleep.

317
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:07,062
You scratched
right through your skull.

318
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,620
This is brain matter.

319
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,192
Need some help in here!

320
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:15,225
I did a free flap closure to avoid
any scarring. She was lucky...

321
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,351
The scratching didn't cause
any brain damage.

322
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:20,283
But the first thing she saidwas:
"It still itches".

323
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:24,288
Itch receptors are only
in the top two layers of skin.

324
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:27,415
Which means she's not actually itchy,
she just thinks she is.

325
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,982
- So the problem's in her brain?
- Thank god we have you to interpret.

326
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:34,005
Sorry, I have a headache.

327
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,490
Could be psychogenic. She made big,
sudden change in her life.

328
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:39,580
Could be the result
of a mental imbalance.

329
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:42,305
She wants to do what she wants to do.
What's crazy about that?

330
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,977
Why do you have to quit to do it?
If I want to do something, I do it.

331
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,383
If you can figure out a balance,
there's no burnout.

332
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:51,339
Thanks, Deepak. The itching
started yesterday, not 8 months ago.

333
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:53,691
Meningitis, encephalitis...

334
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,111
Those are diffuse processes.
This is localized.

335
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,906
Could be plaques.
MS would explain, possibly the lungs.

336
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,282
So would a brain tumor.

337
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,126
Well, how'bout we stop guessing
and mri her head instead?

338
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:30,061
- You want to talk about your headaches?
- Not particularly.

339
00:20:31,928 --> 00:20:34,241
You went off the drug,
but the headaches are worse.

340
00:20:35,004 --> 00:20:37,610
- You need an mri.
- The patient needs an mri.

341
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,238
If she had gangrene,
would you be amputating my leg?

342
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,240
Those pills have codeine.

343
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,431
You're taking twice
the indicated amount.

344
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:46,893
I've only been off the drug
for 24 hours,

345
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:50,165
so I think the bigger issue here
is that I've been off you for 24 hours.

346
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,686
You have worsening headaches,
loss of peripheral vision,

347
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:55,461
and a long history of pretending
bad things aren't happening.

348
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:58,214
You really think this is just
about my hurt feelings?

349
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,988
- I don't remember demoting you.
- I brought you something.

350
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,125
The latest issue of Parent magazine.

351
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,939
Really interesting column.

352
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,675
Apparently, working moms
are actually more engaged

353
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,238
and attentive than stay-at-home moms.
Something about personal fulfillment.

354
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:24,598
That's just a rationalization
by working moms

355
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:27,701
to justify not being with their kids.
Which is fine, if that's what they want.

356
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,322
It's not what I want.

357
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,080
And this is Nurses quarterly.

358
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:33,666
- The point is...
- You're only here to get back at me

359
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,887
by dumping dirty mop water
on my carpet.

360
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:38,463
Just get it over with
so I can get back to work.

361
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,044
I'm sorry.

362
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:05,279
I figured...

363
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,258
I don't know, one of us needed
to go out on a limb.

364
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:12,616
I thought I could help you.

365
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,085
It's hard to have a conversation
when I'm trying not to move.

366
00:22:24,914 --> 00:22:25,914
Oh, God.

367
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,457
Patient's mri was negative.

368
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:31,808
- No tumors, no lesions.
- Where's your cane?

369
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,309
Where are your coworkers?

370
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,395
- I paged them.
- It could still be psychogenic.

371
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:38,982
Technically, it can't still be that,
because it never could be that.

372
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,567
She scratched through her skull
while she was sleeping.

373
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,721
Unless she was having
a dream about fleas...

374
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,166
Oh, hey! Funny you should drop by.

375
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,390
We were just talking
about this patient of ours.

376
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:50,991
Tell him the part about where
two of her doctors don't show up...

377
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:52,333
Where are you going?

378
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,926
Polyneuropathy. If it's not in
the brain, it's in the nerves.

379
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:56,663
It explains itching, lungs, liver.

380
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:59,546
Shock the affected area,
reboot the nerve... She'll be fine.

381
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:06,212
How bad is she?

382
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:12,923
She's got a tumor
in her optic chiasm.

383
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,229
- You don't need your coat to treat it.
- I'm going to the drug company.

384
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,885
To tell them that you
compromised their trial,

385
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,688
your ethics, and the patient's health?
That's a great idea.

386
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:25,919
They have records
on hundreds of patients.

387
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:29,489
I can ask them for access, find out
if other patients developed tumors

388
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:32,403
- and how they were treated.
- This drug inhibits cell death.

389
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:34,476
It could take a wild guess
at how I treat that.

390
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,897
Stop taking it?

391
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:38,916
She tried that yesterday.

392
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,552
Oh, my God, it's been a whole day,
and her brain tumor hasn't melted away?

393
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:45,607
If you get on that elevator,

394
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:48,051
and it's only 'cause you're worried
about getting to sleep...

395
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,304
I want to be able to tell this happened
to other people, and they're fine now.

396
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:52,555
So tell her.

397
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:55,558
- I'm not gonna lie to her.
- A little late for that.

398
00:23:58,955 --> 00:24:00,305
You need to wait.

399
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:02,196
Because if it doesn't go away,

400
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,567
she's gonna need you
to still have a medical license.

401
00:24:09,242 --> 00:24:10,651
So I spoke with House.

402
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,743
- He thinks we should just...
- My leg is bleeding.

403
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,674
- What happened?
- I was going for the phone,

404
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,775
and I fell over the table.

405
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:22,168
I can't see.

406
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:24,087
What do you mean?

407
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,048
I can't see anything.

408
00:24:44,054 --> 00:24:47,496
- You gonna tip Housekeeping?
- Get it from Cuddy.

409
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:51,121
Don't tell me...
She burned your apartment to the ground.

410
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,745
The warmth would have been nice.
No heat, no power.

411
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,150
Apparently Mrs. House
called the utilities

412
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,231
and told them we were moving.

413
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:02,204
You have 17 messages.

414
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,984
And your non-involvement strategy
doesn't seem to be working.

415
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,674
Hang up, he's here.

416
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,918
- We've been paging you all night.
- By all means, let's discuss

417
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:21,686
the failed attempts to contact me,
not the reason behind them.

418
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:26,190
Patient  has experienced spinal shocks
before the machine was turned on.

419
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,659
Lhermitte's sign.

420
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:30,831
Shocks without shock,
an itch that won't stop.

421
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,933
She needs Dr. Seuss.

422
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:35,741
Lhermitte's sign could mean
Bechet's, B-12 deficiency.

423
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,354
No sores, no anemia.

424
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,370
- Where's Foreman?
- No idea.

425
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,428
Could be another
demyelinating disease.

426
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,833
Why are you asking
about Foreman and not 13?

427
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:47,602
Because both questions are bound
to have the same answer.

428
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,548
Ebony and ivory
are joined near the hip.

429
00:25:50,831 --> 00:25:52,341
Forget the brain.
Look lower.

430
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,886
The spinal tumor wouldn't
explain the liver or the lungs.

431
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,388
But an aggressive
spinal hemangioma could.

432
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,834
Go find it.

433
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:17,366
You didn't answer the door.

434
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:19,943
Probably because I didn't
want to talk to anyone.

435
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:22,900
You can leave your stolen key
on your way out.

436
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:25,536
I was looking for Foreman.
I figured...

437
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:30,129
You can't see.

438
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,093
- Where is he?
- On his way to the drug company.

439
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,627
Tell him to come back.

440
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:38,944
I'll dial.

441
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,098
- If they can help.
- You think that drug company

442
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,851
has a magic tumor wand
that no one else knows about?

443
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,697
You need radiation,
not ritual sacrifice.

444
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:52,468
He asked for my advice

445
00:26:52,593 --> 00:26:54,403
before he switched you
off the placebo.

446
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:58,074
I told him to do it if he loved you.

447
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,493
He only thinks he loves me.

448
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,246
It's the same thing.

449
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,305
Yes, he's an idiot.

450
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,583
You didn't ask him.
You're pissed off that he did.

451
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:10,586
So let him torch his career
to pay for his sins.

452
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,800
Unless you actually
feel something for the idiot.

453
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:21,264
In which case, you might
want to tell him to turn around.

454
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:37,113
You're hurting him.

455
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:39,654
Good, after all the stunts
he's pulled on me.

456
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,627
You're physically hurting him.

457
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,541
That's the point.

458
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,920
What's the point?

459
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,732
What do you think
you're going to accomplish?

460
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:49,976
House shouldn't be allowed
to make people miserable

461
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,081
- without paying for it.
- You're not!

462
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:55,487
- You're telling me how I feel?
- You're here because you like this.

463
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:57,095
You like working with him.

464
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,112
If only I'd known I was having fun,

465
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:01,137
I wouldn't have canceled
the bouncy House.

466
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,795
Fire him, and go be home
with your new baby.

467
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:06,601
I like what he does
for this hospital.

468
00:28:07,282 --> 00:28:09,885
What he does is who he is.

469
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:12,257
And the same goes for you.

470
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:22,249
Slow down.

471
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:26,537
Unless you want to radiate
her heart instead of her brain.

472
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,706
Then your problems
would actually all go away.

473
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:29,665
Thanks.

474
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:32,948
I'm not beating myself up
enough already over this.

475
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,963
Entering the left common carotid.

476
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,632
You broke the rules.

477
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:39,800
Girlfriend went blind.

478
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:43,095
You gotta be ready for losing
to be one of the possibilities.

479
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:45,473
You're at the carotid bifurcation.

480
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,166
I knew that giving her the drug
would be bad for me if I got caught.

481
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,894
I never thought it'd be bad for her.

482
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,272
Nobody else was having
adverse reactions.

483
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,634
You did it because you love her.

484
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,444
Ironically, you never
took her into consideration.

485
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,633
Can't wait to see what
you get her for your anniversary.

486
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:07,370
Catheter's adjacent
to the optic chiasm.

487
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,918
We're in position.

488
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:19,127
Nukey, nukey.

489
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:29,164
What's going on with everyone today?

490
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,583
It involves House, Foreman,
and Thirteen,

491
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:35,428
which means it's either dumb, dangerous,
or tragic, or a combination.

492
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:37,274
I'm embracing my ignorance.

493
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:39,664
House was right
about the hemangioma.

494
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:40,989
Looks fixable.

495
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:44,076
What's that?

496
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,536
Hemangiomas travel solo.

497
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,160
This thing has brought a friend.

498
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,913
Masses in her lungs and spine.

499
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:52,415
One in her pericardium.

500
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,034
They're everywhere.

501
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:59,588
Classic for mesothelioma.

502
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,166
It metastasized outward
to the spine and muscles.

503
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,957
Ah, the irony of it.

504
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:06,784
Maybe she wouldn't be sick
at all if some other lazy

505
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:08,806
cancer researcher
hadn't gone home early.

506
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:11,439
Where are foreman and thirteen?

507
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,144
Shouldn't you be saying,

508
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,729
"those weren't there when
we scanned her two days ago"?

509
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:17,523
Mesothelioma shouldn't
grow this fast.

510
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:18,920
Good rephrasing.

511
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,360
Have wilson do a biopsy to confirm.

512
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:23,355
No.

513
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,980
Something weird is going on.
It involves our colleagues...

514
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:28,093
We should know.

515
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:30,481
You want us to treat the patient,
tell us what's going on.

516
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:34,230
Actually, all he needs us to
do is tell wilson to do something.

517
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:35,355
So...

518
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,546
You always blab
to watch people react.

519
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,966
So not blabbing means you don't want
us to react, which can't be good.

520
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:46,681
Is thirteen's headache
not just a headache?

521
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:49,138
If I check with admitting,
am I gonna find her name?

522
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,375
A little pinch.

523
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:04,278
I'm sorry about the other day.
I unloaded on you.

524
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:06,530
- And...
- You're not sorry.

525
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:10,493
You feel bad because
mesothelioma means I'm dying.

526
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:13,454
You're a good person.
I appreciate the sentiment.

527
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,652
I'm not apologizing
because you're dying.

528
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:18,277
I'm apologizing
because you were right.

529
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:19,715
I am stuck.

530
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:23,856
My girlfriend died.

531
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:27,431
She was the only person
I've loved for a long time, and...

532
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:31,791
I'm still living in her apartment.
I'm surrounded by her things.

533
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:34,475
I have left it all
exactly where it was.

534
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:40,231
I don't know how to get unstuck.

535
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:43,514
The only wrong thing is...

536
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:45,087
To do nothing.

537
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:56,364
All right.

538
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:05,542
That's not supposed to happen.

539
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,017
Have you thought about going to the
drug company, see if they can help?

540
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:19,852
- I thought about it.
- We need to give it more time.

541
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:21,146
It's been half a day.

542
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,870
This thing keeps growing,
there's other stuff in your brain

543
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:25,317
you might need later on.

544
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,154
If I were any other patient, you'd both
be in the lounge, eating donuts.

545
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,906
You're not any other patient.

546
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:32,179
Right.

547
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:34,410
Any other patient,
you don't feel guilty.

548
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:39,081
But you don't get to torch
your career to pay for your sins.

549
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:42,167
House told her to say that,
didn't he?

550
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:44,613
Does that make it any less true?

551
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,149
- You think he's right?
- Who cares?

552
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,134
You're a hypocrite.

553
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:52,970
You don't ask her if she wants
to be on the drug,

554
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,276
but when there's a chance
you could help her get better,

555
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:57,677
suddenly you're letting
her call the shots?

556
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:00,299
That's not being noble.
That's saving your own ass.

557
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:04,855
I'd feel worse if
he destroyed his career.

558
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,070
Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.

559
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,528
So what causes masses that do bleed?

560
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:14,533
Avm's secondary to schistosomiasis.

561
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,712
She'd be crawling with worms.
We'd have noticed it.

562
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:19,496
Gorham's disease and
kasabach-merritt can both cause

563
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,814
super-aggressive vascular tumors.

564
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,044
Patient's heart just stopped.

565
00:33:26,575 --> 00:33:28,153
So what causes that?

566
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:31,342
Cardiac tamponade.

567
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,930
She's bleeding into her pericardium,
smothering her heart.

568
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,055
Syringe.

569
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,144
B. p.'s going back up.
It's working.

570
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,862
No, it's not... look.

571
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,898
We're transfusing platelets, ffp,
everything to try to keep her stable.

572
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,877
But we can barely keep
up with the blood loss.

573
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,132
At this rate, she could
be dead by the end of the day.

574
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:01,802
We need to resect the vascular
tumors, stop the bleeding.

575
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:04,799
Too late... No surgeon's
gonna touch her now.

576
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,534
Should we give up?
Just let her bleed out?

577
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:09,051
Don't be silly.

578
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:12,177
You know what that would do
to our malpractice insurance rates?

579
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,614
We go on the offensive.

580
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,863
Cut off the invading
army's supply line.

581
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,928
You're talking about embolization?

582
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:21,441
Cut off the arteries that feed blood
to the tumors, they wither and die.

583
00:34:22,117 --> 00:34:23,877
Start with the ones in her lungs.

584
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,378
If they get any bigger, she's
gonna have a hard time breathing.

585
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:28,440
So she'll have a hard
time telling us she's dead.

586
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,943
You can't kill the tumors
without also killing healthy tissue.

587
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,178
If we wipe out 3/4 of her lungs...

588
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:36,433
Let's hope that running marathons
wasn't on her happy list.

589
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:47,334
I found this.

590
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:51,077
In the, uh, coat closet.

591
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:52,756
Where I hid it.

592
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,394
Thought I'd never see you again.

593
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:01,415
Little, little greg.

594
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:04,317
Yeah, you heard me right!

595
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:12,378
Well, you are who you are.

596
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:14,659
It's annoying, but...

597
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:16,284
It's not your fault.

598
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,523
It isn't about you.

599
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:19,868
I...

600
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:22,202
I'm sorry.

601
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:26,623
Because you were doing this job
perfectly until the baby came along.

602
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:28,180
What?

603
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:31,712
I'm apologizing.
Can't you just accept my...

604
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,944
I accept.

605
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:36,258
We gonna have to do
this dance again in 28 days?

606
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:39,732
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Yesterday, you hate me.

607
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:41,930
Today, you're practically
weeping on my shoulder.

608
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,710
I can only assume that what I'm hearing
is your aunt flow telling me...

609
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:56,996
When I was being a jerk,
you suddenly act human.

610
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,787
But when I act human,
you turn back into a jerk.

611
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:02,326
Guess our cycles
aren't matched up yet.

612
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:06,543
This is your way of saying
you accept my apology, isn't it?

613
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:09,619
Nope, this is my way of saying
you were doing a crappy job before;

614
00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:11,932
you will a slightly
crappier job now.

615
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:14,119
Everything keeps going.
Nature of life.

616
00:36:14,244 --> 00:36:15,794
Nature of parenthood.

617
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:21,620
Or this whole thing is just an act.

618
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:24,723
And you've gone back to
the part you think you need to play.

619
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:28,171
You should go talk to wilson.

620
00:36:28,296 --> 00:36:30,604
Rationalization man
needs a faithful sidekick.

621
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,774
Now, rational man
needs to go save a life.

622
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,449
If you're looking
for returnable bottles,

623
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:48,314
kutner's already cleaned it out.

624
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,559
Damn!

625
00:36:49,684 --> 00:36:50,684
Oh, well.

626
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:54,060
That means the only thing
i'm gonna get out of this...

627
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:55,420
Is a diagnosis.

628
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,682
So the nurses gave her
pads instead of tampons.

629
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:00,247
Is that diagnostically relevant?

630
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:02,553
Fact that the nurses
had to give her anything is.

631
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,680
Means she's bleeding
from her uterus.

632
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:05,764
Women do that.

633
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,975
It's perfectly natural.
Not scary at all.

634
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,089
She menstruating
and she's bleeding everywhere.

635
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,111
There's about a 3 or 4
in 28 chance it's a coincidence.

636
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:18,443
Which leaves a much bigger chance that
the diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis.

637
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:20,811
She had a myoma eight months ago.

638
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:22,948
Surgeons cut through
her uterine wall.

639
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,727
Every cut of the scalpel

640
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:27,798
could have sent endometrial cells
spilling out into her bloodstream.

641
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,063
Some of them took up
residence in her lungs

642
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:32,028
some in her liver,
some in her spine.

643
00:37:32,153 --> 00:37:33,947
And like all horny little cells,

644
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:37,190
they went forth and multiplied till
they reached a critical mass.

645
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:39,349
In the days leading up
to her next period,

646
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:42,218
when her uterus is supposed
to swell, everything swelled.

647
00:37:42,649 --> 00:37:45,345
And when her uterus was supposed
to bleed, everything bled.

648
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:49,683
Yes, ladies,
I am blaming her period.

649
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,518
Granted, it's the worst period ever.

650
00:37:51,912 --> 00:37:54,175
Although,
frankly, not by all that much.

651
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,898
Cut out the masses, she'll be fine.

652
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:59,079
Can't do surgery until her
cycle's over and she stops bleeding.

653
00:37:59,204 --> 00:38:01,133
Let's hope
she can hold out till then.

654
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:03,439
In the meantime, get her a pint of
cookie dough ice cream

655
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:05,114
and a dvd of beaches.

656
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:32,268
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:42,257 --> 00:38:43,457
I can see you.

658
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:02,504
How you feeling?

659
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:06,492
Relative to the last few days,
awesome.

660
00:39:08,418 --> 00:39:09,718
You almost died.

661
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:12,057
For the second time in eight months.

662
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:13,767
I know.

663
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:17,771
How do you feel about
your life choices this time?

664
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,440
I didn't lie there
thinking "what if?"

665
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,328
I always worry, on my deathbed
I'll think,

666
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:27,781
"i didn't do anything
really important."

667
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:31,118
You're gonna spend one day
of your life on your death bed.

668
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:34,538
The other 25,000 are the
ones we should be worrying about.

669
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:37,778
Go to bed happy tonight.

670
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:05,185
Dr. Schmidt.

671
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:07,739
It's eric foreman.

672
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,618
Actually, the trial
isn't going too well.

673
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,309
You told them, didn't you?

674
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,398
Well, you really had no choice...

675
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:35,545
On account of being an idiot.

676
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,976
They gonna pull the drug?

677
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,997
I broke protocol.

678
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,860
Her results are no longer
admissible to the trial.

679
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,908
They don't have to do anything.

680
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:49,571
Anyone else gets a tumor,
they'll put a warning on the label.

681
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:51,239
Gonna keep your license?

682
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:54,993
They'll come after me if I attempt
to participate in any more trials.

683
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:57,829
That's very decent of them.

684
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,083
Well, good for me.

685
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:03,973
I'll see you tomorrow.

686
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:07,003
And the next day.

687
00:41:07,939 --> 00:41:09,289
And the next day.

688
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:12,552
That wasn't your locker, was it?

689
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:14,951
It's a lock-er room.

690
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:18,209
How else are they gonna learn?

691
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:34,455
Do you think you can't
be happy without a kid?

692
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:37,424
I don't know.

693
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,390
I know I can't be happy without you.

694
00:42:14,322 --> 00:42:15,322
You snore.

695
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:17,741
Shut up.

696
