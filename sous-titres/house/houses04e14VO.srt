1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,900
<i>Brock? What are you doing?</i>

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,800
Getting ready for surgery.
What's it look like?

3
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:08,121
<i>You're operating on my sister.</i>

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,600
<i>And my fiancee.</i>

5
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,700
You're drunk. You could kill her.

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:17,085
It's the only way
to stop my hands from shaking.

7
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:18,700
I need to drink...

8
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:20,663
for Anna.

9
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:22,643
What about...

10
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:24,418
our baby?

11
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:26,945
Our... baby?

12
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:32,701
Brock?

13
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:34,937
Oh, my god! Brock?

14
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,252
Are you okay? Brock, speak to me!

15
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:41,556
Oh, my god! I-i think he's really hurt.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,900
Cut!

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,922
Oh... that was scary.

18
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:49,845
I thought for a second
you were really...

19
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:52,052
You're gonna be the only one
in the world who did.

20
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:54,500
This is ridiculous.

21
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,965
- That was great, evan.
- No, it wasn't. It was crap.

22
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,136
- The fans are gonna love it.
- The fans are crap. I'm crap.

23
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,989
This whole damn show is crap!

24
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:04,550
Sorry, not your fault.

25
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:37,732
Where are you going?

26
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,850
<i>My apartment's on the west side.</i>

27
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:42,320
Excuse me, you need to go the other way.

28
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,965
Hey, did you hear what i said?

29
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,148
What the hell's going on here?

30
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:54,560
<i>What do you want?</i>

31
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,030
An autographed picture would be nice.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,924
Oh...

33
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:02,832
and i'm also gonna save your life.

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,795
You might want to think about
repositioning the crosswalk.

40
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,699
It's technically not a violation,

41
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:51,849
but the closer they are to the entrance,
the more likely they are to be used.

42
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:52,996
Makes sense.

43
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,798
I actually wasn't expecting you
till next month.

44
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:57,904
Yeah, that's the problem
with planned visits.

45
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:00,043
Administrators plan for them.

46
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:02,367
So the most recent new jersey hospital

47
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:03,980
accreditation requirements.

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,350
Yeah, i'm familiar with-

49
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:14,800
Who is that?

50
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,705
I have no idea.

51
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,360
Shall we get started?

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,495
Just let me go.

53
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:25,263
I won't press charges.

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,603
Forget the whole thing.

55
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:27,935
That's probably true.

56
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:30,135
Seeing as how you have a brain tumor.

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,013
You're that nutjob doctor
that keeps calling my publicist.

58
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,834
Actually, i'm the nutjob head
of diagnostic medicine.

59
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,700
I run every day.

60
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,149
I don't get headaches.
I'm fine. If you don't mind...

61
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,864
actually, i do mind.

62
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,300
<i>I don't care if you die,</i>

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,343
but if Brock Sterling dies,

64
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:49,490
Anna never finds out
he's the father of marie's baby.

65
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,703
- Help!
- Help!

66
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,363
We're gonna need a wheelchair! Here.

67
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,488
Look, in the last month,

68
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,203
Your average line reading has slowed
from 2.1 seconds to 2.9.

69
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:04,899
<i>You're pausing more.
Always at the same intervals.</i>

70
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,465
Every seven to nine words.

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,266
Which means you're having trouble
reading one side of the teleprompter.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,230
Which means it's
a peripheral vision problem.

73
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,348
Which means a tumor
in your occipital lobe.

74
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:17,100
Just one test.

75
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:20,211
If there's nothing wrong,
i'll take you right back home.

76
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,089
Make it cab fare.

77
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,205
I don't want you anywhere near my house.

78
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:35,200
Just put it in my spot.

79
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:38,899
The accreditation board is here
to protect us and our patients.

80
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:41,670
So in dealing
with the on-site inspector,

81
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,599
please behave as if it wasn't also

82
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:46,321
An enormous pain in the ass. Thank you.

83
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:49,451
Chase, Foreman, Cameron,
up here, please.

84
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,184
- Why is house driving a limo?
- Don't know.

85
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:58,940
- Don't have to know.
- Don't... care?

86
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:01,923
<i>Wrong! Until this inspection is over,
you're back on house watch.</i>

87
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,580
- Current case, past cases.
- He doesn't have a current case.

88
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,369
I have a whole department.

89
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:10,692
- Are you gonna fire us if we don't?
- I was just asking for your help.

90
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,198
The last time i checked the e. r.,

91
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,639
<i>you had the best-kept charts
in the building.</i>

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,499
The last time i checked the
fourth floor janitor's closet,

93
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:23,080
<i>i found house's charts.</i>

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,960
<i>He hasn't filed anything since you left.</i>

95
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:26,262
House may not care

96
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:28,456
whether this hospital's
accreditation gets downgraded.

97
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,237
The people who sign my paychecks do.

98
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:32,388
So i repeat, current, past.

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,051
He doesn't have a current case.

100
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,145
Did he tell you about the limo?

101
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,600
So i just press this button
every time i see a light?

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,200
It tells me where your blind spots are.

103
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,159
So...

104
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,957
The twins.

105
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,180
They're gonna turn out
to be yours, aren't they?

106
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,365
I told you i can't talk
about that stuff.

107
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,663
But you want to be done
with this, right?

108
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:58,542
One's mine, one's julio's.

109
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:00,074
I knew it!

110
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,934
Julio knocked her up
before her appendix burst

111
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,270
you got her after.

112
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,121
How can you watch that stuff?

113
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:08,956
'Cause it's awesome.

114
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,604
It's preposterous.

115
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,676
Not one real moment
since i've been on the show.

116
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,969
As opposed to shows
that represent the world

117
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,197
exactly the way it is, like...

118
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,300
I can't think of any.

119
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:20,635
What's going on?

120
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,694
The hospital is being inspected,

121
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:25,600
and cuddy dispatched you
to keep an eye on me.

122
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,158
I just parked a town car
in an ambulance bay.

123
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:32,403
<i>And instead of ripping me one,
cuddy acted like she didn't know me.</i>

124
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:34,746
<i>It's either an inspection
or an aneurysm.</i>

125
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,261
What's the test say?

126
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:37,636
As i suspected.

127
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:40,993
You have significant losses
in the upper right quadrant

128
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,272
of your visual field.

129
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,800
- Are you serious?
- No, it's a joke.

130
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:47,837
Two guys go into a bar,
and one has significant losses

131
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,880
in the upper right quadrant
of his visual field.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,057
And the other one says,
"you're gonna need an MRI

133
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,175
to confirm the type and location
of the tumor."

134
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,470
That readout says his vision's fine.

135
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:58,441
<i>- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.</i>

136
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:00,314
You lied to me?

137
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,207
I kidnapped you.

138
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,293
You're surprised that i lied to you?

139
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,618
It just means that
the symptoms are intermittent.

140
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:10,368
You come near me again,
i'm calling the police.

141
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,510
<i>You kidnapped him?</i>

142
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,352
It's sweet that
i haven't lost the ability

143
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:16,558
to surprise you.

144
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,470
Are you mocking me?

145
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,170
My back. My back is killing me.

146
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:29,355
Don't care. Busy.

147
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:30,915
Amber's damn mattress.

148
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,299
Well, that sucks.

149
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:33,689
Don't buy a new one.

150
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:36,668
Are you being sarcastic?
Because we are buying one.

151
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,820
She's incapable
of doing anything that matters

152
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:41,467
without turning it into a zero-sum game.

153
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,799
<i>We're buying a mattress for us.</i>

154
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,157
I'm faster than you right now.

155
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:51,957
It's all about her

156
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:55,554
and whatever hapless salesman
wanders into her sights.

157
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:58,899
She's gonna lie, steal,
and trade your testes

158
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,588
to get whatever she wants.

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,909
Hold on, i've just gotta do something
before he dials the second "1."

160
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:11,501
You're going to end up humiliated,

161
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:13,056
holding her purse,

162
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:16,457
and going home to sleep
on a new mattress you hate.

163
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:18,404
What the hell are you doing?

164
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:19,807
He needs an MRI.

165
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:24,640
Give me one-millimeter slices
from the cortex down.

166
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,602
Any particular reason you decided

167
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:31,055
to sedate a patient for a procedure
that's completely painless?

168
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,199
The guy has a history
of violent outbursts

169
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,799
during surgical procedures.

170
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:36,005
Yeah, on tv.

171
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,455
<i>It's evan greer.</i>

172
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,203
He's the main stud on house's soap.

173
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,599
<i>Frontal cortex looks clean. No tumors.</i>

174
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:45,155
Increase the magnification
on the occipital lobe.

175
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:49,025
You watch because you like
or because i like?

176
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,865
I was unemployed, and I...

177
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:53,103
<i>Sorry.</i>

178
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:55,177
That's not an answer. That's an apology.

179
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:57,812
If we are ever to come out
of the darkness, we have to be proud.

180
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:00,624
<i>Occipital, frontal, temporal lobes
are clean. So is the optic nerve.</i>

181
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:02,311
<i>Definitely no tumors.</i>

182
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:05,548
He's fine?

183
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,551
And... awake.

184
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,741
What should we tell him?

185
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,723
See if you can talk him out of suing me.

186
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,851
He kidnapped me! He drugged me!

187
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,867
Perhaps you should go out the back way.

188
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:25,624
I'm not going anywhere
you people tell me to go.

189
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:28,180
It's just someone of your fame

190
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,561
<i>I- I figured fans-</i>

191
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,002
You're trying to hide me.

192
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:32,579
You don't want me making a scene.

193
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,545
The hospital's being inspected today.

194
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,146
<i>- And you want me to do you a favor?
- Not us.</i>

195
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:39,479
Our dean of medicine.
And house hates her.

196
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,992
You'd be doing house a favor
by complaining.

197
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,049
Oh...

198
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,373
This hospital is staffed
with lunatics and criminals!

199
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,812
Excuse me, where's dr. Cuddy?

200
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:54,180
<i>It's my foot.</i>

201
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,596
- What did he do to me?
- What did house do?

202
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,416
Nothing. I was with him the whole time.

203
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,272
It's numb. I can't feel it.

204
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:01,269
Oh!

205
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:06,139
I can't walk.

206
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,064
Foot numbness has a huge differential.

207
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:16,072
It gets a lot narrower when you add in

208
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,800
peripheral vision problems.

209
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:19,899
Which gets a lot wider
when there's no proof

210
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:21,599
he ever had a vision problem.

211
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,457
<i>House was wrong about the first symptom,</i>

212
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,136
but the guy just happened to develop

213
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:27,184
a second unrelated symptom
a few hours later?

214
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:29,570
<i>He already kidnapped
and sedated the guy against his will.</i>

215
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:32,963
Makes sense he'd also do something
to numb his foot so he couldn't leave.

216
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,334
But it doesn't make sense
to include a symptom

217
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:38,460
that he caused in a differential
he's so desperate to solve.

218
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:41,642
- Unless he didn't mean to cause it.
- Stick to the filing, sweetheart.

219
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,628
Let the doctors do the doctoring.

220
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,599
Either toxins or vitamin deficiency.

221
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,874
<i>I'm guessing when you drugged him
you didn't catch him</i>

222
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,270
and ease him to the floor.

223
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,675
He could've pinched a nerve
in his ankle when he fell.

224
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:53,899
<i>You need to run an EMG test
for motor nerve entrapment</i>

225
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,900
or the inspector will own your ass.

226
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
Kutner,

227
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:00,395
leave the room. Wait 30 minutes.

228
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,594
And come back and tell her
the test was negative.

229
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:05,081
Is it okay if i use
that time to do the test?

230
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,329
Get out of here.

231
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:09,142
And the rest of them can help me
with all this stuff.

232
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:10,644
They're busy.

233
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,010
Which is really annoying

234
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:14,178
'cause i wanted to be able
to say that they're busy

235
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,417
for no other reason
than to screw with you.

236
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:17,476
Research.

237
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,366
So the nutjob was right.

238
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,200
Usually is.

239
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:27,103
He said i was dying.

240
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,464
He's wrong a lot too.
That's why we do these tests.

241
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,248
<i>I bet it's pretty cool, you know,
being the star of a hit tv show.</i>

242
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:37,599
It's a daytime soap.

243
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,003
It pretty much puts me
one step above dinner theater.

244
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,021
Come on. You're on tv every day.

245
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,841
And who cares what the critics think?
Women love soaps.

246
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,271
You get to take pride in your job...

247
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,437
For good when you go home at night.

248
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:51,759
You're entertaining people.

249
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,235
I don't care.

250
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,421
Well, you've made
a strange career choice.

251
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:57,134
Look, i'm pandering.

252
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:00,385
I want to be a part of something
that inspires people.

253
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:02,141
So quit.

254
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:04,781
<i>Find something inspiring and do it.</i>

255
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:06,384
It's not that easy.

256
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:07,600
Why not?

257
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,552
Just isn't.

258
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:19,397
It's my heart, doctor. It's racing.

259
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,422
I'm sure it's nothing.

260
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:23,000
You're a healthy woman, Marie.

261
00:12:23,238 --> 00:12:25,300
<i>Shouldn't you examine me?</i>

262
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,970
<i>Why don't you have Rico do it?</i>

263
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,423
You can't tell me
you didn't notice that pause.

264
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,400
Sorry.

265
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,294
She's never waking up.

266
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:37,879
This is a whole new experience
in super hi-def.

267
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:40,806
I had no idea Marie wore an underwire.

268
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:42,354
Does sound a little forced.

269
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,670
Could be stiffening in his tongue

270
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:46,399
which is a symptom of myxedema.

271
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,685
That's not the tongue,
it's the dialogue.

272
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,171
I think i dated that nurse though.

273
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,041
No.

274
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,270
What about the way he's holding
that stethoscope?

275
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:00,854
<i>His thumb and forefinger
are meeting at an odd angle.</i>

276
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,512
Could be demyelination
from toxic exposure.

277
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:04,961
Back it up.

278
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,070
What's this, the av club?

279
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:09,628
<i>It's diagnostic.</i>

280
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,904
- Everything's under control.
- Yeah. Excellent job so far.

281
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:14,951
House, outside.

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,045
Keep watching.

283
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,600
You'll never guess
what rico's got in that box.

284
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,515
<i>Rico doesn't even know i'm alive.</i>

285
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,094
You have an obsession with an actor
or the character he plays.

286
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:29,999
I feel for you. You need to work it out.

287
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,600
But I need you to do it

288
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,780
when the hospital's
accreditation and my job

289
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,041
are not on the line.

290
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,962
You want the star of the hottest
daytime drama on tv

291
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:39,383
to die in your hospital?

292
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:40,899
No, I want you to cure him

293
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:42,975
without committing any more felonies.

294
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,509
I can't do my job

295
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,301
if you're gonna tie my hands like that.

296
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:47,870
51 weeks out of the year,

297
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:51,401
I let you run around like
a monkey in a banana factory.

298
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:54,789
All I'm asking is that you tone it down
for a few days.

299
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:59,241
- I want that tv.
- We're not bargaining.

300
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,163
You want something. Either
you're bargaining or you're begging.

301
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,138
Me keeping my job is good for you.

302
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,046
Yes, but it's better for you.

303
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,100
I just want us to be equally happy.

304
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,371
EMG was negative for nerve entrapment.

305
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:13,100
Means the foot's a real symptom.

306
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,599
Could be vitamin deficiency.

307
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:15,704
Or a toxin.

308
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,042
Or atherosclerosis.

309
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,367
Or a toxin.

310
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,170
Why is toxin a better idea?

311
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,200
Might not be.

312
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,300
We'll know after i'm finished
searching his set

313
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:24,666
and dressing room for...

314
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,455
medically relevant stuff.

315
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,994
Gotta go. Need a decision.

316
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,213
You're not gonna cut your own throat.

317
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,767
Yeah, that sounds like me.

318
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,580
Test for heavy metals, organics,

319
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,576
biotoxins, and search the home.

320
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:44,816
I like the pillow top.

321
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,318
I like this one.

322
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,659
<i>Great taste. That model's
top of the line.</i>

323
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,645
- How much is it?
- $1,999. It's a great price.

324
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,900
What about that's too rich for us.

325
00:14:58,368 --> 00:15:00,121
I don't know, you think...

326
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,700
Honey, we can't afford that.

327
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:04,916
Not with a baby on the way.

328
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,988
<i>Congratulations. Your first?</i>

329
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,300
Yes.

330
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,631
<i>- How about i knock 100 bucks off?
- maybe throw in free delivery.</i>

331
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,500
Money's really tight right now.

332
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:16,246
I'm a law clerk and my husband
just got laid off.

333
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,977
He has an interview today.

334
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,551
Wish him luck.

335
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:21,357
Good luck.

336
00:15:21,849 --> 00:15:23,000
Fingers crossed.

337
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:27,065
We might be able to afford $1,500.

338
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,381
<i>Well, i-
i'd have to check with my manager.</i>

339
00:15:29,646 --> 00:15:31,155
Thanks. I appreciate it.

340
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,277
Hold this, would you?

341
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,408
911 from work. Better go.

342
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:44,020
So am i getting the hard mattress,

343
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:46,101
or do i have to go to my job interview?

344
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:47,670
Whatever mattress you want.

345
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:48,977
I'm fine either way.

346
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:51,700
You-really?

347
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:54,724
Really. Just as long as i get
to help you break it in.

348
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,900
Pack your manhood on ice.

349
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,699
Maybe the hospital can reattach it.

350
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:17,266
You were so wrong.
She's letting me choose.

351
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,356
<i>"You choose"</i>

352
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,180
does not mean "you choose."

353
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,816
<i>Really? Sounded like you choose.</i>

354
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,682
I suppose it's possible
she meant house is so,

355
00:16:25,313 --> 00:16:26,157
<i>so wrong.</i>

356
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:27,700
It's a trap.

357
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:29,840
It means if you love me,

358
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:31,728
you'll buy the one i want.

359
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,999
Amber doesn't do passive-aggressive.

360
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:35,455
People who do aggressive

361
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,700
<i>don't like to limit themselves.</i>

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,887
Could a leaky space heater
cause vision problems and numbness?

363
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,965
He'd have gotten better at the hospital.
It's not a trap.

364
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,980
Did i hear a question mark
at the end of that sentence?

365
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:49,029
<i>House, look, she's-</i>

366
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:50,110
gotta go.

367
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:53,452
Manager says i can do that price.

368
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:59,258
The gin bottles are all gifts from fans.

369
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,472
Brock sterling drinks it on the show,
but evan doesn't drink at all.

370
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,510
He's on this whole
health kick right now.

371
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,110
Fruits, nuts...

372
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:08,690
Did you take those
from his dressing room?

373
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,124
No.

374
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,216
You're not gonna marry Brock, are you?

375
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:16,725
We've been waiting four years
for him to make it official with Anna.

376
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:18,870
Are you really a doctor?

377
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,677
Glioblastoma.

378
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,213
Need more proof?

379
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,680
So no toxins on the set.

380
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:26,300
How about his regular life?

381
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,571
Unusual hobbies? Unsavory friends?

382
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,143
No. I've been out with him.

383
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:31,970
He's as vanilla as they come.

384
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,847
And by "out" you mean...

385
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,890
Well, i asked him on a date last month.

386
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,362
We went out a few times,

387
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,041
but we weren't right for each other.

388
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,612
Too small or too large?

389
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,684
Is that medically relevant?

390
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,389
I'm a doctor, and it's
relevant to me, so yes.

391
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,163
We never got that far.

392
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:51,451
We made out a while, and then he just

393
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,186
said he should go home.

394
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,306
He's a real gentleman.

395
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,140
Now that'd be interesting.

396
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:05,860
He's impotent.

397
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:10,360
<i>Steady diet of sunflower seeds</i>

398
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:12,417
<i>causes a b6 toxicity,</i>

399
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,260
which causes an autonomic dysregulation,

400
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:16,061
which causes a wood-free existence.

401
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,473
One bad night and a
couple of sunflower seeds,

402
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,420
and he's got autonomic dysregulation?

403
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,421
It's more than just one.
He can't even remember

404
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:24,379
the last time he was able to salute.

405
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:27,072
- It's cool?
- B6 wouldn't show up on a tox screen.

406
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,110
And we didn't find
anything at the house.

407
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,290
All we have to do is
filter the b6 out of his blood.

408
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,790
Prep him for plasmapheresis.

409
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,876
Just because he didn't salute
doesn't mean he can't.

410
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,112
And can you find out where that voice
keeps coming from?

411
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,794
Tell it to get out of my head.

412
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,598
The impotence could be psychological.
He's depressed. Hates his job.

413
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,510
Plasmapheresis has risks.

414
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,409
We should have spend the night at sleep
lab, see if he gets a reflex erection.

415
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:51,610
Confirmation is for
wimps and altar boys.

416
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,654
We don't need to Wait for a reflex.

417
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,740
If he can't get engorged
the way god intended,

418
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,400
he can't get engorged.

419
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,325
I'm not showing him my boobs.

420
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:05,417
Lack of response to your
chest tells us nothing.

421
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,237
Thirteen, show him...

422
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:12,022
Where can i find a decent
set of knockers around here?

423
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:13,975
Your porn's in the second drawer.

424
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,796
<i>All set.</i>

425
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,566
Heart monitor, blood pressure monitor,

426
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,039
and the one on his junk.

427
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,508
This is humiliating.

428
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:29,434
We're gonna close the blinds
to give you some privacy.

429
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,827
The instruments will let
us monitor your response.

430
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,931
I don't get this guy.
He has the coolest gig ever,

431
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:36,370
but he's miserable about it.

432
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:38,269
He figures quitting
won't do him any good.

433
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:39,853
Figures he'd be unhappy anywhere.

434
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:41,598
Our circumstances affect whether

435
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:43,500
you're pretty happy in this job, right?

436
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:44,388
Sure.

437
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:46,649
Have you ever had a
job where you were miserable?

438
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:49,629
I once sold men's fragrances
in a department store.

439
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,400
And were you miserable?

440
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,090
The pay was awful.

441
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,966
It was a miserable job,
but you weren't miserable.

442
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,976
So what about you? You happy?

443
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:01,975
Not particularly.

444
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:04,516
Heart rate and bp are climbing.

445
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,667
Got some activity on the tumescence
monitor as well.

446
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,060
There's nothing wrong with his naughty.

447
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,046
It's not b6 toxicity.

448
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,789
Did he just finish?

449
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,301
Sometimes, when you haven't,
you know, for awhile, you...

450
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:25,119
His heart rate's through the roof.
220 and climbing.

451
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:28,730
He's headed for cardiac arrest.

452
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:37,285
We shocked his heart
back into sinus rhythm.

453
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,852
He's stable, at least for now.

454
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,889
Could be some sort of
atypical septic reaction.

455
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:42,160
Not without a fever.

456
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,121
Thus the word atypical.

457
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,428
In that case, it could be
an atypical bunion.

458
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:47,541
He used to smoke.

459
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:50,226
Could be paraneoplastic syndrome
caused by small cell lung cancer.

460
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,713
Quit 20 years ago, and his calcium
levels are normal.

461
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:54,065
Could be graves disease.

462
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:56,195
Extreme hyperthyroidism leads
to systemic problems,

463
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:58,527
including numbness, vision loss,
and cardiac arrest.

464
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:01,305
You want to be here.

465
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,099
I have to be here.

466
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,226
Just say the word, i'll fire thirteen.

467
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,632
Just sign the forms.

468
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:10,397
Smart move. I was bluffing.

469
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:12,774
She's right.

470
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:15,416
We should fry the thyroid
before it fries him.

471
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,820
I know it's more exciting this way,

472
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,537
but shouldn't we confirm you're right

473
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:23,243
before destroying one of the most
important glands in his body?

474
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:26,496
If that gland has drawn a bull's-eye
on his heart, then no.

475
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,540
Nuking his thyroid puts him at risk

476
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,078
for vascular lesions and
all kinds of cancer.

477
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:33,587
Protocol says we should
do an iodine uptake test.

478
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:34,787
We?

479
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,679
Anyone else want to run
a useless test, while

480
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,678
Brock's thyroid plots its
next lethal move?

481
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,141
It was rhetorical.

482
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:48,060
You were sure about b-6 toxicity too.

483
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:49,895
House is right.

484
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:53,357
Seriously?

485
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:56,652
I mean, I am, but you think so?

486
00:21:57,476 --> 00:22:00,572
If he goes into full-on
thyroid storm, he'll die.

487
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:04,107
We gotta nuke his thyroid.

488
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,620
- Hang up the phone.
- Why?

489
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,412
- If we're gonna nuke his thyroid...
- We're not nuking the guy's thyroid

490
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:16,230
without proof that's it's graves.

491
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,730
Do the iodine uptake test.

492
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,731
- If house finds out...
- When house finds out.

493
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:21,593
We'll have the test results.

494
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:24,274
And we'll either do his procedure
or we won't.

495
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:39,027
What are you doing here?

496
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:40,654
Just grabbing a snack.

497
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:43,365
You keep food in the morgue?

498
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,492
If I keep it in the lounge,
everyone else eats it.

499
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:47,661
That's 'cause it's everyone else's food.

500
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,041
Oh, i thought it was just
everyone else's bags.

501
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:55,377
The accreditation board will
light us on fire for this.

502
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:57,617
They're not gonna find out.

503
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,669
Unless, of course, conway planned
on inspecting the morgue

504
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:02,592
in, say, two minutes.

505
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,636
Is that why you're here?

506
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:07,806
You're gonna get me
fired over a sandwich?

507
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:09,559
No, over a tv.

508
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,277
And you're not gonna get fired
because you're gonna fold.

509
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:13,353
No, i won't.

510
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,440
But you're gonna push it,
so we need a safe word

511
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:20,791
so you can signal
your unconditional surrender.

512
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,177
Call me sweet sauce.

513
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:24,573
Dr. House.

514
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,016
I don't think we've met.

515
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:28,035
Dr. Jamie conway.
I've heard your name.

516
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:30,495
Most people have.
It's also a noun.

517
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:37,377
I sometimes come down here
to relax, unwind, maybe grab a...

518
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:38,420
Sweet sauce.

519
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:42,174
It's a nickname.

520
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,383
An ironic nickname.

521
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:47,304
Wow, it is almost 2:00.

522
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:49,447
Aren't you supposed to be...?

523
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:51,275
oh, yeah.

524
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:55,437
Yeah,'cause those sick blind kids
aren't gonna read to themselves.

525
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:57,581
See ya.

526
00:24:05,018 --> 00:24:07,699
I recommend skipping c-26.

527
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:10,535
Floater.
Been in the river at least a week.

528
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,538
- Thanks for the warning.
- Any time.

529
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,715
Doesn't the doctors'
lounge have that same tv?

530
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:31,473
Nope, they've got a 12-inch exactly like
the one that used to be in here.

531
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:33,417
Files are done.

532
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,616
I'll be doing a dance of joy just
as soon as my leg is healed.

533
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:39,011
Can you tilt that down?

534
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:42,242
I know the paperwork annoys you,
but patient records are important.

535
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:43,928
You can't just let them sit there.

536
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:45,051
I had to.

537
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:46,820
In the name of science.

538
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:48,198
I let the crap pile up,

539
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:51,118
and then I see which team
member is the most

540
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,806
self-flagellating, breaks down,
clears up the mess.

541
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,832
Surprise was, it turned out to be you.

542
00:24:57,683 --> 00:24:58,800
Again.

543
00:24:59,494 --> 00:25:02,118
You weren't even
registered as a competitor.

544
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,880
You miss me.

545
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,054
You miss me!

546
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:07,304
You hired thirteen to replace-

547
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,968
Yeah, all pretty girls are fungible.

548
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,263
You're avoiding.

549
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:13,363
I miss the job.

550
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,258
I miss running around
playing private investigator.

551
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:19,396
I miss...

552
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:21,273
The puzzles.

553
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:24,234
Seriously, i'll fire thirteen.

554
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:27,597
Or kutner, if you think thirteen is hot.

555
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,349
I don't miss you.

556
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:37,430
That iodine left a
really weird aftertaste.

557
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,867
That's the tracer in it.

558
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:41,293
We'll have the images
in a couple of minutes.

559
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:43,545
You must do okay with women, huh?

560
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:45,502
I already asked him that.

561
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:47,737
And?

562
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,551
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

563
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:51,803
He feels unfulfilled.

564
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:53,346
I doubt it.

565
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:54,848
I'm lying?

566
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:57,765
I used to be a plastic surgeon.

567
00:25:57,997 --> 00:26:01,313
I talk about my work as
shallow and meaningless.

568
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:06,234
Truth is, I loved every boob job,

569
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:08,702
every tummy tuck.

570
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,079
Meaning doesn't mean that much.

571
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,326
But you're not a
plastic surgeon anymore.

572
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:17,270
It's complicated.

573
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,914
Are you happier?

574
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:21,866
It's complicated.

575
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:23,877
His thyroid looks normal.

576
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,564
So that's good news, right?

577
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,550
- Everything look too bright to you?
- It could be the monitor.

578
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:36,140
It's not the monitor.

579
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,044
It's the iodine.

580
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:41,853
It's everywhere.
His body's not filtering it.

581
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,980
His kidneys are failing.

582
00:26:46,317 --> 00:26:49,122
- I told you to nuke his thyroid.
- It's a good thing we didn't.

583
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:50,996
Kidney failure means it wasn't graves.

584
00:26:51,116 --> 00:26:54,979
So your test screwed me
and our patient's kidneys.

585
00:26:55,203 --> 00:26:56,871
Practically poisoned him with iodine.

586
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,796
Which he could have handled
easily if his kidneys were healthy.

587
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:02,582
All we did was reveal a new symptom.
Usually, you're all for that.

588
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:05,308
Must be the rancid tinge of betrayal
that's put me off.

589
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:08,129
- You were wrong.
- So tell me to my face.

590
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:10,178
You never hesitated before.

591
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:11,874
The board's turned you into a coward.

592
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:13,873
I did it because it was
the right thing to do.

593
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:16,702
- You did it to pass an inspection.
- Does it matter?

594
00:27:17,523 --> 00:27:20,225
Kidney failure on top of the other
symptoms points to an autoimmune

595
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:24,104
condition, which means that any
of his other organs could be next.

596
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,306
We've already started dialysis.

597
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,858
We need to run anas for autoimmune.

598
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,054
You're right.

599
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:33,481
You and the team,
go measure the ceilings.

600
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:35,448
Excuse me?

601
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:37,166
Accreditation board guidelines

602
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:40,231
state that no object can be less
than 18 inches from the ceiling.

603
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:41,788
Make sure we're in compliance.

604
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:43,839
There's nothing in our office
that'd be less...

605
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,122
I don't mean us.
I mean the whole hospital.

606
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,960
Let's see how this baby handles.

607
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:10,618
What?

608
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,277
You bought the firm mattress.

609
00:28:13,778 --> 00:28:15,322
I thought that's the one you wanted.

610
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,870
It was.

611
00:28:17,977 --> 00:28:19,284
Why would you do that?

612
00:28:19,693 --> 00:28:20,712
Because-

613
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:24,115
This is a trick question?

614
00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:25,938
I left it up to you.

615
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:28,626
You were supposed to
get the one you wanted.

616
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:33,089
I got the one you wanted
because I love you.

617
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:33,890
No.

618
00:28:38,518 --> 00:28:40,680
You did it because that's what you do.

619
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:43,777
With all your ex-wives,
you did whatever they wanted

620
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:46,122
because it was easier, and
you ended up resenting them.

621
00:28:47,764 --> 00:28:49,646
Don't you dare do that to to me.

622
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:52,795
What, take care of you?

623
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:54,868
Have you met me?

624
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:57,486
I can take care of me.

625
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,158
I need you to take care of you.

626
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:03,620
I have work to do.

627
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,070
You made it to page eight.

628
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,745
"Mysterious hospital visit
for soap doc."

629
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:20,678
Wow, i'll be sure to send my mom a copy.

630
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,892
They told me I have an
autoimmune disease.

631
00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:29,771
Like lupus or sarcoidosis.

632
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,567
That's what we're here to find out.

633
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:40,073
You really as good as everyone
seems to think you are?

634
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:44,122
Are you really as miserable as
everyone seems to think you are?

635
00:29:44,612 --> 00:29:48,352
I just want to do
something that matters.

636
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:51,623
Nothing matters.

637
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:53,937
We're all just cockroaches.

638
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:57,497
Wildebeests dying on the river bank.

639
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,569
Nothing we do has any lasting meaning.

640
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,220
And you think I'm miserable.

641
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:05,358
If you're unhappy on the plane,
jump out of it.

642
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:07,561
I want to, but...

643
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:11,146
I can't.

644
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:14,407
Hmm, that's the problem with metaphors.

645
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:16,280
They need interpretation.

646
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,354
Jumping out of the plane is stupid.

647
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,506
Well, what if I'm not in a plane?

648
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:27,027
What if I'm just in a place
I don't want to be?

649
00:30:29,418 --> 00:30:31,170
That's the other problem with metaphors.

650
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,002
Yes, what if you're actually in
an ice cream truck and outside

651
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:35,920
are candy and flowers and virgins?

652
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,230
You're on a plane.

653
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:40,010
We're all on planes.

654
00:30:41,354 --> 00:30:43,413
Life is dangerous and complicated.

655
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,930
And it's a long way down.

656
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:49,392
So you're afraid of change?

657
00:30:51,948 --> 00:30:53,480
No, you're afraid to change.

658
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,357
You'd rather imagine
that you can escape

659
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:58,679
instead of actually try.

660
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,076
'cause if you fail,
then you've got nothing.

661
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,466
So you'll give up the chance
of something real

662
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:08,786
so that you can hold on to hope.

663
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:12,964
The thing is, hope is for sissies.

664
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,297
When I get outta here,
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

665
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,635
I mean, how many guys
get a second chance?

666
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:25,512
Too many.

667
00:31:26,462 --> 00:31:28,973
Half the people I save don't
deserve a second chance.

668
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:32,739
Now that I've got mine,
I'm gonna set things right.

669
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:37,398
I'm gonna start by being
a better father to you.

670
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:38,900
And to your sister.

671
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,751
And to your other sister.

672
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,032
You realize you're reciting
lines from last season.

673
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:49,437
We're gonna do all
the things I promised.

674
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:52,455
Just help me get out of this bed.

675
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:01,339
Cooling blankets in here.

676
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:03,299
This guy's brain is about to boil.

677
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:07,387
Do you know where you are?
What's your name?

678
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:09,430
Dr. Brock sterling.

679
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:12,599
Fever rules out auto-immune.

680
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,540
He's septic.
He's got a massive infection.

681
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,529
We've got him on broad
spectrum antibiotics,

682
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:18,909
but he slipped from
delirium into a coma.

683
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:22,527
Good news is last time Brock was
in a coma he fathered two children.

684
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:26,072
We need to identify the infection and
get him on more targeted meds fast.

685
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:28,529
What about pneumococcus?
Causes heart problems and sepsis.

686
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:31,106
But not the neuropathies in
his foot and eyes. What about tetanus?

687
00:32:31,226 --> 00:32:32,996
He got a tetanus booster last year.

688
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:35,091
- Lyme disease?
- He would've been sore all over.

689
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:37,202
There's 1,000 infections
that could've caused this.

690
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,348
We can start testing, but he'll
be dead before the cultures grow.

691
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:42,838
Unless it's a fungus.

692
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:44,674
We could see that under a microscope.

693
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:47,927
Test for fungi, parasites,
all creatures great and small.

694
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:50,030
Where you going?

695
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,013
To lie down. I need to think.

696
00:32:56,347 --> 00:32:58,152
Could be rat bite fever...

697
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:01,384
But his glands aren't swollen.

698
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,397
Which one are you gonna get?

699
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:08,169
She told me to get the one I want.

700
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:09,470
So get it.

701
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:13,254
Listeria explains the sepsis,

702
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:15,079
possibly also the heart problem.

703
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:16,761
But not the numbness.

704
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:21,628
If the listeria caused encephalomyelitis
which then caused the numbness...

705
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:24,184
I want a waterbed.

706
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:34,350
I've always wanted one.
I know it's ridiculous.

707
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,470
It's just...

708
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:40,313
There's something nice about the thought
of being rocked to sleep in water.

709
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,414
No mocking?

710
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:46,361
No freudian analysis of

711
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,946
how the waterbed's really a great
big vagina I want to crawl into?

712
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,617
I'm ignoring you
because you make me sad.

713
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:55,119
He's on ampicillin,

714
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,747
which means if it was listeria,
he'd have shown some improvement.

715
00:33:57,907 --> 00:33:59,288
No, it's a whole thing.

716
00:33:59,408 --> 00:34:02,258
You need special sheets and insurance...

717
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:03,252
Who cares?

718
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:05,952
You wanted one your whole life.

719
00:34:06,072 --> 00:34:07,179
You're a grown-up.

720
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:08,925
You can afford it.
Stores sell them.

721
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:11,740
Most adults don't go through life
like you do, house,

722
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,605
indulging our every whim.

723
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,765
You don't deserve to be happy.

724
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:18,351
And yet I am. You?

725
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:26,275
Amber'll think it's stupid.

726
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:31,596
It is stupid.

727
00:34:37,123 --> 00:34:38,621
Live the dream, wilson.

728
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:43,501
It's not an infection.

729
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,586
It's an allergy.

730
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:48,484
That's why it's not responding
to antibiotics.

731
00:34:48,604 --> 00:34:50,000
This isn't a soap opera, house.

732
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,593
People don't just wake up from comas
the second you give 'em drugs.

733
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:54,982
Especially if we give him
the wrong drugs.

734
00:34:55,102 --> 00:34:56,240
What do the tests say?

735
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,791
It was negative for fungus and
parasites, but that doesn't mean...

736
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,351
The more infections we rule out,

737
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:02,469
the more likely it is that
it's not an infection.

738
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:04,479
He has no history
of allergies or asthma.

739
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,042
Most importantly, none of his symptoms
remotely resemble an allergic reaction.

740
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:10,543
Allergens could trigger
an allergic vasculitis.

741
00:35:10,663 --> 00:35:13,166
- That would explain the symptoms.
- One in a million times.

742
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:15,167
Septic infection always
explains his symptoms.

743
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:18,043
But an infection is never
resistant to every antibiotic.

744
00:35:18,163 --> 00:35:19,666
No, infection is rarely resistant.

745
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:22,122
And allergy never
responds to antibiotics.

746
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:24,500
Never beats rarely. Qed, i win.

747
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,849
There were chrysanthemums
in his dressing room.

748
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:29,361
My god, why didn't you say he'd been
exposed to plant life.

749
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,102
Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrin.

750
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:33,300
It's a neurotoxin and a known allergen.

751
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,568
He has an infection.

752
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:36,929
If we give him steroids, we'll kill him.

753
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:39,473
He has allergy. If we don't
give him steroids, we'll kill him.

754
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:40,601
Not as fast.

755
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,166
Fast enough. You don't have
time for the rest of the tests.

756
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:46,189
We have to do something. And what
we're doing right now isn't working.

757
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,717
100 milligrams methylprednisolone.

758
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:53,502
Patients' names?

759
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:54,906
It's one patient.

760
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:57,945
You want to give one
patient 100 milligrams?

761
00:35:58,065 --> 00:35:59,398
That'll jumpstart a car.

762
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:02,205
Perfect,'cause my
patient's a'69 ford coma.

763
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:05,196
Anything over 50 milligrams,
I need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy.

764
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:07,125
It's protocol.
And the inspector's here.

765
00:36:07,286 --> 00:36:11,005
I am 99% certain that she'll consent.

766
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:13,501
But for the sake of the 1%
why don't I just...

767
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:15,595
You're not allowed back here.

768
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,054
Well, tell the inspector
he can put it on my tab.

769
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:25,097
I didn't mean now.

770
00:36:33,764 --> 00:36:37,623
100 milligrams of methylprednisolone
is an overdose.

771
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:39,448
We were wrong about the infection.

772
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:41,873
He's suffering from
a severe allergic reaction.

773
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:43,871
The team hasn't finished
the test for allergy.

774
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:46,316
- His symptoms don't...
- In rare cases...

775
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,044
Trust me, at the end of
this conversation, i'm right.

776
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:51,255
Then confirm it.

777
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,535
Get a blood test.

778
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:55,739
What is it about this severe
and deepening coma

779
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,718
that makes you think we got
time for protocol?

780
00:36:57,878 --> 00:36:59,722
Protocol has saved your
patient from having

781
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:02,056
his thyroid destroyed
and his blood drained.

782
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:05,338
If you think I'm wrong,
tell me I'm wrong.

783
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:07,019
Don't talk about protocol.

784
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,235
My job's on the line.

785
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:14,277
Your job is on the line.

786
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:18,902
Okay, here's what you do.

787
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:21,242
you wait three minutes,

788
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,286
then you call security.

789
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,971
By the time they get here
and lock me up, i'll be done.

790
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,199
He gets to live.

791
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:29,667
Your ass gets to be covered.

792
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:37,800
If he dies, let me know...

793
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:40,839
So I can pack my things.

794
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:32,688
Tests were negative.

795
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:35,274
Patient's negative
for all floral allergies.

796
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:41,070
I'm gonna restart the antibiotics.

797
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:46,118
If he's still alive.

798
00:38:56,385 --> 00:38:58,119
Ampicillin, two grams, IV.

799
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:02,176
Why? The steroids worked.

800
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:05,056
- House was right.
- The test was negative.

801
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,505
He was still right.

802
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,159
It was an allergy.

803
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:10,184
To what?

804
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,613
Thank you.

805
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:18,734
I was wrong.

806
00:39:20,988 --> 00:39:22,378
You should've stopped me.

807
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:29,170
Heard about house's patient.

808
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:30,926
Bold move.

809
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,790
And you backed him.

810
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,042
He was right.

811
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:38,587
He wasn't even in the same
neighborhood as right.

812
00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:40,548
- The patient's alive.
- Okay,

813
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,700
The rules exist because 95% of the time

814
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,053
for 95% of the people, they're
the right thing to do.

815
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,576
And the other 5%?

816
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:50,274
Have to live by the same rules.

817
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:52,727
Because everybody thinks
they're in that 5%.

818
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:23,618
What are you doing out here?

819
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:27,976
I can't sleep.
I hate the waterbed.

820
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,402
I actually kind of like it.

821
00:40:34,938 --> 00:40:36,636
No, it's awful.

822
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:39,857
We're returning it tomorrow.

823
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:42,988
Okay.

824
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,873
I'm glad you got it though.

825
00:40:57,436 --> 00:40:58,743
Me too.

826
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,548
I hope they'll take it back.

827
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,305
They will.

828
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:16,805
You promised me you'd stop drinking.

829
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:19,998
Of course I'm drunk, Anna.

830
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,942
They told me you'd never wake up
from that coma.

831
00:41:23,102 --> 00:41:25,564
But how could you get
engaged to my sister?

832
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:31,676
We fell in love.

833
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:34,946
What do you want from me, Anna?

834
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,492
i'm just a man.

835
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,422
And I'm just a woman.

836
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:40,417
And as thrilled as I am about the lady

837
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:44,296
slipper being the best night club
port lawrence has ever seen...

838
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:03,357
- Hello?
- Don't hang up.

839
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,192
What was the verdict?

840
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,778
$200,000 fine.

841
00:42:08,928 --> 00:42:11,365
- You should've been fired.
- Good night, House.

842
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:13,188
There are bubbles in his glass.

843
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,995
- Can't this wait until-
- My patient

844
00:42:16,155 --> 00:42:17,621
is allergic to quinine.

845
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,618
And you got this from bubbles?

846
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:25,004
Symptoms started two months ago.

847
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:27,794
It's also when Brock started
downing gin and tonics

848
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:30,008
like a brit staving off malaria.

849
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:33,095
The gin was fake, the tonic was real.

850
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:36,441
And tonic water is loaded with quinine.

851
00:42:36,878 --> 00:42:38,022
Nice job.

852
00:42:40,802 --> 00:42:42,062
You should've been fired.

853
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:43,773
I'm taking back the tv.

854
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,025
- I saved his life.
- That wasn't the deal.

855
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:49,862
The contract clearly stated
no takesy backsies.

856
00:42:50,022 --> 00:42:51,822
- Good night, house.
- What are you wearing?

857
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:53,866
Good night, House.

858
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:55,537
Good night, Cuddy.
