1
00:00:04,056 --> 00:00:05,651
It's okay, Eileen.
I got this.

2
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:07,553
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. You get home.

3
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:09,446
Thanks, Danny.
See you in the morning.

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:10,718
I'll be here.

5
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:34,909
Food's gone, Daryl.
We're closed.

6
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,683
You wouldn't happen to have an
extra coat in there, would you?

7
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:40,706
- You're wearing a coat.
- A winter coat, man. It's cold.

8
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:42,636
Come on.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,593
Here.

10
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:56,560
Rangers?

11
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:59,102
You expect me to
wear this in Jersey?

12
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,686
Come on, man,
where's your sense of humor?

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,535
Good night, Daryl.

14
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:45,900
Go away.

15
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,888
That's not funny, freak.

16
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,395
No one is laughing, Daniel.

17
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,777
House - Season 05 Episode 15
"Unfaithful"

18
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:39,920
Synchro: ShalimarFox, mpm, IceFreak

19
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:58,135
www.house-fr.com

20
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,543
You doing anything Friday?

21
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:06,239
Taking a lovely young lady
to the philharmonic.

22
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:08,551
That your way of saying
you're having sex with a hooker?

23
00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:11,732
Two. Can't create a harmonic
with just one.

24
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,005
Well, I was hoping you might available
for Rachel's Simchat bat. It's a...

25
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,091
Jewish baby-naming ceremony,

26
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:20,846
a time-honored tradition dating
all the way back to the 1960s.

27
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:22,556
My house at 7:00.

28
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:26,560
It'll just be the Rabbi
and a few friends and some family.

29
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:28,545
Nothing like welcoming
a baby into the world

30
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,914
with a completely naked
display of hypocrisy.

31
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,612
There'll be plenty of wine

32
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:35,214
and nice people
you can quietly mock.

33
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,816
Wish I could, but I already
put down a deposit

34
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:39,343
on 16 crates of jell-o.

35
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:44,807
It's one evening.
I'd like you to be there.

36
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,683
Religious hokum, get sponge bath.

37
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,867
Can I get back to you?

38
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,463
Can I help you?

39
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:05,140
Just browsing. Thanks.

40
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,352
Happy to be underachieving again?

41
00:04:08,743 --> 00:04:11,000
Running the E.R.
is slacker heaven.

42
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:14,157
- Looking for anything in particular?
- Not anymore.

43
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,297
- Where's this guy?
- Why?

44
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,027
'Cause he's my next patient.

45
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:19,972
It'd be rude of me
not to introduce myself.

46
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:22,464
He's a drunk priest
who hallucinated Jesus.

47
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,723
- Afraid you might've missed something?
- Afraid you're everyone's time?

48
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,410
It's obviously either alcohol
or exhaustion.

49
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:31,292
So you admit you have no idea which?

50
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:35,024
I admit that I'm too busy to
care who you're screwing with.

51
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:41,880
Don't thank me. Just knowing
I can be of assistance is thanks enough.

52
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,746
You went out of your way
to pick him?

53
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,790
- This is nothing.
- There are no small cases.

54
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:53,834
Any guesses
where this joke is going?

55
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:57,963
- Could be psychomotor epilepsy...
- Could be alcohol.

56
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:00,301
Shouldn't we let the E.R.
rule the obvious out...

57
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,701
Could be atropine toxicity,
occipital lobe tumor.

58
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:04,806
You're not telling us something
about this case?

59
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,389
- Why would you think that?
- 'Cause you want to screw with us.

60
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,558
Or screw with
a hallucinating priest.

61
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:12,416
Both are possible.
There's only one way to find out.

62
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,105
Run an E.E.G. for epilepsy.
C.T. his brain for tumors.

63
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,174
Go check his House of God
for toxins.

64
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,028
Fourteen, hold up.

65
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:25,846
This department is broken,

66
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:28,975
And I'm not gonna take a real case
until it's fixed.

67
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,229
Job or relationship... your choice.

68
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,388
What?

69
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,745
To put it in terms
you might better understand,

70
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,922
If you don't split, you must quit.

71
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:43,008
The drug trial is over.
I'm out, she's out.

72
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,302
- Don't care.
- We're adults. We can handle this.

73
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,263
- You just have to give us a chance.
- No, you're not. No, you can't.

74
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:49,590
And no, I don't.

75
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:53,852
Mull it over. You got until
the end of this fake case to decide.

76
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,513
I wasn't drunk.

77
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,691
I had one or two drinks.

78
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:04,977
People often underestimate
alcohol's effect on their...

79
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,323
I was on my way to six.

80
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,867
I know how alcohol affects me.
This wasn't the alcohol.

81
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,974
You lived in Manhattan for 3 years.

82
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,956
Then a year in Oregon,
18 months in new Mexico,

83
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:16,792
less than a year in Wisconsin,
and now you've been living in Trenton

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,365
for the last 6 months.

85
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,336
Yep.

86
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,372
The more we know about you,
the more likely it is we can help you.

87
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,414
It's not medically relevant, so...

88
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:29,304
No way to know unless
you went to medical school.

89
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,742
Four years ago, a teen
in a youth group at my church

90
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,772
accused me of inappropriate contact.

91
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,364
I was innocent,
but the church decided to transfer me.

92
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:43,525
Said it would be easier
for all involved.

93
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,321
When the parishioners
at the new church got wind of why

94
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,633
I'd been transferred, they were...

95
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:50,231
unhappy

96
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:53,266
I was sent off again and again,

97
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:56,081
and how is any of that
medically relevant?

98
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:58,814
So the kid lied?

99
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:01,420
He was confused.

100
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,173
Confused whether
you molested him or not?

101
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:07,573
Okay, you wanted to know why
I moved around so much and I told you.

102
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,558
How about telling me
why I was hallucinating?

103
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:11,847
Syphilis could explain
the hallucination.

104
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,016
I'm not sexually active.

105
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:16,813
You don't have to admit
you did anything with the kid.

106
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,696
- You weren't always a priest.
- I wanted to be since I was 12.

107
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:22,191
I entered the seminary
when I was 17.

108
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,569
Maybe it wasn't a hallucination.
Maybe it really was Jesus.

109
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,405
- I'm not insane.
- Seeing Jesus makes you insane?

110
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,938
A bit of an odd attitude
coming from a priest.

111
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:34,440
Well, it's just a job now.
The fairy tale ended a long time ago.

112
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:40,272
You're a wuss, part wimp, part puss.

113
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,875
I have no choice.
I'm part of the ceremony.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,378
I thought you were
already circumcised.

115
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:47,591
It's one night for a friend.

116
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,465
What about the friend
who has two tickets

117
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,217
to see Brubeck at the blue note?

118
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:53,552
- I thought you had an orgy planned.
- I lied.

119
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,349
Are you lying about the tickets?

120
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:58,049
Yes, but only to save you
from yourself.

121
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:01,494
I'll be fine and so will Cuddy
if you don't show up.

122
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:03,913
I'm surprised she even invited you.

123
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:06,273
It is oddly flattering.

124
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,863
God, I'm so sick
of his stupid stunts.

125
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,362
Everybody has to put up
with their boss's stupid stunts.

126
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:15,401
No, they don't. There's H.R.,
there's Cuddy, there's other jobs.

127
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:16,954
House doesn't listen to H.R.

128
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,809
Cuddy will let him fire us
before she fires him, and

129
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,461
I don't want another job.

130
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,583
Why do you cling to him?
Why do you defend him?

131
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,213
Because I don't want to be unemployed
doesn't mean I'm codependent.

132
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm not saying you're codependent.
I'm saying you're scared.

133
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:35,961
You know what?

134
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,171
You're right.

135
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:41,542
- So you want to quit?
- No,

136
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:44,064
No, I want to stop a stupid stunt.

137
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:47,464
House doesn't want either
one of us to quit. He wants this.

138
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,238
He's got two lab rats in a maze
and thrown in one piece of cheese.

139
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:58,217
So what do we do?

140
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:00,622
Nothing.

141
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,157
- Cool.
- It's cool he's a child molester?

142
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:07,409
It's cool the priest
doesn't believe in God.

143
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:09,895
It's cool that God did to him
what he did to the kid.

144
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,171
Allegedly.

145
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:13,782
- You think he's innocent?
- He had honest eyes?

146
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:16,771
You think he's guilty, which explains
why you're dying to discharge him.

147
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:19,585
I'm dying discharge him`cause he's
not sick, not `cause he's a pedophile.

148
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,352
- Allegedly.
- You believe the kid got confused?

149
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,189
If everybody lies,
that includes teenage boys.

150
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:27,813
Aren't we lucky to have
such an interesting patient?

151
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,656
Had, there's nothing wrong with him.

152
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,423
The world's most boring case
just became a page turner.

153
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:35,319
- You want to tear out the last chapter?
- You want to examine his character,

154
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,547
go to a soup kitchen.
We are done testing him

155
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:39,161
for things he doesn't have.

156
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,594
Bad news for Foreman and Thirteen.

157
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:46,556
- Case is over.
- We're not splitting up.

158
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:50,714
- So which one of you is taking a hike?
- And neither of us is quitting.

159
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:53,071
Interesting.

160
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:55,224
You were fine
with Chase and Cameron dating.

161
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:58,222
- You obviously don't actually have...
- You're fired.

162
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,851
How long are you gonna keep this up?
We know you're...

163
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,019
Wrong...

164
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,020
Again.

165
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:08,899
In the last few weeks, it's hard
to remember a correct call you made.

166
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,339
If Chase had compromised
his professional judgment

167
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:13,631
to help Cameron,
I'd have fired his ass, too.

168
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:17,032
When my mistake blew up, you did
everything to keep me from contacting

169
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,077
- the drug company.
- To save your license, not your job

170
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:22,567
and definitely not
your relationship.

171
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:24,786
So, badge.

172
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,264
Fine.

173
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:46,199
Why don't you see
if you can find us a real case?

174
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:55,825
How can you discharge me when
you have no idea what's wrong?

175
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,657
We know what's wrong,
and now that you've slept it off...

176
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:02,441
It's not just a hallucination.
I feel nauseous.

177
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,887
My foot feels numb
like it's fallen asleep.

178
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,718
- You didn't mention that before.
- I didn't notice it before.

179
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:10,502
Are you hiding from someone?
Why are you so intent on staying here?

180
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,672
I don't feel well. I know there's
something wrong with me.

181
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,173
Which foot?

182
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:16,633
My left.

183
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:25,642
Oh, God.

184
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,504
What the hell is that?
What is that?

185
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,597
Your toe just fell off.

186
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,292
Must be my lucky day.

187
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,696
New symptom means the old
symptom was a real symptom,

188
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:46,532
and I get to keep
our pederast priest after all.

189
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,207
- Where are Foreman and Thirteen?
- They left.

190
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:52,266
Leprosy can cause necrosis
and hallucination.

191
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:54,375
- Why would they leave?
- Because Foreman

192
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,132
doesn't work here anymore,
and Thirteen

193
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,633
is mad that I fired him.

194
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:01,928
Don't worry. She'll be back.

195
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,306
She'll be pissed off.
She'll want to take a stand.

196
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,732
And he will convince her

197
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:08,092
that there's no reason both
of them should be out of a job.

198
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:09,353
Leprosy's a bad fit.

199
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,647
- Why'd you fire Foreman?
- I gave him a choice, split or quit.

200
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,427
He chose neither.

201
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,652
- What about ergotism?
- He's giving up his career for her?

202
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,488
He's giving up this career for her.

203
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,991
No, normal white blood count.
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

204
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,087
- They're good doctors.
- Separately, they're great doctors,

205
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,547
better than you.

206
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,271
Together, they're morons.

207
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:32,501
Check out the house that they would've
checked had this been a real case.

208
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,044
And page Thirteen. Tell her
to run the blood for C-O.

209
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,311
Get the priest in a hyperbaric chamber
before anything else falls off.

210
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,747
So what are we gonna do now?

211
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:47,968
I get a letter of recommendation
from Cuddy and find a new job.

212
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:50,195
Oh, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

213
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,839
House is right.

214
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,649
Our relationship
did affect my judgment.

215
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:57,915
Then I should quit.

216
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,070
It'll be easier for me
to find another job.

217
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,280
Not like this one.

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,868
- We should both quit.
- What's that gonna accomplish?

219
00:13:08,407 --> 00:13:09,704
Don't worry.

220
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,164
I'll be fine.

221
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,245
We'll be fine.

222
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:28,308
Go ahead.

223
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,819
I'll see you tonight?

224
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,378
I'll be home early.

225
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,600
You really think House
is done with Foreman?

226
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:43,767
If you ask me, Foreman
should be done with Thirteen.

227
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:47,284
He's not gonna get a better job,
Which means he'll end up resenting her

228
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,701
for losing this one,
which she'll end up resenting.

229
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:51,830
Or the hardship'll bring 'em
closer together.

230
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,207
She'll invite friends over
for Foreman to share.

231
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,964
- No leaks in the heater.
- She's not a nympho.

232
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,087
She's bisexual,
which, by the way, means

233
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,048
she's accustomed to partners who don't
need a map to find the treasure.

234
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:06,323
C-O poisoning might have come
from these cigarettes.

235
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,597
Not unless he was smoking them
in a bell jar.

236
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,280
Even if you know where the treasure is,
it can still be pretty hard

237
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:13,987
- to dig it up without a shovel.
- You can buy a shovel.

238
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:25,542
Let's see...

239
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,250
how do I keep House from ruining

240
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,576
my precious display
of religious hypocrisy?

241
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,354
I know, I'll pressure him to attend,

242
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:36,041
knowing that he'll never agree
to anything I actually want him to do.

243
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,455
I didn't pressure you.
I invited you.

244
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,525
And there's nothing hypocritical
about recognizing your heritage.

245
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,214
So you keeping kosher now,

246
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:47,284
wearing four-cornered garments,
slaughtering heifers to the God Ra?

247
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:49,933
Wait, is that one your people?

248
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:53,391
Do it all, do nothing, or option "c":
you're a liar and a hypocrite.

249
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,675
For better or for worse,
you are a part of my life.

250
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,515
It isn't a ploy.

251
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,037
It's a sincere invitation.
I honestly want you to come.

252
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,073
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

253
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,699
I'm glad.

254
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:17,885
You idiot.

255
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:22,132
I was free and clear.
Now he's coming, and it's your fault.

256
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:24,168
Since when have your failed attempts

257
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,834
at communication through lies
become my fault?

258
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,239
Since you forgot
how to keep your mouth shut.

259
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:33,009
You messed it up,
and now you're gonna fix it.

260
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:34,891
And you're gonna keep
my name out of it.

261
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:39,866
How is he?

262
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:41,985
Stable. Necrosis doesn't look
to be spreading.

263
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,862
I was talking about Foreman.
Is he really gonna leave?

264
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,903
That'swhat people do
when they get fired.

265
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,785
Why are you biting my head off?
I was asking what he was gonna do.

266
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,907
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.

267
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,536
It's not House's fault either.
He gave you a chance, you blew it.

268
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,466
He didn't give a chance,
but an ultimatum.

269
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:59,446
I would've thought 5 years
here would buy a mistake or two.

270
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,626
Help me!

271
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,338
Help me!

272
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,053
I can't breathe!
Feels like something's on my chest!

273
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:13,969
Looks like a heart attack.

274
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:24,517
I assume you've heard.

275
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:28,235
I can't override him.

276
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,118
I'm not asking you to override him.

277
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:32,363
I'm asking for a letter
of recommendation.

278
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:35,462
Eric, the reality here is...

279
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:37,954
House should've fired you.

280
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:39,909
You falsified medical records,

281
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:42,586
put this hospital's reputation
in jeopardy.

282
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,794
You're lucky
you still have a license.

283
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,758
I can't get a decent position at another
hospital without a recommendation.

284
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:54,889
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,097
Chest pain wasn't angina.

286
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:01,819
Ekg ruled out heart attack.

287
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:04,564
So the good news is,
he didn't have a heart attack.

288
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:06,928
The bad news is,
I apparently fired the only guy

289
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:09,447
who actually knows
what a heart attack looks like.

290
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:12,271
So the man of God who doesn't believe
in God had a heart attack

291
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:13,844
that isn't a heart attack.

292
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,909
Do I know how to pick
awesome cases or what?

293
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:17,986
Could be a clotting disorder.

294
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:19,829
3 different symptoms,
3 different clots?

295
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,797
I know.
How cool is that?

296
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,675
You two do an angio.

297
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:30,158
You don't want to work, so why don't you
just go get me a lottery ticket?

298
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,295
The sicker he gets,
the luckier I feel.

299
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,920
Where are you going?

300
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,796
I've been wanting
to introduce myself.

301
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,563
Are you really a virgin?

302
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:48,694
You have to treat me,
not to believe me.

303
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,361
And before we treat you,
we have to diagnose you.

304
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,950
Not knowing whether we can believe you
is making that difficult.

305
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:55,659
Everything I've told you is true.

306
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:59,661
You lost your faith
because a teenager got confused?

307
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,288
And the church abandoned me,
and my God forsook me,

308
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,860
and couldn't come up with a reason
why God would do that.

309
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,168
God gave the church
and the kid free will.

310
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,671
Their exercise
of that free will hurt you.

311
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,930
Means you're just a victim
of god's gift to mankind. Oh, yeah.

312
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,751
God wants life to have meaning.
Life's meaningless without free will.

313
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,514
With free will,
there's always suffering.

314
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,059
So God wants suffering.
I got tired of that argument

315
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,059
before I even finished saying it.

316
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:27,645
And even if I bought that,
what the hell is God doing?

317
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,334
Just the big stuff?

318
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,609
The acts of God, the hurricanes,
the earthquakes,

319
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,070
the random killings of millions
of innocent people.

320
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,030
Then we better damn pray.

321
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:40,034
God, I wish you weren't a pedophile.

322
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,663
Lungs are clean.
No embolism.

323
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,331
No pleurisy, no pneumonia.

324
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,545
I'm sorry.
This is gonna hurt.

325
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:48,960
No, it's fine.

326
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,553
- No pain at all?
- No.

327
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:53,493
Why?

328
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:55,318
Because there should be.

329
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:57,594
You feel that?

330
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:01,649
Regional anesthesia
is a new symptom.

331
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,059
Not if the chest pain
is related to the numbness.

332
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,353
It's not circulatory. It's neurological.
Run a nerve-conduction study.

333
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:08,875
And be careful.

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,597
If you kill him, he'll be
dancing with the dark one.

335
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,194
Why the hell are you going
to Cuddy's baby naming?

336
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:19,869
It's a religious ceremony.
It's boring.

337
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:21,869
Why waste which
that could be much better spent

338
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,613
in a drunken stupor
feeling sorry for yourself?

339
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,631
Okay?
Okay, you won't go?

340
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:30,112
Okay, your obligation
to Cuddy is fulfilled.

341
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:33,326
- Why are you doing this?
- Why did Hillary conquer Everest?

342
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:36,067
You always have a reason.
It's usually a bad one, but a reason.

343
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:39,364
- She's being childish.
- An example from the bad category.

344
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:41,668
Is it resentment?
The stork brought home a new baby,

345
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:43,600
and you don't want to share mommy?
Or you...

346
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,683
just can't stand
to see others happy?

347
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,351
She's trying to play me. If I let her
succeed, the terrorists win.

348
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:58,571
I heard there might be
an opening in the e.r.

349
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:01,366
Foreman's a neurologist.
That's not where he...

350
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,159
I did an e.r. rotation in Miami.

351
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,412
If I can find another position,
I figure House will rehire Foreman.

352
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,171
Don't quit.

353
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:10,197
Cuddy wouldn't give him
a recommendation.

354
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:13,169
- He's not able to find a decent job.
- Foreman shouldn't leave either.

355
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,037
You think they should split up?

356
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,126
Office romances are a bad idea.

357
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:21,907
We beat some very long odds.

358
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,429
Why don't you save
the gushy stuff for the wedding?

359
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:26,297
House is playing.
If you let him get away,

360
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:28,977
- he's not gonna respect you anyway.
- Or House is helping you.

361
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:33,090
He knows it probably won't work out.
And he's actually doing you a favor.

362
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,927
Yeah, that sounds
a lot more like House.

363
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:39,238
I know they're looking
for someone at Mercy. I'll make a call.

364
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:44,091
- Your boss always like that?
- Usually worse.

365
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:47,069
Finding a fellow atheist
always makes his day.

366
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,810
Think it's possible
maybe God's testing your faith?

367
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:51,058
No, I already failed.

368
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,542
There'd be no point
in what he's doing to me now.

369
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:56,246
Got something.
Looks like intercostal neuralgia.

370
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,471
What's that?

371
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:59,528
Something's traumatizing
one of the nerves

372
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:01,050
that runs along your ribs.

373
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,354
Explains the chest pain and numbness.
Could also cause muscle atrophy.

374
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,723
- Does it do anything to the eyes?
- Why? What's wrong?

375
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,310
Are you seeing jesus again?

376
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,435
I'm seeing nothing.
My right eye went blind.

377
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,244
Ophthalmological exam's normal.
Nothing structurally wrong with the eye.

378
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:19,593
His heart rate's down.

379
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:22,448
Sensory loss is becoming more diffuse,
progressive muscle weakness

380
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,699
- He's shutting down.
- It's got to be systemic,

381
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,248
like autoimmune.

382
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,000
- CSF was clear for guillain-barre.
- Cancer?

383
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,966
Imaging studies have been clear
for tumors.

384
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:37,539
Then that leaves infection.

385
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,422
He'd be brimming
with white blood cells.

386
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,301
Or we are at the backstage door
of a Duran Duran concert.

387
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:46,215
Hundreds of screaming girls
clustered around.

388
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,182
- What does that mean?
- That girls like rock bands.

389
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,454
The presence of the fans
indicates the presence of the band.

390
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:54,854
Different night...
same band, same door.

391
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:57,690
Now there's not a girl in sight.
What does that mean?

392
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,452
Sorry, I don't speak hair band.

393
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:01,630
They weren't a hair band.
They were new romantics.

394
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,299
- The band already left?
- Nope, the band's still there,

395
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,012
still rocking out.

396
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:09,619
When does the absence of the fans
not indicate the absence of the band?

397
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,462
- When it's 2009.
- There aren't any Duran Duran fans.

398
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:18,004
They don't make them anymore.
If there's no infection,

399
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,380
it's because there aren't
any fans, no white cells.

400
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,007
You think...

401
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,597
his spleen?

402
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:28,120
Why do I bother with these metaphors
if I still have to spell it out?

403
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:30,431
Yes, I think it's his spleen.
Go get a biopsy.

404
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,182
I'll try to get new moon on Monday
out of my head.

405
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,787
Why are you talking this time?

406
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,445
If I quit, will you rehire Foreman?

407
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,157
- Why?
- He can't find another job. I can.

408
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,540
You're willing to make
that sacrifice for him?

409
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:55,373
Foreman know about this plan?

410
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,773
If he's okay with it,
who am I to say no?

411
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:11,376
Hold still.

412
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,540
You think it's my spleen?

413
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,970
That's what they're testing.

414
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,329
So if I happen to cure you,
what happens then?

415
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:28,188
You start thinking that God
was working through me?

416
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:29,880
This is some sort of miracle?

417
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:31,534
Do you think I'm an idiot?

418
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:33,538
That's what I'm testing.

419
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:36,562
Losing my faith
wasn't a choice I made.

420
00:23:36,687 --> 00:23:38,752
It happened.
It's gone for good.

421
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,218
But if it can magically disappear,
it can magically reappear,

422
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,565
and that's what you're hoping.

423
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,924
- Your job...
- Sucks.

424
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:48,854
That's my point.

425
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,526
You can make more money
frapping decafs,

426
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:53,953
and yet you're still ministering
to the meek.

427
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,934
Why do the Lord's work
if the Lord has left the building?

428
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,563
I've been with the church my entire
adult life. It's my marketable skill.

429
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:03,538
I detect the stink
of leftover faith.

430
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,778
You want to talk hypocrisy,
what about you?

431
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:09,916
You act like you don't care
about anyone,

432
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,137
but here you are saving lives.

433
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,309
Solving puzzles.

434
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:16,814
Saving lives
is just collateral damage.

435
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,132
Yeah, nice try.

436
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,279
You're not looking
for somebody to prove you right.

437
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:23,795
I think you're looking for somebody
to prove you wrong, to give you hope.

438
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:28,424
You want to believe, don't you?

439
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:35,723
I want to walk out and find myself
in a forest of whore trees,

440
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,644
but I don't think it's a good idea
to tell people to fornicate with fruit.

441
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,170
I was just talking about you...

442
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:52,384
not you specifically...
whores and hypocrisy.

443
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:54,779
You were right.

444
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:56,367
I don't want you there.

445
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:59,886
It's a special occasion
filled with love and acceptance,

446
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:02,041
and the last thing I need

447
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,868
is someone there who's filled
with loathing and contempt.

448
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:10,800
That's it?

449
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,178
You're really not coming?

450
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm really not coming.

451
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:21,308
You're welcome.

452
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,063
Gosh, I feel so grown up.

453
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:30,201
He's obviously just jerking you around,
wants to see if you're serious.

454
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,446
If you stick it out,
I think he'll bring Foreman back.

455
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,908
I don't, and even if I'm wrong,
I think you should still split up.

456
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:38,077
It's a matter of time
before one of you

457
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,288
finds the other in bed
with another woman.

458
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,583
- From the relationship expert.
- 12 years and counting.

459
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,085
Hey, if you can make it
that long, then anyone can.

460
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,772
Funny how the 2 people in the room

461
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:50,590
who think relationships are easy
are both single.

462
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,049
I don't think they're.

463
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:54,343
That's why if you find
something that could be good,

464
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,873
- you should hang on to it.
- Everything could be good.

465
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,500
Very lite ever is.

466
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,400
His spleen is fine, just some
insignificant traces of minor bugs.

467
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:04,228
- Nothing that'd make him sick.
- Which minor bugs?

468
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:10,484
Why do people suddenly find
religion when they have kids?

469
00:26:10,872 --> 00:26:12,372
Fear of the unknown.

470
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,707
Cornerstone of faith.

471
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:17,485
I think it makes perfect sense.

472
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,120
So it makes sense
because it doesn't make sense.

473
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:23,581
The fact that you're railing about it
doesn't make a lot of sense.

474
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,629
You really got a thing
for your boss, huh?

475
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,004
I've got a thing
for my boss's thing.

476
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:33,136
She doesn't have a thing... per se.

477
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:35,182
I'm big on metaphors.

478
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:37,793
What about you?

479
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:39,468
29 years of celibacy.

480
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:41,474
What's holding you back now?

481
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,113
Who wants a relationship
with a priest?

482
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:45,895
Who wants a relationship?

483
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,072
It's the holy water.

484
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,471
We assumed if it was an infection,
it had to be something big and nasty.

485
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:01,403
But he has pneumocystis,

486
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:04,361
a harmless bug that's everywhere
and never makes anyone sick,

487
00:27:04,486 --> 00:27:06,540
unless they have
a compromised immune system.

488
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,534
So father Nietzsche has aids.

489
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:22,446
Impossible.

490
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:24,825
I've never had a blood transfusion.

491
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,186
I've never done i.v. drugs.
I've never had sex.

492
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,289
So prove it. Have an aids test.

493
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,649
I know I don't have.

494
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,889
We can't treat you
until we know what it is.

495
00:27:34,014 --> 00:27:37,354
A negative result proves nothing.
On the off chance it's a false positive,

496
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,592
I permanently lose any credibility
I have left.

497
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:42,952
- I'd say you just lost that.
- I lost that with you a long time ago.

498
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,659
- We should start treatment.
- We need to be sure.

499
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:52,211
The antiretrovirals could fry his heart,
his liver, his kidneys.

500
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,297
- I'm willing to take that chance.
- Big of you.

501
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,087
I'm worried
about the kid he molested.

502
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:57,630
We should be getting him tested.

503
00:27:57,755 --> 00:28:00,434
- You don't think he already got tested?
- Maybe he did, maybe he didn't,

504
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,417
But that's a chance
I'm not willing to take.

505
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:04,836
Legally, we can't inform
sexual partners about Stds.

506
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:07,541
This isn't some middle-aged
barfly who likes it bareback.

507
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,398
This is an innocent kid
who was molested.

508
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,202
You want to rub
the priest's face in it,

509
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:12,934
- Get him transferred again.
- Yeah,

510
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,359
heaven forbid,
a diddler has job issues.

511
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,361
And you get brought up on charges.

512
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:21,198
I've lost enough doctors this week.
Treat him for AIDS.

513
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:25,817
I found a job.

514
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:28,524
I didn't know you were looking.

515
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:30,791
Eggers at Mercy
says I can start monday.

516
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:34,025
- Why would you...
- House says if I go, you can come back.

517
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,871
It's been less than two days.

518
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,707
Give up on me that fast?
You get a job behind my back?

519
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:40,509
You're acting like
I'm cheating on you.

520
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,527
I said I would handle this.

521
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:45,389
House knew you'd be like this.

522
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,715
I guess House knows me
better than you do.

523
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,190
Too bad I don't go both ways.

524
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:56,650
Good night.

525
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,909
Don't you hate when they put the
mushrooms underneath the cheese?

526
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:08,537
Your attendance
is validating her hypocrisy.

527
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,905
If she invited you
to a ceremonial lynching,

528
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,030
would you go?

529
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:15,468
It would depend
on what she was serving.

530
00:29:15,593 --> 00:29:16,840
Everyone's a hypocrite.

531
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,299
Why are you suddenly so obsessed
with Cuddy's particular brand?

532
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,156
Just making conversation.

533
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:25,179
Would you rather we go back to
talking about mushrooms and cheese?

534
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,528
You're the hypocrite!
You want to go!

535
00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:31,227
You don't resent this baby.
You want to be a part of it.

536
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,896
Yes, but not until
her 16th birthday...

537
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,731
- In some states.
- This is ridiculous.

538
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:37,705
You two deserve each other.
If you want to go,

539
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,194
just go and act like a human being.

540
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,279
Wow, solid advice.

541
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,548
Except for two things.
I'm acting like I don't want to go

542
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,284
because I don't want to go, and...

543
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,452
I am incapable of acting
like a human being.

544
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:06,554
Ryan?

545
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,059
I'm Dr. Chris Taub.
Can we talk?

546
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,645
Yeah.
What's wrong?

547
00:30:16,018 --> 00:30:16,856
In private?

548
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,525
Nobody's listening to us here.

549
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,405
I work at
Princeton Plainsboro hospital.

550
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,573
I have some news
about Father Daniel Bresson.

551
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:28,784
What about him?

552
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,164
We believe he has AIDS.

553
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:35,875
Okay, so?

554
00:30:37,213 --> 00:30:38,218
Well...

555
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:41,096
Given the incident four years ago,

556
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:42,776
I think you should be tested,

557
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:44,341
unless you've already done so.

558
00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:50,890
How sick is he?

559
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,058
Very.

560
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:55,444
Okay.
Well, thanks.

561
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,689
Have you been tested?

562
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,027
And?

563
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:06,780
And it really isn't any
of your business.

564
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:21,212
I want my job back.

565
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:26,342
Love, sacrifice, deception,

566
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,886
and now betrayal.

567
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,596
This is better than a telenovela.

568
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,533
- What's going on?
- Well...

569
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:34,850
Either Foreman is here,
as the two of you discussed,

570
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:37,911
to beg for his job back
in exchange for me dumping you.

571
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:39,036
Or...

572
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,606
nothing.

573
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:45,903
- You're trying to get me fired?
- I'm suggesting you quit

574
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,822
and I stay, which is exactly
what you suggested last night.

575
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,534
- I told Eggers I didn't want the job.
- Find another one.

576
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:53,973
Only took you eight hours
to find that one.

577
00:31:54,098 --> 00:31:55,120
The point is...

578
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,057
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?

579
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,229
- Why are you here without me?
- you're overreacting.

580
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:01,257
- We'll talk later.
- That's what this is about.

581
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:03,632
It's about you taking control.
It's about you not being able

582
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,089
to handle me saving your ass.

583
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,140
And you're not
being controlling right now?

584
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,677
Who's the controlling bitch now?

585
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:10,844
House, shut up.

586
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:14,454
You never wanted to take
that other job.

587
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:16,155
You never wanted to save me.

588
00:32:16,431 --> 00:32:18,852
You wanted to offer to save me
so you wouldn't feel guilty.

589
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:20,688
You knew I'd say no.

590
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,148
That's why you're so mad right now.

591
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:27,653
You're an idiot.

592
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:37,746
Either you can go after
her and try and patch things up,

593
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,250
or you blow her off
and take your old job back.

594
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:55,633
Welcome back.

595
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:02,979
AIDS meds aren't gonna work.

596
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:06,650
If you'd let us do a test, we could stop
treating you, or you could stop lying.

597
00:33:09,274 --> 00:33:10,946
I know the feeling.

598
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,788
BP's climbing.
You feeling okay?

599
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:15,270
No, I feel flushed.

600
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,526
Ah, I'm burning all over.

601
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,073
Ah, my chest.

602
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,258
It's not a new symptom. It's
just a reaction to the AIDS meds.

603
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:28,385
He reacted by getting worse.
Means it's not AIDS.

604
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,529
So went Satan forth
from the presence of the Lord

605
00:33:31,654 --> 00:33:34,196
and smote job sore with boils.

606
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:36,555
You think it's hyper-IGE syndrome?

607
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,322
I prefer the colloquial term
"job syndrome."

608
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:41,606
Explains the symptoms, and my quote.

609
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:43,886
That's the first thing I checked.
IGE levels are normal.

610
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:45,648
Could be some other
genetic disorder.

611
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:48,484
Cerebral microtumors could explain
the blindness and the hallucinations.

612
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,386
We didn't find any tumors.

613
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:52,858
That's why I didn't say "tumors."
I said "microtumors."

614
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:56,283
So your explanation doesn't depend
on us being major morons, just morons?

615
00:33:58,093 --> 00:34:00,114
- We should start genetic testing.
- Takes too long.

616
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,156
- So we start treatment.
- Treatment is surgery.

617
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:03,773
We can't without confirmation.

618
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:05,959
So your position is we can't
test and we can't treat?

619
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,711
My position is you're wrong.

620
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,463
This isn't gonna work.

621
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:12,132
Are you kidding?
I've never felt more alive.

622
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,678
Conflict breeds creativity.
Go run the genetic tests.

623
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:17,006
On it.

624
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,355
So now you don't think I have AIDS?

625
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,097
I still think it's AIDS.
But on the off chance it isn't,

626
00:34:29,222 --> 00:34:31,110
We're pursuing other avenues.

627
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:37,366
Ryan.

628
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:42,515
He's...

629
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,497
he's dying?

630
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,207
We don't know what's wrong with him.

631
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,668
- Can I speak to him?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

632
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:53,788
Why don't I get you...

633
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:56,313
Come on, Ryan,
now's not a good ti...

634
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:06,937
I'm sorry...

635
00:35:13,138 --> 00:35:14,388
for everything.

636
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:23,457
I'm sorry.

637
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:41,806
I know.

638
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:45,383
I know.

639
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:07,206
Any second thoughts about Cuddy?

640
00:36:07,827 --> 00:36:08,831
Nope.

641
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,627
But please, feel free to blather on.

642
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:14,143
Raising a child on her own is scary.

643
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:16,457
She's just doing what you do,

644
00:36:16,582 --> 00:36:18,706
what everyone does...
Trying to avoid pain.

645
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:20,644
Religion is not the opiate
of the masses.

646
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:23,185
Religion is the placebo
of the masses.

647
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,140
If you're saying
she's not a hypocrite...

648
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,019
I'm not.
I'm trying to give you

649
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,559
a rational reason

650
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:30,646
to overlook her hypocrisy

651
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,145
so you don't feel
like a hypocrite for going.

652
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,853
Sorry. Continue.

653
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:40,656
Even if an absolute truth exists,
we can't know all of it,

654
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:43,924
and you can't condemn her
for recognizing that.

655
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:05,430
Are you eliminating symptoms?

656
00:37:05,882 --> 00:37:07,850
We can know everything.

657
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,227
This is medicine, not metaphysics.

658
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,979
Truth is truth.

659
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:19,334
- it fits.
- it doesn't fit.

660
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,864
You can't eliminate a symptom.

661
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:24,032
I can if it's not a symptom.

662
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,242
Well, what is it?

663
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:27,037
Not a symptom.

664
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:38,171
You're not gonna die.

665
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,218
You have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

666
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:45,637
It impairs your immune system,

667
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,849
makes you susceptible to all the AIDS
stuff without actually having AIDS.

668
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:52,185
And you didn't catch it.
You were born with it.

669
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,953
Another gift from god.

670
00:37:56,627 --> 00:37:59,128
- You sure?
- Genetic test should confirm it,

671
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:01,147
but it explains all your symptoms...

672
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,273
Toe, chest, eyes, skin.

673
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:04,948
What about my hallucination?

674
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:07,636
Scotch explains that.

675
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:13,498
But that was just a coincidence.

676
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:18,276
Coincidences do happen.

677
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:25,028
That coincidence is what brought me
to you in the first place.

678
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,321
You promised you wouldn't go there.

679
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:33,613
Einstein said,

680
00:38:34,216 --> 00:38:37,266
"coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous."

681
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,650
A woman in Florida said,

682
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,152
"look, Jesus
is on my cheese sandwich."

683
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:44,745
You didn't even want
to take my case.

684
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,115
You didn't even think I was sick.

685
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:51,046
The fact that I was wrong
is not a proof of God.

686
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,384
I'm just trying to understand

687
00:38:57,509 --> 00:39:00,909
how my life could completely
turn around in a single day.

688
00:39:04,056 --> 00:39:07,556
Don't worry. Your life will go back
to sucking soon enough.

689
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,552
Everything that happened to you

690
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:13,058
can be rationally explained.

691
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,339
I know.

692
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:17,428
It's just...

693
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:24,569
That's a lot of coincidences.

694
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:43,975
House was right about the priest.

695
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,883
Genetic test confirmed
it was Wiskott-Aldrich.

696
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,593
And I would've discharged him.

697
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,013
Everybody would've discharged him,
House included.

698
00:39:52,404 --> 00:39:54,182
He only took that case as a stall.

699
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,060
And yet it was a real case,
and he solved it.

700
00:39:57,987 --> 00:40:00,564
But by violating his own principles

701
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,983
and ignoring the admitting symptoms.

702
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,068
Still he somehow got away with it.

703
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,534
Saved another life.

704
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:12,284
You want him there tonight.

705
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,380
You should tell him.

706
00:40:39,154 --> 00:40:40,344
It's cold out there.

707
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:42,314
At least you have shoes
that cover your toes.

708
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,152
So it's tonight?

709
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,719
Bad weather for it, huh?

710
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,528
Maybe you'll get lucky.

711
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:54,833
Maybe your sister will decide
the roads are...

712
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,203
too dangerous to drive on.

713
00:40:57,694 --> 00:40:58,975
Fingers crossed.

714
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,713
Have fun.
