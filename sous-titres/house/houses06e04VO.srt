1
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:25,669
Mr. Randall?

2
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,160
They're here.

3
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:47,325
$52 million includes over $6 million

4
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,924
already issued pursuant
to the over-allotment option.

5
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,372
- When can we close?
- It would be subject

6
00:00:52,497 --> 00:00:54,955
to regulatory approval
in both Toronto and...

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,056
I didn't say, "how", Oliver.
I said, "when".

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,517
What?

9
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:02,366
You sure this is a direction
you want to go, Roy?

10
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:05,059
This would move us
from energy service into...

11
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:07,809
- You don't think oil's going up?
- Of course it's gonna go up.

12
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,020
- The question is when.
- It's always when,

13
00:01:10,145 --> 00:01:12,581
and if we wait until the deal
makes sense to everyone else,

14
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,074
we'll be waiting in line
behind everyone else.

15
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:16,784
All I'm saying is...

16
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,702
The same cover-your-ass crap
you always say.

17
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:22,608
We have to wrap this up.
I gotta go.

18
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,125
- Where?
- Upstairs.

19
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,794
Get the regulators on it.
I wanna close by end of the month.

20
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:29,798
- There are 10 other items.
- Which will have to wait.

21
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,882
You can't drag us all
out of the office,

22
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,343
get halfway through,
and then just kick us out.

23
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,611
Yeah, I can.

24
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:05,288
The antibiotic treatment
had no effect.

25
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,631
Both the fever and the pain
are getting worse,

26
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,250
which means
it's not Clostridium difficile.

27
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:13,870
But you said that was
the only diagnosis that made sense.

28
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:14,995
It was.

29
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,683
We need to get him to a hospital.

30
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:18,689
Dad?

31
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,311
I don't wanna go.

32
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,345
I know, buddy.

33
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:29,810
But we may need to.

34
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,234
Am I gonna die?

35
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,504
Of course not.

36
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,334
How do you know?

37
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,379
I just do.

38
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,081
And I'm always right, aren't I?

39
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,248
I want House.

40
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,583
I understand, but I told you

41
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,236
Dr. House isn't available.

42
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,253
Call him.

43
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,826
Tell him I'll have a private jet

44
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:37,826
- pick him up from whatever island...
- He isn't on vacation.

45
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,760
Dr. Foreman's
one of our best doctors.

46
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,178
Is House in jail?

47
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:45,307
Foreman is working with two
of House's most veteran associates.

48
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,710
Rehab?

49
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:51,605
Mr. Randall, your son
will be in good hands.

50
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,773
My son...

51
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:57,820
has already been in good hands,
and he's still dying.

52
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,410
I'm through dealing with good.

53
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,052
I want the best
and everyone I've asked

54
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,326
says that's House.

55
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,582
So unless he's dead,

56
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:07,788
comatose,

57
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:10,489
or insane,
I want him treating my son...

58
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:12,751
today.

59
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:21,444
You could have said no
in good conscience.

60
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:23,652
The kid'll still be
Foreman's patient,

61
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,639
but his dad wants you
making the decisions.

62
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:28,467
Then he's not my patient.
You want to give me

63
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:30,810
none of the responsibility
and all of the liability?

64
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:33,028
Which means I get...

65
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:35,649
Cool.

66
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,777
Don't let him do anything crazy.

67
00:04:39,977 --> 00:04:42,779
When does he get his license back
so we can stop playing this game?

68
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,117
Maybe never.
This game is fun.

69
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,621
You also need to prepare
president Dibala's case

70
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,734
for this week's
morbidity and mortality conference.

71
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,382
Unfortunately I'm overdue
a mani-pedi appointment.

72
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,546
Not you.
Foreman's department.

73
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:00,257
Right.
He's got all the time in the world.

74
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,759
We made the wrong call.
He died.

75
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,407
There's nothing to present.

76
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:06,409
It obviously garnered
a lot of curiosity.

77
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,390
And we don't have
more important things to do

78
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,851
than satisfy
everyone's idle curiosity?

79
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,135
It's not idle.

80
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:15,535
The question of how we deal
with two possible diagnoses

81
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,400
whose treatments are contraindicated
is worth discussing.

82
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,822
Abdominal pain
increasing in severity and frequency,

83
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,366
fever, dehydration,

84
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,140
diarrhea, weight loss.

85
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,120
Mom died from kidney failure
caused by type one diabetes,

86
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,164
- which has been ruled out.
- 17 doctors.

87
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:34,208
Everything's been ruled out.

88
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:37,877
Which means we have to re-rule out.
Get a new history and physical.

89
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,215
Unless that's crazy, boss.

90
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:46,177
You been out of the country
or on any recent camping trips?

91
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:47,606
No camping.

92
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,974
But we were in Montreal
back in January.

93
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,851
We went to see the NHL all-star game
for my birthday.

94
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
Awesome.

95
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:56,689
Where's Dr. House?

96
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:58,448
In his office.

97
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:01,407
He's really more of a decider
than a doer.

98
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,484
He's decided we should start over.

99
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:06,156
Never know what previous doctors
may have missed.

100
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:10,688
Like this.

101
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,080
Does that hurt when I push there?

102
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:14,748
Not really.

103
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,163
What is it?

104
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:18,723
I'm not sure.

105
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,397
Just keep it clean, simple.

106
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:24,358
We did a test that called into question
our initial diagnosis,

107
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,855
so we changed our mind.

108
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,020
And if they ask
how the test was done?

109
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:30,472
Why would they?
It's a routine lab test.

110
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,063
Routine lab tests
don't involve blood

111
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:36,311
you stole from a corpse to trick me
into giving the wrong treatment.

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,016
Yes, and if you brought that up,

113
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:41,984
it'd certainly make for a lively debate
about morality of murdering murderers.

114
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,694
Since you burned the evidence...

115
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,612
To cover for you, not me.

116
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:47,281
... you're protected.

117
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,492
The decision was a coin flip.
There was no right or wrong answer.

118
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:54,392
The body's underground,
8,000 miles away.

119
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,550
- Nobody can prove anything.
- That room will be filled,

120
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:00,634
not because of the coin flip,
not because of the patient,

121
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,005
but because House's department
screwed up.

122
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,908
They're gonna be like sharks
in a chum-filled swimming pool

123
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:09,279
and there's no way I'm jumping in
unless I'm in a steel cage.

124
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:11,805
So what do you want?

125
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,565
I want to know
you have everything covered.

126
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:16,227
Got what covered?

127
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,204
We're just reviewing
the Dibala case.

128
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,172
Making sure we didn't miss anything.

129
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
We didn't.

130
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,944
Except the thing that killed him.

131
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:29,291
He's constipated.

132
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,367
Physical showed a mass in his abdomen,
I repeated the X-ray.

133
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,704
Old one was clean. New one shows
his colon almost completely impacted.

134
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,382
Obstruction would explain the pain.

135
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:40,959
You think
they screwed up the old X-ray?

136
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:47,168
Hirschsprung's?

137
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,094
A congenital disorder
of the nerves in the colon.

138
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,764
Very rare in a child your son's age.
Most doctors would never think of it.

139
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,137
- And you came up with this?
- It's House's idea.

140
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:58,477
We need a barium enema
and biopsy to confirm.

141
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,796
Let me guess.

142
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,147
It tastes really bad,

143
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,649
but it's gonna make me feel
a lot better.

144
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,679
Actually, you're not gonna taste it.

145
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:23,754
You should try searching
for "Misty May digs for gold".

146
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,837
Make sure you put it in quotes.

147
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,465
I'm making travel plans.

148
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,845
Just need to get away.

149
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:32,844
Have some time to myself.

150
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:35,002
You getting the hint?

151
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:37,846
So that's it?

152
00:08:39,764 --> 00:08:42,104
You're done with your little
experiment with Foreman?

153
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:45,084
It wasn't an experiment.
It was a relationship.

154
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,942
You may wanna look the difference.

155
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,133
I'm glad you're better, House.

156
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,445
I actually liked working for you.

157
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:57,467
- But I'm not coming back.
- Good.

158
00:08:58,355 --> 00:08:59,746
'cause if you came back,

159
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,489
Foreman would try
and save the relationship

160
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:04,509
and he'd give up being the boss.

161
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:08,357
Are you here to try to save
my relationship with Foreman?

162
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:09,381
God no.

163
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,597
Trying to save
my relationship with Foreman.

164
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:13,613
Right now I'm Kobe

165
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:16,547
playing the game I love
however the hell I want.

166
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:19,766
Phil Jackson has to listen
to everyone else bitch about it.

167
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:21,783
Enjoy Cabo.

168
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,460
I'm going to Thailand.

169
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:29,913
Really?

170
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:32,070
Interesting.

171
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,659
Good-bye, House.

172
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:36,565
Good-bye, Thirteen.

173
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:40,585
Last week,

174
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,289
yesterday, today.

175
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,251
I can't believe it. He's pain-free
for the first time in months.

176
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:48,763
- He's even hungry.
- I'm starving.

177
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:51,840
Still waiting for the biopsy results,
but obviously it's a good sign.

178
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:53,383
Take it slow.

179
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,039
Don't try to regain
all the lost weight in one meal.

180
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,280
- What's wrong?
- Abdomen feels normal,

181
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:02,809
but it looks bigger.

182
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,358
Are you feeling...

183
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,343
Jack, you okay?

184
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:12,340
Right eye's fixed.
Lateral rectus palsy.

185
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,196
He's seizing.

186
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,949
Need five milligrams of diazepam.

187
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,533
What's happening?

188
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,160
Put that and turn off the lights.

189
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,075
- I need to see his optic disk.
- Heart rate's elevated.

190
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,873
- Hold his head.
- I'm trying.

191
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,905
- Where's House?
- You need to step back.

192
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,294
His optic disk is swollen.
Intracranial hypertension.

193
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:31,255
Furosemide.
20 milligrams I.V.

194
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:34,591
- We could intubate him...
- Need five more milligrams of Diazepam.

195
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:36,510
DC the monitors.

196
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,906
- Push 500 mg Phenytoin.
- We can't push that much.

197
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,181
Gotta remove the pressure,
his brain could herniate.

198
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,349
Oh, my God.

199
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,395
50 mg of Phenytoin.

200
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,565
Page Chase.
Tell him to meet us in the O.R.

201
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,942
We need your consent.

202
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:55,004
- What's happening to him?
- Pressure in his skull's too high.

203
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:57,406
If we don't reduce it,
it could damage his brain.

204
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,492
- But he was talking and smiling.
- We need to drill burr holes.

205
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:01,778
Drill into his head?

206
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,578
Phenytoin's not working.
Paralyze him.

207
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,415
3 milligrams Pancuronium.
Then intubate and hyperventilate.

208
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,015
- Where's House?
- House isn't here.

209
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,758
Do we have your consent?

210
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,602
Do we have your consent?

211
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:15,779
Ready?
One, two, three.

212
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,554
Gentlemen,
three milligrams Pancuronium.

213
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,063
Look the monitors. He's still seizing.
We need to do this now.

214
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,400
Go.

215
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:51,494
Electrical seizure
activity's stopped.

216
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:57,090
Intracranial pressure's declining.
Come on. Keep going.

217
00:11:57,692 --> 00:11:59,327
Pressure's down to eight.

218
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,863
I'll tell the dad.

219
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,265
What happened?

220
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,101
I have no idea.

221
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:11,651
He hasn't had any more seizures,
and cytological examination

222
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:13,899
of the subdural fluid
showed no abnormalities.

223
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,233
Don't usually see brain damage
after a rectal biopsy.

224
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:19,919
He was fine after the procedure.

225
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,821
No headaches.
No mental status change.

226
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:24,357
- Wasn't anything we did.
- It's not just his brain.

227
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,649
He's still building up fluid
in his abdomen

228
00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:27,870
as well as dura.

229
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,199
We've inserted shunts to drain it.

230
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:32,208
Gotta be some systemic infection.

231
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:35,796
Not after spending the last week
getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.

232
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:39,341
Notice anything odd
about the shape of the fluid collection?

233
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:40,514
Oh, God...

234
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:43,584
Virgin Mary.

235
00:12:45,202 --> 00:12:46,932
The edge should be tapered,

236
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,201
Lens shaped.

237
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:53,616
Unless...

238
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,018
the dural layer was already
separated from the brain

239
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,652
when the fluid started to build up.

240
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,240
Get a dural biopsy
to confirm brain cancer.

241
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:06,660
Nice catch.

242
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:12,833
Bangkok.
Flight 799.

243
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:16,336
That sounds awesome.

244
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,430
How long?

245
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:18,630
Not sure yet.

246
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:21,416
Luckily I have a friend

247
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,708
who's staying at my place
taking care of my dog.

248
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,556
He's really big,
so he needs a lot of exercise.

249
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,338
Remy hadley.
H-a-d-l-e-y.

250
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:34,493
What, you think
I'm gonna rob the place?

251
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,115
No, of course not.

252
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,902
In case you haven't noticed,
I have a job.

253
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,967
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know you.
You're either honest or dishonest.

254
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:45,355
- I figured the safer choice is...
- Is to treat a stranger like an ass.

255
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,826
Nice way to live your life... bitch.

256
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,145
I said I'm sorry.

257
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,813
I was wondering if there's
any business class seats open

258
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:55,667
that I could use my miles
to upgrade to.

259
00:13:57,425 --> 00:14:00,150
I don't know you,
but I assumed I could trust you.

260
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,590
Welcomed you in my car.

261
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:03,367
Okay, you're a saint.

262
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:06,845
That's impossible.
I confirmed my reservation last night.

263
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:08,886
So rebook it.

264
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:13,470
Well, obviously it was a mistake
on your end, not mine.

265
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,948
I'm on my way to the airport
right now.

266
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,190
They didn't believe you, huh?

267
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,894
Brain cancer?

268
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,329
We should know for sure
by the morning.

269
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:37,083
Our luck
just keeps getting worse, huh?

270
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,057
Treatment options
are better every day.

271
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:42,047
There's no visible mass,
so even if the biopsy is positive,

272
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,307
- we've caught it early.
- You're telling me this is good news?

273
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:47,978
I'm saying we will do
whatever we can.

274
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:49,546
Right.

275
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:54,052
Sorry.

276
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,690
Gotta go, Foreman needs more help
with the m and m prep.

277
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:03,893
I'll come up and help
after I finish the biopsy.

278
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:06,611
We can handle it.
I'll see you at home later.

279
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:10,035
- If you're here, I might as well be.
- Go home. Get some rest.

280
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:12,970
'Cause I'm gonna be waking you up
as soon as I get home.

281
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:21,920
Stay out of my life.

282
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,216
I know you canceled my reservation.

283
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,663
You saw me log in

284
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,812
when you were spying on me
in the coffee shop.

285
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:31,250
I was talking to you.

286
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,181
I was spying on the MILF.


287
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,600
- I'm not coming back.
- I don't want you back.

288
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,062
I cannot work for, with,
or around Foreman.

289
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,107
Which is why I don't want you
back on the team.

290
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,489
With you out of the picture,
he's better than ever.

291
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:46,442
Which is gonna make me
less miserable

292
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,721
which is why neither of us
gives a damn how, when,

293
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:51,491
or on what island in the Bahamas
you wanna get away from it all.

294
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,802
The Bahamas?

295
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:54,869
Costa Rica?

296
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:56,719
I told you Thailand.

297
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:58,615
I assumed you were lying,

298
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,459
It would have been idiotic of you
to tell me truth.

299
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:05,207
Yet another reason
I have no use for you.

300
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:10,211
We've got a problem.

301
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,426
When Cameron sent
Dibala's blood to the lab,

302
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:15,056
she asked
for the anticentromere antibodies test.

303
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,016
So?

304
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:19,922
The printout they sent you included
just the anticentromere antibodies,

305
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,105
But the lab also did
a full blood panel.

306
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,070
So, I'm not an idiot.

307
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,485
The cadaver I got the sample from
had the same blood type.

308
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,696
You apparently
didn't check his cholesterol.

309
00:16:31,703 --> 00:16:32,803
How far off?

310
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:34,314
20%.

311
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,527


312
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,389
Dibala didn't die
of high cholesterol.

313
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,448
Why would anyone
compare the two reports?

314
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,975
The same reason I did. Look for anything
we might've screwed up.

315
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,930
- We could say the blood analyzer broke.
- We can't.

316
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,116
Cameron documented
it was perfectly calibrated

317
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,236
- when she did the test.
- Numbers are off.

318
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:07,700
It's weird, who cares?

319
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:11,088
If it comes up, just act surprised
like it's some irrelevant curiosity.

320
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:12,513
I can't do this.

321
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,033
I can't go in there
and stack lie upon lie.

322
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,673
You've got to figure out a way
to explain this.

323
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:22,956
Missed you this morning.

324
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:25,398
Sorry, I needed to get in early.
Didn't wanna wake you.

325
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:26,777
I thought you did.

326
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:29,089
- That's what you said last night.
- I'm out of here.

327
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,823
I've got the biopsy results.

328
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,092
It's not cancer.

329
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:39,183
How can so much be wrong
with nothing being wrong?

330
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,851
Since when has cancer
been considered nothing?

331
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,568
I just said it's not cancer.

332
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:46,802
- Cell morphologies were all normal.
- And so are the most recent CT scans.

333
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:49,927
On the other hand,
andenocarcinoma of the stomach

334
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,245
would cause pain, constipation,

335
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,351
nutritional deficiencies
that could cause seizures.

336
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,117
And wouldn't show on a CT.

337
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:02,122
You're right about the cancer,
just wrong about the place.

338
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:07,252
Continue to say nothing
if you agree.

339
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,673
Go scope him.
Get another set of biopsies.

340
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,849
I'd get canceling her ticket

341
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:24,853
if you then showed up with two more
to somewhere better.

342
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,521
- What are you talking about?
- Or showed up at all.

343
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,274
But how does just ruining her plans

344
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,243
get her to agree to yours?

345
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:35,234
You talking about Thirteen?

346
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:38,950
- Where's she going?
- Nowhere this week, thanks to you.

347
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,330
I didn't stop her.

348
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:42,036
I'm not gonna stop her.

349
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,301
I've already done all I could.

350
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,326
Now all I can do is move on.

351
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:52,865
I think...

352
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,177
I actually believe you.

353
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,952
If you're telling the truth,

354
00:18:58,282 --> 00:19:00,340
you're even more rational than I...

355
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,017
Well, not more...

356
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,477
Then again, more sane.

357
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,397
You're gonna be a good boss, boss.

358
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,610
There's nothing wrong.

359
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,549
There's obviously something wrong

360
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:17,751
I'm not saying
we need to talk about it now.

361
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:20,072
I just don't see
why you have to deny it.

362
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:21,197
I'm not.

363
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,576
Now you're denying you're denying.

364
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,344
No, I'm denying
that there's anything to deny.

365
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:29,000
You can't do this,
you can't hide things from me.

366
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:34,923
There's a problem
with the Dibala M-and-M.

367
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,018
The HDL numbers
on one of his early blood panels

368
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:40,943
don't match a later panel.

369
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:42,401
That's weird.

370
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,913
It's no big deal.

371
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,800
Cholesterol didn't have anything to do
with his death,

372
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:56,222
but, you know,
after being let go from Mercy

373
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:58,680
and then that thing
with Thirteen's drug trial,

374
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:01,546
Foreman's paranoid about people
questioning how he handled the case.

375
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:04,017
That's ridiculous.
If anything, he should feel secured.

376
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:06,466
He had the right diagnosis,
we talked him out of it.

377
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:07,441
I know.

378
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,683
Don't tell him I told you.

379
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,846
He doesn't wanna show
any signs of weakness,

380
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:15,106
especially now that House is claiming
he wants him to stay in charge.

381
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:16,545
All right.

382
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,332
So it's still cancer?

383
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,884
Just somewhere else?

384
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,994
That's what we're looking for,
but it would explain the symptoms

385
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,423
and all the normal test
and imaging studies.

386
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:28,226
Got biopsies of the mucosa
and the submucosa.

387
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,061
Moving towards the pylorus.

388
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:31,615
It's my fault.

389
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,276
Adenocarcinomas aren't caused by diet
or environmental factors.

390
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:41,621
I inherited
a $10 million pipeline business

391
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:43,071
when I was 24.

392
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:46,828
By the time I was 30,
it was worth over a billion.

393
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:50,967
Since then, I have been involved
in over 50 deals

394
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:53,792
that make that first one
look like a loser.

395
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,313
Everything I do, everything I touch

396
00:20:57,994 --> 00:20:59,294
turns to gold.

397
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,155
Except my family.

398
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,785
First, my wife.

399
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,910
And now...

400
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:12,161
my son.

401
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,730
This is my fault.

402
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,380
It's karma.

403
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,407
That's obviously not true.

404
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,080
- He's seizing again.
- Get the scope out.

405
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,624
Need five mg diazepam.

406
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:35,890
- How's the ICP?
- It's... eight.

407
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,008
But the shunt's open and clear.

408
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,006
This isn't intracranial pressure.

409
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,341
What the hell is it?

410
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,161


411
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:51,367
Seizures stopped,
but he hasn't regained consciousness.

412
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:54,604
No sign of any masses
in his stomach or esophageal lining

413
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:57,190
and he's still accumulating
subdural and peritoneal fluid.

414
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:00,610
And every time we look to see
where it's coming from,

415
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,529
- he starts seizing.
- You think we're setting this off?

416
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:04,993
Something is.

417
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:08,624
One of his stomach biopsies
shows an arteriole partially occluded.

418
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:10,620
With no abnormality
in the other layers

419
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,997
and no evidence
of cellular inflammatory reaction.

420
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,749
It's definitely not cancer.

421
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,017
- It has to be some sort of infection.
- We already ruled out infection.

422
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:20,421
Because he was treated for it
and got worse.

423
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,217
- Seems like a sound reason.
- Unless it's a drug-resistant strain.

424
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,385
Drug-resistant strain of what?

425
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,306
Bacterial cultures, viral serologies
A.N.A. and A.N.C.A. were all negative.

426
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,943
Everything is.
We obviously missed something.

427
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:35,144
Maybe the seizures
aren't a new symptom.

428
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,897
- They're an old one.
- No doctor noticed a thrashing kid?

429
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,515
Abdominal epilepsy.

430
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:43,169
The seizures would look like pain
until it spread to his motor cortex.

431
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:46,259
- It wouldn't explain the fevers.
- Protein malnutrition can cause fevers

432
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:48,241
And nothing causes malnutrition

433
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,599
like excruciating stomach pain
that gets worse every time you eat.

434
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,160
I'd be a lot more certain
if it was my idea.

435
00:22:57,564 --> 00:22:59,159
But it's the best we got.

436
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:00,675
Start him on gabapentin.

437
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,138
Hook him up to an intracranial EEG
for continuous monitoring.

438
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:17,081
- I gave him statins.
- What?

439
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:18,990
If they ask about cholesterol,

440
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:21,427
say I prescribed a statin
and forgot to fill the chart.

441
00:23:21,552 --> 00:23:25,057
You wanna solve a problem in the records
by creating another one in the records?

442
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:27,739

It's a problem with my record keeping.

443
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:29,940
There's no way
anyone can prove me wrong.

444
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:32,365
How d'you get access to the statins?

445
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,078
You gonna get someone
in the pharmacy

446
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,735
to confess
to another record-keeping problem?

447
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:39,031
I saw an open cart, just took it.

448
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:42,295
Why would you steal a drug
you could easily ask for?

449
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,113
'Cause I'm trying
to get you off the hook.

450
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,486
A story that raises
more questions than answers

451
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:50,721
only puts the hook
deeper down my throat.

452
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:53,101
It's all right, I'll handle it.

453
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:54,026
How?

454
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:55,933
By telling the truth.

455
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:57,972
Truth is I don't have the time,

456
00:23:58,097 --> 00:24:00,112
I'm not in the mood
and don't see the point.

457
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:03,024
You don't wanna do it
because you're not in the mood?

458
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:06,569
This kid is dying and House's trying
to push his responsibilities onto me.

459
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,161
They're not his responsibilities,
they're yours.

460
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:10,740
You wanted to be in charge.

461
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,742
Wanted to be in charge,
not a figurehead.

462
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,036
Then do the M-and-M, it's all yours.

463
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,966
You want me to get flogged?
For what?

464
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:19,753
So you can have an academic debate
about a diagnostic dilemma

465
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,564
no one's ever gonna face again?

466
00:24:24,124 --> 00:24:25,637
What's going on here?

467
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:27,632
I just don't want to do the M-and-M.

468
00:24:32,508 --> 00:24:34,658
- Did it work?
- Not even close.

469
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:52,069
Everything okay?

470
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,909
Just waiting
for whatever is about to go wrong.

471
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:56,811
Thirteen called.

472
00:24:56,936 --> 00:25:00,006
She have a theory that makes more sense
than abdominal epilepsy?

473
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,542
She said someone
hacked into her email account

474
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,639
and canceled an airline reservation.

475
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,537
- I'm guessing Foreman.
- Really?

476
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:09,988
You're accusing Foreman, not me?

477
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:11,537
Cool.

478
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:15,763
You really want Foreman
to stay in charge of the team?

479
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:17,253
Makes sense.

480
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,256
He loves power, I love puzzles.

481
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,271
You love power and puzzles.

482
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:25,015
True.

483
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:28,344
When I had them both.

484
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,515
It wasn't Foreman.

485
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:37,285
How do you know?

486
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:40,001
He said he's moved on.

487
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,251
And you believe him?

488
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,263
I believe that he believes it.

489
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,134
It's time for me
to get off the bench.

490
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:01,919
What's up?

491
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:04,384
Are you Dr. House?

492
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:06,468
I understand you're a big fan.

493
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:08,727
I'll have my guy
send over a signed glossy.

494
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:11,015
Continuous EEG shows
no interictal spikes.

495
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:12,910
It's not abdominal epilepsy.

496
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,679
- You paged me to tell me what it's not?
- I paged you to show you this.

497
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,538
That I did not expect.

498
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:25,155
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

499
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,929
Darn it.
I knew I should have stayed outside.

500
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,012
Fantasy's always
better than reality.

501
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:32,271
You think this is a joke?
That's my son.

502
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,258
He's dying, and not one of you

503
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,385
seem to have the slightest clue why.

504
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,403
I know.

505
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:40,182
That's why it's so interesting.

506
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,314


507
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:44,471
Fever, stomach pain, seizures,

508
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,380
peritoneal and subdural fluid collection
and now spots.

509
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:50,733
Could be an allergic reaction
to one of his meds.

510
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,653
That suddenly developed 8 hours
after we started the meds?

511
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,905
If it's not cancer infection,
it's autoimmune.

512
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,402
Systemic lupus
complicated by a CNS vasculitis

513
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:01,233
would explain the rash,
fever, ascites...

514
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:04,206
CNS vasculitis would cause a stiff neck
along with a headache.

515
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,249
And would have showed up
on dural biopsy.

516
00:27:07,671 --> 00:27:09,793
What about polyarteritis nodosa?

517
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:11,252
It can occur in kids.

518
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,714
You can't have arteritis
without inflammation.

519
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,800
Okay, come up with something better.

520
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:20,053
Go on.

521
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:22,427
There was some inflammation
in the skin biopsy.

522
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:25,252
Plus,
he's got elevated diastolic pressure.

523
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,519
It's barely elevated,
which you'd expect

524
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:29,480
given the procedures he's undergone.

525
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,983
Well, barely is more
than not barely.

526
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:37,023
Not my decision.

527
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,912
But if it was,
I'd say start him on prednisone

528
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:42,852
and get a testicular biopsy.

529
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,454
If he's gonna have inflammation,
it'll be there.

530
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,581
- Cameron and I will do it.
- Why?

531
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,317
- It was Chase's idea.
- Kid's father is not gonna be happy

532
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:53,414
about a fourth set of biopsies,
and you've got a better rapport.

533
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:56,257
What's really going on here?

534
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,463
You need Chase to help you
over-prep for the M-and-M?

535
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:03,554
Then say so.
Don't be a child.

536
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,621
Is it on his penis?

537
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:10,509
Kid's rash?

538
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:11,897
Yeah, why?

539
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:15,192
Means it's most likely affecting
the small blood vessels.

540
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:18,399
That's why we didn't see
any inflammation on the biopsies.

541
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:21,685
It's not polyarteritis.

542
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,129
It's Degos disease.

543
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:32,187
I'll do it.

544
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:49,018
Your son has Degos disease.

545
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:51,868
Causes microblood vessels

546
00:28:51,993 --> 00:28:54,033
In the brain, skin, GI tract,

547
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,382
to break down, clot off.

548
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,154
It sometimes manifests early on

549
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:03,491
with atrophic papules on the penis.

550
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:06,023
In your son's case,
we don't know why,

551
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:08,371
they came much later.

552
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:11,707
What's the treatment?

553
00:29:14,691 --> 00:29:15,991
There isn't one.

554
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:18,111
It's incurable.

555
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:25,825
You're wrong.

556
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,891
Already been wrong a bunch of times.

557
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,849
We've rechecked the biopsies.
It's definitely Degos.

558
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:41,278
I'm sorry.
I wish there was something we could do.

559
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:49,553
How long?

560
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:52,493
Not much longer.

561
00:29:54,997 --> 00:29:56,419
What does that mean?

562
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,410
Day at the most.

563
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,359
All right, great.

564
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,274
We need to talk.

565
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,472
Unless it's life or death,
gonna've to wait.

566
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,229
It's about Dibala.

567
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:53,389
Let me rephrase.
Unless it's a current life...

568
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,135
Foreman can't present
the case at the M and M.

569
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:59,732
You are busy, but he's just gonna have
to suck it up and make the time.

570
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:02,276
- It's not the time.
- Then what is it?

571
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,760
The anticentromere antibodies test.

572
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:08,011
The test that caused us
to change the treatment

573
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:10,379
from blastomycosis to scleroderma...

574
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:12,953
It wasn't...

575
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:14,994
Wasn't what?

576
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:19,335
They need you in the pediatric ICU.

577
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,086
- Who's they?
- I don't know.

578
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,838
But I think they're lawyers.

579
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:29,034
If you guys screwed something up,
just come clean.

580
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:31,305
It's not gonna be that bad.

581
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:37,228
With all due respect,
you don't know what's at stake.

582
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,438
- What's going on?
- You need to stop him!

583
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,982
- He's about to ruin his life.
- Like you give a damn.

584
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,400
Roy, he's right.

585
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,441
You're borrowing money to buy options
already out of the money.

586
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:48,489
Even you won't be able
to cover the losses.

587
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,018
Your house, cars, bank accounts.
You'll lose everything.

588
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,726
That's the point.

589
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,787
The billionaire thinks that the gods
will treat him better if he's broke.

590
00:31:59,103 --> 00:32:00,556
I suggested he give it to me.

591
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:02,676
There's got to be
some sort of balance.

592
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,164
You can't have all the good fortune
in just one area of your life.

593
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:09,010
It's not how the world
is supposed to work.

594
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,116
- Who said that?
- Don't just wipe everything out.

595
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:13,870
Put your assets in a trust.

596
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,766
- Give to charity.
- Can't get it back.

597
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,926
- He's insane.
- He's irrational.

598
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,571
So are most people.

599
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,313
It doesn't make him insane.

600
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,815
If he signs that paper,

601
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:24,984
he's not only gonna destroy
his own life,

602
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:28,070
but the lives of thousands of people
who rely on this to make a living.

603
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,636
If he is insane,
we will sue this hospital...

604
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:31,961
Mr. Randall...

605
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:34,915
I know you're upset.

606
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,589
You shouldn't make
a decision like this right now.

607
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,415
Give it some time.

608
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:42,505
My son doesn't have any time.

609
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,943
Your son's dying
from an incurable disease,

610
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:46,268
not bad karma.

611
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,396
He's not dying.

612
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:52,418
It's not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna let it.

613
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:55,452
Please!

614
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:00,666
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:03,254
I can't let him die.

616
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:07,082
People don't get what they deserve.
They just get what they get.

617
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:09,361
There's nothing any of us
can do about it.

618
00:33:18,347 --> 00:33:21,999
Deliver it or I'll make sure
you end up the ones with nothing.

619
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,509
Call a code.
He's flatlining.

620
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,141
Thanks.

621
00:33:53,194 --> 00:33:54,994
You're welcome.
For what?

622
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,827
For thinking I was worth
breaking the law to keep around.

623
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:02,612
That's just the way I am, but still
don't know what you're talking about.

624
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:04,875
Cuddy had I.T.
trace all the I.P. addresses

625
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,443
who've logged in
to my email account.

626
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:10,506
There were two.
Mine and yours.

627
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,052
Obviously House decided
he needs you more than he's...

628
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,762
I already asked House.

629
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:20,121
- And he'd certainly never lie.
- No, he'd lie.

630
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,184
Except he wants me gone.

631
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:25,484
And he'd do a lot better job
of lying than you just did.

632
00:34:26,552 --> 00:34:28,357
Really?
It was that bad?

633
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:30,414
No, actually.

634
00:34:31,415 --> 00:34:33,303
But it doesn't matter anymore.

635
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:34,238
Why?

636
00:34:34,843 --> 00:34:36,293
Because of House...

637
00:34:36,971 --> 00:34:38,021
or Foreman?

638
00:34:39,214 --> 00:34:40,991
You're good for both of them,

639
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:42,777
but Foreman's not my best friend.

640
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:44,123
House will be fine.

641
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,870
Maybe.

642
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,499
But with you on the team,
he'd be better.

643
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,467
He needs someone...

644
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:52,798
who doesn't need him.

645
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,767
You're the only one
he's never really been able to suck

646
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,828
into his crazy House vortex.

647
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,347
Keeps him grounded.
His ego in check.

648
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:02,725
Why didn't you just come to me?

649
00:35:04,564 --> 00:35:07,544
I figured you'd only stay
if House asked

650
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:09,269
and I knew he would...

651
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:10,961
eventually.

652
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:15,649
Bye, Wilson.

653
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:20,659
This is a great job.

654
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,719
Maybe even better now that House
is at least trying

655
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:26,707
to have real relationships
with people.

656
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,455
I said, "trying".

657
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:33,172
- It doesn't matter.
- The job you love doesn't matter?

658
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,677
Don't throw it all away
just because of a bad break-up.

659
00:35:41,135 --> 00:35:42,235
Bye, Wilson.

660
00:35:53,214 --> 00:35:54,564
I just confessed.

661
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,905
I told Thirteen
I canceled the plane ticket.

662
00:35:58,849 --> 00:35:59,656
Why?

663
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,264
You mean why did I confess
or why did I do it?

664
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:05,496
I know you didn't do it,
so I guess the first.

665
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:08,543
You want her to stay
because you want her back

666
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:10,706
or because Foreman does?

667
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:12,844
Why would I care what Foreman wants?

668
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,130
Cause you're not as big a jerk
as everyone thinks.

669
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:17,681
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

670
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:21,651
I just made
a $10,000 short sale on a stock

671
00:36:21,776 --> 00:36:23,753
I know is gonna crash
because of what I saw

672
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:26,266
a grief-stricken dad
do on his son's deathbed.

673
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:28,662
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

674
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,500
You are a jerk.

675
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:34,483
She's making a mistake.

676
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:37,550
- So you did it for her?
- She's a good doctor.

677
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:39,351
So you did it for you?

678
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,323
I'm not the one in charge anymore.

679
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,424
So you did it for Foreman?

680
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,162
She's a smoking hot,
newly single bisexual.

681
00:36:47,668 --> 00:36:50,321
Why don't you just admit
that you like having her around?

682
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:52,209
She's good for you.
You need her.

683
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,754
Because I was born
with a heart three sizes too small.

684
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:58,140
- No, you weren't.
- Yes, I...

685
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:01,799
What?

686
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,842
He's still alive?

687
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:21,284
Good.

688
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,895
Start him on heparin
and IV immunoglobulin.

689
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:26,515
- For Degos?
- Cardiac arrest wasn't just

690
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,885
a "everything goes to hell
in a handbasket" arrest.

691
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,288
It was a coronary event.
Coronaries are large vessels.

692
00:37:31,413 --> 00:37:32,845
Mean's it can't be Degos.

693
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,878
- But the biopsies confirmed...
- Obstructed blood vessels.

694
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,327
They can't be obstructed
because of Degos.

695
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:41,383
Means it's primary
antiphospholipid syndrome.

696
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,428
You sure?

697
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,396
Nope.

698
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:49,352
But I will be if he responds
to the heparin and the immunoglobulin.

699
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:56,440
By the way,

700
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:59,240
someone screwed over your girlfriend

701
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:01,591
and she ran to me, Cuddy,
and Wilson.

702
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:02,905
Everyone but you.

703
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:06,199
She's not over you.

704
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:08,547
Or she is.

705
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:39,689
Where'd you find it?

706
00:38:39,956 --> 00:38:40,956
Find what?

707
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,802
The niacin-bound
chromium supplements.

708
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,991
It was on top of the file.
You don't know about it?

709
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:50,505
No.
Been here all night.

710
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:53,903
One of Dibala's previous docs
was prescribing

711
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:57,334
ultra high doses of niacin-bound
chromium to boost his HDL.

712
00:38:57,532 --> 00:38:58,332
So?

713
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:00,629
So it gives us something
to point to.

714
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:03,705
We can explain the wide variation
between the HDL numbers.

715
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,925
We're safe.

716
00:39:05,656 --> 00:39:06,856
We're covered.

717
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:10,339
You really didn't request the info?

718
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:15,171
And obviously you didn't either.

719
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:18,042
Which means...

720
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,383
BIGGER THEY ARE, HARDER THEY FALL:
CEO BANKRUPS HIMSELF IN A DAY

721
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:54,385
It worked.

722
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:56,810
The medicine worked.

723
00:39:58,342 --> 00:39:59,342
It worked.

724
00:40:15,084 --> 00:40:16,371
How'd you find it?

725
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,239
Fat old black guy.

726
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:25,269
Knew he had to be taking something
for his cholesterol.

727
00:40:25,845 --> 00:40:26,923
And what now?

728
00:40:28,138 --> 00:40:29,384
I'm not the boss.

729
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,911
You don't think I should be fired?

730
00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:32,846
Why?

731
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:36,455
I doubt we'll ever be treating
a genocidal dictator again.

732
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:39,895
Better a murder than a misdiagnosis.

733
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,777
Whether you wanna be
in charge or not...

734
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,990
You are...

735
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:51,831
and you always will be.

736
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:12,052
<i>75-year-old african man</i>

737
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,972
<i>presented to our hospital
following a rapid onset of hemoptysis.</i>

738
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,147
<i>He'd been fine prior to onset.</i>

739
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:20,957
<i>No chest pain, fever,
coughing, or chills...</i>
