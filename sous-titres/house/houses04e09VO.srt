1
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:14,127
Roman emperors were the real punk.

2
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:16,781
- Don't say "punk", it's cliche.
- Whatever let me tell you about

3
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:19,462
these dinner parties.
Nero loved a good poisoning.

4
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:21,523
- At a dinner party?
- He'd arrange one...

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,940
- I don't feel like going on tonight.
- Too bad.

6
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:26,189
'Cause that's what makes the club
feel like paying us.

7
00:00:26,255 --> 00:00:29,270
Titus, this is all in the book.
Titus would ply his guests with wine,

8
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,444
then bind their privates with a cord.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,671
Did you get a new guitar?

10
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:38,518
'64 teardrop re-issue.
Not a mark on it.

11
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,311
All right.

12
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:43,987
Can I see it?

13
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:47,905
Nice, nice.

14
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:53,842
Hey, cut it out, man!

15
00:00:54,615 --> 00:00:56,597
You stupid son of a...
Come on! Hey!

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,294
It's a hunk of wood, bro!
It should look like a hunk of wood.

17
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:02,028
We're not the philharmonic.

18
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:04,775
See, look, man, it's better already.

19
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:11,463
It's 10:45.
How 'bout taking that on stage?

20
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:14,789
Now I feel like going on.

21

Season 4 - Episode 9
"Game"

23
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,727
<i>You're my child,
and so are the quadruplets.</i>

24
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,999
<i>And I'm not gonna give any of you up.</i>

25
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:47,119
<i>Don't you...
Talk to me as a mother.</i>

26
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,159
Sign on the door says
"closed for private event."

27
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:51,877
You're alone.

28
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,236
How much more private can you get?

29
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,298
- Can you pass me a tissue?
- Who are you keeping?

30
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,592
- You owed me a decision ten days ago.
- Total amnesia.

31
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,568
<i>You're my whole life.</i>

32
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:05,318
<i>You.</i>

33
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:08,532
Luisa Maria can't decide
if she's gonna keep the quadruplets.

34
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,993
She keeps them.
I read it online.

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,321
You happy now?
I ruined it for you.

36
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,379
- I want two names by friday.
- Fine.

37
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:20,564
I'll arrange for a patient
with a mysterious illness

38
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:23,081
- to come in on thursday.
- Yes, you need more tests.

39
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,799
It's only been two months.

40
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:27,031
Who knows how they'll react
to freak weather patterns?

41
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,702
They all did fine in the wind tunnel.

42
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:33,246
Two names by friday, or the
pay overruns come out of your salary.

43
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:39,531
<i>I can hurt you.
I know that now.</i>

44
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:42,762
And I move your parking space
to the "e" lot.

45
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,308
<i>Don't ever leave me, mom.</i>

46
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:51,025
Who's the sickest patient you've got?

47
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:54,076
I've got a guy who'll be dead
in the next ten minutes.

48
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:59,044
You mean someone who might
actually survive a diagnosis.

49
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:01,697
There's nothing here.

50
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:04,884
Just the usual cracked heads,
gunshots, false alarms.

51
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:08,022
Who would you pick to fill
your narrow little flats?

52
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:10,840
So you can fire them
off of my recommendation?

53
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:12,841
Nice try.

54
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,397
Who do I have to grope
to get some turn-down service in here?

55
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:19,318
Jimmy Quidd.
He is a punk rock singer.

56
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:23,483
- Punk rock star to you.
- Repeated trauma, self-cutting, fever,

57
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:26,903
arthralgia, hyper-inflated chest,
fatigue, anemia.

58
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,840
Blood in the stool and urine.

59
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:31,938
I've died and gone
to diagnostic heaven.

60
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:35,778
His blood results show
booze, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates.

61
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:38,878
The only mystery here is
how he made it to be 38.

62
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,643
- I'm 28.
- And he lies.

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,540
And he's a pain in the ass.

64
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,195
Hey, come...

65
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:48,538
Wrap him up.
I'll take him to go.

66
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,564
Dizzying array of symptoms.

67
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:58,345
Any of which could be caused
by drugs, trauma, being a loser.

68
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,830
The guy's a walking pharmacy.
Could be anything.

69
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,086
Forgot to mention...

70
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:04,550
Final case.

71
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,442
Get it right, you're hired.

72
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:10,154
Runner-up will be decided strictly
on some definition of merit.

73
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:11,062
Endocarditis.

74
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,768
Hemorrhagic lesions
in the lungs and gut.

75
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:15,298
Bronchiolitis obliterans.
He smoked his airways into oblivion.

76
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:16,897
- Endocarditis.
- I already said that.

77
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:18,512
I'd heard of it before you mentioned it.

78
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:19,936
Speed counts.
Find something else.

79
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:22,160
- Could be bacterial meningitis.
- You already picked.

80
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,686
- I'll take meningitis.
- Too late. Go run your tests.

81
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:27,911
No...
He's sick 'cause he's a drug addict.

82
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:31,957
No, he has every symptom
you'd expect of a drug addict.

83
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,916
So you think it's all too perfect?

84
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,270
Some other disease is trying
to throw us off its trail?

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,918
If he had 4 out of 20
possible symptoms,

86
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:40,863
he'd be a garden-variety druggie.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,275
20 out of 20,
there's an underlying disease.

88
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:44,886
- Run your tests.
- No.

89
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:48,407
He's weak, in withdrawal,
just spewed blood.

90
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,676
They're gonna rip off a piece
of his lung,

91
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:53,381
ram instruments down his throat,
and roto-rooter his intestines.

92
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,791
It'd be nice if we didn't kill him
trying to figure out what's killing him.

93
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,281
One diagnosis, one test at a time.

94
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,140
O2 stats are low.
Hyper-inflated chest.

95
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,526
- I need a bronchoscopy to...
- You just lost two points.

96
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:08,428
What for?

97
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:10,575
For thinking it makes
a difference who goes first.

98
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,941
- Only one person can be right.
- What points?

99
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,844
Can't have an objective system
of measurement without numbers.

100
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,822
You lose three for not knowing that.

101
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,033
From now on,
only the person holding this

102
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,277
can treat or run tests.

103
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:26,803
I wanted to give you the serpent staff

104
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,266
with the poison axe head,
but I left it in my car.

105
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:40,487
Don't need you.

106
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:42,174
It's one thing to hire based on a game.

107
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,542
- Don't need your lecture.
- It's insane to treat based on a game.

108
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:47,553
You're not taking the long view.

109
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,823
The one where we stuff
another patient in a body bag?

110
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:51,931
No.
If we're wrong, it'll come pretty fast.

111
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,404
The long view is the one
where we pick the best team.

112
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,398
That way we can use all the bags
we save for grocery shopping.

113
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,171
You're not buying that argument,
are you?

114
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:02,038
No.

115
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:05,013
In which case, I'm back
to my original position. Don't need you.

116
00:07:13,063 --> 00:07:14,591
What do you think of Amber?

117
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,262
I screwed up a diagnosis.

118
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:24,453
You don't seem that upset by it.

119
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:30,548
Diagnosed a guy, with adenocarcinoma
three months ago.

120
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:32,434
Told him he had six months.

121
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,560
So now you've got to tell him that he's
way behind on his christmas shopping.

122
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:36,892
He didn't get worse.

123
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:38,650
I re-checked everything.

124
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:40,919
Biopsy was a false positive.

125
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,044
Harmless lesions
cause by talc inhalation.

126
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:45,574
Medical clemency.

127
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,448
Interesting.

128
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:49,673
Why would you use that word?

129
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,643
Because I'm interested.

130
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,716
When I'm interested,
I describe the things

131
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:55,595
that make me interested as interesting.

132
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:58,482
Most people would say good,
possibly great.

133
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:00,013
Why aren't you able to just enjoy...

134
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:03,108
Why aren't other people able
to just be interested?

135
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,565
- Is he in there?
- Yeah.

136
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:14,384
Why'd you go right for
the drug theories?

137
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:17,354
If he had a history of
shoving cancer into his veins,

138
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,025
I'd have guessed cancer.

139
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:22,067
Okay.
You're an idiot.

140
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:25,121
Either that or you've decided
you can trust a smoking addict

141
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:27,127
alone in a bathroom
with an oxygen tank.

142
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:37,341
I got your new test results back.

143
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,470
Sorry I'm late.

144
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:43,736
Who's your colleague?

145
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:46,197
- Dr. House...
- Yes, Dr. Wilson?

146
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:51,022
- I really don't need the consult.
- I know the prognosis.

147
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,482
Apparently not.

148
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,230
Mr. Mckenna,

149
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:56,359
I...

150
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,778
Can't believe I'm able to say this,
but...

151
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:03,590
You're cancer-free.
The biopsy looked like adenocarcinoma,

152
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:06,014
but it wasn't.
Harmless lesions on your lungs.

153
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,349
You're fine.

154
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,412
I don't get it.

155
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,084
Cool.

156
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:19,525
No, it's...
I know this must come

157
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:23,294
as a shock, but,
I've double-checked the labs.

158
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:26,189
I just accepted an offer on my House.

159
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:31,458
I've had three good-bye parties.
I'm buying plane tickets to venice.

160
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:33,989
You can still use those
if you're alive.

161
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,608
I have to pay a $6,000 broker commission
on a house I'm not selling.

162
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,997
Money, I don't have.

163
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,678
Thank you...
For letting me know.

164
00:09:56,271 --> 00:10:01,008
I... would have thought the living
would mean more than the expenses.

165
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:03,432
It's not about the money.

166
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:15,319
- I have 17 points?
- I started you all out on 100.

167
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:18,115
- And you blew up part of the building.
- Where's Foreman?

168
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:20,613
- He got paged.
- By who? Is it about our...

169
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,101
By me. I need him right away.
Somewhere else.

170
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:28,158
- We're hiding from Foreman?
- Foreman accused me of playing games

171
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:30,447
- with patient care.
- Who gets the eyeball next?

172
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,377
I haven't run my test yet.
It still might...

173
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,527
You can't run your test.

174
00:10:33,577 --> 00:10:35,321
The patient had
massive smoke inhalation.

175
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,374
Do a bronchoscopy,
it'll set off a laryngospasm.

176
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:38,883
I'll do an open-lung biopsy instead.

177
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:41,047
You want an invasive surgery
because you screwed up?

178
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:43,745
- The patient snuck a cigarette.
- The patient is an addict.

179
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,634
It's not his fault he's jonesing
for whatever he can get his hands on.

180
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:48,436
Not his fault he's jonesing?

181
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,778
In what universe
does that make any sense?

182
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,790
Get him on a nicotine patch.

183
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:54,809
It'll keep up with his Jones.

184
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,649
Do your biopsy.

185
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:07,138
How's the new us's final case going?

186
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:08,780
It's a moving target.

187
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,106
House keeps moving it
so I can't find it.

188
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:12,837
So...

189
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:17,210
You've decided to focus on
solving the problem in darfur.

190
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,040
Taub is in there
prepping the patient for a biopsy.

191
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,590
Stay close to Taub,
or stay close to House.

192
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,997
- And stay close to the game.
- I'm trying to stop the game.

193
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:29,283
That's your role in the game.

194
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,747
You wander over here to annoy me?

195
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,609
You're not wearing a lab coat.

196
00:11:33,983 --> 00:11:36,457
- House doesn't wear one, does he?
- Damn!

197
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,822
Now when I walk away,
it's gonna look like

198
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:41,137
I have a reason
other than just annoyance.

199
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,451
He won't let us finish
prepping him for the biopsy.

200
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,560
You try the other arm?

201
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,191
The problem's not the arm,
it's the entire patient.

202
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:02,858
Hi.

203
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:05,638
He let you check his chest.

204
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:08,488
He let you do anything
except check that arm.

205
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:12,416
He wallpapered himself
with nicotine patches.

206
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,531
Real rebellion has a point.

207
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,183
It's not juvenile and purposeless.

208
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:25,170
Maybe purposelessness is my purpose.

209
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,980
- Mission accomplished.
- Amber...

210
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,237
It's not the patches.

211
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,156
He's got blood clots moving
through his body.

212
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:33,284
Means...

213
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:35,155
I was wrong.

214
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:44,020
If a clot reaches his lungs
or his heart, it'll kill him.

215
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:50,571
- It's true.
- We all know it's true.

216
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,143
- You just wasted our time.
- And what you're doing?

217
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,113
- I'm not competing.
- Where's Taub?

218
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,537
- Foreman was following him.
- So you paged Taub.

219
00:12:57,706 --> 00:12:59,615
Didn't see that I had much choice.

220
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:02,693
He has schistocytes in his blood smear.

221
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,908
Which means the DIC's causing clotting.
What's causing the DIC?

222
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:07,906
- Drug impurities.
- You lost your round.

223
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,023
New symptom, new round.
This has to be drug related.

224
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:11,429
This is how doctors kill patients.

225
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:12,672
By seeing the stereotype...

226
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,608
Drug addicts use drugs
is a stereotype?

227
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:16,801
Drugs are bad is a stereotype?

228
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,721
- Losers lose is...
- Malaria.

229
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,936
- He hasn't left the country in years.
- Malaria's relapsing/recurring.

230
00:13:21,995 --> 00:13:24,053
For all we know he could have
been sick for years.

231
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,963
It explains not just
the DIC and the bleeding,

232
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,595
but the tiredness, fever.
Everything we attributed to drugs.

233
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:30,356
Oh, yeah, it's much more likely

234
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:34,215
that this ass punk rocker
was exposed to malaria than drugs?

235
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:37,015
If you were always right,
then you wouldn't have just been wrong.

236
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:41,072
Or let the patient mainline nicotine.
Or ravaged my anatomical model,

237
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,526
which grandma House bought me
when I aced my mcats.

238
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:46,197
A pharmaceutical rep
left that here on tuesday.

239
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:49,739
- Grandma does some part-time work.
- The rep was a 30-something babe.

240
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:51,788
Thank you.
I got her hips.

241
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,430
Carry it with pride.

242
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:57,220
Manipulative bitch,
you're wanted in the loser's circle.

243
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:04,532
Why do you hate drug addicts?

244
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:09,014
Your situation is different.
You're taking a necessary prescription.

245
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,072
I know...
I'm fabulous.

246
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,359
And I'm not the patient.

247
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,327
I'm not allowed to
have a problem with junkies?

248
00:14:14,377 --> 00:14:16,989
You're allowed.
There's gotta be a reason.

249
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,432
He's a patient. You don't know him.
But you hate him.

250
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:22,352
He's throwing his life away.

251
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,500
'Cause he's setting his own terms?

252
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:27,121
Not living in fear of every pop quiz?

253
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,625
I thought we were talking about him.

254
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:33,128
We were never talking about him.

255
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:37,016
Why are you afraid to lose?

256
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:40,735
Are you gonna fire me
because I like to win?

257
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:42,785
Just want to know the reason.

258
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:49,800
I watched this football game once.
And I noticed something odd.

259
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:52,631
The winning team, was the happy one.

260
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:55,303
I did the math.

261
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:57,113
Our patient's happy.

262
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:59,963
- He's an idiot.
- He's a happy idiot.

263
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,376
That screws with your world view.

264
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,997
There's something freeing about
being a loser, isn't there?

265
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,847
- Why are you afraid...
- Mommy didn't love me enough.

266
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:13,142
Daddy expected too much from me.

267
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,625
Something!

268
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:19,307
Let's assume that's true.

269
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,759
I get how that can make me
a screwed-up person.

270
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,650
But how is my willingness
to do anything

271
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:27,579
to get the right answer
bad for my patients?

272
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,338
Or put in terms you can understand,

273
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:36,217
how is it bad for you?

274
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,508
- I didn't ask you to pick up the meds.
- I'm trying to be a good colleague.

275
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,858
You want to boost your score
by prescribing House's drugs.

276
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,751
- Why else would you have two bags?
- Didn't say good colleague to you.

277
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:53,945
- You realize we still have a patient?
- Don't care.

278
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:56,120
You care about this job
more than about his life?

279
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:58,295
I care more about my wallpaper
than about his life.

280
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:01,018
You're jerking me around.
No reason to be a doctor if you don't...

281
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:02,987
I care about life.
I just don't care about his.

282
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:04,398
He doesn't care.
Why should I?

283
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,267
- My time is better spent...
- Kissing up to your boss.

284
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,000
Average doctor cuts off a patient
18 seconds into a history

285
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,968
because that's all the time he's got.

286
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:15,711
Meanwhile six of us are ministering
to a guy with a death wish.

287
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:16,903
So why do you want the job?

288
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,511
Not because I'm maximizing
my service to mankind.

289
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:21,560
Good for you.

290
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:28,330
Where is he?

291
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:30,986
We're gonna spend the next hour

292
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,322
looking for a guy
who doesn't want to be found.

293
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,505
Jimmy Quidd's greatest stiff.

294
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,935
1989.

295
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:48,432
- A profit-seeking entity released this?
- Put it out himself.

296
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,622
He wanted people to listen,
but apparently didn't want people

297
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:53,348
to enjoy listening.

298
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,626
- Now, why would someone...
- Truly a mystery.

299
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:58,932
Why would anyone do something
just to aggravate people?

300
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:05,309
Why would you have a blank
liability release form,

301
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,546
plus your checkbook,
on top of your desk?

302
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:12,433
Probably because they were
in the second drawer

303
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:16,281
in a manila envelope under a book,
and you put them on top of my desk.

304
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:18,084
You usually keep your checkbook
at home.

305
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:20,907
It's your go-to excuse
for why you can't lend me money.

306
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:24,977
You're gonna pay the guy
the six grand, aren't you?

307
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:29,106
There are other people
I write checks to. I do have cable.

308
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:31,937
There's no negligence, without injury.

309
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,031
I handed the guy a death sentence.

310
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:36,066
He's not distressed
with a death sentence.

311
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:38,005
He's distressed with a life sentence.

312
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:40,225
I gave him three months of misery.

313
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,152
You gave him three months
of being someone special.

314
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,944
You're paying the guy
because he used to be boring,

315
00:17:45,988 --> 00:17:48,386
and without you
he's gonna be boring again.

316
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:53,164
- Hi.
- Results of the malaria test already?

317
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,580
Well, no.

318
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:57,972
But we were wondering if you'd
sent the patient for any additional...

319
00:17:58,529 --> 00:17:59,378
Tests.

320
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,787
You lost the patient.

321
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,741
- Taub, you check lost and found.
- Thirteen...

322
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:11,883
Come with me.

323
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,905
Why do you love drug addicts?

324
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,347
I won't pigeonhole the patients,
so that means I'm...

325
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,022
Perfectly capable of drawing
my own conclusions.

326
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:23,836
Are you capable
of answering a question?

327
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:25,627
I think there's more to him
than the drugs.

328
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:26,690
Admirable. Why?

329
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,637
I need a reason
for doing something admirable?

330
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,081
There's always a reason.
He's a patient, you don't know him.

331
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,737
Why do you like him?
The alcoholic parent, druggie youth.

332
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,839
There's no such thing
as a saint without a past.

333
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:37,173
Or a sinner without a future.

334
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,841
What makes you so sure that drugs
are a mask for something else?

335
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,540
Drugs are always a mask
for something else.

336
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,682
That's the dumbest thing
I've heard in my life.

337
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:01,930
You really want this job?

338
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,750
You think you can talk me into leaving?

339
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,320
You're a person who likes her privacy

340
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,243
working for a man
who needs to know everything.

341
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,068
You're a person who cares
about her patients

342
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,257
working for a man
that cares about games.

343
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,403
I hear him.

344
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:20,568
So neither sleet nor hail
nor dread of night.

345
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,117
Wait, wait, wait...

346
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,934
Malaria's not contagious.

347
00:19:25,979 --> 00:19:27,337
Children, I bid you...

348
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,794
Good night!
And I'm off!

349
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,510
Which one of you guys
sapped my powers?

350
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:42,320
Was it you?

351
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,015
Did you take my powers?

352
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,661
Maybe it was you.
Well, no matter.

353
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:50,181
See, I'm feeling stronger already.

354
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,407
It's okay.

355
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:57,815
It's okay.
He's okay.

356
00:19:57,908 --> 00:19:59,687
Respiration's good, pulse is solid.

357
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,573
We need a lot of nurses in here.

358
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,160
Dr. Cuddy.

359
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,739
That face that launched
a thousand long faces.

360
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,202
Get control of your patient.

361
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:29,198
- Strap him to the bed if you have to.
- I want to keep all four.

362
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,519
You can have two.

363
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,857
You don't get negotiation, do you?

364
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,883
I say four, you say three,
we finally settle on three and a half.

365
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:39,861
- Which would be good news for Taub.
- You don't want four.

366
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:41,158
You don't want three.

367
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:45,302
But if I say three,
you get to keep playing your game.

368
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:47,046
Who would you pick?

369
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,205
Are you asking my opinion?

370
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,964
If you have any absolute truths,
that would be even better.

371
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:54,875
You never want my advice.

372
00:20:54,918 --> 00:20:57,847
You spend your life
trying to avoid my advice.

373
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:01,414
You're a bureaucratic nightmare,
you're a chronic pain

374
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,809
in the ass, and you're
a second-rate doctor at best.

375
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:05,298
Am I blushing?

376
00:21:05,993 --> 00:21:07,283
But you do...

377
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:09,491
Know this stuff.

378
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:16,030
Can we get this over with?

379
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:18,685
Taub and Kutner.

380
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:20,987
Taub will stand up to you.

381
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:23,071
You won't like him,
but you'll respect him.

382
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,337
Kutner,

383
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,259
shares your philosophy of medicine.

384
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:31,292
God knows I don't need two of you,
but he will actually help you.

385
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:34,753
It's not malaria.
Bloodwork's negative.

386
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:37,390
But we did find the reason for the DIC.
Bad blood fragments.

387
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:39,623
If we can figure out
how they got there...

388
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,049
- Blood exposure during sex?
- Hemolysis from the malaria meds?

389
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:48,301
Stop guessing.

390
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:51,081
- You'll spoil the surprise.
- If you're looking to get information

391
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:54,090
out of the guy, he's not exactly
the bare-your-soul type.

392
00:21:57,197 --> 00:22:00,528
I was wondering
if you guys know girl from Ipanema.

393
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,650
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. What are you doing?

394
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,765
That's mine, man.

395
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,900
You're gonna be denying
that in a second.

396
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
Next time make sure you bring enough
for the whole class.

397
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:22,950
He's been sharing needles with this guy.

398
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,492
As he injected this guy's blood,
his own blood attacked it, chewed it up.

399
00:22:26,507 --> 00:22:28,097
Those were the fragments we found.

400
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,772
So DIC was nothing?

401
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,100
We're back to bloody vomit

402
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:34,930
and his two dozen other drug
or non-drug symptoms.

403
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:38,406
Re-check everything.

404
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,633
Throw these guys out,

405
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:41,250
and strap the patient down.

406
00:22:41,505 --> 00:22:42,330
House!

407
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,600
Respiratory failure.

408
00:22:50,534 --> 00:22:52,100
Good news for you, thirteen.

409
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:56,360
That is definitely not drugs.

410
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:02,310
The blood clots were drug-related.

411
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,815
The coughing up blood
and the respiratory arrests

412
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,508
are still on the table.

413
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:07,567
Inhalants.

414
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:09,612
If i'd wanted a knee-jerk
drug diagnosis,

415
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:11,250
I would have told Foreman where we are.

416
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,464
He knows where we are.

417
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:17,145
Because he followed you!

418
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,890
I followed Taub.
I followed her.

419
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,545
He had a bleeding problem.
That could cause respiratory arrest.

420
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,305
If I wanted to forgive
his drano-drinking ways,

421
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:26,033
I wouldn't ignore what you just said.

422
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,242
Could be an infection.

423
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:29,096
No, the lumbar puncture's clear.

424
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:30,359
What lumbar puncture?

425
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:31,806
You didn't authorize that test.

426
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:34,022
True, and yet,
here I am with the results.

427
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,873
Thirteen thought it was bacteria
meningitis.

428
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:37,479
And I had the eyeball.

429
00:23:37,547 --> 00:23:38,725
It was a harmless test.

430
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:41,056
Patient's welfare still counts
for something, doesn't it?

431
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,305
Yep.
Minus 50.

432
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,647
Chronic pulmonary embolism
would explain the breathing problem

433
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,341
and the blood coming from his lungs.

434
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,142
- I'll run an.
- You're not running any tests.

435
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:54,373
He knows it's not PES.

436
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,644
- The guy's d-dimer's normal.
- Doesn't always rule out.

437
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:58,731
Go in to run one test,
run eight more like she did,

438
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,091
find out which one's right.

439
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:02,341
Then comes back with a brilliant guess.

440
00:24:02,371 --> 00:24:03,381
Is this true?

441
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:04,942
- No.
- Too bad,

442
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:07,498
cause that would have earned
you 40 points for cleverness.

443
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:08,686
The points go to Amber.

444
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:10,732
- Foreman, you run the tests.
- Sure.

445
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,984
Anything I can do to help your game.

446
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:17,970
- He's not gonna run the tests?
- I don't think so.

447
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:24,138
So what's wrong with me?

448
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,671
You mean besides your music?

449
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:30,593
Well, sure, cause I don't play
tour kind of music,

450
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,719
- it's not music, right?
- Yeah.

451
00:24:32,842 --> 00:24:34,855
I resent you because
you're not perry como.

452
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,405
Look, I don't.

453
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,942
I don't play for an audience,

454
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:41,968
Okay?

455
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,136
Well, then, that stage
you stand on is an odd choice.

456
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,902
I just, I do it for me, okay?
I don't do it for you.

457
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:52,215
You have three choices in this life.
Be good, get good, or give up.

458
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:53,970
You've gone for column "D".

459
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:55,619
Why?

460
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:02,504
Simple answer is
if you don't try, you can't fail.

461
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,954
Are you really that simple?

462
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:09,775
Look, you know, some people...

463
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,209
They like my music.

464
00:25:12,242 --> 00:25:13,639
Most people can't stand it.

465
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,210
But they just sort of just shrug
and ignore me.

466
00:25:19,262 --> 00:25:20,272
But a few,

467
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,350
the feel like they have to tell me

468
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,001
what I'm screwing up.

469
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:28,761
You know, what I'm wasting.

470
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,239
Why do they care?

471
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,858
You have some peculiar masses
near your heart.

472
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,860
Peculiar how?

473
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:44,007
Well, unlike your music,
they elicit some emotional response.

474
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,142
That's odd.

475
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:49,543
What?

476
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:52,709
You care if I appreciate your music,
but you don't care if you live or die.

477
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,985
Maybe the answer is that simple.

478
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:02,747
I can't apologize enough.

479
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:04,715
To you, to your family.

480
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,655
There may not be
any technical liability here, but.

481
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,499
You're ripping it up
because you think it would be wrong

482
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:18,332
to take money from me?

483
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,368
I think it would be wrong
so little money from you.

484
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,960
You're out 6, 000.

485
00:26:25,024 --> 00:26:26,560
You ruined my life.

486
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,344
I ruined three months.

487
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,980
For the first time in my life,
I was living in the present.

488
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:34,014
Cause that's all there was.

489
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,961
You're suing me
not for the wrong diagnosis,

490
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,484
but for the right one?

491
00:26:42,696 --> 00:26:44,631
Have you spoken to a lawyer?

492
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,494
You gave me

493
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:48,688
happiness...

494
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,272
And then you took it away.

495
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,078
Definitely no emboli.

496
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:01,117
It's pretty fuzzy.

497
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:03,770
Hey, for point and shoot
I thought I did okay.

498
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,040
It's fuzzy because he was still shaking
cause was coming down from the heroin.

499
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:10,435
- Where is everybody else?
- The clinic's been quarantined.

500
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:13,516
A patient came in with
avian flu-like symptoms.

501
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,673
And 50 extra dollars in spending money.

502
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:17,111
Can you do this echo again?

503
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:18,438
Okay,

504
00:27:18,964 --> 00:27:20,496
minus five for ingratitude!

505
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:21,942
No "thank you, Dr. House."

506
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,227
No "here's a bottle of codeine
for your troubles, Dr. House".

507
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,029
I was asking if you could do it again
after giving him a sedative

508
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,089
to keep him still.

509
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:30,231
I could.

510
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:31,832
We'd definitely get the answer.

511
00:27:31,906 --> 00:27:34,396
But since the opiates would decrease
his respiratory drive,

512
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:36,050
and he already can barely breathe,

513
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:38,637
minus ten
for asking me to kill the patient.

514
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:40,788
What if it's a congenital defect?

515
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:42,778
An anomalous vessel on his heart?

516
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:45,322
You know that the heart
does the blood stuff, right?

517
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:46,981
And the lungs do the breathing.

518
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,866
If the vessel wrapped around
his trachea?

519
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,737
- What do you want me to do?
- MRA.

520
00:27:57,147 --> 00:27:59,267
See if you can get a clear picture
of that vessel.

521
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:01,919
What.
Wait.

522
00:28:01,953 --> 00:28:03,283
What, what, why?

523
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:06,805
You said the picture sucked
because the patient was shaking.

524
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,285
- MRA will be worse.
- We have to get a picture.

525
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,892
You were doing better
before you had a good idea.

526
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,852
How can we see
it if we don't take a picture?

527
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,524
You can see me, right?

528
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:22,992
We want to look at his heart.

529
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,518
With our eyes.

530
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,813
So I kill the patient on my
operating table.

531
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:30,658
You get to keep testing your team.

532
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,346
And I take the heat from Cuddy.

533
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:34,726
If it goes that way, yeah,
that'll be excellent.

534
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,608
His respiratory status
is through the floor.

535
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:38,893
If there's a vessel
and we don't remove it fast,

536
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,661
best case,
he's on a ventilator for life.

537
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,806
Granted, it'll be a short one.

538
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:45,254
Who do you think I should hire?

539
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,084
You want me to tell you in front of him?

540
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,933
It would be rude to ask him
to leave now.

541
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:54,421
If you don't do the surgery,

542
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,016
the patient will die.

543
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:59,216
You'll have had nothing to do with it.
And everyone will know that

544
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:01,776
had nothing to do with it.
Everyone will know that it's because

545
00:29:01,793 --> 00:29:03,690
you were pissed off at House
for firing you.

546
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:05,652
You know that's not why I'm saying no.

547
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,198
But that's how it's gonna play out.

548
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:10,355
Keep him and Amber.

549
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,170
You'll get stuff done.

550
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,421
Prep him for surgery.

551
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,233
This isn't an anomalous vessel.

552
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,274
Look at these lymph nodes.

553
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,471
Way too big.

554
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:26,440
There are the masses you saw.

555
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,080
70 over 40.
He's crashing.

556
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,574
Two units of PRBCS.

557
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:32,192
Starting dopamine.
We're losing him!

558
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,792
So...
How's your game going?

559
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,680
It's not whether you win or lose.

560
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,752
Respiratory failure.

561
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,581
Enlarged lymph nodes.

562
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:51,083
Whatever this is, he's not going
to be breathing much longer.

563
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:52,966
Does Foreman being here mean
the game's over?

564
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:54,839
It means the patient's life
is almost over.

565
00:29:54,854 --> 00:29:56,287
You can call it what you want.

566
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,096
We're done, people!
Come on!

567
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:04,079
I need ideas.
And I don't care who they come from.

568
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:05,140
Of course you do.

569
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:08,055
This is still a game. You still going
to reward whoever gets right idea,

570
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,854
punish whoever's wrong.
Hire who you want,

571
00:30:09,869 --> 00:30:11,023
get this over with.

572
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,151
Thirteen, Kutner.

573
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,301
I'm sorry.
Go home.

574
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:24,693
Why?

575
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,916
It doesn't matter.
He just told me that gotta.

576
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:28,778
Lungs are stiff, could be a RDS.

577
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,390
You fluid-overloaded him.

578
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,316
Anyone's lungs would
leak after that surgery.

579
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,825
- Good-bye.
- Anaphylactic shock.

580
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,220
- No sign of bronchospasm.
- If the lymph nodes are caused

581
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:39,471
chronic stimulation his immune system?
Impurities his drugs could have caused.

582
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:41,693
Street drugs are laced
with all kinds of things. Immune

583
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,352
overreaction would explain everything.

584
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,273
Drug diagnosis.

585
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,094
That's what you're going with.

586
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:55,898
That firing thing.

587
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,943
It was all a dream.

588
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:01,877
Go find where he gets his drugs
and what's in them.

589
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,494
Put him on dimercaprol
for heavy metal poisoning.

590
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:11,643
Competition works.

591
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,169
So you're not gonna tell me
who sells you drugs?

592
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,335
Why does it matter?

593
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:27,219
You're dying.
Does that matter?

594
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,570
Not really.

595
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,556
I'm not an adult.

596
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:41,755
I never wanted to be.

597
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:45,982
So if the choice...

598
00:31:47,926 --> 00:31:50,460
Is running out the clock
with a walker...

599
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:53,824
And a bedpan...

600
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,780
You don't regret anything?

601
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:07,438
Well, there was a lot of drugs.

602
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,831
A lot of drinking...

603
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:13,809
A lot of fights.

604
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,358
I regret everything else.

605
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:30,233
You hate me,

606
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:31,768
don't you?

607
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,261
Yeah.

608
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,295
I don't care.

609
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,272
What's it like?

610
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,746
It means you have no regrets.

611
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,406
Kinda sticks in your head, doesn't it?

612
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,966
This guy's amazing.

613
00:33:15,374 --> 00:33:17,192
There's not one redeeming note.

614
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,580
What sort of a lawyer tells his client

615
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,971
he's got a case because
he's going to live?

616
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:24,325
I've heard that not all lawyers

617
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,342
are as ethical as the ones we see on TV.

618
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,629
I don't think this guy
even has a law degree.

619
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,487
A lot of the guys on TV don't, either.

620
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:32,942
I think he has a medical degree.

621
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:46,816
It directly affects my bottom line.

622
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:48,678
You have less money to lend.

623
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,856
I'm trying to take responsibility!

624
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,289
And I'm trying to teach you
that everyone is out for theirs.

625
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:54,656
You might as well keep yours.

626
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:55,779
And lend it to you?

627
00:33:56,754 --> 00:33:58,656
You have to control everything.

628
00:33:58,908 --> 00:34:01,618
How come you're going around asking
everyone who you should fire?

629
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:03,164
I'm asking for input!

630
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:05,548
I thought you would have admired
the humility.

631
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,751
You like games
because you can control them.

632
00:34:07,766 --> 00:34:09,328
God I'm gonna put the record back on.

633
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:12,068
You like what's interesting.
Never mind if it's real or good.

634
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,280
Wanna know why
you offered that guy six grand?

635
00:34:14,308 --> 00:34:16,988
Life just happens,
and that scares the hell out of you!

636
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:18,448
You think you can cure pain.

637
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:19,981
You think you can avoid pain!

638
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:22,223
You think you're responsible
for every failure, every

639
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,205
patient's boring life,
ever friend's screwed-up.

640
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,558
You don't want to face it any more
than my patient does.

641
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:29,420
Dying's easy.

642
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:30,774
Living's hard.

643
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:36,507
That can't possibly be as poignant
as it sounded.

644
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:43,707
Still can't find the drug source,
but I don't think that's the problem.

645
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:45,275
The dimercaprol isn't working.

646
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:48,181
And quidd volunteers at a home
for abandoned kids.

647
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:49,738
Why are you telling me this?

648
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,211
Because his bass player told me.

649
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:52,464
Is it medically relevant?

650
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,491
I don't know.

651
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:56,733
Well, then why are you.
Stop playing games and do your job!

652
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:05,207
No.

653
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:13,349
This time,

654
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,922
I'm firing Taub and Amber.

655
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,232
This is a joke, right?

656
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:22,759
It's only a joke
If you come up with the answer.

657
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:24,612
It's not really funny if you don't.

658
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,705
Thirteen and Kutner, you're fired too.

659
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:33,271
Foreman.
He's a druggie.

660
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:35,686
I was never sure there was
a disease in the first place.

661
00:35:35,793 --> 00:35:37,044
So all we know

662
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,396
Is that he's dying.

663
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:40,826
Who wants to tell the patient?

664
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:43,640
Fine.

665
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,374
We'll get some kid to go talk to him.

666
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,427
It's the only people he gets along
with anyway.

667
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:50,305
Are we still fired?

668
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,726
He works with abandoned kids?

669
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,203
Is it medically relevant?

670
00:35:59,148 --> 00:36:00,158
I think so.

671
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:04,994
I need a brain biopsy.

672
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:06,966
For the patient.

673
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:08,557
Stop it.

674
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,590
You two switch?

675
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:13,464
You want to drill into a skull
of a patient who almost

676
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,360
died on the operating table yesterday?

677
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:20,949
Why are they here?

678
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:22,593
Because

679
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,960
I wouldn't have gotten the answer
without each of them.

680
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:27,214
You could have just told me.

681
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,608
I want you to feel guilty.

682
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,637
She thinks the patient's a loser.

683
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,590
She thinks the patient's a winner,

684
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,937
just a regular guy
with a regular problem.

685
00:36:35,355 --> 00:36:38,081
He thinks he's gonna be great
once he's all growed up.

686
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:40,210
And he thinks...

687
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:41,312
What did you think?

688
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:42,586
- Autoimmune.
- Right.

689
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:44,836
Less interesting, but just as important.

690
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,090
We can't all be right.

691
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:47,146
You're all wrong.

692
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,230
My mom always said that two wrongs
don't make a right.

693
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:53,111
She never said
anything about four wrongs.

694
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,660
I always found that suspicious.

695
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:56,424
Plain old measles.

696
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:59,325
Constant exposure from hanging
out with Oliver twist and his lot.

697
00:36:59,456 --> 00:37:01,409
I assume he's been vaccinated.

698
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,284
Patient's immune system was shredded

699
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,688
with years of drugs.

700
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:06,915
They're early markers of rash and fever.

701
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,407
Would have been lost in a druggie.

702
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:09,912
His immune system overreacted.

703
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,383
That's why his body went haywire.

704
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:14,177
That's clever.

705
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:19,608
You're not doing a biopsy without
neurological symptoms.

706
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,213
If I'm right, the virus is in his brain.

707
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,811
Wrong course of treatment
could be his last course of.

708
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,173
I need a neurological.

709
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:28,476
He kept swallowing.

710
00:37:28,543 --> 00:37:31,032
Could be neurological.
Could be a complex partial seizure.

711
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,266
What did it look like?

712
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:37,265
Good...
God, woman.

713
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:38,965
How much more proof do you need?

714
00:37:40,006 --> 00:37:42,833
If you can induce a seizure,
you can have your biopsy.

715
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,024
Hup!

716
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,737
We're gonna use flashing lights.

717
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,717
Noxious stimulation,
It'll irritate your brain.

718
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,024
If there's damage to your neurons,
it'll trigger

719
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,801
a seizure that we can.

720
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,626
I got something much more noxious.

721
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:03,624
It's not as commonly used,

722
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,770
but sound
can be just as big an irritant.

723
00:38:14,063 --> 00:38:16,319
Now remind me of your influences here.

724
00:38:16,953 --> 00:38:18,350
Cause I'm gonna say,

725
00:38:18,386 --> 00:38:19,658
Thelonious monk

726
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:22,379
and the sound a trash compactor makes

727
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,365
when you crawl inside it.

728
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,301
I don't do it for you.
I do it for me.

729
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:39,364
What do you think?

730
00:38:39,388 --> 00:38:40,708
Is he seizing or dancing?

731
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:41,962
Seizing.

732
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,399
Play him the b-side.
It's even worse.

733
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:46,327
Schedule an OR for the biopsy.

734
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:48,252
See you in the lecture hall.

735
00:39:16,697 --> 00:39:18,061
A little mood music.

736
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:20,656
Build the suspense.

737
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:22,363
Sounds more folky.

738
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,145
You seriously have no idea
when to stup up, do you?

739
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:31,186
Amber, please stand.

740
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:35,538
You didn't call me bitch. Is that bad?

741
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:40,122
You play the game

742
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:42,017
better than anybody else here.

743
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:45,278
But for the wrong reasons.

744
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:47,505
Reasons don't matter.
Results are the only thing.

745
00:39:47,522 --> 00:39:48,599
You were wrong.

746
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,345
20 years ago,
this was recorded by Jim Moskowitz.

747
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,635
Who later became known as Jimmy Quidd.

748
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:04,304
Loves kids.

749
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,221
Apparently has a heart,
perhaps even a soul.

750
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,249
If you're gonna work for me,

751
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:14,508
you have to be willing to be wrong,

752
00:40:15,152 --> 00:40:16,666
willing to lose.

753
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,611
Cause you just did.

754
00:40:20,478 --> 00:40:21,613
You're fired.

755
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:33,803
Thirteen, please stand.

756
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,923
You're fired.

757
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:47,742
- You just said I was right about.
- He was a drug addict.

758
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,948
Four applicants, two spots.

759
00:40:56,277 --> 00:40:58,040
If I had three, I'd keep you.

760
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,655
Game over.

761
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,598
You're gonna have to grow old after all.
You've got measles.

762
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,682
We're blasting you with corticosteroids.

763
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,077
- What's wrong with you?
- I got fired.

764
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,700
What are you doing here?

765
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,766
Trying not to care.

766
00:41:49,483 --> 00:41:50,341
Yeah.

767
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,834
Well, that's not easy.

768
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:02,969
What the hell did you do?

769
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,773
- You told me to hire Kutner and Taub.
- Because I knew you wouldn't.

770
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:11,612
- I can't let you hire two men.
- Now, that is sexist.

771
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:14,040
- You've already got Foreman.
- Is he a dude?

772
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,298
- Hire a woman too.
- Hire two women.

773
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:20,990
You can have the one that
gives a crap about people.

774
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:23,320
They both do.

775
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:24,817
Great.

776
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,771
Hire thirteen.

777
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,330
This was your plan all along.

778
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,128
Well, at least the games are over.

779
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,470
How long have you known me?
