1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:03,203
Yeah, I said I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling too hot.

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:05,994
You're sneezing,
you can do that in a movie theater.

3
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:09,172
Yeah, and I will be in a nice soft chair
when I collapse. I'm exhausted Dave.

4
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:10,523
<i>Come on.
We're gonna be late.</i>

5
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:12,533
Episode four,
never comes to the big screen.

6
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:14,472
This is the pre-lucas-ized version,
remember?

7
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:16,137
<i>None of that greedo shooting first crap.</i>

8
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:17,218
Go without me.

9
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:19,533
What are you talking about?
You love Star Wars.

10
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:21,545
Don't you?

11
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:22,714
Ben.

12
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,111
- Since when?
- Since just before

13
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,730
I started pretending I loved it.

14
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,575
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to be supportive.

15
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:33,029
Fine.
I'll go alone.

16
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:48,577
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- <i>Me too.</i>

17
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,373
I'm so woozy I can hardly think.

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,524
We'll hang out at home.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,950
No, you should go.

20
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:56,229
Did you just feel something?

21
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:58,157
Feel?
Like what?

22
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:00,175
- Is there an earthquake?
- In New Jersey?

23
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:01,698
- Oh, God.
- What?

24
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:03,247
I think I'm, like,

25
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:04,664
hallucinating.

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,117
Call 911.

27
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:55,983

28
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:35,346
26-year-old female,

29
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:38,293
gas main exploded under her building.
She was pulled out of the rubble

30
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,648
after six hours.

31
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:51,429
Two surgeries for multiple
fractures and burns.

32
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:52,963
I'm thinking the broken bones

33
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,171
are a response to the building
falling on her head.

34
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:00,889
And the fever?

35
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:03,726
She's the only collapse victim
whose body temperature...

36
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,173
Put her on antipyretics.

37
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,084
Already have.

38
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:12,473
The fever is holding at 104.

39
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:13,716
Fluctuating consciousness.

40
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,808
I can't take the case.
I don't have a team.

41
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,247
So hire a team.

42
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:19,094
What for?
I don't have a case.

43
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:20,882
Have you even interviewed anybody?

44
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:22,717
You test drive a car before you buy it.

45
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,188
You have sex before you get married,

46
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:26,972
I can't hire a team based
on a ten-minute interview.

47
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,110
What if I don't like
having sex with them?

48
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,947
You've spent the last two weeks
doing absolutely nothing.

49
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:42,181
Concert is over.

50
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:45,330
In what
twisted universe does mastering

51
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,247
Eddie Van Halen's two-handed arpeggio

52
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,697
technique count as absolutely nothing?

53
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:52,370
Take the case or you will
spend the next month

54
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:55,301
helping the collapse
team change bandages.

55
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:57,732
I diagnose her.

56
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,774
Alone.

57
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:00,182
By the end of the day,

58
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:01,976
you go away for a week.

59
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,074
Done.

60
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,171
It's not gonna work.

61
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,062
If he solves the case, we cure the girl.

62
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:16,563
And prove he doesn't need a team.

63
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,410
He's not gonna solve the case.
Not that fast.

64
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,223
Why not.

65
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,613
Because he needs a team!
And this'll prove to him.

66
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,758
You wanna change his mind
about something you need

67
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,767
a more convincing argument
and "you promised."

68
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:28,948
Fever,

69
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:33,002
non-responsive to antibiotics
and antipyretics.

70
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,637
Fluctuating consciousness.

71
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,062
Go!

72
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:41,629
You talking to me?

73
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,045
Yes.

74
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:50,344
Imagine that

75
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,581
the roof of the storage closet

76
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:55,232
collapses on your favorite
floor buffer.

77
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,705
Which then starts overheating.

78
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,441
Why would I have
a favorite floor buffer?

79
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,479
Okay.

80
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:04,103
Maybe the electrical works
got banged up

81
00:05:04,142 --> 00:05:06,225
in there from stuff falling on it.

82
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,447
Interesting.

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,466
Brain damage leading to
hypothalamic dysregulation.

84
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,624
If you're brought in covered in rubble,

85
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:18,166
it's all about the MRI's.
We'd have seen that. Come on!

86
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,327
You gotta earn that fiver.

87
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:20,368
Or stuff

88
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:22,081
leaked in the holes,
messing it up.

89
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,341
Lacerations leave multiple
portals for infection.

90
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:27,585
Bacterial would have
responded to the antibiotics.

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,125
Too high for viral.

92
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:31,688
Parasites or Fungus is possible.

93
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,049
Or maybe Lupus.

94
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,732
My grandma has Lupus.

95
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,357
Okay, autoimmune.

96
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,237
I'll run a lupus panel.
Infection fits best.

97
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:45,112
Complete history would be helpful.

98
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:48,382
Which leads to the
worst part of the job.

99
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,719
Dealing with the floor buffer's family.

100
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,477
We talked every couple of weeks,

101
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,444
but ben would know better than I...

102
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:00,179
No farms, no travel anywhere weird.

103
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,920
You get that, Dr. Buffer?

104
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,569
No travel, no farm.

105
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,541
The file says she was sick
before the building collapsed.

106
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:09,955
I figured it was just a cold.

107
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,316
Why do you think's related?

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,022
Her being sick and her being sick?

109
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:14,256
Often is.

110
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:17,090
She was unconscious when I found her.

111
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:18,989
We'd been fighting.

112
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:20,932
I just want to...

113
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,814
Just tell me she's gonna be okay.

114
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:25,882
I'm not even sure you're gonna be okay.

115
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,282
We're gonna make her all better.

116
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:36,909
Showoff.

117
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:38,363
You oughta be nicer to people.

118
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:40,240
Where are we going?

119
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,109
You know how the laughter
of little children is infectious?

120
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,384
Parasites and Fungi are even more so.

121
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,942
We're gonna find out which one
is making her brain bubble over.

122
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:49,973
Where, the building?

123
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,450
EPA's doing that job for us.

124
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,686
They say it's clean.

125
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:55,635
Which means we're making
a pilgrimage to castle blackberry.

126
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,252
Her name's Bradbury.

127
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,033
- I should ask them for keys.
- No need.

128
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:01,514
I'm sure we can find
a large rock somewhere.

129
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,730
I'm not breaking in to somebody's house.

130
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,076
I got principles.

131
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:12,683
I got some loose change
here says you don't.

132
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:15,691
I'm not doing this.

133
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,783
For less than a 50.

134
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:23,459
Where's the restaurant?

135
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:24,961
What restaurant?

136
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,847
The one you said you were
taking me to for lunch.

137
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:30,756
This one's Homier.

138
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:33,477
Dibs on the cold pizza.

139
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,985
I'm sure it looked easier on youtube.

140
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:56,033
You don't need a team.

141
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,281
You can't even get arrested
without company.

142
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,255
You're right.
Only one solution.

143
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,204
Never replace them.
Ever.

144
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:04,779
Do you need help?

145
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:07,424
Patronize the poor cripple.

146
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:10,898
- Let me get that.
- I got it.

147
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:12,213
Will you...
Let me...

148
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,420
Just let me get it.

149
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:19,722
I'll check the bedroom.

150
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,642
Some interesting mold
on the windowsill here!

151
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,680
It's gonna take me a while.

152
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,708
I'll cover the bathroom.

153
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:11,524
She had a secret diary.

154
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,751
Is there any other kind?

155
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:15,293
What are you doing?

156
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:18,554
There's a sale on liquid tide.

157
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:22,526
If you're broke, I can lend you
a tiny bit of the money I owe you.

158
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:25,018
No, no, I wouldn't put you
in that position.

159
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,742
What does the diary say?

160
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:29,074
It's basically a list
of her sexual encounters.

161
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:31,952
Boys, girls, vibrating appliances.

162
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,329
If it was, you'd be quoting,
not summarizing.

163
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,749
This is a parade of sad banalities.

164
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,169
"I can hardly get out of bed.

165
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,364
Feeling blue." Then, three months ago,

166
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,627
turns into a parade of happy banalities.

167
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:45,107
"Starting to turn the corner.

168
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:46,376
Job's looking up."

169
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:49,345
We can stop swabbing.
Her clich's are getting healthier.

170
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:51,459
Or she's less depressed.

171
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:54,529
- Aren't there pills that do that?
- Antidepressants don't cause fever.

172
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:55,550
Not on their own.

173
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:58,069
But the ER didn't know
she was on MAO inhibitors,

174
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,654
so they gave her demerol.

175
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:01,136
It's a nasty combo.

176
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:03,597
So all you have to do
is convince this kid

177
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,601
that his girlfriend had a secret doctor,

178
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,201
and a secret stash, and a secret life.

179
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:12,049
It's been a while since a patient took
a swing at you. Can I watch?

180
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:13,914
I only have to convince the mother.

181
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:16,832
Actually...

182
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:19,222
I don't have to convince anyone.

183
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,208
This it total crap.

184
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:23,175
If she was seeing a psychiatrist,
I'd know.

185
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,676
If she was on drugs, I'd know.

186
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:27,230
Mrs. Bradbury, please sign the form

187
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,728
so we can start the dialysis.

188
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,281
But why antidepressants?

189
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,642
I don't understand!

190
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:35,394
Mrs. Bradbury, please sign the forms
so we can start the dialysis.

191
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,539
Stop saying that.

192
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:38,655
Dr. Buffer, what is going on?

193
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:40,126
What aren't you telling us?

194
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,282
He's a janitor?

195
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,509
More significantly, a blabbermouth.

196
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:46,922
House, shut up!

197
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:51,591
I am very sorry
how Dr. House handled this.

198
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:53,729
It is completely unforgivable.

199
00:10:55,937 --> 00:10:57,194
Except if he's right.

200
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,642
Dialysis will filter her blood.

201
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,979
There's nothing to filter.

202
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,409
Save her life.

203
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,792
She wasn't depressed.

204
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:05,758
I'm miserable around Ben.

205
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,289
Not me.
I like Ben.

206
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,143
February 12th.

207
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,107
Either she's depressed,
or she just thinks you're a jerk.

208
00:11:16,184 --> 00:11:19,574
Neither suggests that you should be
the one directing her medical treatment.

209
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:22,742
Does the diary say my
daughter's taking these drugs?

210
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:23,794
No, but medically...

211
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,355
Did you find drugs in their home?

212
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,451
She's probably hiding them in her purse.

213
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:30,561
I thought it would be rude to go
searching under 1,000 tons of rubble.

214
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:33,391
This was months ago. We were in a fight.
Doesn't mean she's depressed,

215
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,903
and doesn't mean she doesn't love me.

216
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:38,293
Fine, maybe the diary proves nothing.
On the other hand, half the country's

217
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:39,798
on antidepressants.

218
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:41,999
And it fits her symptoms perfectly.

219
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:51,120
No ring on your daughter's finger
means you make the decisions.

220
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:52,599
I'm not...

221
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,766
sure that I know her
well enough anymore.

222
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,348
You really wanna risk her life

223
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:58,954
on how wellheknows her?

224
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:49,038
You idiot.

225
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:51,509
Listen carefully,
and no one will get hurt.

226
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,938
You must follow these instructions.

227
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,913
Any attempt to contact the FBI.

228
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:58,985
Or other law enforcement agencies

229
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:00,301
or... Cutty...

230
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:02,287
Will be met with...

231
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,203
A large Coke.

232
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:06,317
No ice.

233
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,402
Give it back.

234
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,733
What happened?

235
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,557
Did someone...

236
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:13,587
Kidnap your guitar?

237
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:16,847
A $12,000 1967 flying V?

238
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,758
- Or something?
- Where'd you hide it?

239
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:22,241
I'm flattered you would consider
me this bold and brilliant.

240
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,878
No, 'cause it takes...

241
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,583
It takes a criminal mastermind

242
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:30,737
to pull off a heist from an unlocked,
unguarded room down the hall.

243
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:32,002
What do you want?

244
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,381
Me? Nothing.

245
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,756
But I'm sure the kidnapper wants
what every kidnapper wants.

246
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:39,782
To see you interview five to seven

247
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:41,392
well-qualified fellowship candidates.

248
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:42,956
I don't need a team.

249
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,196
You were bouncing ideas off a janitor.

250
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:46,713
And solved the case!

251
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,187
Hi.

252
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:54,059
I'm Dr. Cuddy.

253
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,822
If you can hear what I'm saying,
blink once.

254
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,952
You can't talk right now.
You have a tube down your throat

255
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:04,371
and try not to move your head.

256
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,213
You've been in a terrible accident.

257
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,562
But it looks like you will have

258
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,027
no permanent injuries.

259
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,699
You've had a bad fever,
but it's gone now.

260
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:14,169
I've been here the whole time,
honey, okay? I'm not leaving.

261
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:15,646
This is very important.

262
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:18,075
I need you to blink one for yes,

263
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:19,903
twice for no.

264
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:22,158
Were you seeing a psychiatrist?

265
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,453
Were you on MAO Inhibitors?

266
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:28,221
The antidepressant.

267
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,409
Megan, it's okay.
It doesn't matter, okay?

268
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:33,656
I love you.

269
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:36,151
Honey?
Honey, what's wrong?

270
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:37,529
Megan, are you all right?

271
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:39,169
What's happening?
Are we upsetting her?

272
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:41,714
Heart is beating too fast.
Get the family out of here.

273
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:43,683
Charging to 200.

274
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:47,922
Clear!

275
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:57,390
We shocked her back into sinus rhythm,
but she's still tachycardic.

276
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:00,915
Fascinating.
Equally fascinating is...

277
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:02,155
Why are you here?

278
00:15:02,195 --> 00:15:04,124
I was gonna leave you
alone if you won the bet.

279
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:05,185
But you lost.

280
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:06,552
I explained the fever.

281
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:08,736
Which is all we were talking about.

282
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,430
She confirmed the antidepressants.

283
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:14,283
Go bet with someone else if you want
to explain the heart problems.

284
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:15,509
She confirmed them by winking.

285
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:17,323
Maybe there was a cute
guy across the room.

286
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:20,205
She got better when I treated her.
Even I'm not that cute.

287
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,265
Two unrelated symptoms,
just a coincidence.

288
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,795
Or you're grasping at straws
to avoid admitting

289
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,323
- you can't do this on your own.
- Fine, what explains the fever

290
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:30,238
and persistent tachycardia?

291
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:31,757
Could be anything.

292
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:35,258
- Endocarditis.
- Nope. Fever, no infection.

293
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:39,020
Keep going, you're doing great.

294
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:43,615
You win.

295
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,280
I don't believe you.

296
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:47,911
I'm not gonna play this game.
Just give me the damn resumes.

297
00:15:51,257 --> 00:15:52,537
And my guitar.

298
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:54,899
I don't have it.

299
00:15:55,324 --> 00:15:57,060
Although I did hear some...

300
00:15:57,092 --> 00:16:00,879
Plangent strumming
from under that couch earlier.

301
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,988
This kidnapper isn't just bold,
he's diabolical.

302
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:15,082
I guess he realized
he probably shouldn't

303
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,673
give it back to you until after

304
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:18,241
you've had the interviews.

305
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,008
You didn't write anything.

306
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:42,533
So what you're saying is you didn't find
that one big explanation...

307
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,004
'Cause there isn't one.

308
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:46,395
- Clever.
- Well, let's just say...

309
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:48,977
Your antidepressant theory
does explain the fever.

310
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:51,701
What about the heart?
And don't say a building fell on her.

311
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:52,782
Okay...

312
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:56,219
- A structure collapsed...
- Shut up.

313
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:59,156
Come on, it fits.
Crushed musculature releases potassium,

314
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:00,333
causes V-TAC...

315
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,241
You'd think she'd get crushed syndrome
after she was crushed, not 2 days later.

316
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:05,981
Microvascular occlusions.

317
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:08,711
Takes that long
for the blood to reperfuse.

318
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:11,844
She'd have a baggy heart.

319
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:14,265
Echo it to confirm.

320
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,645
Is crush syndrome good or bad?

321
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:22,932
Does it sound good?

322
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:24,944
I mean, compared to the
other things it could be.

323
00:17:24,964 --> 00:17:27,828
- There are no other things it could be.
- Then why are you testing her?

324
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,430
Excellent question.

325
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,672
What... What is it?

326
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,438
The heart's fine.

327
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,301
Why is she sweating?

328
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:43,908
- Her fever's back.
- Why would her fever be back?

329
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:45,807
I can't say.

330
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:47,088
You don't know?

331
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,106
I know, I just can't say.

332
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:51,277
'Cause you'll hit me.

333
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:54,458
Let's discuss this
in front of witnesses.

334
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,190
The DT's?

335
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:57,835
So she's an alcoholic now?

336
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:00,609
Her first fever was from the medication
for her depression.

337
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:01,886
Or you're wrong.

338
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:05,090
The second fever was from
the self-medication for depression.

339
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,204
This is insane.

340
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:08,808
You don't think I would have noticed her
being constantly drunk?

341
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:10,781
You were practically
living with Sylvia Plath.

342
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:13,240
- You didn't notice that.
- Tone it down or I will hit you.

343
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,121
Fine, I'll do liver enzyme tests.

344
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:18,919
Liver enzymes can also be elevated
from musculoskeletal trauma.

345
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,501
They'd be there whether she had
a drinking problem or not.

346
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:22,990
They don't know that.

347
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,698
Just pretend to confirm.

348
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:25,937
What's the treatment?

349
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,147
She's not an alcoholic.

350
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:29,729
Hair of the dog, IV alcohol.

351
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,345
Taper it off after a few days.

352
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:33,115
She's sick and traumatized
and half-dead.

353
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,607
You wanna make her drunk.

354
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,611
Just do it.

355
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:38,137
You can't do this.

356
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,023
We lived together, we were gonna
have kids. You barely even know her.

357
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:43,103
Apparently, neither did you.

358
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:11,058
Hello?

359
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,481
Hi, could I speak to trevor... Kaufman?

360
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:14,560
Yo yo, it's Trev.

361
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:15,594
What up?

362
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,535
This is Dr. Gregory House.

363
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,615
Can you come in tomorrow to interview?

364
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,659
House?
Are you serious?

365
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,763
Awesome!

366
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:25,660
- Hey, dude, I got the House interview!
- Oh, look at me!

367
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:28,248
- I got the house interview!
- Dude, shut up! I'm on the phone!

368
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:29,818
- Shut up!
- I'm so cool!

369
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,719
Give me the phone back!

370
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:37,984
I got a page.

371
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:40,808
- No, you didn't.
- They called a code.

372
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:42,198
No, they didn't.

373
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:47,710
You got a page, but not from us.

374
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,969
Did you ever see raid on entebbe?

375
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:05,516
Yeah, in the end,
they release the hostages.

376
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:07,184
How's that working for you?

377
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:08,886
The ugandans played fair.

378
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:11,518
They didn't move
the hostages on the Israelis.

379
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,616
<i>Once again, I am in awe
of the kidnapper's tactical brilliance.</i>

380
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,640
What is el fuego del amor and why
do you need ten of them?

381
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:24,939
It's a...
It's a telanovela.

382
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:26,733
I'm learning spanish.

383
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:27,982
Say adios.

384
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:30,094
Are you erasing my tivo?

385
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,892
- House, not the season finale.
- I don't negotiate with terrorists.

386
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,409
I smoke them out of their hidey-holes.

387
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:40,559
Do you know what terrorists do
when you don't negotiate?

388
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:41,819
They terrorize.

389
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,910
Bring it on.

390
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,042
Fever's down.

391
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,316
Sweating has abated.
Heart's working fine.

392
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:54,992
I guess House was right.

393
00:20:55,357 --> 00:20:56,360
Again.

394
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,119
That's good news, right?

395
00:20:58,168 --> 00:20:59,171
It is good news.

396
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:00,975
So what does this mean,
she's an alcoholic?

397
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,605
There's no other explanation?

398
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:06,225
No, sorry.

399
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,747
It doesn't make any sense.

400
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,638
She's doing this thing
with her mouth again.

401
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:16,769
It's been on and off
for the last couple hours.

402
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:18,338
Is she trying to talk?

403
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:21,104
No.

404
00:21:22,554 --> 00:21:24,075
I think she's screaming.

405
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:30,649
Morning!

406
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,867
Where did you come from?

407
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,956
Apes, if you believe the democrats.

408
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,807
I heard you were there
when I was proven right.

409
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:41,259
The alcohol treatment took away
the heart and fever problems.

410
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,001
Yes, was also there
when you were proven wrong.

411
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:46,696
She'd been silently screaming
for two hours.

412
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:49,054
Amylase and lipase are through the roof.

413
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,460
She has pancreatitis.

414
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,141
IV alcohol can cause pareatitis.

415
00:21:54,044 --> 00:21:55,065
Okay.

416
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:05,674
- You're not gonna argue with me?
- Nope.

417
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,966
- You think I'm right?
- Nope.

418
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:10,281
- Why not?
- Nope.

419
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,109
It's not really a yes or no question.

420
00:22:13,142 --> 00:22:15,196
Which is why I'm not answering it.

421
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,695
If it's not the IV alcohol,

422
00:22:17,776 --> 00:22:19,983
- it's gotta be...
- Not interested.

423
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:23,066
If I'm wrong,

424
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:24,939
she's gonna die.

425
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,820
Are you sure you're still
dean of medicine?

426
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:30,792
I'm not interested in arguing because
I'm not interested in enabling you.

427
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:33,357
You need someone to bounce ideas off of.

428
00:22:33,813 --> 00:22:35,250
You need a team.

429
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:39,286
Don't follow me.

430
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:45,088
MAO Inhibitor caused the fever.

431
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:50,270
Alcohol caused the pancreatitis.
Alcohol withdrawal caused the V-Tach.

432
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:53,758
Your logic is irrefutable.

433
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:55,217
You're wrong.

434
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,606
Well, who are you gonna believe?
A classic toy or a woman who,

435
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:02,760
if she had any confidence in her ideas,
wouldn't feel the need to distract you

436
00:23:02,777 --> 00:23:04,117
with a water bra?

437
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,658
Are you really just gonna
treat the pancreatitis?

438
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:08,326
Are you here to enable me?

439
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:11,075
I don't want her to die
because you're stubborn.

440
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,939
So you can enable and rationalize
at the same time.

441
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:17,366
- Guess you are still dean of medicine.
- If you're right, then this guy,

442
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,098
who's not an ass,
who's not a workaholic,

443
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,970
who's not a sociopath,
has somehow missed

444
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:25,977
both her depression
and severe alcoholism.

445
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:28,915
Yes, imagine that,
a couple with secrets.

446
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,312
Why would she lie?

447
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:35,181
Okay, alcoholism you don't
wanna advertise, but...

448
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:42,471
If you're right, there'd be
an abnormality on the pancreas.

449
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:44,337
At least do an MRI to confirm.

450
00:24:04,164 --> 00:24:07,808
Oh, my God.

451
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,137
This guy means business.

452
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,818
Or guys.
Could be multiple guys.

453
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:17,049
Or a gal.

454
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:18,560
Who knows?

455
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:22,277
All I can say is,
this reeks of boldness.

456
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:25,434
I am not hiring a team.

457
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,424
You ever tighten a guitar string
really, really slowly?

458
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:34,654
Past the point it can handle the strain?

459
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,334
It makes this weird

460
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:37,912
sound.

461
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,485
Almost like a scream.

462
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,233
I thought this was gonna be fun.

463
00:24:56,281 --> 00:24:58,181
I messed with you, you messed with me.

464
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:00,747
Eventually, you give in.

465
00:25:01,395 --> 00:25:04,287
But you've shown
a startling lack of humor,

466
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,846
which got me thinking.

467
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:06,905
Oh, God.

468
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:09,380
What's the real reason
you won't hire a team?

469
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:11,179
I told you, I don't need a team.

470
00:25:11,273 --> 00:25:13,470
Then hire three people and let 'em
sit on their asses.

471
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:16,110
- That wouldn't be right.
- Three years ago, you hired a team.

472
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:17,187
What's changed?

473
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:18,619
I have become a man of principle.

474
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:20,024
I've gotten smarter.

475
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,431
What answer will make socrates shut up?

476
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:24,775
What's changed is,
you hired with a team.

477
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:27,958
You connected with a team,
you work with a team,

478
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,005
and you lost the team.

479
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:31,681
Damn.

480
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:34,060
There's no abnormalities
in her pancreas.

481
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,133
You fall in love, you get married.

482
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:38,524
50% chance it'll end in misery.

483
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:42,060
Hiring employees can be even tougher.
Because you know, eventually,

484
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:43,230
they're gonna leave.

485
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:46,452
There's increased T2 signal
on her hepatic capsule.

486
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:48,240
If you know what I mean.

487
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:50,775
You got hurt.

488
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:52,401
Get over it.

489
00:25:55,677 --> 00:25:57,693
Now, if you'll excuse me, my patient

490
00:25:57,743 --> 00:26:00,132
is about to start bleeding
out of her mouth and anus.

491
00:26:12,435 --> 00:26:13,993
Internal bleeding.

492
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
Not anymore.

493
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,429
Now it's all over the place.

494
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:18,838
Why are you here?

495
00:26:20,022 --> 00:26:21,646
That's my patient down there.

496
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,731
You're here because I'm here.

497
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,966
I am done enabling you.

498
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,415
I know.

499
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:40,605
The alcohol didn't cause the
pancreatitis, the internal bleeding did.

500
00:26:40,644 --> 00:26:43,248
The question is what caused the internal
bleeding? I hate myself.

501
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:45,534
You do know that the patient
had a building land on her.

502
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,743
- Four days ago.
- Bleeding can start at any time.

503
00:26:47,792 --> 00:26:49,378
It's bleeding from five different sites.

504
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,145
You think they synchronized
their watches?

505
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,036
She got warfarin after her hip surgery.

506
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:55,426
It's designed
to mess with bleeding patterns.

507
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,301
Fever, heart, and bleeding.

508
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,876
Three problems,
three completely different explanations.

509
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,325
She must be the
unluckiest woman in the world.

510
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,352
I only cling to this crazy theory
because it's been proven right

511
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:07,552
every step of the way.
Each treatment worked.

512
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,408
Yes, she looks perfectly healthy.

513
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:13,046
This much bleeding is a symptom
of something more.

514
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:17,206
And you need a team because you're wrong
and you're gonna kill this woman.

515
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:27,590
If I had a team,
this patient would be dead.

516
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:30,839
Because they'd be here instead of me
and they wouldn't notice the size

517
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:32,435
of this woman's uterus.

518
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:39,563
Hi!

519
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:40,957
How's it going?

520
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:42,605
Mind if I observe?

521
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:45,300
Got a big room up top window
just for that.

522
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,510
Stop that.

523
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:51,454
You wanna look at vaginas,
there are websites for that.

524
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:53,084
Think I'm made of money?

525
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:55,897
Can you get him out of here?

526
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:57,619
Enlarged uterus.

527
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:00,682
Means that she was recently pregnant.

528
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:04,530
She's a good liar, but I doubt she could
hide a baby from her boyfriend.

529
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:12,014
Scraping in the uterus indicates
that she had an abortion.

530
00:28:12,512 --> 00:28:16,036
But nothing in her medical history.
Only one reason to hide an abortion.

531
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,951
Boyfriend wants babies, she doesn't.

532
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:20,242
She's bleeding everywhere.
Unless the guy was performing

533
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,060
an abortion with a shotgun...

534
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,581
<i>Stop enabling him!</i>

535
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,305
It's not the abortion,
it's what she did after.

536
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,066
The boyfriend
would have noticed condoms.

537
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:29,947
He would notice abstinence.

538
00:28:31,112 --> 00:28:32,887
He would not notice the pill.

539
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,718
Which means, I don't need a team!

540
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,934
Where's your
mother-in-common-law?

541
00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:47,638
Dr. House, this is Doug Mcmurtry.

542
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,783
His girlfriend
was working with megan when...

543
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:52,905
She's dead?

544
00:28:53,468 --> 00:28:55,036
She passed this morning.

545
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:58,820
Well, then why are you still here?

546
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:03,655
I need the old lady's consent
to do some treatment.

547
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:05,195
What'd you find out?

548
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:08,745
I wish I could tell you, but since
you're not legally related...

549
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,139
What the hell did you find out?

550
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:16,444
Your girlfriend had an abortion.

551
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:21,688
See why I didn't tell you?

552
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:27,144
I'd be insane to also tell you
that she's on the pill.

553
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:30,890
No, she's not.

554
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:33,940
If they'd known she was on it, they
wouldn't have given her a blood thinner

555
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,464
after her hip surgery.

556
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,511
The combination caused the bleeding.

557
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:39,699
It's good news.
It's treatable.

558
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:41,473
Just give her tamoxifen.

559
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,007
- Which is normally a breast cancer...
- It's not true.

560
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:46,609
'Cause, we wanna have kids.

561
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:52,788
See, I already did the blood tests.

562
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:57,542
And either she lied to you,
or her blood lied to us.

563
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,997
Tell megan I'm glad she's gonna be okay.

564
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:19,239
How are you doing?

565
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:22,175
I got cancer.

566
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,383
You're on an oncology ward.

567
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:26,134
Everybody's got cancer.

568
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:29,536
You want sympathy, you wanna try the
hardly anything wrong with the world

569
00:30:29,776 --> 00:30:31,937
in fact,
why don't i take you there right now?

570
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,774
How sick are you?
Can you walk?

571
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,239
Are you a doctor?

572
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,446
Admitted today.

573
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:40,278
First day of a five day chemo course.
Yeah, you can walk.

574
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:41,373
Come on, let's go.

575
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:43,742
Does Dr. Wilson know you're here?

576
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:47,476
Well, if he didn't,
this would be really stupid.

577
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,012
Cause then he wouldn't know
where his patient was.

578
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,555
He might think he'd been kidnapped,

579
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,216
the room upstairs is bigger.

580
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:57,187
It's got cable.
Better looking sponge bath nurses.

581
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,841
If you feel sick,
you call me directly, not Dr. Wilson.

582
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:03,465
He's getting his last
set of hormone shots.

583
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,480
You put her on tamoxifen?

584
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:16,004
An anti-cancer drug?

585
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,592
- It blocks estrogen receptors.
- Does it also block breathing

586
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,059
and kidney function?

587
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:22,219
She's crashing.

588
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:25,813
Doesn't mean I was wrong.

589
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:31,076
We're bringing his patient over now,
thanks.

590
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:32,774
Anybody here a doctor?

591
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:38,807
Kidney failure, spiking fever,
breathing difficulties.

592
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:39,932
Any theories?

593
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:45,781
Am I in an M. Night shyamalan movie?

594
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:48,770
You're house,
right?

595
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,970
Okay, I assume you know me
because I once insulted you,

596
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:55,991
your patient, or your relatives.

597
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:58,502
If that's so, I apologize.
I was drunk that day.

598
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:01,059
Patient initially presented
with crush injuries.

599
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:03,239
I know you because
Dr. Cuddy issued a memo.

600
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:08,037
Telling to cooperate fully with me?

601
00:32:08,528 --> 00:32:09,540
Nope.

602
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:12,864
I figured that was a long shot.

603
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,506
Anybody here not get that memo?

604
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,480
Fungal infection.

605
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:29,932
Don't you have a patient?

606
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:32,180
She shot herself in the
leg while high on meth.

607
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:34,541
Wouldn't hurt her to be
in pain for a little while.

608
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,592
Fungal infection would
be in her eyes by now.

609
00:32:36,982 --> 00:32:37,985
Haemophylus.

610
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:39,790
Doesn't explain the remitting fever.

611
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:41,484
You've heard...

612
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:43,341
That I've got a job opening, right?

613
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:45,251
I just care about people.

614
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:48,042
Acute respiratory distress syndrome.

615
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,863
A.R.D.S. Doesn't explain anything.

616
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:50,952
Except the breathing.

617
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:53,113
If you care about people,
you're not getting the job.

618
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,582
I was lying.
Crush syndrome.

619
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,203
Doesn't explain the breathing.

620
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:02,305
- What was the problem with A.R.D.S.?
- Only explained the breathing.

621
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:04,749
- And the crush syndrome?
- It didn't explain the breathing.

622
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:07,180
You a fan of symmetry?

623
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,238
Sure.

624
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,353
Weird.

625
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,633
Cause your eyes are lopsided.

626
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,483
And by eyes,
I mean breasts.

627
00:33:16,674 --> 00:33:17,735
ARDS

628
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,839
And crush syndrome,

629
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,957
both reactions to severe trauma.
Why can't she have both?

630
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:24,179
Because...

631
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:29,536
Because then
there's nothing we could do.

632
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:33,995
Boy, you remind me of someone.

633
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,415
Send me your resume.

634
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,927
I'll put it on top of the pile
that I'm never gonna look at.

635
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,420
I couldn't leave.

636
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:54,303
You don't seem like the type of person
who would give up on giving up.

637
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:56,012
I love her.

638
00:33:56,813 --> 00:33:58,009
You love somebody.

639
00:33:58,106 --> 00:33:59,534
Someone who didn't drink,

640
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:01,213
who wanted to have babies.

641
00:34:01,394 --> 00:34:02,648
And wasn't miserable.

642
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,125
I know she lied, but...

643
00:34:04,304 --> 00:34:05,404
What are you doing?

644
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:07,690
Why are you saying these things to him?

645
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:11,209
The woman you love doesn't exist.

646
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:13,000
This woman is dying.

647
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:17,463
She has acute respiratory distress
syndrome and crush syndrome.

648
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:19,336
Her body's basically giving up.

649
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:22,626
We can keep her on supportive
dialysis and hope for the best.

650
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:30,735
Never mind.

651
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,405
She has a lump on her arm.

652
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:35,074
Does that mean you're wrong?

653
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,129
That would be good news for you guys.

654
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:40,219
We'll know after the biopsy.

655
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,111
Which patient is that?

656
00:34:48,748 --> 00:34:50,426
- Megan...
- House's patient.

657
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:51,507
Yep.

658
00:34:51,577 --> 00:34:52,812
Didn't you get my memo?

659
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:55,225
Sure. Got both memos.

660
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:57,232
Both.

661
00:34:58,776 --> 00:35:01,438
And the second memo said to
ignore the first memo?

662
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:02,551
Yep.

663
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:04,114
Seemed odd.

664
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:07,071
- Did an MRI and...
- Of course you did.

665
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:09,930
What'd you find?

666
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:11,122
It's kind of freaky.

667
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:13,187
She's got growths all over the place.

668
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:19,127
She's got tumors?

669
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,653
Not exactly.

670
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:24,118
The growths are eosinophilic granulomas.

671
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:27,867
They are usually
from allergic reactions.

672
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:30,282
- I'm putting her on steroids.
- Allergy to what?

673
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:31,999
She doesn't have allergies.

674
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,722
We don't know.

675
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:36,199
Unfortunately, the only drug
she's had enough

676
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:38,475
of to have this kind of
reaction is cephalosporin.

677
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:41,405
- And why is that unfortunate?
- Because she was on it two months ago.

678
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:42,854
That's what you mean, right?

679
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,147
She took it for strep throat,

680
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:46,444
- so she can't be allergic to it.
- It would seem so.

681
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,816
What is this hospital doing to her?

682
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:52,054
She has had three
separate medical disasters.

683
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:55,510
And now she's dying of an
allergy she can't possibly have!

684
00:36:22,582 --> 00:36:24,666
Mr. Lee, I just have to check...

685
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:28,530
Sam?
Are you okay?

686
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:37,190
What are you doing here?

687
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:38,599
I was taking a nap.

688
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,129
Where's my patient?

689
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:44,892
You stole my patient.

690
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:47,684
You kidnapped my guitar.

691
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,841
Give him back.

692
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,465
Only when you give her back.

693
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:51,603
It's a she?

694
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,020
Well, it's certainly not a dude.

695
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:56,450
It's a guitar!
You took a human being!

696
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:59,642
Now who doesn't have a sense of humor?

697
00:37:00,097 --> 00:37:02,065
I'm monitoring the guy remotely.

698
00:37:02,149 --> 00:37:05,101
What are you, listening for
the distant sound of screaming?

699
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,648
The nurses know to call me.

700
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:08,269
They don't know who he is!

701
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,994
His name's right there on the chart.

702
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:11,441
Now go away.
I'm working.

703
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:14,652
They give him the wrong meds,
who the hell knows what's gonna happen?

704
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:17,964
House!

705
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:23,212
Bad things would happen.

706
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:28,543
He's in room 318.

707
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,534
What are you...
what are you giving megan?

708
00:37:44,934 --> 00:37:46,381
Megan?
Nothing.

709
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:50,279
Nothing? What's going on?
What's wrong with her?

710
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,189
Her?
Nothing.

711
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:54,013
Then why are you giving her drugs?

712
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:56,068
Just some amphetamines to wake her up.

713
00:37:56,694 --> 00:37:59,588
Everything could be explained
by her lying to you.

714
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:03,290
The antidepressants,
the drinking, the pill.

715
00:38:04,342 --> 00:38:05,345
Until now.

716
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:09,522
Now she's allergic to something
the chart says she's not allergic to.

717
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:12,171
That's not her lying,
that's the chart lying.

718
00:38:13,274 --> 00:38:14,740
Which doesn't make sense.

719
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:20,752
Do you know Liz Masters?

720
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:23,491
- No.
- Yeah, she works with Megan.

721
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:25,845
That was her boyfriend who
you met outside the morgue.

722
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:29,243
This is her chart.

723
00:38:32,015 --> 00:38:34,404
She's on MAO
Inhibitors for depression.

724
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:35,537
She's on the pill.

725
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:37,642
She had an abortion a month ago.

726
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,843
And she's allergic to cephalosporin.

727
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,351
What's going on here?
What, are you saying this isn't megan?

728
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:55,563
- Yes.
- <i>Ben.</i>

729
00:38:56,594 --> 00:38:57,655
<i>Since when?</i>

730
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:00,311
<i>Since right before i began
pretending i loved it.</i>

731
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:03,803
She's the same size as Megan,
same build, same hair color.

732
00:39:03,868 --> 00:39:06,936
They were both horribly injured.
Unrecognizably.

733
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:08,730
Emt teams do not second

734
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:11,821
guess family members
identifications at accident scenes.

735
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,388
Liz died yesterday.
This isn't liz.

736
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:20,818
I know Megan.

737
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,444
I know her hair.

738
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,784
I know her hands.

739
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,404
I know her smell.

740
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:31,894
What's your name?

741
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,365
Liz...

742
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:41,861
Oh, God!

743
00:39:50,852 --> 00:39:52,704
Your girlfriend never lied to you.

744
00:40:46,517 --> 00:40:48,751
I did it all by myself, mommy.

745
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,571
You talking to me?

746
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:54,844
Go away.

747
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,099
I did it all by myself, mommy.

748
00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:08,372
How'd you know it was me?

749
00:41:08,572 --> 00:41:11,933
There's a scent given off
by wounded, feral cats.

750
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,204
You were wrong.

751
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:15,480
I got everything right.

752
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:18,780
- Just treated the wrong.
- They had a good relationship.

753
00:41:18,985 --> 00:41:20,191
He couldn't even identify her.

754
00:41:20,254 --> 00:41:22,241
And you were wrong about needing a team.

755
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:23,476
She almost died.

756
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:26,290
So I almost need a team.

757
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:29,027
You were content with your
"people are idiots" theory.

758
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,810
But Cameron would never
have accepted that

759
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,210
this guy knew nothing
about the love of his life.

760
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,820
And as soon as you claimed
it was multiple conditions

761
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,360
Foreman would have done
anything to prove you wrong.

762
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,370
And then Chase would have done
anything to prove you right.

763
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,434
Any one of them
would have solved this days ago.

764
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:50,374
Hire a team.

765
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:53,359
I don't care how you do it.

766
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:56,498
Just do it.

767
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:03,535
Sometimes,
I am wrong.

768
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:07,399
I have a gift for observation.

769
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:12,540
For reading people in situations.
But sometimes, I am wrong.

770
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:16,826
This will be the longest job
interview of your life.

771
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:18,236
I will test you,

772
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:20,261
in ways that you will often consider.

773
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:22,807
Unfair,
demeaning,

774
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:24,485
and illegal.

775
00:42:25,238 --> 00:42:26,839
And you will often be right.

776
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:28,682
Look to your left.

777
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:31,842
Now look to your right.

778
00:42:32,971 --> 00:42:34,727
By the end of six weeks,

779
00:42:35,794 --> 00:42:37,492
one of you will be gone.

780
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:41,282
As will 28 more of you.

781
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,583
Wear a cup.
