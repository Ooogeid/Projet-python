1
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,193
You like that?

2
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:23,893
I don't know.

3
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:25,852
You want me to use my butt again?

4
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:34,704
I don't know how I got here.

5
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:45,165
- How many drinks did I have?
- Your scotch hasn't even arrived yet.

6
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,291
Means I was drunk when I got here.

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,551
8:50.

8
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,091
I remember being at work.

9
00:00:56,643 --> 00:00:58,400
I've lost at least four hours.

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,642
- Say five words.
- What do you mean?

11
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,400
That's four words.

12
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,099
The accepted diagnostic test
for global memory impairment

13
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,599
is five random words.

14
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:11,775
Are you okay?

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,900
I'm... trying to find that out.

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,300
Give me five animals.

17
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,733
Cat, bird,

18
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:22,702
monkey.

19
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:25,834
Rhino. Goldfish.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,400
Monkey. Rhino...

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,649
Either I'm massively drunk...

22
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,100
Oh, you're bleeding.

23
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:40,300
Or it's someone else's blood.

24
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:42,263
Do you see a wound?

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,244
- How bad is it?
- It's all over.

26
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:51,089
I have a concussion.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,753
Retrograde amnesia.

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,567
No keys, no phone.

29
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,120
- I've been mugged.
- No, you haven't.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,378
You already gave me a 20.

31
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,840
- Did you earn it?
- Not yet.

32
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,187
Someone is going to die.

33
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:16,339
Kenny!

34
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:17,632
Not you.

35
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
I saw something. A symptom.

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,431
Someone is going to die
unless I find them.

37
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:25,937
Who?

38
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:29,200
I have no idea.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,910
Keep the change.

40
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:29,999

42
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:37,464
Merci à Linwelin et Kom1dune.

44
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,328
I saw somebody dying.

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,207
You saw 30 people
flying into glass and metal.

46
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,459
I saw a symptom before the crash.

47
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:19,420
You're concussed, you don't know
what you saw and when you saw it.

48
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,131
A week ago, you noticed
a symptom in a soap star.

49
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,199
Bad argument.
Since I was right about that.

50
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,499
But your brain obviously thinks
it happened last night.

51
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:27,699
Wires are crossed.

52
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:28,860
That's all of it.

53
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:31,954
A few stitches
will hold your brain in place.

54
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,299
Hey, hold your head still,

55
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,860
unless you want me to sew
your nose onto your eye.

56
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,525
- Why was I taking the bus?
- 'Cause you were drunk.

57
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:43,500
What if I saw someone
and I followed them on from...

58
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,947
Somewhere in Princeton?

59
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,514
You okay?

60
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:49,220
Perfect.

61
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,453
You.

62
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,581
Get histories from everyone in here.

63
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,299
- Did you just forget his name?
- No.

64
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:00,283
Lesbian.

65
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:03,463
Find out if anybody on that bus
was taken to other hospitals.

66
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,301
- He just forgot mine.
- No, Thirteen.

67
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,285
- I just wanted to call you a lesbian.
- I'm not a lesbian.

68
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:11,450
I was rounding up. From 50%.

69
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,580
Find my cane and motorcycle.

70
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,648
Figure out where I went last night.

71
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:19,981
Where's your cane and motorcycle?
And where'd you go last night?

72
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,318
You gonna trust me?
I lie about everything.

73
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,020
You're staying the night.

74
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,138
We need to monitor
your brain for swelling.

75
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:29,203
- How much bigger could it get?
- You don't think it's...

76
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,680
a little weird
that there is both a giant crash

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,121
and a simultaneous,
mysterious symptom sighting?

78
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:40,349
What if it's not a coincidence?

79
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:42,425
You mean like the hand of God
reaching down

80
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:43,895
and screwing with you?

81
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,800
That. Or the symptom caused the crash.

82
00:05:50,374 --> 00:05:52,566
You see anybody
in a bus driver's uniform?

83
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:01,767
Right here.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,480
Purpura on lalph klamden's neck.
Indicative of leukemia.

85
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,833
It caused the bleed in the brain,
Hence the accident...

86
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,865
Indicative of wearing a seatbelt.

87
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:12,300
It's just a bruise.

88
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:14,996
- I have leukemia?
- No. We just ruled that out.

89
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,037
Pay attention.

90
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,337
- You probably had a seizure.
- I didn't have a seizure.

91
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,251
I got hit by a garbage truck.

92
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:23,169
Which you drove into
while you were seizing.

93
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,463
You saw the bus driver
exhibiting the initial stages

94
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:28,368
of a seizure and didn't bother
telling him to pull over?

95
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:30,787
Hey!

96
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,900
Nobody leaves here until
I say they can be discharged.

97
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,557
- She said I was...
- Is she me?

98
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:38,874
You have a fever.

99
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,600
No. I'm fine.

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,980
98.6.

101
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,523
I need him to stay.

102
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,567
Pulse is normal. BP's normal.
Everything's normal.

103
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:48,865
I just have a stiff neck from the crash.

104
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:49,982
A stiff neck.

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,031
This man has meningitis.

106
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,824
We need to quarantine the whole ER.

107
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:57,600
No one leaves here until
their full workup is complete.

108
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,500
You left here at 5:23 pm.

109
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:10,920
Your motorcycle never made it home.

110
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,780
Well... that covers ten seconds

111
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,390
out of the four hours I can't remember.
Where else did you look?

112
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,654
We did pull up a list
of all the injuries.

113
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,110
22 victims were brought here,

114
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,063
injuries ranging from a broken pelvis
to a severed right foot.

115
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:26,482
The other eight were
taken over to Princeton General.

116
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:29,427
It would be helpful

117
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:31,299
if these came
with head shots and resumes.

118
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,999
20-something-year-old Jane Doe.

119
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:35,499
Kidney contusion, laceration on her leg.

120
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:38,399
Both of which are expected complications

121
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,699
when someone goes
from 60 to 0 in no seconds flat.

122
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,278
The weirdest thing
we've got is a ruptured spleen.

123
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay. New plan.

124
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:48,838
We make a list of all the bars
between here and the crash site.

125
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:51,280
- We find out where I went, we go{\ there}...
- On it.

126
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:56,262
You're not gonna do anything, are you?

127
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,556
We're gonna go to the ER
and do our jobs.

128
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:00,899
Someone is dying
because I can't remember...

129
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,271
When you remember, you can page us.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,458
The shortest distance
between here and your memory

131
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:10,568
is straight through
your prefrontal cortex.

132
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:13,284
- All we have to do, is access it.
- Great idea.

133
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,380
I'll build the giant submarine.
You get the miniaturization gizmo.

134
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,827
Medical hypnosis can bring the brain
to a class II theta state,

135
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:21,996
increasing focus and memory retrieval.

136
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,290
You're not gonna make me
do the chicken dance?

137
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:26,905
Someone in the surgical
department must be trained.

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Just relax.

139
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:31,700
Keep letting go
of any intrusive thoughts.

140
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:36,844
So what, you saw an ad
in the back of a comic book?

141
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:39,055
Shh. I did a rotation in Melbourne.

142
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:41,999
Focus on the sound of your breath.

143
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:44,018
You're taxing an already injured brain.

144
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,604
It's like telling him to walk it off
after a broken ankle.

145
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:48,900
Wilson is done talking now.

146
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:54,900
Visualize the bus.

147
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:58,400
The way it looked, the way it smelled.

148
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:02,018
The people on it.
What they look like.

149
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:06,400
This is a waste of...

150
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,965
time.

151
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,579
Cool.

152
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,900
Focus on the details.

153
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,100
Bus is empty.

154
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:27,603
Is this really working?

155
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,100
Shh. Just...

156
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,200
Focus. Clear your mind.

157
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,234
Think back to how you felt.

158
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:34,527
Details you saw.

159
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:40,300
I can't see out the windows.

160
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:43,400
And I can see you guys.

161
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,873
Memories further from the incident
should be clearer.

162
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:49,333
Where were you
before you got on the bus?

163
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:04,300
Why'd you get so drunk
at 5:00 in the afternoon, alone?

164
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,900
I need a reason?

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,148
God, I hate "beer" brand beer.

166
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,100
When he's hypnotized, can he lie?

167
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,941
- He...
- I can be mistaken.

168
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:16,300
I can't actually lie under hypnosis.

169
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:17,954
- Is he lying?
- No.

170
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:21,080
- What are you running away from?
- When I'm drinking without you,

171
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,649
what am I running away from?

172
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:24,243
One of those imponderables.

173
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:27,455
Can you hold off on your insecurities
until we find this patient?

174
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,723
Do you see anyone in the bar?

175
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,878
I see a faceless crowd.

176
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:35,889
How do I focus?

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,860
Say something to make me focus.

178
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,300
He's concerned about you.

179
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:41,263
Why does that mean he's insecure?

180
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,472
Get your... girlfriend outta here.

181
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:47,233
- It's a legit question.
- Amber's there?

182
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,917
- You've got Amber in your head?
- You put her in my head.

183
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:50,917
I can't have...

184
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:52,808
A conversation with you
in my subconscious

185
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,250
without her tagging along.

186
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,148
She'd better have her clothes on.

187
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:57,700
Unfortunately.

188
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:01,447
I didn't mean to say that out loud.

189
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:04,034
- Say what out loud?
- I didn't say it out loud?

190
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,550
- Nothing.
- What's going on in there?

191
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,957
If I can't lie,
I need these two outta here.

192
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:15,503
Let's just... ignore Wilson
and Amber from now on, shall we?

193
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,082
I wish it were that...

194
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,358
That's some program they
got down there in melbourne.

195
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,400
Cheers.

196
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:29,863
I remember the bartender.

197
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:32,980
Good. Now you're accessing
your temporal lobe.

198
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,190
Does the bartender have
any odd symptoms?

199
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,500
No. He seems fine.

200
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:40,861
Anybody here sick?

201
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,723
Anyone here taking the bus?

202
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:43,904
You are.

203
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:47,743
Because you took my keys.

204
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,399
Good. This is good.

205
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,177
Now we can retrace your steps.

206
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:56,002
Let's go back to the bus.
What's in front of you?

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,914
Passengers.

208
00:11:58,357 --> 00:12:01,000
Anything... special about them?

209
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,441
Some emo guitar hero wannabe.

210
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,895
You're focusing on him.

211
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:16,100
Why?

212
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,800
Because nose picking
could mean nasal peritis.

213
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:20,563
He's dying.

214
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:23,741
- You a nose picker?
- Do I have to answer?

215
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,710
If the answer was no,
you'd have answered.

216
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,199
- Tilt your head back.
- He's fine. He doesn't have meningitis.

217
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:32,163
Just like everybody else
we've had to give meningitis shots to.

218
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,794
You can go.

219
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:35,207
You have a brain tumor.

220
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,377
You're kidding, right?

221
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:40,440
If I was kidding,
I'd be dressed like you.

222
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,600
You're fine.
A nurse will sign you out.

223
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,449
Go home. Have fun. Relax.

224
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:47,665
I'm probably just a nut case.

225
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:54,200
Tilt your head back.

226
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:07,448
You can get your things and go.

227
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,200
You need to rest.

228
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,700
I'm admitting you.

229
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Oh!

230
00:13:17,718 --> 00:13:18,700
Oh!

231
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:20,900
I can't get up.

232
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,170
I can't move my legs.

233
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:29,929
Your legs are not your biggest problem.

234
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Your biggest problem is...

235
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,656
I don't know
what your biggest problem is.

236
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,500
So we have the who but not the what.

237
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,799
We've only got one symptom to go on.

238
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,400
Sudden onset paralysis.

239
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:48,143
- We actually have two symptoms.
- Only one that we remember.

240
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,741
You did a full workup on the guy.
Did you find anything?

241
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:52,599
CT ruled out subdural hematoma,

242
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,538
- stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- Guillain-Barre fits.

243
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,084
Trying to figure out what
Guillain-Barre looks like.

244
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:02,738
You can't eliminate everything

245
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:04,828
`cause it doesn't match
what you might have seen.

246
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:07,202
How'bout 'cause it doesn't match
what I could have seen?

247
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:10,299
Guillain-Barre has no external
physical manifestations.

248
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:13,055
Everything has some external
physical manifestations.

249
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,440
And you're obsessive enough
to notice any of them,

250
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,107
There's nothing we can rule out.

251
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:19,523
Elevated white count.
Makes transverse myelitis

252
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:21,434
Yeah, sudden paralysis
while driving a bus.

253
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:24,525
That's the sort of subtle clue
that only a genius would have noticed.

254
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,630
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

255
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,059
Where are you going?

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,503
To smell a bus. Obviously.

257
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,880
Yeah. I'll start him on antibiotics

258
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:53,138
in case it's transverse myelitis.

259
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,897
You guys go... sniff a city bus.

260
00:15:01,252 --> 00:15:03,522
Why are you smelling
the passengers' clothes?

261
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:08,333
Smell is the most powerful
evokerater of memory.

262
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:10,624
I need to get back on that bus.

263
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,974
Okay. So why are you
taking so much vicodin?

264
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,280
If Cuddy asks,

265
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,680
blocking the pain
helps focus the memory.

266
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:19,222
You split your head open.
You should rest.

267
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:24,084
- Anything?
- Hint of...

268
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,900
Exploded bus.

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,999
House, that's four vicodin
in 40 seconds.

270
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,678
- At this rate...
- Wish me luck.

271
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,512
I'm going in... Rambo style.

272
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,729
House, do you think this is gonna work,
or are you just stoned?

273
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,362
Both, apparently.

274
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,403
You're wrong.

275
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:52,655
It's not working.

276
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:55,147
- So you're saying I'm not here.
- If it was a real memory,

277
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:56,275
you'd be limping,

278
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:59,870
and you wouldn't be talking to me.
I'm obviously a hallucination.

279
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,980
Okay. So I went a little heavy
on the vicodin.

280
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,362
Better hope so. 'Cause otherwise...

281
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,079
- means your brain's bleeding.
- We're both in my head.

282
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,880
One of us would have noticed the blood.

283
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:13,050
- Why haven't you had a head CT yet?
- Who do you want to treat, me or you?

284
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,594
- Did you have a seizure?
- Dumb question.

285
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:18,263
The brain's too fried during a seizure
to form memories.

286
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:19,400
Dumb answer.

287
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,560
I wasn't asking you. I was asking me.
You've proven that you're not here.

288
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,522
- I'm getting a headache.
- Is that a clue?

289
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:25,880
Again... I'm not here.

290
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:28,680
You're getting a headache.
Stop arguing with a hallucination

291
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,293
and get some treatment.

292
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:31,984
He can't.

293
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,469
The hallucination
is your messed up brain's way

294
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,215
of reasoning out a problem.

295
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:40,439
You weren't on the bus.

296
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:42,890
How do you know?

297
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:44,957
$500 shoes.

298
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,626
Not on the Princeton cross-town.

299
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:49,587
Must be another reason why I'm here.

300
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,351
Yes.

301
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,997
What do you have to tell me?

302
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,637
I was talking
to the passengers on the bus!

303
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,700
You were hallucinating.
You're getting an MRI.

304
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:06,600
<i>Stop fidgeting.</i>

305
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:11,180
If you haven't found
the bleed yet, it can't be...

306
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,980
<i>There's edema and localized swelling</i>

307
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,643
<i>in the section of the temporal lobe</i>

308
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,238
<i>that controls short-term memory.</i>

309
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,700
<i>Also, the penis-size cortex
is set to "pathetic."</i>

310
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
What didn't you say out loud?

311
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,313
Very little.

312
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,200
<i>When you were under hypnosis,</i>

313
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,291
you were talking to Amber.

314
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,751
I wanted to see her naked.

315
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,132
- Seriously, what were you hiding?
- I wanna see her naked.

316
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:37,635
You wanna see everyone naked.
Why would you hide that?

317
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:42,100
Some guys get upset
when you objectify their girlfriends.

318
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,869
But if you're okay, I've got
a digital video camera, so we could

319
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:48,130
<i>Why would I be upset
that you're treating my girlfriend</i>

320
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,346
<i>like you treat every
other woman on the planet?</i>

321
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,901
Unless... you're not.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,537
<i>Unless it's deeper than that.</i>

323
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,491
You weren't objectifying her.

324
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,400
Trust me.

325
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,899
I wanna do some very nasty

326
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,955
demeaning stuff to your girlfriend.

327
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,667
You have feelings for her.

328
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,548
This is bad.

329
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:19,510
It's a longitudinal fracture
of the temporal bone.

330
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,000
I banged my head.

331
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,829
This isn't just a Boo-Boo.

332
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,717
I'll rest once I figure out
what's wrong with this guy.

333
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:28,042
Why? Why this guy?

334
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,644
You want patients with weird,
undiagnosed symptoms,

335
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:33,100
you get five files like that
on your desk every morning.

336
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,600
You'd never risk your life for them.

337
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,404
Why is this guy so special

338
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,364
that you've become Batman?

339
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,867
- I don't know.
- Maybe it's because

340
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:46,286
you have a cracked skull
and you're not yourself.

341
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:48,539
Go home. Go to sleep.

342
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,200
My legs are holding.

343
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,485
Good. Now put all your weight
on your right leg.

344
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,586
The antibiotics are working.
It's TM.

345
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,694
It's 2:00 in the morning.
You should be home,

346
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:39,688
resting what's left
of your bruised brain.

347
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:41,008
Recovery's too fast.

348
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,935
The fact that he's getting better
is evidence that we're wrong?

349
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,292
I need to sit.

350
00:19:45,993 --> 00:19:47,878
Recovery slow enough for you now?

351
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:49,475
Oh... it's my stomach!

352
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,186
Which means
it's not transverse myelitis.

353
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:54,229
Rapid onset.
Could be a perforated ulcer.

354
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:56,550
Wouldn't explain the paralysis.

355
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:57,900
Addison's.

356
00:19:58,233 --> 00:19:59,485
From a tumor.

357
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,528
It's possible i saw his eyelids droop.

358
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:04,072
We've scanned his head five times.

359
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:06,742
You're bleeding.

360
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:09,902
Little thing called a bus crash.
It's just a scalp laceration.

361
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:11,877
Could be hidden in his optic chiasm.

362
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,476
It's coming from your ear.

363
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:15,647
Think that's a good thing?

364
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:18,033
But that would have
affected his eyesight.

365
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,500
I need to take a bath.

366
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:25,302
Hallucinations and smells
were kind of working, right?

367
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:26,674
Why the bath?

368
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:28,680
Hypnosis gave me a nose picker.

369
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,516
Smells set off hallucinations.

370
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:32,834
Sensory deprivation

371
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:35,330
should get the brain into
an alpha-theta phase.

372
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,939
Didn't you see "Altered States"?

373
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,399
I don't think I was even born
when that movie was out.

374
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,820
Then you're too young to be a doctor.
That movie was released in 1980.

375
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,531
- That was 28 years ago.
- No, it wasn't. Shut up.

376
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,407
Did you just forget what year it is?

377
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,494
No. I just remembered how old I am.

378
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:54,498
I need to give my brain
time to transition,

379
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:56,208
so I can embrace my inner monkey.

380
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:57,881
Or maybe I don't.

381
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:00,538
Get me some physostigmine.
It crosses the blood-Brain barrier.

382
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:02,430
And act like a nerve gas,
stop your heart

383
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,174
you'll go to heaven and be omniscient.

384
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:06,265
Good idea. Not gonna happen.

385
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:09,179
Don't do anything.
Even if I escape,

386
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:11,598
eat a goat, get shot by police.

387
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:13,698
Wasn't born yet means
I won't be entertained

388
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:15,053
by further reference.

389
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,904
I didn't know you rode the bus.

390
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:29,312
I used to drive home
after getting drunk.

391
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:31,767
But some mothers got mad-d.

392
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:34,480
What are you doing here?

393
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,206
You weren't on the bus with me.

394
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,779
Then I guess this isn't a memory.

395
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,003
This is a fantasy.

396
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:43,424
If it's a fantasy,

397
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:46,077
you'd be wearing... this.

398
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:50,803
You're convinced your patient is dying,

399
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:53,080
and you wanna waste
your time with a sex fantasy?

400
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,018
- Don't blame me. Blame my gender.
- Well, I'm not here to indulge that.

401
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:58,604
I'm here to help you
figure out what symptom you saw.

402
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:00,944
Your patient was driving
the bus, so all you could see...

403
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:02,357
Why can't you do both?

404
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,618
Your patient was driving the bus

405
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:15,289
so all you could see
was him sitting down,

406
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:17,497
most likely facing forward.

407
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,466
From behind,
I saw his earlobes wiggling.

408
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,877
Or his head bobbing.

409
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,103
But not that.

410
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:42,940
Could indicate aortic insufficiency.

411
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:45,417
- Marfan's syndrome.
- Or syphilis.

412
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,480
What if his earlobes were just drooping?

413
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,160
Ehlers-Danlos?

414
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,495
Or cutis laxa.

415
00:22:57,788 --> 00:22:59,553
It's not fatal in adults.

416
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,500
Yeah. He's an adult.
Very good point.

417
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:07,953
Keep going.

418
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,014
- I'm distracting you.
- No!

419
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:20,058
Dance, woman!

420
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:21,554
You'd rather be diagnosing.

421
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:23,008
I screamed "no".

422
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,860
And your own subconscious ignored you.

423
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,837
Because you'd rather fantasize
about finding symptoms.

424
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:30,612
How screwed up is that?

425
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,073
Hey. Over here.

426
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:34,950
Remember me?

427
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:36,948
I'm the sick guy.

428
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,121
Tell me what I saw.

429
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:42,069
Was it the blood dripping from my ear?

430
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:46,580
That doesn't make sense.

431
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:48,949
'Cause your shirt wasn't stained.

432
00:23:49,572 --> 00:23:50,966
And because that was me.

433
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:57,180
I could have had a subtle hemiballismus,

434
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,349
indicating the early stages
of huntington's.

435
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:02,005
Huntington's wouldn't explain
the abdominal pain.

436
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,396
It's only on the table
because we're thinking of Thirteen.

437
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:07,315
A shuffling gait
could suggest parkinson's.

438
00:24:07,575 --> 00:24:09,696
Except there's no such thing
as shuffling sitting.

439
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,310
He moved when he helped
the old lady up the steps.

440
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:16,825
Who are you?

441
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:18,550
I'm the answer.

442
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:20,537
Look.

443
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:22,456
At what?

444
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,818
Here.

445
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:39,989
You were right.

446
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,332
Help him up.

447
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:49,900
- I got it. It's parkinson's.
- House, your ear.

448
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,819
- Start him on Levodopa.
- You should sit down.

449
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,330
House!

450
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:09,169
Get that out of my face.

451
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:12,464
Welcome back. I'm nurse Dickerson.

452
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:15,118
I don't need your name.
And I got your profession

453
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:18,228
from your super-competent
technique of melting my retinas.

454
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:20,263
Verbal faculties seem to be intact.

455
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,207
Do you remember passing out?

456
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:24,767
I remember puking on Cuddy's shoes.

457
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:28,021
Yeah. Skull fractures tend to hurt.

458
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:30,982
It would hurt a lot less
if you didn't swipe my pain pills.

459
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:32,776
Dr. Cuddy's orders.

460
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:35,821
- Wants me to regulate the amount...
- Wait a second. You brought muscle?

461
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,447
Dr. Cuddy's orders.

462
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:42,247
Means I was wrong.

463
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:45,933
My patient doesn't have parkinson's.

464
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:47,877
Cuddy knows that's the only reason

465
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:50,249
I wouldn't want to stay here
with my pain pills, porn,

466
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:51,626
and you forever.

467
00:25:52,288 --> 00:25:54,589
Vomiting means
your brain injury is getting worse.

468
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:58,254
House's skull fracture
extends all the way down

469
00:25:58,374 --> 00:26:00,595
- to his ear canal.
- House is being looked after.

470
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:03,473
Our other patient has jaundice,
low albumin, and no diagnosis.

471
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,133
Wilson's disease. Thank you.

472
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:06,685
But Wilson's wouldn't explain...

473
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,149
- Foreman.
- How did you eliminate parkinson's?

474
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,734
Tests confirmed the abdominal pain
was caused by liver failure.

475
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:17,779
I assume you've already ruled
out hepatitis and Wilson's.

476
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,239
You should really be resting.
Give him five minutes.

477
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,992
<i>Brainstorming a few possibilities
isn't going to explode his brain.</i>

478
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:24,077
If she's wrong,

479
00:26:24,337 --> 00:26:26,486
that makes this phone call
that much more exciting.

480
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:29,057
<i>- What about hepatic fibrosis?</i>
- Can't be. His alk phos was normal.

481
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:31,165
Could be thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.

482
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:33,628
Did I mention
this diagnosis needs to make sense?

483
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:35,088
Why doesn't it make sense?

484
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:37,274
Bus driver's asian,
his potassium slightly low.

485
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,513
If he got paralyzed
while driving the bus,

486
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,639
you think I would have
gotten off at the next stop?

487
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,222
Not if the next stop
was at a 90 degree angle into an suv.

488
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:46,550
The bus would have slowed.
I would have notif...

489
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,651
- Phone call's over.
- TPP has all the confirmed symptoms.

490
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:51,354
There's no downside to testing.

491
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:53,648
Genetic test is too slow...

492
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:55,472
Run the bagel test!

493
00:26:58,457 --> 00:27:00,805
How many more bagels do I have to eat
for this to work?

494
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,243
High carbs plus exercise

495
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:04,013
is the quickest way to confirm TPP.

496
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,879
I been on this for half an hour.

497
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:07,916
I'm not gonna collapse again.

498
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:09,541
Up the speed. Keep eating.

499
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:14,743
Yeah?

500
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:17,682
<i>So the carbo-loading
marathon isn't working.</i>

501
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:19,779
<i>Stop looking around suspiciously.</i>

502
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,498
To answer your next two questions,

503
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:24,054
no, I am not there, and yes,
you are completely predictable.

504
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:26,534
<i>If the test had worked,
you would have called</i>

505
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:28,392
to put my delicate brain at ease.

506
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:32,187
I told you not to lock the door.

507
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,203
Still wiping.

508
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,858
Put the phone up to bus driver's grill.

509
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,625
Who are you talking to?

510
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,651
My large colon.

511
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,413
TPP is not consistent
with your patient's labored breathing.

512
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:52,035
Patient has labored breathing

513
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:54,333
`cause he's been on a treadmill
for the last 30 minutes.

514
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:55,800
Did you take my cell phone?

515
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:59,837
My large colon did.
I'm negotiating its release.

516
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:03,735
- Help.
- What's happening?

517
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:07,325
<i>The test worked. He collapsed.</i>

518
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,182
You're half right.

519
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:10,988
<i>He's wheezing, isn't he?</i>

520
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:12,636
Yeah.

521
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:15,146
Can't wheeze without
moving your chest muscles.

522
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:17,357
<i>- This isn't TPP.</i>
- Then what is it?

523
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:20,334
How am I supposed to know?
I'm not there!

524
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,196
Right heart strain.
He's still not oxygenating.

525
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:28,743
Must be a pulmonary embolism.

526
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:32,247
So why haven't you pushed a vial of TPA?

527
00:28:32,508 --> 00:28:34,457
- You let him back in?
- I asked him back in.

528
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:37,711
At the tail end of me patiently
explaining how you idiots were idiots.

529
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:40,331
We pushed TPA ten minutes ago.
That means it's not a clot.

530
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,049
Has to be a clot. If he had a bagel

531
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:44,190
stuck in his windpipe,
I'd have seen it on the echo.

532
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,850
Get him to the OR to suck it out.

533
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,674
Must have just screwed up
the intubation.

534
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:49,723
Seal's good.

535
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,266
It's a clot, House.

536
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:55,895
Wait, wait, wait. Look at his teeth.

537
00:28:56,545 --> 00:28:59,733
He's got shiny new caps.
He's had recent dental surgery.

538
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,777
You can tell us what that means
while we're rolling him to the OR.

539
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:10,618
House! House!

540
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:11,806
House!

541
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:14,675
Get a syringe.

542
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,876
I didn't bring you back here
so you could stage a coup.

543
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:21,671
Listen to me.

544
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:24,581
Dental air drill pushed an air bubble
into his gums.

545
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:27,093
Dislodged while he's driving.
Caused a myoclonic jerk.

546
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:28,830
That's what I must have seen.

547
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,473
Then it hit his spine,
his liver, now his lungs.

548
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,167
Dr. Hadley, open the door!

549
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:34,934
I'm not plumping his pillows here.

550
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:36,936
I'm putting him
in the Trendelenburg position,

551
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:39,664
move the bubble to the apex of his heart
so you can suck it out.

552
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:41,153
Now, get the damn syringe.

553
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:43,167
I can't risk you
stabbing him in the heart

554
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:45,588
- looking for an unconfirmed air bubble.
- Stab him.

555
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,696
Dr. Hadley!

556
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:49,407
See? She doesn't even know your name.
Stab his heart!

557
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:52,014
- Sat's at 75.
- Yes. He's suffocating.

558
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:54,181
- If you're wrong...
- Shut up and make a decision.

559
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,081
Keep standing there,
he's dead either way.

560
00:29:56,342 --> 00:29:57,832
Dr. Hadley!

561
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,388
I'm sorry.

562
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:00,675
Open the door!

563
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,891
Don't shoot!

564
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:16,726
- Get him to the OR.
- The O2 sat.

565
00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:20,468
It was an air bubble.

566
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:21,564
He's okay.

567
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:29,406
The other nurse always
used to tuck me in.

568
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:33,243
I'll be on the couch...
with a shotgun in my lap.

569
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:34,587
Worrying about me?

570
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:37,038
Making sure you don't try
and make a limp for the border.

571
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:38,289
Get some sleep.

572
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,572
I'm not sleepy, mommy.

573
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:14,701
Me neither.

574
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,372
Who are you?

575
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:21,166
And why are you stalking me?

576
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:22,876
Technically, you're stalking me.

577
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:24,960
What is that?

578
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:29,757
Mosquito?

579
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:31,926
Maybe just a fly.

580
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,912
In the ointment.

581
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:38,689
So there's something wrong.

582
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,701
There's some detail I'm not noticing

583
00:31:41,821 --> 00:31:43,354
that's spoiling the big picture.

584
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,134
Is this... significant?

585
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:57,410
Or is this dream just going
in a different direction now?

586
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:59,433
I guess that depends.

587
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:02,707
What are you going to do with that?

588
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,087
I have to tie this around you.

589
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:28,287
I'm cold.

590
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,492
Stay with me.

591
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,935
Why did I say that?

592
00:32:55,245 --> 00:32:55,885
Hey.

593
00:32:56,145 --> 00:32:57,562
Oh, go away.

594
00:32:58,564 --> 00:32:59,816
It's not over.

595
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:02,559
I saved the wrong person.

596
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,484
This wasn't just a dream or a fantasy

597
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:13,802
or a drug-induced trip to wonderland.

598
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:16,346
So the bus driver with the air bubble's
just a coincidence?

599
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,184
No. I got the causation flipped.

600
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:21,196
Bubble didn't cause the crash.
Crash caused the bubble to dislodge.

601
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:23,508
There was no myoclonic jerk.

602
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,290
I saw something else in someone else.

603
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,805
You're not leaving.

604
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:29,424
What's the most dangerous thing
a patient could do

605
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:31,546
when his brain
is on the brink of herniating?

606
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:33,704
Elevated heart rate, BP,

607
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:36,206
which is exactly why you need to stop.

608
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,696
Instead of sleeping, I'm {\going to}gonna be
pacing around this apartment,

609
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:43,057
- trying to decipher those visions.
- Why does this matter so much?

610
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,435
I don't know. Heart rate?

611
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:48,980
- 127.
- BP?

612
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:51,899
Contextual memory.

613
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:54,701
I need to get back on that bus
with all 31 passengers

614
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:56,557
to remember who and what I saw.

615
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:59,616
I'm not gonna call in crash victims
because you've gone insane.

616
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,111
Maybe I don't need the actual victims.

617
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:06,077
Who's playing Anne Mckeehan?

618
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,512
Right here.

619
00:34:08,175 --> 00:34:10,791
Jane Doe number two
from Princeton General.

620
00:34:11,137 --> 00:34:12,794
Right here. You too, that's right.

621
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:14,226
Goth kid.

622
00:34:14,932 --> 00:34:16,870
Yeah. At the back on the right.

623
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,009
Yeah. Here.

624
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:21,057
Okay.

625
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:24,361
You think that staring
at pictures on our shirts

626
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,517
is gonna be more effective
than hypnosis?

627
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:28,602
Well, if you'd only stop talking,

628
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:31,434
the reenactment could stimulate activity
in my hippocampus

629
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:33,261
and parahippocampal cortex.

630
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:35,652
How long do we have to sit here
before you are stimulated?

631
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,564
Stop staring at my breasts.

632
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,826
And don't say "or lack thereof".

633
00:34:48,114 --> 00:34:48,997
You okay?

634
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:58,458
What do you see?

635
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:02,512
Just... slipped away.

636
00:35:04,078 --> 00:35:05,110
Is that Vicodin?

637
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:08,309
No. Just a little memory pick-me-up.

638
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:12,624
- Physostigmine.
- Are you crazy?

639
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,733
Alzheimer drugs will make
your brain go into overdrive.

640
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:17,269
That's the point.

641
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,191
It'll speed up my neuronal firing,

642
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:22,115
- turn up the voltage on my memory.
- And blow out your heart.

643
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:25,145
- How many did you take?
- Just now, or including the ones

644
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:26,743
I took on the ride over?

645
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:32,988
House, this isn't worth...

646
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,143
House?

647
00:35:46,606 --> 00:35:47,682
Why are you here?

648
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:50,244
You believe in reason above all else.

649
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:51,777
There must be a reason.

650
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,355
You have something to tell me.

651
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:55,682
Yes.

652
00:35:56,063 --> 00:35:57,222
Who am I?

653
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,319
That's asking, not telling.
Who are you?

654
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:02,758
You know who I am.

655
00:36:03,616 --> 00:36:05,724
If I did, I'd be passed out in bed

656
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:07,611
instead of ODing on physostigmine

657
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:09,591
on the 6th street Cross-Town.

658
00:36:09,964 --> 00:36:12,074
What's my necklace made of?

659
00:36:16,732 --> 00:36:18,470
- Resin.
- Who am I?

660
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:20,549
I don't know.

661
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:23,760
Why the guessing game?

662
00:36:24,278 --> 00:36:26,444
Because you don't know the answer.

663
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:28,444
If I don't, you don't.

664
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,344
You know the clues.

665
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:35,188
I know what's bugging your subconscious.

666
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,689
What's my necklace made of?

667
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:45,663
No.

668
00:36:46,898 --> 00:36:48,057
Who am I?

669
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:53,383
Doesn't make sense.

670
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:56,250
What's my necklace made of?

671
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:03,800
Amber.

672
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:05,212
I have to... tie this around you.

673
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:13,927
I'm cold.

674
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:16,244
Stay with me.

675
00:39:17,694 --> 00:39:19,352
Just stay with me.

676
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:18,862
Sir, are you all right?

677
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:21,580
Are you all right?

678
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:24,500
Are you injured anywhere?

679
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:35,716
They'll take care of you over there.

680
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:29,911
He's coming out of it.

681
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:31,023
Strong pulse.

682
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:33,194
You idiot! Your heart stopped.

683
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:36,405
Amber.

684
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:38,791
What?

685
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:40,442
Amber.

686
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:43,346
It was Amber.

687
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:49,512
- She was on the bus.
- You almost kill yourself,

688
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,837
and all we're getting
is drug-induced fantasies.

689
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:54,090
Have you spoken to her?

690
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:58,016
She's probably working.
She's been on-call.

691
00:41:58,677 --> 00:41:59,985
I called her...

692
00:42:01,974 --> 00:42:03,317
She didn't call...

693
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:08,043
I...

694
00:42:08,163 --> 00:42:09,438
How could she...

695
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:11,010
I don't know.

696
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:15,012
Jane Doe number two.

697
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:23,452
"Female, late 20s, kidney damage."

698
00:42:23,712 --> 00:42:26,288
Does Amber have a birthmark
on her right shoulder blade?

699
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,547
She was on the bus with me.

700
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:40,160
She's the one who's dying.
