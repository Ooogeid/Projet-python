1
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:27,335
How about the name Brooke?

2
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:30,536
She just doesn't seem
like a Brooke anymore.

3
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:31,661
Brooklyn.

4
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,025
She's a baby, not a city.

5
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:38,371
What do you think, Bud?
Got any suggestions?

6
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:39,683
Toadette.

7
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:41,999
I'm hungry.

8
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:44,627
I'll get you guys something to eat.

9
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,497
You're okay.

10
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:01,894
I was paged?

11
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,875
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,208
Can we talk somewhere?

13
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:19,506
I was thinking Doroth...

14
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:36,846
Sarah?

15
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:42,663
Where's the baby?

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,008
No one saw anyone go in or out,
and the baby's not in the nursery.

17
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,014
- What was her condition?
- Five weeks preterm.

18
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:58,868
C-section
because her mom's preeclampsia.

19
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,133
Is that the father?
Mr. Lozinski.

20
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:05,481
I'm Dr. Lisa Cuddy, dean of Medicine.
How long were you out of the room?

21
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:08,295
15, 20 minutes tops.

22
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,242
- Was there a proximity alarm?
- No alarms.

23
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:12,343
What's that?

24
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:15,090
The bracelet on your baby's ankle
has a microchip

25
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:18,095
that would set off alarms
if she was carried through an exit.

26
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:20,499
Call the police.
Shut down all the exits.

27
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:21,887
We are on lockdown.

28
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:24,353
Nobody moves
until we find that baby.

Why won't you sign
the divorce papers?

It's been on my to-do list.
Sorry.

34
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:08,834
Will you sign them?

35
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:12,953
Not until we have a real conversation
about our marriage.

36
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:16,987
I made a mistake coming here.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna leave...

And did anyone
other than your nurses

57
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,902
ever come by
asking about your daughter?

58
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,184
No, just those two.

59
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:32,768
- I'll check in soon.
- Wait.

60
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:35,065
- What are you doing?
- No, I need to help them look.

61
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,693
You have to stay in bed.
You pulled a stitch.

62
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,622
Lay back down.
I got it.

63
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,022
Why don't I give you something
to help you relax?

64
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,491
I don't want to relax.
I want to find my baby.

65
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,286
- The police are searching room by room.
- Who would take her?

66
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,768
- What if she needs to be fed?
- We're gonna find her.

67
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:52,367
Why aren't the police
talking to our nurse?

68
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:58,505
What now?

69
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,631
- Truth or dare?
- You don't want to mess with me.

70
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:03,504
True or dare queen at Newton north.

71
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:04,943
I was kidding.

72
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:06,669
We can find something interesting

73
00:05:06,794 --> 00:05:08,849
without relying
on some juvenile game.

74
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:10,131
Sure.

75
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:19,556
Truth.

76
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,989
They think I took the kid?

77
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:26,158
- Do you think I would do something...
- No, I'm just asking questions.

78
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,313
The day I let the older brother
hold the baby for the first time...

79
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,056
so I put her in his lap.

80
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,501
After a few seconds, she shrieked.
I'm pretty sure he pinched her.

81
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:37,403
I need to know this stuff.

82
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,338
Anything out of the ordinary.

83
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,174
It was sibling rivalry.
I thought it was kind of ordinary.

84
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:54,277
- What are you doing down here?
- I was looking for McKenna's file.

85
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,553
You mean this file?

86
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,265
- The one I said I'd get?
- Two hours ago?

87
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,026
Seriously, you don't trust me

88
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,404
with the immense responsibility
of fetching a file?

89
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:07,013
- Why are you looking through those?
- Do you know what these are?

90
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:11,119
The staff credentials files.

91
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:14,123
- Those should all be in H.R.
- Down here to be digitized.

92
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,221
And we're locked in,
and whoever's supposed

93
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:20,146
to be watching 'em is locked out.
We could look up anything on anyone.

94
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:23,882
- Malpractice records, felony histories.
- Put them away.

95
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:26,616
Come on.
We have a tiny window of opportunity

96
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:29,221
to gain some insight
into our colleagues.

97
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:34,518
What if we just snoop on the boss?

98
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,190
I think I can live with that.

99
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,904
You're on two milligrams
of morphine an hour.

100
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,372
How the hell are you still awake?

101
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,627
No, don't tell me.

102
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,424
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.

103
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,594
If the blood's not reaching
your gut,

104
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,825
you have intestinal hypoperfusion.

105
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,212
That'd be stronger
than the narcotics.

106
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:16,101
The nurse said I might only have
a day or two left.

107
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,224
She was being kind.

108
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:27,858
You're Dr. House,

109
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:30,213
aren't you?

110
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:33,538
Oh, God, don't tell me
we used to date.

111
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,699
The limp. I read about you.

112
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,007
I sent you a letter

113
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,626
before they knew what was wrong.

114
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,100
I tried to get you to take my case.

115
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:45,413
You should have kept reading.

116
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,074
Heart disease
is kind of below my pay grade.

117
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,678
It started as tooth pain.

118
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,754
No one got it
that it was a heart problem.

119
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:58,372
Till I had a series
of massive heart attack...

120
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:14,952
This doesn't bother you?

121
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,882
You talking with your mouth full?
A little.

122
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:20,340
I meant the fact that you're standing
here watching me die

123
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:23,210
because my file bored you.

124
00:08:23,784 --> 00:08:25,896
I take maybe 1 in 20 cases.

125
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:29,375
A lot of the people I turn down
end up dying.

126
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,990
It's really a good argument
for there being more than one me

127
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,536
when you think about it.

128
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,584


129
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:45,858
- Truth.
- All right.

130
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:48,776
Have you ever had a threesome?

131
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:53,282
- You haven't?
- Wait, just because I'm bisexual?

132
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,909
Do you understand
what bisexual means?

133
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:00,080
It doesn't mean you have sex
with two people at once.

134
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:03,834
And by the way, you didn't ask me
if I'd had a foursome. Truth or dare?

135
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:06,628
- You've had a foursome?
- Now you've asked me two questions,

136
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,673
so I get to ask you two.
You see why I was the queen.

137
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,332
Walker wouldn't do anything.

138
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,057
He's my son too.

139
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,270
I don't mean to sound cold,
but he's your stepson.

140
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,908
We can't ignore any possibility.

141
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,649
Walker's been getting
in fights a lot

142
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:35,157
at school lately.

143
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,368
Last week,
he hit another kid with a book

144
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,550
hard enough to draw blood.

145
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:47,955
If he did something to the baby...

146
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,852
We were working on it.

147
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:09,816
- And we failed.
- No, you had a conversation with House,

148
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,759
then came back, informed me
I'd been forever poisoned by him,

149
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:14,279
and started packing.

150
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,256
It's interesting
how you leave out the part

151
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,033
where you murdered
another human being.

152
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,037
A dictator who was committing genocide.
You thought about doing it yourself.

153
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,572
- But I didn't.
- Right.

154
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,791
Because you're not toxic like I am.

155
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,209
What do you think
is gonna happen here?

156
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:31,880
You're gonna logic me
into coming back?

157
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:38,512
There must be over 30
malpractice settlements in here.

158
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,525
He did a brain biopsy
without CT mapping,

159
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,766
causing brain herniation and death.

160
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:47,958
Look at this one.

161
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,224
Patient lost four liters of blood

162
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,985
from a botched penisectomy.

163
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:57,264
On a patient named Lisa Cuddy?

164
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:01,482
Damn.
They're all named Lisa Cuddy.

165
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,879
He's not even here,
and he's screwing with us.

166
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,659
Where's the joy in that?

167
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:11,335
You really want
to get into his head?

168
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,771
Yeah, but I decided against
stabbing myself in the leg

169
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,763
or getting addicted to pain pills.

170
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,290
You can... skip the stabbing.

171
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:25,337
- Where did you...
- Confiscated them from a drug seeker.

172
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,288
Didn't get a chance to turn 'em in.

173
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:30,582
It is after hours.

174
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:33,724
I'll take one.

175
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:36,445
Walk in House's shoes for a night.

176
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:37,966
One?

177
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,699
I believe he wears a larger size.

178
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,086
No cards, no flowers,

179
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:54,844
not even a phone call.

180
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:56,783
Let me guess.
Lighthouse keeper.

181
00:11:56,908 --> 00:12:00,235
I was a classics Professor
at Princeton for 26 years.

182
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,370
Mostly research.

183
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,473
So your closest colleagues
died 2,000 years ago.

184
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:06,898
That must be it.

185
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:10,365
Not that you have no friends
because, say,

186
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,189
you're a miserable bastard.

187
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:14,691
What do you care?

188
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:17,736
The next few hours
are gonna be grim.

189
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:20,598
There'll be nausea, pain,
no company,

190
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,817
as soon as I can
get myself out of here.

191
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,869
I can unlock the regulator.

192
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,413
You can put yourself
in a narcotic haze,

193
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:30,629
sleep blissfully to the end.

194
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,127
Is that a favor to me or to you?

195
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:36,421
Win-win.

196
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:39,718
No, thanks.

197
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:42,886
Are you trying to guilt me
for not taking your case?

198
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,046
You think a classicist
doesn't believe in fate?

199
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:49,935
You think Odysseus would lie whimpering
like a loser in a hospital bed?

200
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,590
Come on, take my offer.

201
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,521
Take the drug holiday.
Numb yourself out.

202
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:02,837
I think you're the one
who wants to numb himself out.

203
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:16,874
Truth.

204
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,424
How did your dad react
when you came out to him?

205
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,675
He made me tea.

206
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:23,718
Doesn't matter what I tell him,

207
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,255
he smiles, tells me he supports me,
and makes me some peppermint tea.

208
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,416
- Truth or dare?
- Truth.

209
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,130
Are you dating anyone?

210
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,521
Now? No.

211
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,463
Interesting, you added a modifier.

212
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Truth.

213
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,326
When you were dating Foreman...

214
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,773
If it was something personal
about him or us,

215
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,328
I don't think that's right to answer.
We work together.

216
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,706
That's the point!
Something personal, embarrassing.

217
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,250
- Pick something else.
- You see, this is your problem.

218
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,545
You act like you're so liberal and open,
but you are the least...

219
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,422
I changed my mind.
Dare. Just no nudity.

220
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,833
Yes, nudity.

221
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,738
I want you to show

222
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:05,338
your breasts

223
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:07,797
to Taub.

224
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:11,975
That is the most idiotic dare ever!

225
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:14,393
Have you ever played this game?

226
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:17,974
I thought showing me your breasts
would be a little exploitative.

227
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,400
Your dare is in the future, genius.

228
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,277
If you're saying you won't do it...

229
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,529
Of course I'll show my breasts
to Taub.

230
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,365
Tomorrow, perhaps,

231
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,701
or maybe some time next year,
you know,

232
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,536
because I'm honor-bound.

233
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,079
Truth or dare?

234
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,621
It's understandable
that you wouldn't be happy right now.

235
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:41,922
Your world is changing.

236
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:44,187
You scared?

237
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,636
How do you feel about your sister?

238
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:50,114
I hate her.

239
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:56,770
Walker, this is important.

240
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:58,772
Did you do anything to the baby?

241
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:01,363
Did you move her somewhere?

242
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,984
Hide her?

243
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,695
- Nobody'd be mad at you.
- I said no,

244
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,475
so stop asking me.

245
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:15,404
Bad pain day?

246
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:18,487
Bad pain month.

247
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:21,199
Since I'm not using it...

248
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,092
If you don't want the morphine,
you must have something of your own.

249
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:28,726
I was in rehab.

250
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,822
I had a little problem
with the something of my own.

251
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:34,671
Now all I take is ibuprofen,
and it's two flights up.

252
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:37,102
- For the whole month?
- The pain's migrated.

253
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,979
I think the arterial wall
is damaged.

254
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:42,816
- What, you don't know?
- I haven't had an arteriogram yet.

255
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,527
And you don't want the test.

256
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,297
In case the arterial wall is fine.

257
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:52,022
Which would mean that the pain
is coming from something else.

258
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,745
What's her name?

259
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:57,945
Interesting...

260
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,663
That you jump from physical pain

261
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:02,188
to long-lost love.

262
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:04,718
You're projecting.

263
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:07,299
So what's her name?

264
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:13,904
- What time is it?
- What does it matter to you?

265
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:15,682
It's T minus four hours.

266
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:20,578
8:20.

267
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,043
Now tell me who she is

268
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,594
and what are
the pathetically long odds

269
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,444
that she's gonna visit or call.

270
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,904
And why that's a reason
not to take the morphine.

271
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,209
Dude.

272
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:43,591
Dude.

273
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,390
Is the room still spinning?

274
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:49,962
Mine is.

275
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:53,695
Maybe we shouldn't have taken
so many.

276
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,847
I'm gonna try to stand up.

277
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:01,466
You be careful.

278
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:13,823
That's working.

279
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,290
I can't feel my face.

280
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,180
No way.

281
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:23,684
Way.

282
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,210
Hit me.

283
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:26,668
What?

284
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:28,403
Hit me in the face.

285
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:29,907
Seriously?

286
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,408
You know you've always wanted to.

287
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:34,886
- Now's your chance.
- That's a great idea.

288
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:38,182
We start a fight club.
Maybe we...

289
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,750
Oh, my God!

290
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,449
That is so cool!

291
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:51,146
I can still feel my hand.

292
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,781
- I wasn't ready.
- What were you gonna do?

293
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,699
Flex your goatee muscles?

294
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:01,605
Wait a minute.

295
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,516
This is your credentials file?

296
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,651
Give me that.

297
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:10,672
That's why you came down here.

298
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,590
Not for the patient file.

299
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,470
You wanted...

300
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,646
You wanted...

301
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,750
I will answer

302
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,881
whatever questions you want.

303
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:31,452
But then you sign the papers.

304
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:35,795
Did you ever love me?

305
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:38,658
How can you even ask that?

306
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,244
The first time you slept with me
was because you were high.

307
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,934
I was on the drugs
because I was emotional.

308
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,082
The emotions led to the sex,
not the drugs.

309
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,250
Not true.

310
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:49,961
After that, you refused
to let it go further.

311
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:53,089
Because I knew I was falling for you
and I didn't want to.

312
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,565
And that never changed.

313
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,981
You broke off our vacation
because I bought you a ring.

314
00:18:57,106 --> 00:18:58,870
I got cold feet. I'm not proud.

315
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,051
You almost called off our wedding
because you couldn't give up the idea

316
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,684
- of having your dead husband's baby.
- Don't bring him up!

317
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,735
Because even then,
you weren't sure about me.

318
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,158
Maybe if I was dying,

319
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:10,190
- it would've been different.
- That's unfair.

320
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,983
It's exactly the point!

321
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,892
He was dying when you met him,
and gone just a year into the marriage.

322
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:19,199
So it was all a honeymoon with him,
and I could never match up to that.

323
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,804
- The first time reality intruded...
- Stop this.

324
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,947
- Tell me the truth.
- About what?

325
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,581
- Did you ever love me?
- I don't know!

326
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:36,722
Thank you for finally telling me.

327
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,675


328
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Truth.

329
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:55,727
You said
you weren't dating anyone now.

330
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:58,902
Does that mean
you recently were, or soon will be?

331
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,266
Look who's guarded now.

332
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,361
You had no problem
talking about your sex life,

333
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:07,036
but your love life...

334
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:09,123
Fine. Dare it is.

335
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,470
No nudity now or in the future.

336
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:23,602
You're too much
of a nice boy, Wilson.

337
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:26,766
Let's let the bad boy out for a bit.

338
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:28,893
You have to go steal

339
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:30,215
one dollar

340
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:32,025
right now.

341
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,559
From who?

342
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:40,898
Come on.

343
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,280
Interned at Hopkins.

344
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,176
Old news. Here we go!

345
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,426
Academic probation.

346
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,915
I am asking you
to please stop reading.

347
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,729
I'm afraid I can't do that.

348
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:56,633
Faked a lab result.

349
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:57,964
Very wrong!

350
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,050
And you came down
to destroy the record

351
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,968
before it gets digitized.

352
00:21:03,382 --> 00:21:04,582
Permanentized.

353
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,930
Even wronger.

354
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:10,891
I needed to beat

355
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,566
all those elite,
spoiled kids around me.

356
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,533
To show no weaknesses,

357
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,899
to win at everything.

358
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:22,635
Why'd I just tell you that?

359
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,260
I always talk too much
when I'm stoned.

360
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:27,410
Why'd I just tell you that?

361
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:34,155
It was stupid.

362
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,420
You had great grades.
One lab result shouldn't have mattered.

363
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,343
Except I didn't think
I deserved to be

364
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,968
at a top med school
in the first place.

365
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:43,193
Again.

366
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,648
Faking lab results is one thing.

367
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:49,123
But you needing to come down here
to destroy the records

368
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,171
12 years after the fact...

369
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:56,951
This isn't about med school.

370
00:21:57,646 --> 00:21:59,567
You don't think you belong here.

371
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,035
At the hospital.

372
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,991
Dr. Taub,

373
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,909
Christopher Michael.

374
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:16,884
So this is what it comes down to
in the final hours.

375
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:19,506
Deifying some lost love.

376
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,715
Hoping to get her on the phone
and make everything perfect.

377
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:24,869
It's pathetic.

378
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,494
Either you left her for a reason
or she left you for a reason.

379
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:31,683
- A phone call is not...
- It's my daughter.

380
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,062
Why isn't she here?

381
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:38,542
I left my family...

382
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,910
When Gracie was six.

383
00:22:42,897 --> 00:22:44,123
I was sort of...

384
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:46,072
forced out, actually.

385
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:50,268
After I'd had an affair
with a student.

386
00:22:51,556 --> 00:22:53,286
For sex or love?

387
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:54,898
Neither.

388
00:22:56,888 --> 00:23:00,088
I'd only married Gracie's mother
because of the baby.

389
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,224
But I didn't think
I could handle commitment,

390
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,700
and, like any decent academic,

391
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:08,733
I proved myself right.

392
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:12,784
And what time it is matters because?

393
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:15,059
She's a dance teacher in Atlanta.

394
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:17,514
She gets home from work at 9:00,

395
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:20,398
and I just wanted to speak to her
one more time.

396
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:23,276
That's my story.

397
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:26,168
What's yours?

398
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:29,615
Same thing, pretty much.

399
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:34,044
I'm gonna be dead in a few hours.

400
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:37,252
Your secrets couldn't be safer.

401
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,897
Unless you're keeping them
from yourself.

402
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:47,016
I like being alone.

403
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:52,708
At least I convince myself
that I'm better off that way.

404
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,260
And then I met someone

405
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,836
at a psychiatric hospital,
of all places.

406
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,107
She changed me.

407
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:05,819
And then she left.

408
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:11,699
We're better off alone.

409
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:14,635
We suffer alone, we die alone.

410
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:17,911
Doesn't matter
if you're a model husband

411
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,636
or father of the year.

412
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,710
Tomorrow will be the same for you.

413
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:28,192
But yesterday
would have been different.

414
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,573
Could you cook me up
a chicken sandwich?

415
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:43,948
Grill's closed.

416
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,551
It's important medically.

417
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:48,862
Dr. Hadley needs
a high-protein meal right now.

418
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:52,915
She doesn't like to talk about it,
but she has hypoproteinemia.

419
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,203
- We got chicken salad.
- Yeah. That's cold.

420
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,663
She needs to eat warm protein
for this disease?

421
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,023
Well, we could give her cold protein

422
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:03,108
whose uptake enzymes
haven't been activated,

423
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,766
as long as you don't mind her
risking liver and kidney failure

424
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:07,019
and eventual death.

425
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:09,841
But, it's worth it
so you don't have to flip on the grill.

426
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,459
You don't have
to be obnoxious about it.

427
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:02,321
How do you look...

428
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,561
so okay?

429
00:26:03,868 --> 00:26:07,680
I spent months
wondering how I made it go bad.

430
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:11,451
If you never loved me, then...

431
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:14,614
Then I didn't do anything wrong.

432
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:21,277
Allison, come on.

433
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:23,969
It's all right.

434
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:27,154
I still don't know why I said that.

435
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,577
It's not even true.

436
00:26:30,978 --> 00:26:32,228
I did love you.

437
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:36,192
Just...

438
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:41,079
Not in a way
that would have ever worked.

439
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,743
- Why not?
- Because...

440
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:47,362
everything you said is true.

441
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:51,182
I'm a mess.

442
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:55,612
I married a man I knew was dying.

443
00:26:55,737 --> 00:26:59,111
So God knows how screwed up
I already was.

444
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:02,884
Him dying messed me up even more.

445
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:07,252
I pushed you out of my life.

446
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:10,321
And...

447
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,984
I'm unfixable.

448
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:19,318
Not you.

449
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:27,143
I'm sorry.

450
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:29,433
I'm sorry too.

451
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,678


452
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:05,766
Truth.

453
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,802
Shut up.

454
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:08,602
I'm sorry.

455
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:11,982
- It's not your fault.
- No, I didn't even play fair.

456
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:16,136
You asked me how my dad reacted
when I told him I was bisexual.

457
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,570
And the Huntington's.

458
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,905
- No tea party?
- I never told him.

459
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:21,782
He's been through enough.

460
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:25,715
So he just visits his heterosexual,
healthy daughter,

461
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,068
and you go out to dinner and a movie

462
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,312
- and talk about your garden?
- I work late.

463
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:33,064
He's staying at my house.
It's easier if I stay elsewhere

464
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:34,499
as much as I can.

465
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:36,881
You can't suppress your life
for his convenience.

466
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:39,216
You don't see
a little irony in that?

467
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,695
That's exactly
what you do for House.

468
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,555
When he moved in with you,
you bought a bigger place for him.

469
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,557
No wonder you're not dating anyone.

470
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:48,347
You're right.

471
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:50,765
That woman,

472
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,023
the woman I'm not involved with,

473
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:56,112
her name is Sam Carr.

474
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:59,908
But in 1990 and 1991,
it was Sam Wilson.

475
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:01,864
Your ex-wife?

476
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:03,825
No, my mother.

477
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,417
Yes, my ex-wife.
Ex number one.

478
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:09,268
She friended me a few weeks ago.

479
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,412
We started emailing.
It turns out she's recently divorced,

480
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:14,487
and I wanted to ask her out.

481
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:18,648
You can't take a woman to dinner,

482
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:22,051
or else House will go running
straight back to the loony bin?

483
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,387
You're not worried about House
but about yourself.

484
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:25,742
Because she's an ex.

485
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:28,599
So even dinner will mean
it's immediately serious.

486
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,000
What are your favorite parts
that you remember?

487
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:40,685
I liked how...

488
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:43,438
I would wake up
in the middle of the night,

489
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:46,249
you'd put your arm around me,
and you wouldn't even wake up.

490
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,211
I liked watching you stand up
to your dad at Christmas

491
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:51,186
when he yelled at your mom.

492
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:53,767
How you didn't even know
you were strong.

493
00:29:54,882 --> 00:29:56,032
But you were.

494
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:00,256
What do you miss?

495
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:01,903
I miss a lot.

496
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:07,052
But when I think about missing you,

497
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,624
I think about that dance class
that we took for the wedding.

498
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:13,605
It's weird.

499
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:18,910
I think,

500
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,898
he's never gonna hold me
like that again.

501
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:07,662
I'm gonna miss this too.

502
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,666
Published in
<i>The New England Journal</i> at 26?

503
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,659
Finished all the lab work
a year earlier.

504
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,569
Led a group of surgeons

505
00:31:21,202 --> 00:31:23,577
to fix cleft palates in Bangladesh?

506
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:26,575
What can I say?
That concert was very moving to me.

507
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,434
I have to take a knee.
I don't get it.

508
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,523
This has got to be
the most spectacular file down here.

509
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,274
Why are you pretending
to be ashamed?

510
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,114
I would trade mine for yours
in a second.

511
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,455
When I was in med school,

512
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,748
I thought I'd be House some day.

513
00:31:43,624 --> 00:31:44,624
Instead,

514
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:47,065
I am a fellow working with...

515
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:52,504
working for people
years younger than me.

516
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:54,773
So...

517
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:57,665
we both have a few regrets.

518
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,016
You should be proud of yours.

519
00:32:01,595 --> 00:32:03,170
Your life's been trending up.

520
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:09,885
No news.

521
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,632
How you holding up?

522
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,573
You let them sedate you?

523
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:22,206
- Do you have kids?
- A little girl.

524
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:25,818
I adopted her last year.

525
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,236
I adopted Walker
right after Donald and I got married.

526
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:36,364
What if I can never love Walker
the way I love my daughter?

527
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:40,457
Does that make me a horrible person?

528
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:45,560
Let me get you some tissues.

529
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:59,636
Did you request some extra towels?

530
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:03,009
What, why?

531
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,610
There are eight towels
in Sarah's room.

532
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:14,120
- There should only be four.
- House keeping handles towels.

533
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:17,749
I need you to track down their logs,
figure out who was up there and when.

534
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:21,347
- Because they got extra towels?
- Just find the logs. Now.

535
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:28,257
- Adrienne, you okay?
- Sure.

536
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,327
What's wrong?

537
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,912
Adrienne, give me your arm.

538
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:42,525
The hair on her left arm
is standing up.

539
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,190
Asymmetric neurological function.
She's having a pilomotor seizure.

540
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,734
- She seemed fine a minute ago.
- She was.

541
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,656
She's probably been having
complex seizures all day.

542
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:55,491
She would be basically functional,
but more or less acting on autopilot.

543
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,160
She probably dropped
the towels off twice.

544
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,799
She could have taken the baby.

545
00:34:08,156 --> 00:34:10,675
We never really
did have a proper good-bye.

546
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,822
It's 9:00.

547
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:40,309
<i>It's Gracie. I can't come to the phone,
so please leave a message.</i>

548
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:52,568
I guess she's running late.

549
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:56,987
You don't seem that surprised.

550
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,494
That's what you expected to get.

551
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:06,434
You waited until you knew
she'd be out.

552
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:09,469
Her aunt...

553
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:12,748
said that she starts work late.

554
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:18,023
Every now and then, I just call to hear
her voice on the machine.

555
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,299
I was never there
when she needed me, so...

556
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:29,755
What right do I have
to need her now?

557
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:31,468
None.

558
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:36,587
Just means you're a hypocrite.
'Cause apparently you do.

559
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:43,304
Forget about rights.

560
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:46,689
Just tell her
what you need to tell her.

561
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:53,459
<i>It's Gracie. I can't come to the phone,
so please leave a message.</i>

562
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,511
This is...

563
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:08,599
your father.

564
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:13,505
I love you.

565
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:29,246


566
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Anything?

567
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,295
We've covered every room
on Maldonado's logs.

568
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,804
Been everywhere she's been.

569
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,810
Where's the other cart?

570
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:54,782
Isn't there usually
another cart in here?

571
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:21,205
<i>Anyone in there?
Lockdown's over.</i>

572
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:26,634
I should go.

573
00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:38,678
I just asked Sam to dinner.

574
00:39:39,692 --> 00:39:41,461
Little baby's all growed up.

575
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:45,550
You gonna tell your dad?

576
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,676
I'll stop by his hotel, talk to him.

577
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:49,928
Hotel?

578
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,705
You said he was staying
at your apartment.

579
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,901
Was there any truth
in anything you said?

580
00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:01,296
The part about it being
a good idea for you to call Sam.

581
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:02,621
That was true.

582
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:04,949
Good night.

583
00:40:05,074 --> 00:40:06,749
<i>Code seven has been lifted.</i>

584
00:40:07,224 --> 00:40:08,832
<i>Repeat, code seven...</i>

585
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:10,407
You want your file?

586
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,483
Good for you.

587
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,109
We don't have
to tell anybody what we...

588
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:28,855
- You got the patient file?
- I'll grab it.

589
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,806
Thanks.

590
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,528
See you tomorrow.

591
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:11,668
I think I'm ready
to take you up on your offer.

592
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:36,191
Lockdown ended a few minutes ago.

593
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:37,957
Yeah. I know.

594
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,528
I'm sorry I didn't take your case.

595
00:41:56,752 --> 00:41:57,752
Me too.

596
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:06,209
Gracie...

597
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:10,061
was the cutest six-year-old
you ever saw.

598
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,006
Interesting night?

599
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:53,667
Interesting.
