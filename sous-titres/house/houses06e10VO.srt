1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,932
So I'm thinking 35.

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:05,487
Seems high to me.

3
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:08,710
That's a fair price
for quality like this.

4
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:11,236
I'll give you 30.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,933
I thought you were joking.
I didn't...

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,603
Who am I dealing with here, Eddie?
Him or you?

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,729
Mickey, relax.

8
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,991
Now, if things move forward
with Gorski,

9
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:27,652
he lets us into Philly,
then maybe I cut you a break.

10
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:31,238
You cut me a break now,
or maybe you don't get with Gorski.

11
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:36,304
Marco...

12
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,746
I thought we had an understanding.

13
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:43,334
Tommy, don't be stupid.
Put the gun down.

14
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:45,211
He shows you some respect.

15
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,547
Hey, you just... listen to your boss,
all right, moron?

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,548
Shut up!

17
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:51,457
Just relax, buddy.

18
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:00,476
What were you thinking?

19
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,186
- I didn't shoot him!
- sure?

20
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:05,687
- He's face-down on the pavement!
- I nailed myself in the foot!

21
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,126
- I don't think he's hit.
- Then what happened?

22
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,532
Let's get outta here!

23
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:17,564
Come on, Mickey, wake up.

24
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,245
Mickey! Wake up!

25
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:26,179
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

26
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:27,920
.:: La Fabrique ::.

27
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,936
Arrow
ShalimarFox

28
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:57,732
We almost done here?

29
00:01:57,857 --> 00:02:00,286
Assuming you did
this shaving your forehead...

30
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,956
Okay, then.
I'm ordering a head C.T.

31
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,250
I don't have a headache.
I'm not dizzy.

32
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,836
- Eddie, I gotta get back.
- You gotta stay here.

33
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:11,737
We'll straighten out
that mess with Marco tomorrow.

34
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:13,106
Let the doc do his job.

35
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,908
Actually, stitching you up
is really the E.R. doc's job.

36
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,225
Too long of a wait.

37
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:23,345
Also, a lot of cops in the E.R.

38
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:26,869
Not that you care about that.

39
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,106
So how did this happen?

40
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,694
You're right.
That was a stupid question.

41
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,817
'Cause the answer's kind of obvious.

42
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,806
No scrapes on your hands
means you didn't try to break your fall.

43
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,867
Means either out cold

44
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,243
or totally disoriented
when you went down.

45
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:47,374
No sign of trauma other than the cut
means no one hit you in the head.

46
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:50,002
Powder burn on your jacket sleeve

47
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,379
means someone shot a gun.

48
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:56,764
All right, Eddie.
Come on, let's go.

49
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:00,184
I don't care what you guys are into.

50
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:03,390
If you don't get this checked out,
it'll happen again.

51
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:05,893
- What will?
- This.

52
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:14,634
Cool.

53
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:17,446
32-year-old man,

54
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:20,073
recently developed
loud-noise-induced vertigo.

55
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:23,013
C.T. was clean.
No internal bleeding, no edema.

56
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:25,079
Everything else is in the file.

57
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:27,206
Cameron get your hair
in the divorce?

58
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,947
This guy strained his back
three years ago. And that's it.

59
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:32,837
All the rest of these pages
are blank.

60
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,421
He won't tell us anything.

61
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:37,341
Understandable,
since he's a drug dealer.

62
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:40,261
So he's dangerous and withholding,

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,971
which you find irresistible.

64
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,098
But guys like that, they never call.

65
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,391
He actually said
he was a drug dealer?

66
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:47,935
Not out loud.

67
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,321
But he was wearing
a solid gold Patek Philippe.

68
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:53,941
His friend had a Rolex.
But their phones were prepaid burners,

69
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,102
so they can toss 'em
as soon as they're done.

70
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:58,474
It doesn't matter
if this guy's a drug dealer or not.

71
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,458
Noise-induced vertigo
means ear or brain.

72
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,867
Head C.T. was clean,
so I'm thinking acoustic neuroma.

73
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,903
We need to do an A.B.R.
to test his hearing.

74
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,616
Acoustic neuroma fits.

75
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:08,706
So does lidocaine toxicity.
Or benzocaine...

76
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:10,708
Depends
what he's cutting the coke with.

77
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,252
Now he's not just a drug dealer,
he's a cocaine dealer.

78
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:14,628
He seemed peppy.

79
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:17,814
You test his ears.
I'm gonna go test his cocaine.

80
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,260
You think this guy's gonna hand over
a briefcase full of illegal drugs

81
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,764
because you ask nicely?

82
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,053
I hope not.

83
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,012
So the best coffee's at Geena's,

84
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,331
and the best pizza is at Gino's.

85
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:36,025
Yeah, and don't mix those up,
because the coffee at Gino's

86
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:37,534
could kill ya.

87
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,618
- How's the drycleaner on the corner?
- Go two blocks over to eco-clean.

88
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,324
The one on the corner
used to shred all my boyfriend's shirts.

89
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:46,076
- Good to know.
- In retrospect,

90
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,162
I should really thank
those cleaners.

91
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:51,540
We broke up.
This is my stop.

92
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,272
So if you have any more questions
about the neighborhood,

93
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:55,461
I'm your girl.

94
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:59,255
Favorite sushi place.
Maybe we could get dinner sometime.

95
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,425
Sure...

96
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,636
If you promise to bring
that good-looking guy with the cane.

97
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,512
You mean House?

98
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,389
Your boyfriend's name is house?

99
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,060
He's not my boyfriend.

100
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:13,838
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,863
What do you call each other?

102
00:05:15,992 --> 00:05:17,342
Husband? Partner?

103
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:18,808
Lover?

104
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:20,736
We're not gay.

105
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:22,821
Seriously?

106
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:27,343
You're gonna hear a series
of clicks and hisses.

107
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,663
Sensors measure electronic activity
to your auditory nerve.

108
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,971
How long is this gonna take?

109
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:35,296
An hour, maybe an hour and a half.

110
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:38,858
Or you could walk away
with a tumor in your ear.

111
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,773
- Guy's probably late to a stabbing.
- Impedances look good.

112
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,929
Starting at 13 clicks
per second at 50 decibels.

113
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:49,556
Check this out.

114
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:54,603
13's middle name is Beauregard?

115
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:57,897
Wave three latency is 3.8.

116
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:00,943
Slightly delayed, nothing significant.
That's what sticks out to you?

117
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:03,098
House is clearly screwing with us.

118
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:05,447
- It's a fake paystub.
- Looks real to me.

119
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:08,951
- She don't make that much money.
- I make that much money.

120
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,540
And... apparently, you don't.

121
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,501
I need the drugs.

122
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:19,795
We're in textiles.

123
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,131
I need the drugs!

124
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,384
Works for Jack Bauer.

125
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,525
Is this really necessary?

126
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:30,607
The chairs in the hall
are way more comfortable.

127
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:32,558
But way less genre-apopriate.

128
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:34,685
Here's the deal.

129
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,970
I need information.

130
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,565
You have reasons not to give me that.
So either I can force it out of you...

131
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:42,943
Or I can't.

132
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:46,030
I wish I could tell ya.

133
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:49,913
Let's work with that.

134
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,370
Forget the drugs.
Let's talk about textiles.

135
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:55,238
What's your major product?

136
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:56,582
Is it "H"?

137
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,458
And by that I mean "hosiery".

138
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:01,138
We do more with...

139
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:03,297
culottes.

140
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:05,867
- Is that with a "C" or a "K"?
- C.

141
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,468
Nobody wants "K" anymore.

142
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,635
Does your friend cut the fabric?

143
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,805
No, he's a sales guy.

144
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,114
He must cut a culotte
here and there.

145
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,600
No one touches the culottes.

146
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:21,190
I'm sorry.
Can I talk to you?

147
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,520
I'm interrogating a suspect.

148
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:26,507
Make it quick.

149
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:33,035
Everyone in our building
thinks we're gay.

150
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,048
We're grown men over the age of 30

151
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,735
who moved in together.

152
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,835
We're two tigers
away from an act in Vegas.

153
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:44,102
They'll figure out
we're straight eventually.

154
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:47,299
Eventually is not when I want to go out
with the cute girl in 3-B.

155
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,638
Any chance I could
get some water over here?

156
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,180
If only there was some way
to communicate that information to her.

157
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:54,972
Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds.

158
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:58,493
- If only the larynx was capable of...
- She didn't believe me.

159
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,768
She sidestepped my dinner invite.

160
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:04,400
And a woman would only reject you
because she's worried

161
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:07,611
- that you might not be interested.
- We were chatting, having fun.

162
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,889
- There was definitely a spark.
- When she thought you were gay.

163
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:14,201
You sure your friend isn't secretly...
What is a culotte, anyway?

164
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:17,133
Pants that hang like a skirt.

165
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:23,919
Mickey hates the stuff.

166
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,463
He's one of the few guys I trust

167
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:28,924
to watch the product overnight.

168
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,260
They took him away an hour ago.

169
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:34,561
- You think he's okay?
- It's an ear test.

170
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:36,220
Pretty sure he'll live.

171
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,279
Pupils are constricted.
Pulse is bounding!

172
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:43,021
Airway's clear.

173
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,481
Need a crash cart!

174
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,575
Gotta be his blood pressure. We need
to get it down before he strokes out!

175
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,410
At least we know his ears are okay.

176
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:50,612


177
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:54,128
We put the patient on vasodilators,
got his hypertension under control.

178
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:55,754
He got worse here at the hospital.

179
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,664
Means thug life probably
isn't what's making him sick.

180
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,249
Which means we can stop
the bloodhound gang routine

181
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,708
and go back to being doctors.

182
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:05,961
But we're doctors all the time.
It's so boring.

183
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,131
Fine.

184
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,839
- Could be sick sinus syndrome.
- No chest pain, shortness of breath.

185
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:15,070
Brain aneurysm secondary
to polycystic kidney disease?

186
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:17,522
Normal urinalysis.
Kidney's impalpable.

187
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:19,516
Is... that a new watch?

188
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:22,635
Thought I'd give myself
a little treat.

189
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,272
What if it's not his brain,
but it's on the way to his brain?

190
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:26,606
Carotid stenosis.

191
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:31,778
Get an ultrasound of his carotids.
See if his arteries are clogged.

192
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:41,370
How much money do you make?

193
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:44,469
I want a raise.

194
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:47,127
And I will be happy to talk about that
at your next review...

195
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:49,205
in August.

196
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,360
I know that you're paying me
less than everyone else on the team.

197
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,093
I can't discuss other people's salaries.
You know that.

198
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,387
Now that they know,
they'll never respect me.

199
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,223
And who told them how much you make?

200
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:03,330
It's not fair for me to make less
than the people I supervise.

201
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:05,320
Salary isn't about fairness.

202
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:07,834
It's about what you can leverage
in negotiation.

203
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,028
Which isn't much
without a competing offer on the table.

204
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:13,190
And we both know you don't have one.

205
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,710
Ultrasound showed no narrowing
or obstruction in the patient's carotid.

206
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:23,352
Not that he's worried...
Keeps asking me when he can leave.

207
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:26,214
<i>... in the business of healing people,
you'd think they'd have better soup.</i>

208
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,888
- You bugged his room?
- Our patient sleeps in the building

209
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,652
where they keep their stash.

210
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:33,907
Eventually, he'll say something
that gives away where that is.

211
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:37,302
- We'll find out what's making him sick.
- But we ruled out environmental causes.

212
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,263
You ruled out environmental causes.

213
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:42,808
And you pretended to agree,
just so we'd take him out of his room

214
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,530
so you could plant the bug.

215
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:46,905
Carotid stenosis was a decent idea.

216
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,074
But an even decent-er idea

217
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,336
is that he's got toxins stored
in his fat cells.

218
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:53,343
Every calorie he burns
makes him sicker.

219
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:55,422
If we're going with toxic exposure,

220
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:58,220
we should just start testing
for the most likely suspects.

221
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,909
Bug's a better idea
than blindly running tests for days.

222
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,456
Tell him it'll take weeks.

223
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,147
It'll be faster.

224
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,384
- What do you mean weeks?
- These tests take time.

225
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:16,116
- There are a lot of possibilities.
- No, but I can't sit here this long.

226
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,913
I got things I gotta take care of.

227
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:21,220
If you're worried about the children
going without their drugs,

228
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,224
- I'm sure someone...
- I wanna be discharged.

229
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:27,142
I'll get the forms.

230
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,689
- This is ridiculous.
- Beats sitting in a lab all day.

231
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:48,231
In the lab, there is significantly
less chance of getting killed.

232
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,709
- Slow down.
- We're in a car in broad daylight.

233
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,378
- What's gonna happen?
- You think he doesn't have a gun?

234
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,833
That he's gonna use
to shoot doctors?

235
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:57,948
Back off.

236
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:02,846
Well played with the watch,
by the way.

237
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:04,306
Borrowed it.

238
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,517
- How much longer are we gonna do that?
- Until it's no longer fun.

239
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,897
We all thought he needed
to be taken down a few notches.

240
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,566
So we're just having fun,
not getting even?

241
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:16,693
Crap.

242
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,449
He's gonna get away.

243
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:28,875
Shut up.

244
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,381
3- B?

245
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,341
You're Nora, right?

246
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:42,678
You're the one to thank for all the tips
about the neighborhood.

247
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,319
Nice to meet you.

248
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:50,352
I hear you thought that wilson and I
liked to polish each other's swords.

249
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,148
And by swords, I mean pistols.

250
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:57,912
- Of course he told you about that.
- Don't worry.

251
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:00,501
Actually, I'm surprised
that doesn't happen more often.

252
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:01,655
We're straight.

253
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:11,872
Oh, my... God.

254
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,166
That is beautiful.

255
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:17,337
We finally have the room
to display it the way it deserves.

256
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,634
Would you...
help me get this upstairs?

257
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,386
Absolutely.

258
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,441
Nice shoes, by the way.

259
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:29,566
Louboutin?

260
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:33,145
- You talk to Cuddy?
- Shot me down.

261
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:37,464
- What are you gonna do now?
- I'll wait for my review in August.

262
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:40,110
What?

263
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,757
Nothing.

264
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:43,532
That's what I would do.

265
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:45,155
But I'm a coward.

266
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:54,541
His friend brought him in
15 minutes ago.

267
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,263
Temp's 105.
Pulse is weak and thready.

268
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:59,045
He's not making any sense.

269
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,256
It's too much money.
That wasn't the deal.

270
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:02,841
That wasn't the deal.

271
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:05,187
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Eddie!

272
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,970


273
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:11,146
We gave him antipyretics
and soft steroids to reduce the fever

274
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,549
and prevent organ damage.
He's no longer delirious.

275
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:15,525
Patient went out,
came back worse than before.

276
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,060
Points us back to environmental,
tied to wherever he went.

277
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:19,361
No, it doesn't.

278
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:21,610
- Where's Foreman?
- He had a meeting with Cuddy.

279
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,767
What do you mean? We screwed up.
My car was impounded.

280
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:26,892
True, amusing, and irrelevant.

281
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:30,076
Foreman fall for the paycheck thing?

282
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:37,292
<i>Mazel Tov.</i>
Should be fun to watch.

283
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,045
You're off environmental?

284
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,083
Wherever he went,
it wasn't for long enough.

285
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,674
Add in the fever
and infection's way more likely.

286
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,522
And if it is an infection, his symptoms
suggest it's moved to his brain.

287
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:50,036
Which means...

288
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,046
We'll do a lumbar puncture.

289
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,837
Next time you're tailing someone,

290
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:59,162
take two cars.

291
00:15:00,963 --> 00:15:02,630
You knew we were following you?

292
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,196
I'm sorry.
I had to lose you.

293
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,906
I had business to take care of.

294
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:10,909
Right, because you're a businessman.

295
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,830
Do you know how many junkies come
to the E.R. with their brains melting?

296
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,674
I'll bet there's more drunks
with their livers giving out.

297
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,759
A liquor store owner
laying on this table...

298
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:22,056
I'm guessing
he doesn't get attitude.

299
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:23,838
I hit bone.

300
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:26,344
His old back injury
must have flattened out his discs.

301
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:28,658
Sorry, but I've got
to try this again.

302
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:29,886
You okay?

303
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,721
An adult wants to get wasted,

304
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,470
why is it anybody's business
what substance they use?

305
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,394
Because some of those substances
are against the law.

306
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:40,536
So your problem
isn't that it's immoral.

307
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,861
Your problem is that it's illegal.

308
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:46,903
I got the same problem.

309
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,412
I'm in.

310
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:53,998
Look at his heart rate.

311
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:56,246
- It's normal.
- I know.

312
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,517
I ran into Nora this morning.

313
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:05,797
She told me
about your <i>Evita</i> listening party.

314
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:10,176
The London and New York recordings
are so different.

315
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:13,435
You were supposed to tell her
that we're straight.

316
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,931
She didn't believe me, either.

317
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,414
You're doing this to mess with me.

318
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,970
Correction. I started doing this
to mess with you.

319
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,169
Now I'm honestly trying to hit that.

320
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:25,360
By pretending you're gay
and in a relationship with me?

321
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,776
We're in a relationship
and we're really unhappy.

322
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:31,072
Communication's never been easy for us.
Probably 'cause we're so closeted.

323
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,200
I got it all figured out.
Nora and I spend the next few weeks

324
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,657
hanging out,
become best girlfriends.

325
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:38,997
I confide in her about our issues.

326
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,022
I can't decide if this plan

327
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:43,549
is more despicable or illogical.

328
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:44,919
Then, one night,

329
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,337
we get drunk...

330
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,632
Back rub turns into a front rub...

331
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:50,133
The next morning,

332
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,344
"I've never felt this way
about a woman before."

333
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,827
That's... quite a commitment
you've made

334
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:57,098
to jumping the girl
I'd like to date.

335
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:58,999
I'd like to date her.

336
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:01,102
In the sense that I'd like
to jump her repeatedly.

337
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:02,429
I saw her first.

338
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,147
Seriously?
You're invoking the guy code?

339
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,359
We're guys.
It's a code.

340
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:11,195
You're only bringing this up
'cause you know you're gonna lose.

341
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:13,234
It's not an infection,

342
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,912
but it might be
an autonomic nerve disorder.

343
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:17,661
The hair is still bumping me.

344
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:20,350
Did you get it cut because you're ready
for the next chapter...

345
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:23,085
We stuck a needle
into his spinal bodies twice.

346
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,933
His heart rate stayed normal.

347
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:26,893
If we add that
to his other symptoms...

348
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:29,171
That would be a mistake.

349
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:32,008
She's never gonna fall for it.

350
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,751
Then, you got nothing
to worry about, sweetie.

351
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:40,517
You're a wuss.

352
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,561
Say that when I'm better.

353
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,940
What, are you gonna beat me up?
That sounds stressful.

354
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:49,984
Maybe you should pop
one of your beta blockers first.

355
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,363
- You have a heart problem?
- Medically, no.

356
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,532
He would have told us about that.
Metaphorically...

357
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:10,046
It's an effect from operating
outside of the law.

358
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:13,074
Sometimes, I have to do bad things.

359
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:15,135
And not always to bad people.

360
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,247
Last few months,
that hasn't been so easy.

361
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:24,393
A guy got me the pills.
And they control the stress.

362
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,146
Look, don't say anything to Eddie.

363
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,263
All right?
The last thing I need

364
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,514
is the guys thinking
that I've gone soft.

365
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,735
When was your last pill
before we originally admitted you?

366
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,050
The night before.

367
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:39,868
And we stuck you in here,
you went into beta blocker withdrawal.

368
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,383
That's what caused the hypertension.
When he got out of here,

369
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,497
he took a pill,
and the hypertension went away.

370
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:47,500
Which means it was never a symptom.
We take that off the table,

371
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,169
- we've got vertigo, fever...
- And stress.

372
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:51,967
He's been in this game for a while.

373
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:54,556
Either he grew a conscience
over the last few months

374
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:56,301
or he's producing exceenaline.

375
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,636
Pheochromocytoma.

376
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:03,057
It's Greek for, "you'll be back doing
bad things to good people in no time."

377
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:05,351
M.R.I. his adrenal glands.

378
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,271
You're okay with that? You're not gonna
put a pillow over his face?

379
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,028
Great.

380
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:16,825
Cable guy came.

381
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,040
Hi, James.

382
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:27,332
We've got some kung pao left.

383
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:31,044
God. Right there.

384
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,589
We're having a picnic...
with wine.

385
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,032
- I'll pour you a glass.
- He doesn't drink.

386
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:40,386
Well, more for us, then.

387
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:44,774
Well...

388
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:47,077
I think I might...

389
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,862
have a little...

390
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:51,689
Kung pao.

391
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,598
How'd it go with Cuddy?

392
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:04,911
She told me I needed leverage.

393
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,969
So...

394
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,666
I told her about an offer I had to help
run the neuro department at mercy.

395
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:16,925
- Are you really gonna take the job?
- There is no other job.

396
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,008
I bluffed.
She called it.

397
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:21,553
I'm not gonna beg to be underpaid.

398
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:24,618
I'm leaving when this case is over.

399
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,143
House is lying to you.

400
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,646
I know.

401
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,314
And so are you.

402
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,083
It's 2010, I mean...

403
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,777
You know, nobody cares
if you're gay anymore.

404
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:39,988
You don't have to be in the closet.

405
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:40,989
I'm not...

406
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,943
Look around you. Does this really
look like a place gay men live?

407
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,667
Apart from the poster.

408
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,870
Those stools are our only furniture.

409
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:52,889
There are no window treatments.

410
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:56,796
Well, my ex-boyfriend didn't even know
what window treatments were.

411
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:00,853
Is that Greg's
Carpenters album or yours?

412
00:21:00,978 --> 00:21:04,554
Look, House hates
musicals and fashion and meringue.

413
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,598
This whole thing is an act

414
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:09,309
designed to earn your trust...

415
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:12,988
In order to sleep with you.

416
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:16,954
- I get it.
- Finally.

417
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:19,152
You're jealous.

418
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:22,360
You know, if you want
to spend more time with Greg,

419
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:24,574
you should just tell him.

420
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,896
You were wrong, M.R.I. revealed no sign
of a pheochromocytoma,

421
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:35,962
means Mickey's stress is just stress.
We're back to vertigo and fever.

422
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,398
And environmental is back at the top
of our list of suspects.

423
00:21:38,523 --> 00:21:39,839
{\We're trying to narrow down
the possibilities.}

424
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,300
That receiver doesn't respond
to manual stimulation.

425
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:44,302
Maybe if you took off your shirt.

426
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,365
I resorted to something more exotic.
I call it reading the instructions.

427
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,851
Turns out if you screw the antennae
into the wrong sockets,

428
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,769
it doesn't actually work.

429
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:57,690
We lost Mickey just outside Trenton.

430
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:05,198
It's supposed to search
for an open frequency.

431
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,689
Most buildings there
were built between 1920 and 1940.

432
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:10,388
We're compiling a list of toxins...

433
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:12,541
There's got to be at least
one open frequency.

434
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:21,256
I need a few minutes
with your friend.

435
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:24,884
Or stay if you want.

436
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:26,692
Rectal exam.

437
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,681
I'll check out the cafeteria.

438
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:39,983
Why the beta blockers?

439
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:42,568
What do you mean?

440
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,738
Valium and Xanax
actually reduce stress.

441
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:49,325
Beta blockers just control
the symptoms of stress.

442
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,674
Keep the heart from racing,
hands from shaking,

443
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,693
and all those stage fright issues.

444
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:57,711
That's why some people
take them when they perform.

445
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:02,738
- What the hell is that?
- This is my bug.

446
00:23:02,954 --> 00:23:03,840
And this...

447
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,583
This...

448
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,595
This is yours.

449
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,558
You bugged your own room?

450
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:15,975
Are you... An informant?

451
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:20,199
An informant would have sold his pals
at the first sign of a sniffle.

452
00:23:20,324 --> 00:23:22,395
This guy... is a cop.

453
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,183
I don't see how this is relevant.

454
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,908
In the land of no fun,

455
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:33,327
you got a really sensible
piece of property.

456
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:35,148
Give him a break.

457
00:23:36,425 --> 00:23:39,454
Knowing this guy's an undercover cop
doesn't get us any closer to curing him.

458
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:41,256
Good point.
You know what they say.

459
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,131
Information is not power.

460
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:44,109
Wait...

461
00:23:44,234 --> 00:23:46,861
You're saying we should use
the cop thing to force him to talk?

462
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:47,813
Force?

463
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:50,598
I'm talking about the womanly
art of persuasion.

464
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:52,757
I said womanly.

465
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,694
If you won't talk to us,
we'll find someone who will.

466
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,536
You must have a supervisor.

467
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,986
A... Handler.

468
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:08,814
Good luck with that.

469
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,726
You don't know my real name.

470
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,909
You don't know
if I'm local or state,

471
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:16,079
F.B.I., D.E.A.
but, by all means, get on the phone.

472
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,166
I get it.
These guys are lowlifes.

473
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,932
You want them off the street.

474
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:22,251
They're not just lowlifes.

475
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,785
Eddie killed a snitch
three weeks ago.

476
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:26,756
Boss' orders.

477
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:33,429
The boss, he's one of the biggest
cocaine importers in the entire state.

478
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,319
And he wants to expand
down to Philly.

479
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,937
Tomorrow night, he and Eddie

480
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,686
are meeting the big fish.

481
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,647
And the cops are gonna bust it.

482
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,762
But if you guys get caught
poking around there,

483
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:48,152
the whole thing gets called off.

484
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:49,868
That's noble,

485
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,323
but you can't put your life at risk.

486
00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:54,909
I've been undercover for 16 months.

487
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:58,717
I haven't seen my wife...

488
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:01,374
My house, my dog.

489
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:06,601
I have put far too much into this,
and I will not let it fail.

490
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:11,022
So just...

491
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:14,207
Just keep me alive
for another 24 hours.

492
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,984
And I will tell you
everything you need to know.

493
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,080
Can I come in?

494
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,566
Nurses out here
can't keep their hands off of me.

495
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:29,944
He's a Casanova!

496
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:33,364
What, you bringing me my sandwich?

497
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,259
No, because,

498
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:36,775
guess what.

499
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:38,093
I don't read minds.

500
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:41,869
You okay?

501
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:51,060
He had a G.I infarction
caused by a clot

502
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:52,884
in his superior mesenteric artery.

503
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,622
We had to remove a foot of bowel.

504
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:57,096
If more clots keep forming,
he may not last 24 hours.

505
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,098
And the moron still won't talk.

506
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,309
Bad guy, cool; good guy, moron?

507
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:03,599
- Pretty much.
- Guy's a hero.

508
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:06,230
He's risking his life
to put these dealers in jail.

509
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,108
I'm sure the dealers who take
their places will be very grateful.

510
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:12,401
So vertigo, fever, and thrombosis.

511
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,561
We've already ruled out
cancer and infection.

512
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:17,699
He got worse on steroids,
which suggests it's not autoimmune.

513
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:20,908
- So we're stuck with environmental.
- But what kind of environmentals?

514
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:23,132
Toxins, parasites, allergens.

515
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:25,834
We should pick the top ten possibilities
and treat them.

516
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,586
Except that treating for everything
could kill him faster than whatever.

517
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,338
Got a better idea?

518
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,056
Sort of.
Chase is right.

519
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:34,968
Our patient is holding out
for noble reasons: protecting his bust.

520
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,617
Anybody else on that crew got sick,

521
00:26:36,742 --> 00:26:39,013
I'm guessing
they'd be a little more self-serving.

522
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:45,204
Thanks.

523
00:26:47,843 --> 00:26:50,274
Surgery went well.
You'll be able to see him soon.

524
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,906
Used to be all about
ferberizing your kid.

525
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,854
Now they're saying
it could mess them up.

526
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,339
My... Mine's 6 and a half.

527
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:06,717
Mickey's getting worse.

528
00:27:07,657 --> 00:27:09,205
The clot is a very bad sign.

529
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,504
We really need you
to tell us where he's been.

530
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:13,913
I do that...

531
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:18,469
There's a very good chance that I could
end up John Doe at the county M.E.

532
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,305
Look, Mickey got sick
because he had the most exposure.

533
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:24,058
Other guys are at risk too.
You don't want to...

534
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:26,327
You okay?

535
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:30,723
- I feel dizzy.
- Are you diabetic?

536
00:27:32,552 --> 00:27:34,902
When was the last time
you were at your office?

537
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,363
- Did you drug me?
- What?

538
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,448
You're trying to make me think
that I'm sick

539
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,036
so I'll take you to the stash.

540
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,901
Of course not,
but if you are sick...

541
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,621
No, I don't feel sick.

542
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,848
I feel drugged!

543
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:48,791
Trust me, I know the difference.

544
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:55,468
You didn't even drink half of it.
You'll be fine in an hour.

545
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,774
You think Mickey could die?

546
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,516
It's just a deal.

547
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:07,729
I'll take you.

548
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,742
Couldn't have given us a heads up
that he was living in a drycleaner?

549
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,578
It's like living in a vat of poison.

550
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:20,607
Is that it?
Can we get out of here?

551
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,960
- I gotta cover all our bases.
- Okay, fine. Look...

552
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,340
Back there.

553
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:25,578
Hurry up.

554
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,055
What are these, more chemicals?

555
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:43,650
Not exactly.

556
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:48,281
If this stuff was the problem,
there'd be a lot more sick people.

557
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:53,857
Did you call the cops?

558
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,443
No one's supposed to be here.

559
00:28:59,006 --> 00:28:59,904
Come here.

560
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:01,943
I said no kissing!

561
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:05,228
I didn't know you'd be here.

562
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,615
The deal was just for you. This guy
wants to watch, it's an extra 50.

563
00:29:11,095 --> 00:29:12,845
Yeah, private party, man.

564
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,543
I got it covered tonight.

565
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,510
Nice.

566
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,082
The jealousy is...

567
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:34,915
killing me.

568
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:39,318
He clearly cares about you.
Very much.

569
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,515
Why can't he show it in a...
In a normal way?

570
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:45,106
I'm so tired of...

571
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,993
the whole silence
and the resentment.

572
00:29:49,127 --> 00:29:51,122
I don't know
if I can go back there tonight.

573
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:55,626
I need some time.

574
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,746
Come stay at my place.

575
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:02,049
Really?

576
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:05,106
It'll be fun.

577
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:07,722
You know, like a...
Like a sleepover.

578
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:10,933
That would...
That would be...

579
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,196
It would be such a help.
Thank you.

580
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,985
What are you doing here?

581
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,830
I'm here because...

582
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:27,408
Nothing you can say
is going to change anything.

583
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:37,668
I love this man.

584
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,447
And I am not wasting
another moment of my life

585
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:44,289
denying that.

586
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:53,225
Will you marry me?

587
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:57,646
This is unexpected.

588
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,611
Say yes!

589
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:09,867
I'm gonna go.

590
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:14,538
You two obviously
have some talking to do.

591
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,141
Excuse me.

592
00:31:30,815 --> 00:31:33,001
- How's it coming?
- So far, nothing.

593
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:35,059
Carpet, paint, insulation.

594
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:37,949
Even the gross food in the fridge.
Everything's coming up clean.

595
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:41,190
Which leaves the dry-cleaning chemicals.
Should've the results in a few minutes.

596
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,220
Foreman's already started him
on inhaled albuterol.

597
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,362
Chances are, this case is over.

598
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,915
- We have to tell him.
- We can't.

599
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,892
Won't change the fact
that Cuddy let him walk.

600
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:53,769
It'll just let him know
it was all because of a stupid prank.

601
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,403
We have to tell Cuddy.

602
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:58,415
We confess and beg her
to take him back.

603
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,252
If it worked, he would have a raise,
and we wouldn't be screwed.

604
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,922
Albuterol is not helping.
Patient started coughing blood.

605
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,927
What about adding ipratropium?

606
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,592
- That might...
- Don't bother.

607
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,470
We assumed this place
was using perchloroethylene.

608
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:14,348
Turns out...
Petroleum solvents.

609
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:17,017
The drug dealers are running
a green drycleaner?

610
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,566
I hate to push past the irony,

611
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:22,398
but our patient's bleeding
into his lungs, and we've got nothing.

612
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:28,259
The v/q scan last night
showed a pulmonary aneurysm.

613
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:29,738
Explains the coughing blood.

614
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,164
I did an embolization
to stop the bleeding,

615
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:34,034
then started up again this morning.

616
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:37,484
- Three more aneurysms.
- Those look like mycotic aneurysms.

617
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:38,956
Indicates a fungal infection.

618
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,934
That'd be consistent with his other
symptoms: the vertigo, the fever.

619
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,480
I didn't see any fungus at the location,
and none of the...

620
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:46,513
Somebody missed something.

621
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:48,839
Which is embarrassing for somebody.

622
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,759
And the steroids we gave him

623
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,769
would have suppressed
his immune system.

624
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:55,417
If that was a fungus,
he'd have 30 aneurysms.

625
00:32:56,514 --> 00:32:58,233
Somebody's got a good point.

626
00:32:58,358 --> 00:33:02,021
One bleed to four in less than 12 hours?
That seems like an uptick to me.

627
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:06,025
We need to start him on antifungal meds
before he drowns in his own blood.

628
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:10,134
Do it.

629
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:14,141
How long till it starts working?

630
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,251
Give it a few hours.
We'll be back to check on you.

631
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:37,514
There you go.

632
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:39,128
Take it easy.

633
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:48,233
You shouldn't have taken her there,
you imbecile.

634
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,091
They found nothing.

635
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:54,186
You could have got
your brains blown out.

636
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:56,085
I had to do something.

637
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:58,797
I couldn't just sit and watch and...

638
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:06,973
You're my friend.

639
00:34:09,762 --> 00:34:10,762
Thanks.

640
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:15,323
You'd do it for me.

641
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:21,438
I should get going.

642
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:24,144
Got the big man from Philly
coming in tonight.

643
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,987
You want me to stay, I'll stay.

644
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,978
Jimmy knows everything that we know.

645
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:42,242
The six months we put in on this...

646
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:46,889
You gotta be there.

647
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,217
I'll swing by tomorrow.

648
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:03,392
I'm sorry.

649
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:08,035
You know that...
I can't go with you.

650
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,501
It was all our fault.

651
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:25,122
We were screwing with Foreman,

652
00:35:25,512 --> 00:35:28,240
trying to make him think
he made less than we did.

653
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,753
Obviously,
things got out of control.

654
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:34,312
Well, someone does something
stupid and insensitive,

655
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:36,437
I always figure it was House.

656
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:38,927
Good to know it's catching.

657
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,847
Look, there is no other job.
He was just trying to get a raise.

658
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,575
Even if you gave him
a little more money, I know he'd stay.

659
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,525
I'm not giving Foreman a raise

660
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,021
because the three of you
decided to amuse yourselves.

661
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:52,691
We know, and that's why we want you
to take it out of our paychecks.

662
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,527
You two okay with this?

663
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,808
- Is there any other option?
- We're okay with it.

664
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:03,035
Foreman is a good team leader.

665
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,286
He deserves it.

666
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:07,063
Okay, then.

667
00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:09,493
That is what I will do.

668
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,735
And just so you know...

669
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:17,090
I've no idea what you're talking about.
I haven't seen Foreman in three days.

670
00:36:30,476 --> 00:36:33,956
The phrase "Who's your daddy?"
comes to mind.

671
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:48,245
Want to grab some coffee?

672
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,665
Kind of a bad time.

673
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,210
Sorry.
You told me to drop by, so...

674
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,402
- This is when I could make it.
- Right.

675
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,922
Come in.

676
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:05,977
This whole thing with Wilson...

677
00:37:06,797 --> 00:37:08,183
It's all my fault.

678
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:11,270
We're not closeted,
because we're not gay.

679
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:13,564
For real.

680
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:17,853
Wilson thought you were cute,
and I was just yanking his chain.

681
00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:21,113
Maybe that's not the best phrasing.

682
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:25,120
So you were only spending time with me
to screw with him?

683
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:28,245
God, no. I was spending time with you
because I want to touch your boobs.

684
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:30,746
Enough to listen to <i>Evita,</i> twice.

685
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:33,186
I really hate <i>Evita.</i>
That's how much I like your boobs.

686
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:40,713
Wait. Wait, wait.

687
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:46,333
He's a really good guy.

688
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,650
And he really likes you.

689
00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:53,751
Well, it's really...

690
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:56,522
It's sweet of you to stick up
for your friend like that.

691
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:02,135
And you're still
trying to sleep with me.

692
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,657
You know, maybe I will call him.
It would serve you right.

693
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:07,708
Wilson's a jerk too.

694
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,143
At least he tried
to do the right thing.

695
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:13,790
He's been divorced three times.
He slept with a dying patient.

696
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,421
Sure, he looks like a boy scout,
but then...

697
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:39,274
The aneurysms look mycotic,
but they're not.

698
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,555
They're inflammatory.

699
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:43,941
Because this is not
a fungal infection.

700
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:46,512
The hypertension was a real symptom.

701
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:48,762
You've been unwittingly treating it
with beta blockers.

702
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:51,557
You stopped taking them,
and your blood pressure went up.

703
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:54,998
It's Hughes-Stovin.

704
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:59,461
Okay, so how...
How do we treat this?

705
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:07,010
We don't.

706
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,930
Hughes-Stovin
is an autoimmune disease.

707
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:12,808
Once it's this advanced,
there's not much we can do.

708
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:16,627
The aneurysms keep multiplying.
Eventually...

709
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:19,231
One of them will rupture.

710
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:23,151
Are you sure?

711
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:26,863
If you die in the next day or so,
I will be.

712
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:32,400
Even if you had told us
everything we wanted to know,

713
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:34,469
it wouldn't have made a difference.

714
00:39:37,447 --> 00:39:38,879
You did the right thing.

715
00:39:44,537 --> 00:39:46,787
I think I should call my wife now.

716
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:44,789
I'm sorry about your patient.

717
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,507
He died a hero in his own mind.

718
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:51,007
Guess it's better than nothing.

719
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,364
Ran into Nora in the elevator.

720
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:55,379
She no longer thinks we're gay.

721
00:41:55,504 --> 00:41:57,639
Now she thinks
we're mendacious dirt bags.

722
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:02,202
Mendacious dirt bag
comes much more naturally to me.

723
00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:05,021
Least we can get rid of that.

724
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:07,353
I kind of like it.

725
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,417
Unlike this sofa.

726
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:10,926
It's 500 bucks.

727
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,820
And...

728
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,514
It reclines.

729
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,375
I will punch you in the face.

730
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,169
I'll stop, if you
get rid of the sofa.

731
00:42:28,705 --> 00:42:29,546
No chance.

732
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:53,112
