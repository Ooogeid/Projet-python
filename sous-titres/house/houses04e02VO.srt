00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:03,608
<i>Big eye, this is cobra zero six,
just entered Indian country</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,057
<i>approaching way point four.
Request confirmation to engage target.</i>

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:08,424
<i>on first approch.</i>

4
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:12,147
<i>Roger, Cobra zero six. Big eye waiting
for confirmation as well.</i>

5
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,734
<i>We wait any longer, big eye,
we're not gonna have any choice</i>

6
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:17,122
<i>in the matter.
I can't exactly do a u-turn here.</i>

7
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:19,598
<i>Roger that, cobra.
Hold for confirmation.</i>

8
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:11,568
Captain Cooper, are you okay?

9
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:13,200
What happened?
You weren't answering.

10
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:15,598
Because the damn comcord
got disconnected.

11
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,522
You spend a billion
dollars on the avionics

12
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,503
and don't bother to check
the comm connection?

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,120
I checked that twice before you got in.

14
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:23,614
And the next time you
ask us to test a prototype,

15
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:26,127
it'd be nice if your directional
gyro didn't spin like a top

16
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:28,185
when I'm supposed to be
500 feet off the floor.

17
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:29,293
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,985
I'll go review the simulation,
see if I can figure out what went wrong.

19
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:46,029
Season 4 - Episode 2

20
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:50,183
<i>Transcript: swsub.com</i>

21
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:57,004
<i>Synchro: BlueDoc, ¤AkaZab¤</i>

22
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,299
Who is this man?

23
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,335
Come on, take a shot.

24
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,403
I'm not gonna fire you every
time you get a wrong answer.

25
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,749
Neville Chamberlain.

26
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,892
You're fired.

27
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:29,784
Does this man look like he's ceding
Czechoslovakia

28
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,716
to a fascist dictatorship?

29
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,214
It's Buddy Ebsen,
the actor.

30
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:35,969
He's dead.

31
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,458
- Why are we...
- Buddy Ebsen

32
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:40,215
was the original tin man
in the wizard of oz,

33
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,312
for a day.

34
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,289
He was diagnosed allergic to the
aluminum dust in the makeup.

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,680
His lungs failed, he nearly died.

36
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:47,991
Question is, why?

37
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,812
Didn't you just say he was allergic?

38
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:52,606
You may not have legs,
but you got ears.

39
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:55,846
I suggest you use them.
I said he was diagnosed allergic.

40
00:02:56,294 --> 00:03:00,249
Since we are currently short
exactly one interesting patient,

41
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,134
we are gonna figure out what really
happened to Buddy Ebsen in 1938.

42
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,354
Now, on the one hand,
he's not getting deader.

43
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,758
On the other hand,
your jobs hang in the balance.

44
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,621
- So.
- House.

45
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:20,385
I want seven alternate
diagnoses when I get back.

46
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,245
Did you forget how to count to three?

47
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:27,519
I get budget for three.

48
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,019
Doesn't mean I can only hire three.

49
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:30,765
Actually, that's exactly what it means.

50
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:33,200
I cut the permanent salaries by 10%.

51
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:35,674
Over three years, that'll more
than make up for the breakage

52
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:38,052
on the 27 that I'm gonna weed
out over the next few weeks.

53
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,355
There's 40 people in there.

54
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,565
Row D, you're fired.

55
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:46,503
I didn't actually count all the resumes.

56
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:50,263
This is stupid.
You can't manage that many people.

57
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,480
You're just gonna keep
weeding them out arbitrarily.

58
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,470
Sure, and having them sitting
in my office schmoozing about

59
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:58,883
their favorite algerian surfing
movies is a much better system.

60
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,794
- Wait a sec, were you in Row D?
- Yes.

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,611
My apologies, my boss says
I'm being arbitrary and stupid.

62
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,575
Row D is not fired.
Row C is fired.

63
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:09,410
Great.
Thank you.

64
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:13,829
See,
that was not arbitrary.

65
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:17,426
Well, I'd love to chat,
but I've been paged.

66
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,334
That's interesting.
Apparently paged myself.

67
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,051
If you have a resume there,
not interested.

68
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,830
But I wouldn't mind hearing
how you got my pager number.

69
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:39,954
It's not a resume.

70
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,697
$50,000.

71
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:47,088
Does one-eyed nicky want me
to run that to Jimmy The Nose?

72
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,805
It's for my medical bills.

73
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:52,062
I need you to find out
what's wrong with me.

74
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,135
Insurance is usually cheaper than that.

75
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,881
Cash means there is something to hide.

76
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:01,893
I'm a captain in the air force
about to start a new assignment.

77
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,934
NASA's astronaut training program.

78
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:08,321
I discovered salt
and created FM radio.

79
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:11,744
Something is wrong,
with my eyes, my ears.

80
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:14,517
Well, if it's fixable,

81
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,751
the air force will do it for free.

82
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,803
If not, doesn't matter.

83
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:22,856
There are 100 applicants ready to take
my place who don't need to be fixed.

84
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,752
I need to do this off the books.

85
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,572
I did the research.
You're the best, you break rules,

86
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:29,975
and you don't care about
anyone except yourself.

87
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,701
Well, let's say that's true.

88
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,521
You get a new job,

89
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:41,927
hospital gets a nice wad of cash.

90
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,742
What do I get?

91
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:47,258
I crashed a flight simulator

92
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:49,944
because I started to hear

93
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:51,797
with my eyes.

94
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,723
- The aluminum, could've been tainted...
- Don't care.

95
00:05:58,825 --> 00:05:59,828
New patient.

96
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,038
30 year old female,

97
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,357
with synesthesia.

98
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:06,433
New rules.

99
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,625
You generate a lab report,
you shred it.

100
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,600
X ray,
you melt it.

101
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,550
No notes, no records, nothing.

102
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:19,228
As far as you're concerned,
the patient is Osama Bin Laden.

103
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:22,041
And everyone not in this
room is delta force.

104
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:23,409
Any questions?

105
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,786
We're protecting Osama Bin Laden?

106
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,490
It's a metaphor.
Get used to it.

107
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,033
Any more questions?

108
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,965
And you're not even gonna
tell us her name?

109
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,085
You think her name might be connected
to what's wrong with her?

110
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,168
Here's Osama!

111
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,566
You all have numbers,

112
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,168
so we're gonna do this
alphabetically.

113
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,185
- 8, 15, and 5.
- Is the synesthesia new?

114
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:56,708
Yes.

115
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,439
Any history of similar
symptoms or psychiatric

116
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,657
No, nothing.

117
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,780
Are you on any prescription meds?

118
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,859
- Or use any other drugs?
- No.

119
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:06,256
Should we trust her answers?

120
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:09,002
You think I'd pull you off Buddy
Ebsen just for a junkie?

121
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,532
Can we trust your answers?

122
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,752
- Well, you gotta trust someone, right?
- No.

123
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:17,137
Has anyone close to you been sick lately
a family member, a coworker?

124
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:18,915
No, not that I'm aware of.

125
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,796
Two down.
Kitty Carlisle.

126
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,505
You spend much time above 20,000 feet?

127
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:28,317
Why would you ask that?

128
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:30,899
People who fly are immobile
for long periods.

129
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,842
Could be a leg clot that embolized
to the brain through a PFO.

130
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,357
Unusual choice.

131
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:38,712
Like you said, you wouldn't interrupt
Buddy with anything that wasn't.

132
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:41,588
The patient is...

133
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,592
A frequent flier.

134
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:47,148
13, 32, 39.

135
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:50,464
Get Osama an EEG, MRI, and angiogram.

136
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:55,697
How many of you think that
Oswald acted alone?

137
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:59,454
If, by alone, you mean that
he was unaware that the CIA

138
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,540
Oh, shut up.

139
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,485
Split yourself into two groups.

140
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,175
Test her blood.
Test her stool.

141
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:10,990
Who likes
the designated hitter?

142
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,911
You're wrong.
You're lucky you're not fired.

143
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:17,577
Two more groups.
LPS and cultures.

144
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,114
Who doesn't know what
a designated hitter is?

145
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,291
Here's her address.

146
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:26,450
I want you to break in,
find out what she's hiding.

147
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,446
Why don't we just ask
the patient for the key?

148
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,804
If you could find out what she's hiding
just by asking,

149
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,582
we'd have to redefine hiding.

150
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:41,586
You wanna live in this country,
learn the language.

151
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,841
What do you want the rest of us to do?

152
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:52,313
30 people for three openings,
and I want you to wash my car.

153
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,543
This is not why I busted
my ass in med school.

154
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,787
We spend half an hour cleaning a car,
big deal.

155
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:57,944
It's demeaning.

156
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,808
Work is demeaning?

157
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,213
We're too good for this.

158
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,343
Oh, don't give me that
honest day's labor crap.

159
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:06,765
We all went to med school so we wouldn't
have to do an honest day's labor.

160
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,554
What about an honest hour's labor?

161
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:10,970
In exchange, we get a shot at
learning from one of the best

162
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,646
diagnosticians in the world.

163
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:14,897
We don't.

164
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:18,624
If we did, we'd be one of the ones
drawing blood or checking for toxins.

165
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:19,875
We're done.

166
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:22,670
He's just not gonna cut
us loose until we've

167
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,445
dusted his shelves
and starched his shirt.

168
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,493
I'm outta here.
Who's with me?

169
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,068
Are we sure he wasn't joking?

170
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:49,080
Maybe this is just a test.

171
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,290
Everything's a joke,
and everything's a test.

172
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,812
And he wants us to do it.
Come on, get up here.

173
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,734
I could try,
but I pulled a muscle in 1987

174
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:59,410
I didn't waste two years
repeating medical school

175
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:02,302
- to be arrested and deported.
- Why'd they make you repeat?

176
00:10:02,454 --> 00:10:03,804
Not enough gym credits?

177
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,459
According to the state of New Jersey,

178
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,370
medical schools in my country
suffer from not being from this country.

179
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:19,355
If you get it open, you're gonna
have to come down and let me in.

180
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,261
Or you could just wait out here.

181
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,687
This is a competition.

182
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,565
Change your mind?

183
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,945
- Then why are you here?
- Never intended to quit.

184
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,673
- Well, then why did you.
- Intended to get everyone else to quit.

185
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:43,812
Get off the car.

186
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,296
I need to clean it.

187
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,693
We need to clean it.

188
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,509
I stole his keys.
We'll take it to a car wash.

189
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:52,774
He's got people breaking
into a woman's apartment.

190
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:56,207
Obviously, respecting personal property
isn't one of the rules.

191
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,867
I told the super I was
worried about my niece.

192
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,635
She hasn't been answering the telephone.

193
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:12,978
Nice guy.

194
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:14,425
Two daughters at mount holyoke.

195
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:18,527
No evidence of clots.

196
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,087
And other than elevated
red blood cell counts,

197
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:23,701
the, uh, blood work was.

198
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:25,001
Unremarkable.

199
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,772
Got a problem with the
naked female form?

200
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,357
Not at all.

201
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,479
Maybe she's just not used
with the naked dolphin form.

202
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,245
That's not a dolphin.
It's a porpoise.

203
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,044
There is a difference, you know.

204
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:43,316
Salary, for one thing.

205
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,022
You want us to give you a minute?

206
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,190
- High red blood cell count likely means
- carbon monoxide poisoning.

207
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:56,894
There are a lot of
different explanations

208
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,240
for elevated red blood cells.

209
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,608
Yeah, well, which one fits best
with the damaged fluid

210
00:12:00,664 --> 00:12:04,501
that your competitors found
in the gas fireplace in Osama's cave?

211
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:08,788
Car's clean.

212
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:11,844
Did you just see a blond guy with
a pretentious accent?

213
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:14,253
- Can't see an accent.
- Good point.

214
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,089
Can I have my car keys back?

215
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,057
Gimme the car keys,

216
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,974
put the patient in a hyperbaric chamber,
and no more prime numbers for you.

217
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,402
Thank you.

218
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:31,470
The high pressure and oxygen will flush
the carbon monoxide from your system.

219
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,929
This much oxygen for too long
can have some toxic effects,

220
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,609
so we'll do this in cycles.

221
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:38,684
Can I talk to you a second?

222
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:44,448
You're working that thing all the time.
Is everything alright?

223
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,075
We're supposed to be watching
her heart rate and blood pressure.

224
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,037
Yeah, I was until you
pulled me over here.

225
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:52,022
I'm sending out a consult
on another patient.

226
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:55,965
What? I'm not quitting my old job
until I'm sure I've got a new one.

227
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,774
- didn't say anything.
- You had a look.

228
00:12:57,953 --> 00:12:59,670
Yeah.
I did.

229
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:01,310
Sorry.

230
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,065
I think she's having a heart attack.

231
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,348
No, I just feel a little funny.

232
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:08,098
Tachyarrhythmia.

233
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:10,731
Call?

234
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,130
- Nothing.
- V-FIB,

235
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,170
where the hell is clear.

236
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,713
Are you crazy?
You can't bring those.

237
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:20,982
- We're in a!
- Clear.

238
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,307
She's on fire!

239
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:42,192
- Her heart's beating.
- And we are so fired.

240
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,552
We've started her on
nitro and blood thinners.

241
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,148
Electrolytes and post-arrest
EKG were normal.

242
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,130
The attack was not caused
by the procedure.

243
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:56,174
So what does cause synesthesia,

244
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:58,296
high red blood cell count,
and heart attack?

245
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:02,826
Aren't we gonna discuss what caused
the sudden appearance of burnt flesh?

246
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,153
He brought charged paddles
into an oxygenated room.

247
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:08,795
And you didn't stop him.

248
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:10,996
Means either you thought

249
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,505
it was a chance worth taking,
making you a hypocrite,

250
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,724
or you thought he'd fail,
making you a cutthroat little pixie.

251
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,350
- What causes?
- Takayasu's syndrome.

252
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:22,140
Not without a rash and a fever.

253
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:24,019
- It's gotta be whipple's.
- No way.

254
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,034
You ever see whipple's
without abdominal pain?

255
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:27,067
Stop it!

256
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:30,491
This argument is distracting
every male and lesbian here.

257
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:31,799
You're both right

258
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,509
in the sense that you've convinced
me that you're both wrong.

259
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:36,462
What about cardiomyopathy?

260
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,894
Structural abnormality causes the heart
attack and throws clots to the brain,

261
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:42,739
leading to synesthesia.

262
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,392
- How old are you?
- I'm 21.

263
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:47,384
Unless it's relevant.

264
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:49,427
Okay,
scooter.

265
00:14:50,185 --> 00:14:51,960
Do a transesophageal echo.

266
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:56,649
And since the positive divisors of
26 are 2 and 13, have them assist.

267
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,277
Rest of you, go to the cafeteria,

268
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:02,470
document ten things
that can cause infection.

269
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:03,744
Each.

270
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:14,900
I wouldn't.

271
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:16,847
Someone named "17"

272
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:20,170
thinks there could be listeria
in the cream cheese.

273
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,728
17's a stupid number.

274
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:26,721
- What's Chase doing here?
- You saw Chase?

275
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,010
Last night,
outside my office.

276
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,185
That's interesting.

277
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:33,982
It's more curious than actually.

278
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,977
Chase took a job at the
mayo clinic in Arizona.

279
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,051
A week ago.

280
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:42,974
Interesting.

281
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:46,099
It wasn't Foreman or Cameron you...

282
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:47,565
"saw,"

283
00:15:47,752 --> 00:15:49,546
but Chase,
the one you fired.

284
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:50,937
Not interesting.

285
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:54,881
Someone who looked like someone
I used to know walked by my office.

286
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,271
It's always interesting

287
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,865
when repressed guilt starts
unrepressing itself.

288
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:03,952
The only thing
I feel guilty for: Is this.

289
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:12,849
We're gonna feed this endoscope
down your esophagus,

290
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:15,861
try to find where your heart
might be damaged.

291
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:18,010
It's gonna feel uncomfortable.

292
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,039
But just keep swallowing.

293
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,147
I promise
you'll be fine.

294
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,241
She's ready.

295
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:29,324
Go ahead.
Take a whack.

296
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,917
Right.

297
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:33,656
So if we don't find anything,
House blames me.

298
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,579
Or you find something
and get a gold star.

299
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:37,025
Why don't you want to do it?

300
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:40,638
House isn't gonna be impressed by a gray
hair doing his ten thousandth echo.

301
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:43,400
- She's just be interesting.
- That makes you suspicious.

302
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,007
Doctor?

303
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,903
Call me "13".

304
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:48,769
I'm not getting invested.

305
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,496
Her heart's structurally sound.

306
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:55,431
No clots.
No valvular defects.

307
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,106
No wall motion abnormalities.

308
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,810
Got that from "structurally sound".

309
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,727
- What did she say?
- Structurally sound.

310
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,630
I assume you're not all walking
with me to tell me you found nothing.

311
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,348
It showed a short burst in the at...

312
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:09,650
Okay.
Who's next?

313
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:12,485
Showed a short burst of atrial flutter.
I ran a rhythm strip twice

314
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,372
- and got the same result.
- Stop.

315
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,512
Okay, here's how we diagnose in transit.
I lead, you draft.

316
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,620
I move, you move.
I stop, you stop. Got it?

317
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,483
Flutter can mean
hormone overproduction.

318
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:25,390
Why did you do the test?
I gave it to scooter.

319
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,223
- We didn't think it mattered
- It doesn't.

320
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:29,033
It matters that you let her.

321
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,479
Okay.
10, 24, 39,

322
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,508
run a trh stimulation test
for hyperthyroidism.

323
00:17:35,562 --> 00:17:37,472
That could cause another heart attack.

324
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,080
Proving her first attack
was caused by her thyroid.

325
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,791
Which is kinda the point, right?

326
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,769
I ride alone.

327
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,467
The hormones stimulate your thyroid.

328
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,702
Don't worry if you get flushed
or you start to sweat.

329
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:58,194
It means the thyroid's working.

330
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:01,882
And, uh, if you want,
I can remove that mole.

331
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,330
I'm a plastic surgeon.
You're allowed a little vanity.

332
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,455
I'm fine with the way I look.

333
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:08,814
Good for you.

334
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:13,266
Although, I do find it
a bit odd that someone

335
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,061
so self-assured doesn't want her doctors
to find out what's wrong with her.

336
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:19,417
What are you talking about?
Why else am I here?

337
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:20,924
You're jerking us around.

338
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,582
You're handcuffing us
with all these restrictions.

339
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:25,380
I'm feeling warm.

340
00:18:26,393 --> 00:18:30,220
Her pulse is 120. Stop pushing.
If House thought this would handicap us,

341
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:33,189
- he wouldn't have taken the case.
- Or maybe that's why he took the case.

342
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:35,415
He wants to see if we can
get it out of her on our own.

343
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,883
What did you find in her home?

344
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:39,206
- You were in my home?
- Nothing.

345
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,235
Travel pictures,
yearbook,

346
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,990
her name on an employment slip?

347
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,689
We weren't checking for that stuff OK?

348
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,522
Obviously, House didn't want us to.

349
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,010
You're gonna.
You're gonna out me, aren't you?

350
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:50,565
You're gonna ruin everything.

351
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,458
Nobody's trying to do anything.
Just relax.

352
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:57,581
This is not a normal response
to the test. Pulse and bp are too high.

353
00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:59,215
Get away from me.

354
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,507
Get away from me.

355
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,009
Don't touch me.

356
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,512
Paging me during Judge Judy,

357
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:18,898
not the best way to win my affections.

358
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,723
She had another episode of synesthesia.

359
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:23,445
It set off a psychotic attack.
And now she ran in there and must've

360
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:25,622
- jammed something in the handles.
- So you call me.

361
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:28,811
The guy with one good
leg and zero leverage.

362
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:33,394
We break that door down, security
shows up, and her name goes in a file.

363
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:38,527
Luckily,
violence is not the last resort.

364
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:41,239
Extortion is.
So go ahead.

365
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,312
Extort her.

366
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:49,785
If you don't open this door,
we're going to break it down.

367
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,622
Clever.

368
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,910
An appeal to her deep concern
for hospital property.

369
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:56,484
Let's see how that works.

370
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:03,014
If you don't open this door,

371
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:04,991
<i>- you're going to die.
- Go away!</i>

372
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,336
- You seem to be getting to her.
- She doesn't care if she dies.

373
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,225
- You think she wants to die?
- No, but

374
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:14,180
I think she only wants to live
under certain circumstances.

375
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:20,849
Open up or I blab
your secret to everyone.

376
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,895
<i>You don't know anything.</i>

377
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:24,215
I do.

378
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:42,419
- Anybody think that a sedative might...
- I'm trying.

379
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:47,666
Who's that?

380
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:56,692
Who is she?

381
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,733
Osama Bin Laden.

382
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,144
Who is she?

383
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:19,197
- Is she okay?
- She's stable.

384
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,004
Who is she?

385
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,291
- What did House tell you?
- That she is on the run

386
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,110
from an international crime syndicate.

387
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:28,538
That's what he told us.

388
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:31,677
House maybe your boss,
but I'm House's boss.

389
00:21:31,995 --> 00:21:34,463
You want to work here, I better be okay
with it.

390
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:37,521
Honestly, he didn't tell us
anything about who she was...

391
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:39,155
Her name's Greta Cooper.

392
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,769
Wants to be an astronaut. 
Doesn't want NASA to know

393
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:46,012
her brain's getting
her ears confused with her eyes.

394
00:21:47,978 --> 00:21:49,393
I went through her mail.

395
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:55,501
You're a virus, House. Now instead
of one liability, I've got 20.

396
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:57,214
Apparently, only 19.

397
00:21:57,861 --> 00:21:59,882
- Which number was it?
- From now on,

398
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:01,676
everything you do gets charted.

399
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:05,609
With pen on paper. In a binder that says
princeton Plainsboro teaching Hospital

400
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,599
- on the cover.
- Mom!

401
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,169
If you want to run something
through the labs, I get a copy.

402
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:14,226
If you do scans, I get a copy.
If you think about doing scans,

403
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:15,488
I get a copy.

404
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,971
You know my current thoughts, right?
I don't have to put those on paper.

405
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,497
Three issues.

406
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:26,956
One,

407
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,247
number 10, you're fired.

408
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,771
- She told you?
- Well, it had to be someone

409
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:32,983
who went to her home.

410
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,805
No. 26 is half asleep.
Missed his afternoon nap.

411
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,546
Obviously he doesn't feel guilt.
No. 2 is here on a visa

412
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,424
- she can't jeopardize...
- you can't know.

413
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:43,541
And that chick's been pointing at you
since I walked in.

414
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:45,938
Issue two.

415
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,577
What causes synesthesia, high RBC,
tachyarrhythmia, and panic attacks?

416
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:54,101
Slight glucose elevation...
That says thyroid.

417
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:56,820
- Baseline thyrotropin's 1.1.
- 1.3

418
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,331
- Whatever. Her thyroid's working.
- What about her liver?

419
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:02,320
Original ALT levels weren't abnormal
but were near the edge.

420
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:04,303
- She has patient data on her PDA.
- I do not.

421
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,885
I saw the lab values. You said we
couldn't write anything down.

422
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:09,651
- I also said I wanted answers.
- Liver cancer's the most likely.

423
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,378
Paraneoplastic syndrome.
We need to do an MRI.

424
00:23:12,468 --> 00:23:15,490
- Which brings us to issue three.
- You're saying we can write stuff down?

425
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:17,983
To you, I'm saying you're fired.
To everyone else...

426
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,342
- But you said specifically...
- I hate tattletales.

427
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:23,099
- She tattled on 10.
- Now you tattled twice.

428
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,046
Issue three...

429
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:27,052
Come on, let's go.

430
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:31,739
Issue three. How do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

431
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,180
Dr. Cuddy didn't say we can't do tests.
She said we have to chart.

432
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:38,072
If we chart, we won't get consent.
So we can't.

433
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,431
The patient's life may depend on her
consenting.

434
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:42,850
Her dreams depend on her not consenting.

435
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:47,567
So, how do we do tests
when we can't do tests?

436
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:49,768
You've got an hour.

437
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,189
How do you scan a liver
without scanning a liver?

438
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,960
And what's Cameron doing here?

439
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:02,756
Interesting.

440
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:06,782
- So you're seeing cameron now.
- No, not "interesting",

441
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,855
because not "seeing."

442
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:09,991
"saw."

443
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:13,830
My patient won't consent
to MRIs or ultrasounds.

444
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:16,527
And you've dealt with more liver cancer
than anyone else here.

445
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:20,320
So you want me to share the secret
scanning techniques I learned in Nepal?

446
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:23,019
Unfortunately, the monks
made me swear a blood oath.

447
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:25,310
- Where was she?
- In the lobby.

448
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,803
Guess we could palpate
the area around the liver.

449
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:31,823
Which won't work unless the tumor's
enormous, which you know.

450
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:35,339
Which means you're here because
these visions are freaking you out.

451
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:37,968
She had blonde hair.

452
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,904
- Why would I hallucinate that?
- Yes.

453
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,956
Yes, why are you merging
Cameron and Chase?

454
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:48,172
We should find out before the next time
you see her when she'll be black.

455
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:51,891
Of course, it's scientifically
impossible for a person to go back

456
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:53,588
and visit somewhere they worked.

457
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:57,304
No. But since she's not a dead cat,
it is scientifically impossible

458
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,298
for her to be in two places at once.

459
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:01,414
Physics joke.

460
00:25:01,998 --> 00:25:05,707
- Don't hear enough of those.
- She just called me from Arizona.

461
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:08,216
Notice the area code. 480.

462
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,545
They put an offer
on a place in Scottsdale.

463
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:13,469
Do you want to talk or should I?
I guess we could both talk.

464
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:17,343
Although they're engaged. And if you're
staying in touch, you might want to buy.

465
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:26,426
Maybe it's not repressed guilt.
Maybe it's just... Panic.

466
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:29,423
Right now you've got enough fellows
to build a railroad.

467
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:31,854
But you're gonna have to narrow
that room full of numbers

468
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:32,912
down to three people.

469
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:36,975
Any chance you could turn this creative
brilliance towards my patient's liver?

470
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:40,441
I think you're gonna choose people
for reasons that have

471
00:25:40,502 --> 00:25:43,342
nothing to do with their skills.
I think you're going to choose people

472
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:47,121
just because you can't stand them.
Because if you like them,

473
00:25:47,237 --> 00:25:49,185
well, that's just...

474
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,264
Stressful.

475
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:54,596
Stress.

476
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:56,995
I like it.

477
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:04,686
- We need to stress the patient's liver.
- You mean make her sick?

478
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,821
I mean make her sick in a specific way.

479
00:26:06,997 --> 00:26:09,964
If her liver's given to malfunctioning,
we make it malfunction.

480
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:12,139
Are we on the other side of wrong here?

481
00:26:12,178 --> 00:26:14,970
Don't we have an ethics board
that we should consult?

482
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:16,289
I fired you.

483
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,673
- No, you didn't.
- He fired you. You're No. 6.

484
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,285
No, I'm not. I'm No. 9.

485
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,136
I approve of your shamelessness.

486
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:26,010
You're still fired.

487
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:28,199
How do we stress her liver?

488
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:30,838
Lying and paperwork, I get.
Shutting down organs...

489
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:33,927
We could give her intravenous vitamin D
and stick her in a tanning booth.

490
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,931
If she goes into a coma, we know
it's a metabolic problem.

491
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:38,639
Nice.

492
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,167
But vitamin D's metabolized
by the liver and kidneys.

493
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,049
It wouldn't tell us
which one's screwed up.

494
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:44,686
We could get her wasted.

495
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,814
Give her shots of tequila. Measure
how long it takes for her to pass out.

496
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:52,718
If it's too fast, then we know
her liver's not processing alcohol.

497
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:53,814
It's a shot.

498
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:56,962
I like you, No. 9.

499
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:07,463
- You wanted to see me?
- You a mormon?

500
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,042
You're wearing a ring
from Brigham Young.

501
00:27:13,253 --> 00:27:15,399
Or did your folks just do the lawns?

502
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:18,524
The church has a very progressive
attitude toward racial equality.

503
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,157
Don't care.
Actually, I'm thanking God.

504
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:23,935
You're the only non-drinker we got.

505
00:27:24,446 --> 00:27:27,827
We need a control group to establish
whether the liver's deterioration

506
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,225
is within normal range.

507
00:27:29,503 --> 00:27:32,661
Got a big drinker, medium drinker,
now I got a no-drinker.

508
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,285
Just do an MRI.

509
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:41,138
You really think the guy who created
heaven and earth cares what you put

510
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:42,457
in your digestive tract?

511
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:45,068
Her dream shouldn't outrank
my religious belief.

512
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,266
Why not?
Her dream might come true.

513
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,054
All life is sacred, right?

514
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,044
We're not saving her life,
we're doing a diagnostic test.

515
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:59,346
- Not even a real diagnostic test.
- Well, that fake test

516
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,334
might really save her life.

517
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:06,624
Would you pull an ass
out of a pit on the sabbath?

518
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,358
Would you or would you not pull an ass
out of a pit on the sabbath?

519
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:22,199
Fine.

520
00:28:22,816 --> 00:28:23,831
I'll do it.

521
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:26,338
Good.

522
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:33,815
Why'd you have to pick tequila?

523
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:36,576
I assume a single malt
would've worked just as well.

524
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:37,759
Wasn't our choice.

525
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:42,344
Okay.

526
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,125
Two minutes, then round number five.

527
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:49,120
So tell me about the magic underwear.

528
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,784
- Is that why you're here?
- I'm the big drinker.

529
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:57,330
Doing my part for science.
The interesting question is why your

530
00:28:57,415 --> 00:29:01,465
religious beliefs are suddenly
less important than her dreams.

531
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,183
- You're reversing your argument?
- I know what I believe.

532
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:05,946
I'm just not quite sure
what you believe.

533
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,100
Well, lds doesn't try to dictate
every detail of our lives.

534
00:29:09,192 --> 00:29:12,969
When a situation isn't clear, we're
encouraged to make our own decisions.

535
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,068
But your judgment was to say no.

536
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:18,184
- You used my judgment.
- You made a good argument.

537
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,338
Rational arguments don't usually work
on religious people.

538
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:23,800
Otherwise there would be
no religious people.

539
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:26,681
- You're an atheist.
- Only on christmas and easter.

540
00:29:26,796 --> 00:29:28,780
The rest of the time,
it doesn't really matter?

541
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:32,025
Where's the fun in that?
A finite, unmysterious universe...

542
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:33,484
It's not about fun.

543
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,919
- It's about the truth.
- The truth is, we're having this debate

544
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:39,146
because you want to figure
something out about me.

545
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,780
What do you got so far?

546
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,263
She can't breathe. We need to intubate.

547
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,490
- No.
- At least oxygen.

548
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:52,181
NASA will need to know why.

549
00:30:03,557 --> 00:30:05,536
I checked the tests you ordered.

550
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:09,336
- Did you just see Foreman?
- You measured the density of her teeth.

551
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:12,211
It's a shortcut test for hypercalcemia.

552
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,450
- You had to have just passed him.
- So you suspected hypercalcemia

553
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:17,782
from her complete lack of broken bones.

554
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,364
Is that why you also
ran three tox screens.

555
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:22,593
Patient might've been sneaking uppers.

556
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:24,566
He was in a white coat.
Did you hire him back?

557
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:27,647
Foreman is running the diagnostic
department at New York Mercy.

558
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:36,182
Have you been drinking?

559
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,958
She was having trouble breathing.
Refused oxygen and intubation.

560
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,304
- So you put her on a treadmill.
- Records will show

561
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:07,909
that we gave her oxygen as a part of
a routine cardio stress test.

562
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:11,704
She gets to breathe.
Your boss gets her paperwork.

563
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:13,440
Who's idea was that?

564
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,272
It was a joint decision.

565
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:18,171
It never is.

566
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:22,951
So how old were you
when your brother left home?

567
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:25,539
- Why do you think...
- Why aren't you answering?

568
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:29,381
- Did your mother initiate the divorce?
- We should probably focus

569
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:31,840
- on what's wrong with her lungs.
- Are you a wiccan?

570
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,497
She really can't breathe.

571
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,174
Hold still.

572
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:43,275
- What are you doing?
- Auscultatory percussion.

573
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,795
If you have a good ear, you can...

574
00:31:48,477 --> 00:31:50,527
You didn't have
a lot of friends because you...

575
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:52,654
You can hear while you're talking?

576
00:31:53,305 --> 00:31:58,700
You can detect not only structural
details, but small, deep masses.

577
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,483
Game's over.

578
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:10,130
You either have lung cancer
or tuberous sclerosis.

579
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:13,875
We need to cut you open and biopsy.

580
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:15,847
That'll...

581
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:21,686
Leave a scar. NASA doctors will see.
They'll know.

582
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,352
I never opened for springsteen
or slept with Barbara Feldon.

583
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:28,767
You can live for years without dreams.
Without lungs...

584
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,496
Find a way.

585
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:38,577
As long you keep saying it strongly,
you won't die.

586
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:41,972
Find...

587
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,631
A way.

588
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:49,584
How do we force a patient into surgery?

589
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:51,642
Texas bag scam?

590
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,369
Saratoga wire?

591
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,952
- Paris exposition trip?
- The problem's not the surgery.

592
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,102
It's the scars.

593
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:00,508
And we have a plastic surgeon
here who can hide 'em.

594
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:01,618
Not that well.

595
00:33:01,868 --> 00:33:05,517
- NASA's gonna check every cranny.
- I say we just put ether in her oxygen

596
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:07,593
- and do what we have to do.
- She'll sue.

597
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:08,693
For what?

598
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:11,102
Making it harder for her
to lie to the government?

599
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:13,220
We don't need to hide them.

600
00:33:13,555 --> 00:33:16,088
We give her elective cosmetic surgery.

601
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:18,487
The incisions will give us access
to her lungs

602
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:20,974
and she's got an innocent
explanation for the scars.

603
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,925
- You mean like liposuction.
- No, no.

604
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:29,140
Those incisions are too far from
the lungs. We don't subtract, we add.

605
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:31,748
Turn her "b"s into "c"s.

606
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:37,082
It's a myth that fake hooters blow up
at high altitude.

607
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:38,901
She'll be fine.

608
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:42,560
Just think of it
as one giant rack for mankind.

609
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:46,506
I fought for years
to be taken seriously.

610
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:50,458
Trust me, you'll be taken
more seriously. Just sign the form.

611
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:52,770
This'll make me a joke.

612
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:55,524
There's got to be another way.

613
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,808
I've, known a few people who had dreams.

614
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,118
One thing they all had in common was
they got laughed at

615
00:34:07,616 --> 00:34:09,205
and they didn't care.

616
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,132
You bumped a splenectomy
for a boob job?

617
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:26,225
Would you condemn this woman to a life
where people look at her face

618
00:34:26,253 --> 00:34:27,495
when they talk to her?

619
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:29,895
You don't explain this,
I'll cancel the surgery.

620
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,690
Can I explain why you're here?

621
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,974
Think I just told you why I...

622
00:34:34,013 --> 00:34:36,985
I scheduled a diagnostic patient
for a boob job,

623
00:34:37,124 --> 00:34:40,300
which is ridiculous. So obviously
you had to confront me.

624
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,862
- With you so far.
But I'm gonna give you a reason.

625
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:46,340
- Not a good one.
- No. Not even close to a good one.

626
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,945
But here's the drag
from your point of view.

627
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:52,110
My explanation will make sense.

628
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:56,485
Not to the board. Not to a judge.
But to you. So you'll let me do it.

629
00:34:57,932 --> 00:35:01,566
Then you're gonna have to sit next to me
at the administrative hearing.

630
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,748
Don't you have better things to do?

631
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:16,900
It's in the best interests
of the patient.

632
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,349
Trocar's in. You're good to go.

633
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:32,794
Deflate the lung.

634
00:35:34,214 --> 00:35:35,852
There. A cyst.

635
00:35:36,698 --> 00:35:38,825
Cysts.
I count three of them.

636
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:41,668
Probably the same
if not more on the left lung.

637
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,713
So what's been working overtime to kill
"miss Bin Laden"?

638
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:50,296
- We know her name now.
- Yeah, but I forgot it.

639
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:53,915
Say the magic word and get immunity
from the next challenge.

640
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,645
Alveolar hydatid disease.
Hits all the organs.

641
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:58,637
She would've have multiple
seizures by now.

642
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,990
- Pulmonary langerhans'.
- Doesn't explain the red blood cells.

643
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:06,629
Come on. Cysts.
Synesthesia. Heart attack.

644
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:09,670
<i>- You guys have gotten...
- Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.</i>

645
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,841
<i>Raises red blood cell count.</i>

646
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:14,636
<i>Causes masses on the organs.</i>

647
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:17,364
<i>One of the masses is a pheochromocytoma.<i>

648
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:19,930
<i>It'd cause neurologic
episodes and a heart attack.</i>

649
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:28,961
Do you see a blond guy who still has
peach fuzz standing up there?

650
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:35,822
This is a closed procedure.
Gallery's off limits.

651
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:38,194
<i>Not to the surgical staff.</i>

652
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:42,115
You gonna hire that guy instead of us?

653
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:53,518
Not a chance. I love you guys.

654
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:58,107
Dig out the cysts, histology to confirm
Von Hippel-Lindau.

655
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,407
Don't forget her chesticles.

656
00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:11,965
Calling Arizona.

657
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:14,638
- It was a very nice touch.
- You do have residual...

658
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:17,722
Not only do I not have
residual feelings, I didn't even have

659
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:19,248
- primary feelings.
- You freaked...

660
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:21,611
- You lied.
- Because you knew it meant...

661
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,454
It meant nothing!
I saw him 'cause he was there.

662
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:28,537
Cameron follow her beshert
to the surgery department?

663
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,036
I think Chase followed her.

664
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,690
She's been a senior attending
in the ER, the last three weeks.

665
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:35,124
A blonde senior attending,
to be accurate.

666
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:37,418
Foreman.
Is he back in neurology?

667
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:39,879
He's at New York Mercy.
He's been there a month.

668
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:43,344
- Did you "see" Foreman?
- No.

669
00:37:48,364 --> 00:37:49,381
So...

670
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:50,936
I'm cured.

671
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:52,755
You're fine for now.
But Von Hippel-Lindau

672
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:54,951
is a genetic disease. There's no cure.

673
00:37:56,355 --> 00:37:59,495
Greta, you need to come clean to NASA.

674
00:38:00,302 --> 00:38:03,412
- You said you got all the cysts.
- They could reemerge.

675
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:07,908
I'll go to radiology clinics.
I'll get regular screenings.

676
00:38:07,956 --> 00:38:10,124
If something happened
while you're up there,

677
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:11,981
you'd be playing
Russian roulette with...

678
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,023
Relax.

679
00:38:14,354 --> 00:38:16,649
She doesn't have to tell,
neither do you.

680
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,667
Turns out that NASA doctors
even know where the hyphen

681
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,349
in Von Hippel-Lindau goes.

682
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:25,250
You called them?

683
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,404
I'm not an idiot.
Those shuttles fly over New Jersey.

684
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:43,650
<i>So here we are.</i>

685
00:38:44,169 --> 00:38:45,242
<i>The big moment.</i>

686
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:48,405
Which of you gets to live
to be abused another day.

687
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:51,928
And which of you goes home
and rationalizes being fired

688
00:38:51,982 --> 00:38:54,123
as character building?

689
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:04,398
Following numbers, thanks for playing.
21, 19, 8,

690
00:39:04,772 --> 00:39:07,890
34, 17,

691
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,941
29, 5,

692
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,560
36, 2.

693
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,810
Rest of you, 8:00 AM Sharp.

694
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:19,739
I'll be in sometime between
10:00 and 3:00.

695
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,471
But 26, stick around a while.

696
00:39:27,673 --> 00:39:29,720
I did nothing wrong.

697
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:32,828
- Lots of people did nothing wrong.
- Other people screwed up.

698
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:35,485
- I never even...
- Other people took chances.

699
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,208
26.

700
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:43,193
Buddy Ebsen
actually wasn't allergic to...

701
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:46,414
- Yeah, I know. How old are you?
- 21

702
00:39:47,034 --> 00:39:50,141
- You don't think it's relevant.
- I'll likely have less time

703
00:39:50,214 --> 00:39:53,503
to use the skills you teach us, but
I don't think that's significant to you.

704
00:39:53,566 --> 00:39:56,477
How about the fact that you
never went to medical school,

705
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:01,069
which is why you let the unlucky number
do the trans echo?

706
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:04,806
At least you're ethically unethical.

707
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,943
30 years I worked in the
Columbia med school admissions office.

708
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:15,441
Audited all the classes.
Most of them more than once.

709
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:18,464
I just never got a diploma.

710
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:22,295
You had to know
I'd find out sooner or later.

711
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:25,492
I know you break rules.

712
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,488
I thought maybe you'd break one for me.

713
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,714
I can't hire you as a doctor,

714
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:35,681
but you can still tell me
what you think.

715
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:38,563
You can also fetch me coffee,
pick up my dry-cleaning,

716
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:40,920
until I can decide
whether or not to keep you.

717
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:43,342
So I'm playing this whole game
to be like...

718
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:45,126
Your secretary?

719
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:47,756
Assistant sounds
marginally less demeaning.

720
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:50,285
It's not my dream job.

721
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:54,078
Actually, it is.
It's just not your dream title.

722
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,757
Three weeks. For someone who never
misses something small,

723
00:41:23,832 --> 00:41:25,207
you missed something big.

724
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:28,818
You're an idiot.

725
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,105
- The hair, where I'm working, or both?
- The hair makes you look like a hooker.

726
00:41:34,776 --> 00:41:35,786
I like it.

727
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:39,778
Pulling pieces of windshield
out of car accident victims.

728
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,431
Reattaching fingertips
sliced off cutting bagels.

729
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,940
At least chase's move
is only one step down.

730
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:50,198
I can do good here.
Get it out of my system.

731
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:55,588
Why'd you rat your patient out to NASA?

732
00:41:56,302 --> 00:41:59,274
I don't know who's been gossiping
about ethics instead of sex,

733
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:01,363
but I hope they've already been fired.

734
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,865
- Which number was it?
- Greta.

735
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,335
- Number.
- No number. The patient.

736
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:08,179
How do you think she got
your pager number?

737
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:10,081
She came into the ER,
didn't want to talk.

738
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:12,588
- I didn't rat her out.
- You lied?

739
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:16,273
Suppose I should tell her that
before she keys my car.

740
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,320
- Why lie?
- Had to stop some leaking faucets.

741
00:42:21,287 --> 00:42:22,686
What did it matter?

742
00:42:23,822 --> 00:42:25,512
It was no one's business.

743
00:42:26,482 --> 00:42:27,485
Right.

744
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:30,141
She's gonna be
the safest astronaut up there.

745
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:33,409
Certainly more vigilant than
the guy next to her who's got no clue

746
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:35,522
about the aneurysm in his head
ready to pop.

747
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:36,625
Right.

748
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:39,775
You got a better reason?

749
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:44,874
You couldn't kill her dream.
