1
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:09,902
Sure, let's give up now.

2
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:12,027
It's no big deal.
It's just Pharmacide.

3
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:13,582
Just their tour kickoff.

4
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:17,405
I mean, who cares if we miss
the most insane party in the world?

5
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:24,828
Come on, Phoeb.

6
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:26,303
Victory or death.

7
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:27,957
Or possibly cake.

8
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:31,772
Look, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,886
Sorry, your caffeine fix
is on its way.

10
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,376
Will you hold on?

11
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:40,414
We're the DJ's assistants.

12
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:50,865
Hold on.

13
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,931
- I said we both work for him.
- You mean her.

14
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:58,808
The DJ's a she-jay.

15
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:01,487
It's okay, Dave.

16
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:03,389
She's my "plus one".

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,090
Make that "plus two".

18
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,215
You weren't worried, were you?

19
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:23,291
And there will be punishment
unless you tell us everything.

20
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,001
You've been here all night?

21
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,753
After the party, we went up
to the presidential suite with the band.

22
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,485
It was ginormous.
Like, ten rooms.

23
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,516
We had a few drinks and some weed

24
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,760
and played <i>Drummer god</i>
on this giant plasma TV.

25
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,929
Which she rocked, by the way.

26
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,989
- I think I hate you right now.
- Colt took me up to the roof,

27
00:01:40,114 --> 00:01:42,410
but by then the gate
to the pool was locked.

28
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,017
So no one was up there.

29
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:46,264
So we just climbed over

30
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,232
and jumped down and...

31
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,231
went skinny dipping.

32
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:54,614
Did you do it?

33
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:57,268
He was so sweet.

34
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,494
Later, he played his guitar,
and he wrote a song for me.

35
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:05,958
Oh, my God!

36
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:08,836
Jord, what happened to your foot?

37
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,931
Maybe you twisted
your ankle when you jumped.

38
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:12,632
Or it could be your allergies.

39
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,425
My aunt was allergic,

40
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,744
and her hands swelled up
like the marshmallow man's.

41
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:19,263
Are you okay?

42
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:26,305
.:: La Fabrique ::.

43
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,273
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

44
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,205
Arrow

45
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:35,240
Benj

46
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:38,452
Olaola

47
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,580
Foreman expects me to read an x-ray
on this itty-bitty screen.

48
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,850
He should have emailed me
a larger phone.

49
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:06,709
Why are you packing?

50
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,774
We're leaving for the conference
on pharmacology and public policy.

51
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,401
- We?
- We discussed this.

52
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,028
- It's been on your calendar for weeks.
- So has Ramadan.

53
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,724
Think of it as a vacation.

54
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,799
Nice, healthy Adirondack air.

55
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:22,702
Or not. I don't care.
You're coming with.

56
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,276
You should come with me.

57
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,414
State pillow fighting championships.

58
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,463
Dollar beers, wet t-shirts.

59
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:32,128
In the words of Eddie Money,
I've got two tickets to paradise.

60
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:35,006
When you moved in I promised
your therapist I'd be here for you.

61
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:38,654
I can't be here if I'm there.
Unless you're there too.

62
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,079
- So it's not a discussion.
- Fine.

63
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,923
I'll let Foreman know
that the 16-year-old patient

64
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:45,742
with severe edema can wait.

65
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,907
Relax. I've got no idea
what's wrong with her.

66
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:50,979
So odds are, not fatal.

67
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,083
Still not going!

68
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:57,737
She's got rhabdo.

69
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:01,223
Who wants to come
to the pillow fighting championships?

70
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:04,118
Rutgers has got a great team this year.
I'm glad their anchor didn't turn pro.

71
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:07,723
A 16-year-old girl suddenly
has the joints of an 80-year-old.

72
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,748
- You think we can discuss this?
- It's rhabdo.

73
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:13,662
The patient gave you the answer.
She fell down and went boom.

74
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,975
We have to leave in an hour,
so should we eenie-meenie?

75
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,217
The fall'd explain the lower leg damage,
but not the swollen hands.

76
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,846
Hard landing caused crushed muscles.
It release toxins into the blood stream.

77
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:26,724
Toxins caused swelling
in the hands and legs.

78
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,851
Just another way of saying
it's rhabdo.

79
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,975
- 59 minutes.
- She's a credit card kid.

80
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,356
Her parents are architects.
A project in Shanghai.

81
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:38,069
Could you be sitting any further away
from Chase and be in the same room?

82
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:41,614
It doesn't have to be that. The swelling
could be caused by deep vein thrombosis.

83
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,823
She has allergies.

84
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,270
Could be anaphylaxis
or some heart condition that we don't...

85
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:48,120
It can't really be
any of those things since it's rhabdo.

86
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:51,082
I know it's rhabdo.
Foreman knows it's rhabdo.

87
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:53,672
Deep in his heart,
even Chase knows it's rhabdo.

88
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:56,921
Isn't it annoying when everybody
in the room knows something you don't?

89
00:04:58,235 --> 00:04:59,985
I'll test for everything.

90
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:07,483
He's an ass.

91
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,049
Contrast is ready.

92
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,101
She already thinks I'm cheating.

93
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,540
Maybe this is his way
of telling you to talk to her.

94
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:16,816
Sure. How was your day, honey?
By the way, I killed someone.

95
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:19,478
If I tell her,

96
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,320
that's dumping a burden
on her forever.

97
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,313
No sign of obstructions or clots.

98
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:44,594
- Tell me what you came here for.
- I've got a legitimate medical reason.

99
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:46,220
You must be so proud.

100
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:49,208
I've forgotten it.

101
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,437
I guess it's no big deal,
since I was only using it as an excuse

102
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,270
to come check out Patty and Selma.

103
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,982
I feel bad.
I haven't named your testicles.

104
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:01,772
Word on the street is
you set a new personal best for low-cut.

105
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,689
I don't know why you chose to give them
the names of somebody's aunts.

106
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:07,283
It's a compliment.
They're always smokin'.

107
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:09,628
Oh, I remember.

108
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,627
I need you to authorize
the medical discharge of a minor.

109
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,114
That's why I'm holding this
in my hand.

110
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:19,545
I haven't finished testing yet,
but it's rh...

111
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,091
Your outbox
is three times normal size.

112
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,881
It's not a metaphor.

113
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:29,900
There's a lot to be done
before the weekend.

114
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:32,075
You could take the papers home.

115
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:34,851
Unless you're not gonna be home.

116
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,981
Unless you were, for example,
going to a medical conference.

117
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:40,900
I'm driving up with Wilson.

118
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,319
- Me too.
- You aren't on the registration list.

119
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,133
I love that you checked.

120
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:47,156
- But Wilson said...
- That I have a case?

121
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,532
You're authorizing
the discharge right now.

122
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,636
That was a metaphor.

123
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:05,466
Busy right now.

124
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,425
Is he dying?

125
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,403
In the next ten minutes?

126
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,307
Unfortunately, no.

127
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,076
He's in a lot of pain.

128
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,480
I've thought about it. You're right.
I should go to the conference.

129
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:21,982
You found out Cuddy's going.

130
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:23,813
God, no.

131
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:26,320
She'll ruin everything.

132
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,966
We leave in two hours.

133
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,760
Please... Morphine.

134
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,253
I'm right here.

135
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,270
I'm right here, Joseph.

136
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,754
Two days away.

137
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:55,433
- You think I should pack ball-y?
- You can't leave.

138
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:58,603
You lit a fuse.
You need to watch the bomb go off.

139
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:02,527
The bomb was gonna go off on its own
if you kept quiet.

140
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:04,859
So now you either have
to come up with a convincing lie,

141
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,528
or tell her the truth.
Your choice.

142
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,904
- CK levels point to rhabdo.
- Of course.

143
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:15,286
Except for the part where imaging
shows no sign of muscle crush.

144
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,910
I'm your doctor.

145
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:34,972
This is Lars Ulrich,

146
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:38,142
the greatest metal drummer of all-time.
You know the song?

147
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:39,977
Good.

148
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:41,312
Drumstick.

149
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:43,786
Another drumstick.

150
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:46,795
I want you to rock out to the music
the way you did last night.

151
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:51,030
Go on.
This is a classic medical test.

152
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:52,697
Hippocrates used it.

153
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,866
Let's go.

154
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:02,458
Come on, you've gotta keep time!
Cross over on the high hat.

155
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,253
Let's head bang!

156
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:08,714
What are you doing?

157
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,175
The chart said her potassium's low.

158
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,469
Rhabdo elevates the potassium.

159
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:15,143
And monkey drums.

160
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,458
Ergo...

161
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,893
The levels must've been really low
last night.

162
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,319
Which causes...

163
00:09:25,153 --> 00:09:26,553
I can't move them.

164
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:30,945
Temporary muscle paralysis.

165
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,406
Given this rate of muscle fatigue,

166
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,409
she couldn't have climbed stairs
and then a fence to the pool.

167
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,454
Low potassium means no jump,
means no trauma.

168
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:42,989
Tests mean "yes rhabdo".

169
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:45,364
Ergo, something else
caused both the rhabdo

170
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:47,089
and the low potassium.

171
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:48,479
This time...

172
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,677
start by getting
an accurate history.

173
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:51,852
Be careful.

174
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:54,151
Our patient's a big fat liar.

175
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,431
What did you really do last night?

176
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:01,183
We need to find the cause
of your low potassium.

177
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,934
You could have a kidney disorder,
leukemia, adenoma.

178
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,979
We need to know
about any drugs or alcohol.

179
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:08,557
Anything that might have
threatened your health.

180
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:09,942
Come on, Jord.

181
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:15,055
We didn't spend the night
with the band.

182
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,418
You can't tell our friends.

183
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:20,493
Have you heard of <i>Stiletto:
warrior queen of space</i>?

184
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,997
- It's a comic book right?
- Thank you.

185
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,082
And a freaking amazing
new sci-fi series.

186
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,960
- They're filming the motion picture.
- It's a prequel.

187
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,963
The other girls wouldn't get it.

188
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:33,311
Only Phoebe understands my passion.

189
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,438
Only Phoebe understands
the bushido of the heel.

190
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,640
So what actually happened
last night?

191
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,089
We were with our friends

192
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,645
trying to get into the Pharmacide tour
party at the Adams.

193
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:49,147
And then I found out
that Jeffrey Keener's gonna be there.

194
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:52,006
I follow his tweets.

195
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,280
It's tragic
that I have to explain this.

196
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,135
He's the creator of <i>Stiletto</i>
issue number one.

197
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,076
And the TV show.

198
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:11,135
He's a god.

199
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,883
So did you guys go up to him?

200
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:15,092
God, no.

201
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:16,716
We keep a ten-foot rule.

202
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:20,012
It's not stalking if you don't go up
to the person and bother them.

203
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:22,264
So we just followed him around.

204
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,406
Discreetly.

205
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:26,014
He ditched after half an hour
and went down to the hotel restaurant

206
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:27,227
for a late dinner.

207
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,229
- And you went with him?
- Discreetly.

208
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,265
We played it so cool.

209
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:38,406
For two hours, we lived his life.

210
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,533
We did everything he did.

211
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:42,618
Ate the exact same meal he ate.

212
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:44,774
Cool.

213
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,768
The rest of their story checks out.

214
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:49,830
The hotel manager says Mom and Dad
were charged for food and a room,

215
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:52,442
three pay-per-view episodes
of <i>Stiletto</i>.

216
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,193
Are you trying to kill yourself?

217
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:56,132
It's from the same batch
the girls ate.

218
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,302
They ate what he ate. And what a hundred
other healthy people ate.

219
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,570
Dig in.
Lunch is on the Adams.

220
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,050
What if food is the answer?

221
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,309
Not this food. Any food.

222
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:09,773
Jordan says she ate all of this.
She's 16, all about body image,

223
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:11,960
and she obviously worries
about fitting in.

224
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:13,815
Bulimia would account
for her symptoms.

225
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,651
A barium swallow
for Mallory Weiss tears,

226
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,697
start her on nutritional supplements,
get a psych consult.

227
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,621
Why are you reading
my program guide?

228
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:26,120
It's not like you plan
on attending any of the presentations.

229
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:29,346
I like to know
how much boredom I'm missing.

230
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,091
"Patient perceptions
of complications

231
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:35,295
"in end-stage chemotherapy."

232
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,752
You didn't tell me
you were giving a paper.

233
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:40,217
- And that was wrong?
- Last time you presented a paper,

234
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,428
you gave me an advance copy
and asked for feedback.

235
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:46,098
And you're wondering why I wouldn't
want to repeat that experience?

236
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,268
Oh, look!
An '80s party.

237
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:53,474
When you think you left seagulls
behind in your rearview mirror,

238
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,566
suddenly it's up ahead
like an undead hitchhiker.

239
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:57,224
Cuddy's going.

240
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:03,193
- Did you pack my leg warmers?
- If you want her...

241
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:05,221
ask her out.

242
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:06,638
My God, man!

243
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:09,394
She's not some floozy in a bar.

244
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:11,749
She's the floozy I work for.

245
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:14,752
Gotta be no radical steps here.
Gotta be subtle.

246
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:18,756
We happened to attend the same party.
The chat happens to turn personal.

247
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,175
Like the frog
in gradually boiling water.

248
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:22,542
Exactly.

249
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,011
She'll be red and delicious
before she knows it.

250
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,810
What could possibly go wrong?

251
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,189
Chase went to the gym
5 times this week.

252
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:37,900
One time I followed him.

253
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,189
- What?
- I followed him.

254
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:43,572
I know how humiliating
that admission is.

255
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,996
- Where'd he go?
- The gym, that time.

256
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:50,079
- But something's...
- Stop right there.</i>

257
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:53,040
This is a conversation you should have
with him, not me.

258
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:55,167
I've tried having this conversation.

259
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:57,878
No sign of tears.
It's not bulimia.

260
00:13:58,227 --> 00:13:59,597
Is he having an affair?

261
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:05,678
- Why should I believe you?
- You shouldn't. You should believe him.

262
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:10,962
Baby, how are you?

263
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:15,563
- Jordan!
- Normal sinus rhythm.

264
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,732
- Heart rate's fine.
- BP's dropping.

265
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,039
What's happening?

266
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:20,693
- No pulse.
- My God!

267
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:23,315
You said her heart rate was fine.

268
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,281
Cardiac tamponade.
Drain the fluid now.

269
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,860
What is going on?

270
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:30,490
She's bleeding around her heart.

271
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,417
Blood constricted her heart muscle.

272
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,862
She's on antiarrhythmics,

273
00:14:37,987 --> 00:14:40,285
but we don't know
how long we can keep her stable.

274
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,790
<i>Seemed to be triggered by stress.
Her parents had just...</i>

275
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,926
Did her BP drop
during the barium swallow?

276
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:46,761
To 50 systolic in three minutes.

277
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,387
Rules out chronic conditions.

278
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,298
Acute conditions
limit us to toxins, infections.

279
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,566
Could be anything.

280
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:56,191
A gas leak, arsenic in the wallpaper,
fungus in the shower.

281
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:58,720
I'll get samples
from her room and the restaurant.

282
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,274
<i>Talk to our gossip girl.</i>

283
00:15:00,637 --> 00:15:02,276
You need to know where she's been

284
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,796
and what she's done
in the last 24 hours.

285
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,210
I think...

286
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:16,499
Welcome to the convention,
Dr. Perlmutter.

287
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:18,854
It's my 25th consecutive year.

288
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,202
Perlmutter loves the '80s.

289
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:37,728
- Do you need me to leave too?
- You might remember stuff she doesn't.

290
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,273
We didn't do anything
we haven't told you about.

291
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,316
We hung out at Jordan's all day.

292
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:45,152
And then we called a limo
to go into the city.

293
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,989
We stopped
at Bruce Springsteen's house.

294
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,890
Don't joke around.

295
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,913
You're really sick.
Just tell him the truth.

296
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,624
Bruce let me play

297
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,835
the first electric guitar
he ever owned.

298
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,253
Why are you lying?

299
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,801
How can you not believe me?

300
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,017
Turn to your right.

301
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,439
- Mr Keener, I appreciate you coming.
- It's not that much of a hike.

302
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,390
My room's only six floors up.

303
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,943
Last night, do you remember two girls,
about 16?

304
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,343
That table right there.

305
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:30,455
They made an impression.

306
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,450
You notice
the giggling and the staring.

307
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,545
That must happen to you a lot.

308
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:37,079
I'm sure that happens to you
a lot more.

309
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,078
She can't control it.

310
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,887
A bleed is affecting her thalamus,
causing her to lie.

311
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:50,518
We need to know everything.

312
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,094
You two were never apart?

313
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:55,756
Except
for when she went to go get ice.

314
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,516
That couldn't have been very long.

315
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,727
- You don't know?
- It was the middle of the night.

316
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,615
I woke up
when she came back into the room.

317
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,732
She told you she went to get ice?

318
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:30,716
1980s.

319
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:34,214
You sure?
They weren't specific.

320
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:37,198
How much did it cost you
to rent that?

321
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,599
It was in Wilson's bag.

322
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:40,607
Dr. Perlmutter.

323
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,979
I read your article
on neural degeneration.

324
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:45,472
You didn't take that seriously,
did you?

325
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,066
I wrote that for the money.

326
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:52,364
Well, hey there, Jane Fonda.
Would you care to dancercize?

327
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,920
Sorry,
we were just about to hit the floor.

328
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,641
Thank you.

329
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:59,691
- Your leg?
- I'm okay.

330
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:02,777
As long as you don't expect rhythm.

331
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:25,216
You remember
the last time we danced?

332
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,087
Med school, the week we met.

333
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,278
I saw you in endocrinology.

334
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,567
Tracked you down to the hoedown.

335
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:37,558
I meant, we met before that.

336
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,033
In the bookstore.

337
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:46,596
My third day of school,

338
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,270
I hand my syllabus
to the guy behind the counter.

339
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,095
He barely looks at me,
Just skims the sheet

340
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,276
and tells me I'm overly ambitious,
I have a chip on my shoulder,

341
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,101
and I know how to party.

342
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:01,207
I'd forgotten you knew how to party.

343
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,726
I said, "You're making that up".

344
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,754
And you said,
"Your class schedule is overloaded,

345
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,006
"but none of your classes
are before 11:00,

346
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:12,097
"and no one
takes professor Lamb's course

347
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:13,985
"unless they have something
to prove".

348
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,745
Because professor Siegal
covered the same ground

349
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,115
and was the easier grader.

350
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,733
I tracked you down.

351
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,338
Endocrinology...

352
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:23,085
The party...

353
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:25,581
One thing led to another.

354
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:28,459
And then it didn't.

355
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:32,561
I was gonna call you.

356
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,416
Don't do that.

357
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:37,963
There was no expectations.
I was just as into...

358
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:39,838
I was gonna come see you.

359
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:43,307
Figure out where things
would go from there.

360
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,227
When I got the call from the dean

361
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,243
and I was expelled
from my first med school,

362
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:49,960
There didn't seem any point.

363
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:57,137
I should go to my room
and review papers

364
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,412
for the infectious disease panel.

365
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:10,527


366
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:23,765
Thanks for telling me.

367
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,287
7:00 in the morning.

368
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,388
Somebody better be dead.

369
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,248
My patient, Joseph Schultz.

370
00:20:43,085 --> 00:20:44,785
Under the circumstances,

371
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,294
isn't it the best
that could've happened?

372
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,756
I just wish I had been there.

373
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,487
Didn't hear you come in last night.

374
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:56,839
Yes, and it was almost 9:30.

375
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:58,758
Things didn't go as you planned?

376
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,950
We've moved on to a new phase.

377
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,632
I tell Cuddy
I've always been interested in her,

378
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:07,308
- And she walks out.
- Either she just wasn't ready for that,

379
00:21:08,742 --> 00:21:11,938
or maybe she was just surprised
and didn't know how to react.

380
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:17,443
- What are you doing?
- Interesting reflex of guilt just now.

381
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,654
Your patient's been dying
for six weeks.

382
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:22,781
You couldn't have predicted
he'd go this weekend.

383
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:24,421
Or could you?

384
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:33,514
"Euthanasia.

385
00:21:34,248 --> 00:21:35,628
"Let's tell the truth.

386
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:37,259
"We all do it."

387
00:21:38,902 --> 00:21:40,199
Great opening line.

388
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,635
Are you insane?

389
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,976
I didn't want your notes before,

390
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:47,929
and I don't want 'em now.

391
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,900
Well, she didn't get ice.

392
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,988
She got out in the lobby.
She could have gone anywhere.

393
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,984
Let's start with for how long.
Fast forward.

394
00:22:07,398 --> 00:22:08,202
Stop.

395
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:09,453
Rewind.</i>

396
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:10,824
Back.

397
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:14,500
Wherever she went,
she was only gone for five minutes.

398
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,837
- She's holding something.
- Keener's journal.

399
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,714
He left it in the restaurant.

400
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,174
She went back, claimed it was hers.</i>

401
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:24,385
She wanted an excuse
to knock on his door.

402
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,143
I know what you're gonna say.

403
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:33,857
I'm not insane.

404
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:36,602
Doctors are rarely indicted.

405
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,166
I was just thinking of your career.

406
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:45,716
But yeah, if you're one of the doctors
occasionally indicted,

407
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:47,825
it could affect that.

408
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,479
Someone needs to say

409
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:52,997
what life is really like now
for people who are dying.

410
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:56,494
What doctors have to go through,
the decisions we have to make.

411
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:57,877
Alone, without guidance.

412
00:22:58,547 --> 00:23:00,201
Someone should say that...

413
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:02,506
In an unsigned letter to <i>The Times</i>.

414
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,464
I'd be telling the truth.
Saying what we're all thinking.

415
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:06,589
Who cares?

416
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,147
Oncology department
is subsidized by drug companies.

417
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:12,183
- They don't want it run by a murderer.
- We're all murderers.

418
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:15,070
- We don't have the guts to admit...
- Again, who cares?

419
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:17,195
You won't be hirable anywhere.

420
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,299
If there's one thing
I've learned from you,

421
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:22,301
it's that I should do
what I think is right

422
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:24,368
and not worry
about the consequences.

423
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:30,326
Yeah, it's worked out great for me.

424
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:44,632
I'm expecting a notes call from LA,
can we make this quick?

425
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,726
Jordan came to your room
the other night?

426
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:49,387
Let me put it another way.
We know she did.

427
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:52,890
Look, I've tried to be helpful.

428
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,726
I don't know why you wanna pretend
I'm lying to you,

429
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,267
- but it's getting too weird.
- We must search your room.

430
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,807
You don't,
because she was never here.

431
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:02,876
Allison, calm down.

432
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:06,410
You'd cover your ass
at the expense of someone's life?

433
00:24:06,535 --> 00:24:08,215
We know she brought up your journal.

434
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:15,849
That was helpful.

435
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,208
He'd be crazy to risk his marriage
for a one-night stand.

436
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,413
With a teenager!

437
00:24:20,538 --> 00:24:23,170
Sensible people risk their marriage
for something more serious?

438
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:25,339
I'm not having an affair.

439
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:28,045
- We're talking about Keener.
- Fine.

440
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:30,870
He doesn't care about his marriage,
what about his career?

441
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:34,521
- Statutory rape would ruin it.
- Admitting statutory rape could.

442
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:36,943
Which is why
we'll never hear the truth out of him.

443
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:40,563
Rufies OD explains all her symptoms.
We should treat her with flumazenil.

444
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,778
- Isn't the MRSA panel going on?
- We got kicked out. She started crying.

445
00:24:49,342 --> 00:24:52,339
Discussions of urinary catheterization
will do that to me too.

446
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:54,150
The babysitter had an emergency.

447
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,206
How did you like '80s night?

448
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,634
House talked with you?

449
00:25:02,244 --> 00:25:04,144
I was being subtle about it.

450
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,088
You left suddenly.

451
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,424
I know House can be

452
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,940
- a little much sometimes.
- No, he was sweet.

453
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:13,012
I know better than to rely on that.

454
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,311
He's trying.

455
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:18,101
I know.

456
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:20,853
I'm a mother now.

457
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:24,315
I need a guy I can count on
every single day.

458
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:27,068
That's never been House.

459
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,004


460
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:34,784
It's not rufies.

461
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,756
She's bleeding behind her kidneys.

462
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,171
We're transfusing
another two units packed red cells,

463
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:41,958
- She keeps springing leaks.
- It looks like a toxic reaction.

464
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,795
- Keener must have given her something.
- He's a comic book writer,

465
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:47,062
not a drug dealer.

466
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:49,323
A lot wouldn't show up
in a standard tox screen.

467
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:51,187
But he's never gonna tell the truth.

468
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:53,893
Not gonna get the truth
out of her either.

469
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,665
We will if we drug her.

470
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:03,113
Amobarbital would suppress
her thalamus.

471
00:26:03,238 --> 00:26:04,689
She's on antiarrhythmics.

472
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:06,315
It could stop her heart.

473
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:07,774
She's already dying.

474
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,730
You're angry at me.

475
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,344
You're taking it out on this guy
'cause you think he's lying to you too

476
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:16,611
and you're gonna kill her
in the process.

477
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:21,455
- We need to know the truth.
- We should call House.

478
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:24,834
He'll recommend
we take the cautious approach.

479
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:33,446
Pretzel?

480
00:26:33,571 --> 00:26:36,345
Those are gonna show up
on my credit card, at seven bucks a bag.

481
00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:38,666
There's an all-you-can-eat
buffet downstairs.

482
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:41,521
Studies show
that $10 wine tastes better

483
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:43,628
If you're told that it costs $90.

484
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,835
I'm sure the same thing
must be true of grape soda.

485
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:48,608
Have one.

486
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,464
We can toast
your pending unemployment.

487
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,937
Yes, you can sit here
running up my hotel bill,

488
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:06,542
Or you can go
get the woman of your dreams.

489
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:09,768
I didn't know Angela Merkel
was attending the conference.

490
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,318
I just spoke with Cuddy.

491
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:15,843
She doesn't think you're reliable.
And you will remain friend-zoned

492
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:17,691
Until that changes.

493
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:21,698
I can't convince her that I've changed
my entire personality in a weekend.

494
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,018
Yeah, but you could make
the first step.

495
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,916
- What does she need?
- Today, a babysitter.

496
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:34,411
- What are you thinking about?
- Fjords.

497
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,490
You see?
Seriously.

498
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:39,116
 This is out of your comfort zone,

499
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,404
But don't scheme.
Don't...

500
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:43,120
Do the deed...

501
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,453
You tell me that I've gotta show her
I've changed,

502
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:47,333
and you act like I can't.

503
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:50,690
If I can't convince
my best friend...

504
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:52,906
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

505
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,936
I didn't mean...

506
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,344
I didn't mean...

507
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:04,892
You drugged me.

508
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:10,231
She's better off without you.

509
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:18,072
Words can hurt, you know.

510
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,123
I thought truth serum was only stuff
they gave people in lame spy movies.

511
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:27,507
We know you're scared.
But we know you want to tell the truth.

512
00:28:27,632 --> 00:28:29,000
We're gonna help you.

513
00:28:29,553 --> 00:28:32,211
<i>What happened between you
and Jeffrey Keener?</i>

514
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:39,329
I couldn't believe
he even talked to me.

515
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:44,033
I told him
how much his work means to me.

516
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:49,870
I figured I must sound like a moron.

517
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,459
But he was nice about it.

518
00:28:53,462 --> 00:28:55,390
He said I was special.

519
00:28:57,165 --> 00:28:58,362
Heart rate's increasing.

520
00:28:58,818 --> 00:29:00,509
140's acceptable.
Let her talk.

521
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:02,325
<i>Did he give you anything?</i>

522
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,659
A drink, pills?

523
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:05,549
He said it was ecstasy.

524
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:09,582
But it didn't look like ecstasy,
and it didn't really make me feel

525
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,742
<i>how ecstasy usually does.</i>

526
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:13,736
How did it make you feel?

527
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:15,796
It just made me really tired.

528
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:18,544
What did it look like?
A capsule? Tablet?

529
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:21,151
It was a tablet.
Round.

530
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:22,650
Could be lithium.

531
00:29:23,354 --> 00:29:25,254
He just started touching me.

532
00:29:26,227 --> 00:29:27,814
At first it seemed nice.

533
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:29,583
But then...

534
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,355
I didn't want to insult him.

535
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:34,151
<i>That's enough.</i>

536
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:38,903
I'm so sorry.

537
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:43,458
I love you guys so much,
and I just...

538
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:46,452
I feel like I've let you down.

539
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:49,789
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

540
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,914
Before you do that, look here.

541
00:29:53,349 --> 00:29:55,840
Increased periorbital
blood flow throughout.

542
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:58,339
Everything she's been saying
has been a lie.

543
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:02,179
Everything?

544
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,595
So you still don't know
what's wrong?

545
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:07,913
Sorry.

546
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:15,992
I thought you were room service.

547
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:18,369
Something going on
with your patient?

548
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,403
It's quiet in there.

549
00:30:20,572 --> 00:30:21,922
Is Rachel asleep?

550
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:25,865
I thought maybe
you could use a babysitter.

551
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:31,580
Actually, I've got her
in day care downstairs.

552
00:30:34,568 --> 00:30:35,394
Great.

553
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:37,397
Maybe later.

554
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:00,151
Hey, Lucas.

555
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:02,403
This is awkward.

556
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:03,909
A bit.

557
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,750
That awkwardness
would probably go away if I left.

558
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,034


559
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:30,973
It's Foreman. I'm trying
to update House, but his phone's off.

560
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:36,604
Not here.

561
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,125
Patient's losing blood faster
than we can transfuse.

562
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,944
Wefound out Keener travels with a dog,
we're treating for rickettsia.

563
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:46,121
- <i>Any idea where he is?</i>
- Oh, no!

564
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,705
I was supposed to be giving
a paper five minutes ago.

565
00:31:54,938 --> 00:31:58,942
Dr. Wilson has asked me
to tender his apologies for his absence.

566
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:01,420
You'll be hearing my paper instead.

567
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,216
Unfortunately, there wasn't time
to correct the program schedule.

568
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:06,706
Euthanasia:

569
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:09,887
Let's tell the truth.

570
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:12,609
We all do it.

571
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,810
We just don't talk about it.
We play the game.

572
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,436
We use other words

573
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:19,313
or any words at all.

574
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,177
Nice phrasing.

575
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:31,021
I don't know what department I want.

576
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,688
I need...

577
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:35,937
pants.

578
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:37,202
Patient S...

579
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,056
a 55-year-old man.

580
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,772
End-stage lung cancer.

581
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,839
His pain was beyond the point
where we could even pretend to treat it.

582
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,336
I showed him how to use
the morphine pump.

583
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,677
I told him
too much morphine would kill him,

584
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,308
but not to worry.

585
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:53,642
The machine only gives out so much.

586
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:56,726
To override it
you need to enter a special code.

587
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:59,519
I went to the door
and told the nurse,

588
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,440
"The code is 328."

589
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,624
I said it loudly.

590
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:09,046
When he first came to my office,

591
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:12,106
I told him I would be with him
every step of the way.

592
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,995
But I left him alone at the end.

593
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:17,974
I broke that promise

594
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,268
To cover my ass, I failed...

595
00:33:32,925 --> 00:33:34,626
I was wrong when I wrote that.

596
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:38,474
I've never given any less
than my best.

597
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,210
I am incapable of turning away
from a responsibility.

598
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:46,002
My friends...

599
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:49,695
take advantage of that fact
far too often.

600
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:53,658
I know that I gave that man
everything I could.

601
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,728
And I know that he knew that too.

602
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:01,630
This is a burden

603
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:04,293
no one should have to carry alone.

604
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:08,038
And this is a decision
no one should make alone.

605
00:34:09,156 --> 00:34:12,264
Because frankly,
I don't trust all of you.

606
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:14,637
Doctor. Doctor.

607
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:18,124
Question...

608
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:20,283
Excuse me, doctor.

609
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,329
Not many people
would have your courage.

610
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,531
Thank you, Dr. Perlmutter.

611
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,121
Before I start shouting,

612
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:43,499
Foreman says
they're looking at rickettsia.

613
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,532
Thanks for the message.

614
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,452
- Continue.
- What the hell?

615
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:50,561
That little shout-out is gonna make me
forget that you drugged me,

616
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:52,595
Hid my pants, stole my speech?

617
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:55,251
You wanted the paper out there,
it's out there.

618
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:56,875
And your job is safe.

619
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,310
That was my paper.

620
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,836
You don't ask what I want,
you ignore my wishes,

621
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,927
you drug me.

622
00:35:02,052 --> 00:35:04,437
I'm waiting for you to name
something new to our relationship.

623
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,064
You've got no good reason
to be angry with me.

624
00:35:07,432 --> 00:35:09,442
Really?
I should be thanking you?

625
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:12,403
If this was about getting
the story out there, then yeah.

626
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:14,572
If this is about something else...

627
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,556
Maybe you feeling impotent
because patients keep dying

628
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,619
And you need to make
some stupid gesture.

629
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:21,182
To be a hero,

630
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,290
Sorry, I did screw it up.

631
00:35:25,685 --> 00:35:28,578
You stepped over the line.
This was not your decision.

632
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:32,381
My God, there are 10,000 oncologists
in this country.

633
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,885
Every one of them loses patients.
Only you would feel guilty enough.

634
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,977
Of course, we can't even argue
on my schedule.

635
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:49,732
It's House.

636
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:56,715
<i>Take down the bags.</i>

637
00:35:56,894 --> 00:35:58,911
It's too soon to tell
if the meds are gonna...

638
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:01,773
It's not the meds.
It's the blood that's killing her.

639
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:04,546
<i>What's everybody doing?
You're stunned, right?</i>

640
00:36:04,782 --> 00:36:06,079
I mean, blood?

641
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>She's had internal bleeding.</i>

642
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,533
- She needs the blood.
- <i>Is that the mom?</i>

643
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,732
<i>I've got a good comeback
if it's the mom.</i>

644
00:36:12,857 --> 00:36:14,655
Yes, I'm her mother.

645
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:18,146
Sure, she needs blood,
if you want to kill her.

646
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:21,091
<i>Then you'd have nobody left
to neglect, great plan.</i>

647
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,662
<i>Your daughter has vibrio vulnificus,</i>

648
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:26,894
Courtesy of a few scrumptious oysters
on the half shell.

649
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:28,916
I didn't eat any oysters.

650
00:36:29,058 --> 00:36:31,524
Thus proving that she did.
Boy, that's neat.

651
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:33,681
100 other people ate those oysters.

652
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:36,320
<i>- I ate.</i>
- The dad? I've got a good comeback.

653
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:37,513
It's Chase.

654
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,907
He might've been Australian too.

655
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,034
<i>There was nothing wrong
with the oysters.</i>

656
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:43,773
All oysters have vibrio.

657
00:36:44,107 --> 00:36:47,080
But almost no one
has hemochromatosis.

658
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,959
<i>It'd give here a unique
susceptibility to vibrio,</i>

659
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,170
<i>cause the swollen joints.</i>
<i>But it got attributed to bulimia,</i>

660
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,631
- So she got supplements.
- With iron.

661
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,593
<i>Which overcooked the liver,
which caused bleeding.</i>

662
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:01,679
More blood, more iron,
more bleeding, more blood.

663
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,222
Is she gonna be OK?

664
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,516
Only if we give her
high-dose ceftazidime

665
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:08,197
<i>for the vibrio and chelate
for the hemochromatosis.</i>

666
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:11,230
<i>Cameron, pick up the phone
and give me a dramatic exit.</i>

667
00:37:23,832 --> 00:37:24,702
So...

668
00:37:25,396 --> 00:37:27,596
how'd you two crazy kids hook up?

669
00:37:28,104 --> 00:37:30,962
I suspected someone in accounting
was skimming money,

670
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,044
and I wanted to investigate quietly.

671
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:37,102
And since you introduced me
to the only detective I know...

672
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,008
And one thing leads to another.

673
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:47,224
Why keep it a secret?

674
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:50,070
You protecting me
in my fragile state?

675
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:51,812
You think I was an unhinged looney

676
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,815
Who was about to go off the rails
At a badly timed bit of news?

677
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,817
I don't advertise my personal life.

678
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:00,310
I needed help with the baby.
Lucas drove up.

679
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,281
She was worried.

680
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,701
A little worried.

681
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,350
As a friend.

682
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:10,623
I had to hide in our room
and be the dirty little secret.

683
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,550
Kinda sucked.

684
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,605
I told her it wasn't necessary.

685
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,379
So you had some hallucination

686
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:17,916
about having sex with her.

687
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,979
I don't think we need to talk...

688
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:24,136
I imagine having sex
with women all the time. No big deal.

689
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:27,207
Though I guess if they knew
what I imagine,

690
00:38:27,443 --> 00:38:28,779
It could get awkward.

691
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:30,566
And It's different

692
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:33,853
because in the fantasy,
she was your savior.

693
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,148
That was months ago, right?

694
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,859
All the work that you had to do
to get straight.

695
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,389
You've been institutionalized.

696
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,770
You've had way bigger stuff
to deal with, I should shut up.

697
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:50,329
Can I buy you a ginger ale?

698
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,402
A ginger ale would be good.

699
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:55,577
With lemon.

700
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:01,089
Infection's clearing up nicely.

701
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:04,302
- You'ld be out of here in a few days.
- That is wonderful.

702
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:08,770
Jack, how are you?

703
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:11,142
Sweetie, your father and I

704
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,686
think we should reward ourselves
with a little time off.

705
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:16,188
That meeting's gonna have to wait.

706
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,528
We stay here.

707
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:20,676
You should think
about where you'd like to go.

708
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,174
The specs are wrong
for the foundation.

709
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:25,323
- Can you talk to 'em?
- Let me see.

710
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,339
- You OK?
- Yeah.

711
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:38,345
Soil engineering report was fine.

712
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:39,837
I'm used to it.

713
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:43,151
So...
about what happened that night.

714
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:51,512
I never even got up the courage
to knock on his door.

715
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:02,458
Well, you'll have to send me
their numbers.

716
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:22,369
He looks like a guy
who'd be there every day.

717
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:25,258
Minibar is restocked.

718
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,562
I say we grab some pretzels
for the road.

719
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:28,970
When you do what I did.

720
00:40:29,976 --> 00:40:32,934
It's not enough to tell yourself
you did nothing wrong.

721
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:35,480
You need to hear it
from someone else.

722
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:37,007
If not God,

723
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,358
or society,

724
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:41,148
a friend.

725
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,067
Otherwise you go crazy.

726
00:40:44,214 --> 00:40:45,569
What you said to me...


727
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:51,911
You're a good friend.

728
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:54,321
Cuddy should know that.

729
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:58,916
Let her know that I drugged you
So you wouldn't confess to murder.

730
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:00,923
Let's get out of here.

731
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:05,246
Someone could have recognized you.

732
00:41:05,722 --> 00:41:08,637
First US conference
I've attended in 15 years.

733
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:10,013
Perlmutter?

734
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:13,126
Toronto, all weekend.
Airtight alibi.

735
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:24,555
I'm sorry.

736
00:41:26,923 --> 00:41:29,113
I don't know why
I always suspect the worst.

737
00:41:31,512 --> 00:41:35,022
If you say you're not having an affair,
You're not having an affair.

738
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:45,540
God, you are.

739
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:47,462
- I'm not.
- OK. sorry.

740
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:48,909
Again.

741
00:41:55,744 --> 00:41:57,410
If you don't want to tell.

742
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:04,328
But I could help.

743
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:08,607
Whatever this is,
it's eating away at you.

744
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,634
We could get past it together.

745
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,672
I love you no matter what.

746
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:33,106
We lose patients sometimes.

747
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:37,893
One of those patients...

748
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,595
Dibala...

749
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:44,684
We didn't ac...

750
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,558
We didn't actually lose him.

751
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:53,639
I killed him.

752
