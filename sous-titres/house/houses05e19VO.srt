1
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:36,239
<i>How long have I...?</i>

2
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:39,028
<i>Forced trauma to the head...</i>

3
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,582
<i>Since the accident,
he's had a continued...</i>

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,200
<i>Why can't I get up?</i>

5
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:45,002
<i>What's wrong with my legs?</i>

6
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:48,957
<i>Someone talk to me.</i>

7
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,175
<i>You don't hear me talking to you?</i>

8
00:00:56,976 --> 00:00:58,826
Great heart for transplant.

9
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:00,596
<i>My heart?</i>

10
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:03,187
<i>Oh, God!
They don't know I'm in here.</i>

11
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,634
Hey, genius.

12
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:07,900
I think it
violates certain ethical laws

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,280
to rip the organs out of
a guy who's still alive.

14
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,937
- Possibly certain law laws too.
- <i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

15
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:15,991
Could you, get back
in your bed, please, Mr. House?

16
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,405
- It's actually doctor House.
- <i>This guy's a doctor?</i>

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,834
There's also navy seal house.
But you're going to have

18
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,063
- to save up for that one.
- Really? That's interesting, but...

19
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:26,174
you're here because
you crashed your motorcycle,

20
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,921
not because I need a consult.
So, get back in bed.

21
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:31,882
I scraped my elbow,
I just need a truckload of vicodin.

22
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,957
- Whereas, this guy...
- He's brain dead.

23
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:35,010
<i>No, I'm not!</i>

24
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,228
So drop it.

25
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:37,963
See that?

26
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,725
Minimal brainwaves
don't mean he's alive.

27
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,726
<i>I am alive!
I'm here!</i>

28
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,812
No EKG response to painful stimuli,
hot or cold.

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,939
What you're seeing is random,
barely discernable.

30
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:49,264
- I discerned it.
- <i>Listen to him, please.</i>

31
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,777
No, that's just the amplifier's
internal noise level.

32
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,227
- It's on increased sensitivity.
- <i>No, it's not! It's me.</i>

33
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:57,771
- Then why is his eye following you?
- <i>Exactly.</i>

34
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,781
Following motion's
an involuntary reflex.

35
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:02,830
You're a doctor,
you should know these things.

36
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:06,387
<i>No, no, I'm not dead, I need help.
I'm here!</i>

37
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:11,682
I also know
about locked-in syndrome,

38
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:15,342
that things
are either involuntary...

39
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:17,766
or voluntary.

40
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:21,504
Blink if you can hear me.

41
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,058
<i>I hear you.</i>

42
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,546
This is going to be fun.

43
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,777
House - Season 5 Episode 19
"Locked In"

44
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,832
Synchro: ShalimarFow, mpm, IceFeak

45
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:58,135
The HTeam's AnonymHouse

46
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,349
Eye movement is deliberate.

47
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:11,261
Can you blink once
for "yes," twice for "no?"

48
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:12,386
<i>I hope so.</i>

49
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,407
The square root of nine?

50
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:20,893
He got that faster than you.

51
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:22,860
The brain is fully functional.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,746
- <i>Where's Molly?</i>
- You were in an accident.

53
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:32,002
<i>Hit the brake,
hit the brake, hit the brake!</i>

54
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,734
You've sustained a traumatic
injury to your brain stem

55
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,022
which has cut off your brain's ability
to communicate with your body.

56
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:41,515
<i>Can you fix me?
Where's Molly?</i>

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,396
You still have movement
in your eyes.

58
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,394
So we can get you
to a rehab facility

59
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,803
where they can teach you
how to communicate.

60
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,665
<i>I can't be stuck like this.</i>

61
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,063
Unless... the crash didn't cause
the brain damage.

62
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:56,617
Maybe the brain damage
caused the crash.

63
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,933
<i>I couldn't stop.
Why couldn't I stop?</i>

64
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:03,619
Look at his palms.
There's no scrapes.

65
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:08,192
He didn't even
try to protect himself.

66
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,879
So you had slowed reflexes
or no reflexes.

67
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,799
You're not a doctor in this hospital.
You are a patient.

68
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:16,242
<i>Yeah, and you're the guy
who wants to cut out my organs,</i>

69
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:17,661
<i>he's the guy who doesn't.</i>

70
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:19,989
Stroke, cancer,
even a simple infection,

71
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:22,509
anything that insults
the central pons could do this.

72
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:25,306
- <i>Then that means that I could be fixed.</i>
- You're giving him false hope.

73
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:28,043
He needs to accept what's happened.

74
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,643
And work on making the most of it.

75
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:41,727
<i>Molly.</i>

76
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:48,065
<i>Don't look at me like that.
That's not making me feel better.</i>

77
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,264
<i>I love you.</i>

78
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:54,081
I don't know how God
is going to get us through this.

79
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,006
- But he will.
- Stop it.

80
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,296
I'm blushing.

81
00:04:57,719 --> 00:04:58,839
What are you doing?

82
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:02,128
Just looking for some reading
material for the crapper.

83
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:04,427
- These CTS...
- Get back in your bed.

84
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:05,460
Come on.

85
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,265
The children are in the waiting area,
can I bring them in?

86
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,064
<i>No. No, don't.</i>

87
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,186
<i>You don't want to see them?</i>

88
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,294
<i>I don't want them having nightmares.
I don't want to scare them.</i>

89
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,191
You don't want them to see you?

90
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,236
It's okay.

91
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,554
I understand.

92
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:26,701
You're going
to be better soon enough.

93
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,376
<i>You really that sure?</i>

94
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:32,179
<i>Why are you so sure?
Baby, how'd you get so sure?</i>

95
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:39,514
You okay?

96
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,174
- Never better.
- Here's your burger.

97
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:47,388
If you can't
bring Mohammed to Princeton,

98
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,456
bring Princeton to Mohammed.

99
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:51,517
That's my diagnostics posse.

100
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:53,856
Hot, dark, and darker.

101
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:56,939
- <i>Talk about getting me better, please.</i>
- What are you doing up in Middletown?

102
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,146
- <i>Who cares?</i>
- Buying a gibson'57 goldtop.

103
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,361
It's the guitar
Duane Allman used to play.

104
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:05,331
Next to the trauma,
the mostly likely causes of

105
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,198
a sudden onset of locked-in syndrome

106
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:09,328
are basilar artery stroke,
and brain hemorrhage.

107
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,326
- CT was clean.
- <i>Man, those fries look good.</i>

108
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:14,873
Guy's an active bike rider,
his heart's fine.

109
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:16,945
A well-placed tumor
could explain it.

110
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,761
<i>Jeez, is the last thing I ate
gonna be the last thing I ate?</i>

111
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,549
It could evade the CT, and still show up
on an MRI with contrast.

112
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,674
<i>It was a melted power bar.</i>

113
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:26,997
She's the smart one.

114
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:30,172
I just keep dark and darker
to fill out the quota.

115
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,123
If we find it, treat it,
you could be fine.

116
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:37,932
<i>I never thought
I'd be praying for a brain tumor,</i>

117
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,607
<i>but please, dear God.</i>

118
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:43,569
If you're praying in there,
stop it right now.

119
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,550
<i>We'll get his doctor
to order an MRI.</i>

120
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:49,639
His doctor's busy teaching him how
to blink out "kill me" in morse code.

121
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:53,912
Luckily, I found some forms
under the mattress.

122
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,568
Check it out, they have
those MRI video goggles.

123
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:03,282
- I heard these were awesome.
- What do you see?

124
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,557
It's a beach.

125
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:07,323
Look, there's Taub...

126
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,154
drinking a margarita

127
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,654
and mocking us for driving
all the way up here...

128
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,224
<i>Easy, I can still feel in here.</i>

129
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:17,983
Excuse Dr. Kutner, he gets
a little excited about new technology.

130
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:20,962
It can get loud in there,
and a little closed off.

131
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:23,521
These will put you in a quiet place.

132
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,340
You can create a relaxing
scenario for yourself.

133
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:27,851
<i>I hope they...</i>

134
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:29,436
<i>... work.</i>

135
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:40,667
You're in my relaxing scenario?

136
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:44,088
I guess you like me.

137
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,049
Either that, or you got sent here.

138
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:49,259
What? By God?

139
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:51,678
I'm not sure if I believe in God.

140
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,265
You spend an awful lot of time in church
for someone who doesn't.

141
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,894
I don't not believe either.

142
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:01,882
It's either one or the other.

143
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:05,107
I go to church mainly
to keep my wife happy, but...

144
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,235
I don't know, I've never actually
thought that God could reach out

145
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,864
and affect my life.
But...

146
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,743
Getting a brilliant doctor
in the bed next to me?

147
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,180
God is also the guy who opened
his car door in front of you.

148
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:20,874
I think Molly was right.

149
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,086
I think you were sent here
to make me get better.

150
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,449
I think so.

151
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,350
Hey, dad.

152
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,868
Making a volcano.

153
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:39,862
You're making a volcano?
It looks like it.

154
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,537
What you doing, baby?

155
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,027
<i>What time is it?</i>

156
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:48,787
Hope you don't mind.

157
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,765
My new roommate snores.

158
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:54,954
And my new room doesn't have you.

159
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,883
Your MRI showed a lesion
in the central pons.

160
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:01,867
<i>What is that?
What does that mean?</i>

161
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:03,010
See it there?

162
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,488
That's what they said.

163
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,018
But it's there.

164
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,262
Which means no way
head trauma did this.

165
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:17,149
It's cancer, causing
a paraneoplastic syndrome.

166
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,693
Unfortunately,
your current doctor thinks

167
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:22,352
its diffuse nature
means an infection.

168
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:26,273
And the bad news is,
the antivirals he's got you on

169
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:28,344
might kill you.

170
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:29,780
<i>I'm not gonna die.</i>

171
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:32,946
But the good news is
if they just almost kill you,

172
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,952
then Dr. Idiot will realize

173
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,911
that his name is not a coincidence
and he'll let me do whatever I want.

174
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
<i>Thank you.</i>

175
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,792
See, the irony here is...

176
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:49,321
you're kind of fascinating.

177
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,965
So many questions.

178
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,511
But if you could answer any of them,
you wouldn't be fascinating.

179
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,097
<i>I get it, you're a little nuts,
aren't you?</i>

180
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,562
Your wife is the one
getting you through this.

181
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,265
Your wife and me.

182
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,121
Although frankly,
the mri was a lot more useful

183
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,396
than four hours of hand-holding.

184
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,448
I think.

185
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,867
<i>If you had a wife,
you'd know why it matters.</i>

186
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,734
You're a good guy.
Easy to talk to.

187
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,025
<i>Wait, something's happening.</i>

188
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:30,921
<i>What's happening to me?
I need some help in here!</i>

189
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,340
Your patient is seizing.

190
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,215
- Why would he have a seizure?
- Because he has cancer!

191
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,817
His brain stem is compromised.

192
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:43,286
<i>Why are you arguing with this guy?
You thought I was dead.</i>

193
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,185
Welcome back.
And nicely played.

194
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:48,855
You almost died.
Exactly as we planned.

195
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,974
You knew this was going to happen?

196
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:54,455
It usually happens when you treat cancer
by pretending it's not cancer.

197
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,545
Right, doctor?
My turn?

198
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,072
- It's cancer?
- No, it isn't.

199
00:10:58,197 --> 00:11:01,493
A small tumor in his brain stem,
causing paraneoplastic syndrome.

200
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,454
- He needs plasmapheresis.
- Can you give that to him?

201
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,842
No, I'm sorry, I completely
disagree with Dr. House.

202
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,798
- <i>Please shut up.</i>
- I don't.

203
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:11,129
Which means I can treat him.

204
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,282
<i>Let him. Let him.</i>

205
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,674
- Is that what you want?
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

206
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:20,453
Would you send up
a couple of bellboys?

207
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,399
I got the transfefer papers.

208
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,152
Plasmapheresis is all set up.
Are you okay?

209
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,020
Fresh infusion of macho.

210
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:38,167
You like?

211
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:41,336
<i>I can't move, and
she's worried about his boo-boo?</i>

212
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,087
What were you
doing up there, anyway?

213
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,212
Antiquing.

214
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,432
I found you a late victorian corset.

215
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,915
- Come by later, I'll tie you up.
- <i>Is he hitting on her?</i>

216
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:51,988
<i>If she turns around,
she's into him too.</i>

217
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,267
<i>And there, yeah.</i>

218
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,796
Sorry I didn't show up in Middletown.
I didn't get the message.

219
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:57,601
Probably because
there was no message.

220
00:11:57,726 --> 00:11:59,995
I've decided
to accept your resignation.

221
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,791
I thought we were past this.
I decided to stay.

222
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,765
No, you didn't.
You had it decided for you.

223
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,516
So now you're stuck here with a boss

224
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,554
who knows that you want
to be somewhere else.

225
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,608
Means you're no longer
motivated to impress me,

226
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,437
which means you're no longer motivated
to come up with good ideas.

227
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:14,858
Unless I'm wrong.

228
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,681
Save the cheerleader.
Save your world.

229
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:22,528
- I got it from here.
- <i>I thought you already solved this.</i>

230
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:24,826
<i>Are you thinking you might be wrong?</i>

231
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,254
<i>What's going on?</i>

232
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:29,251
Hey, just curious...

233
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:31,708
What were you driving up
to Middletown for?

234
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,796
- What do you care?
- Why does he care?

235
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,857
- Because I'm your friend.
- I was buying a guitar.

236
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:39,294
Yeah, I heard that.
It used to belong to a guitarist

237
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,020
who died in a motorcycle accident.

238
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:43,715
It just reeks of
you screwing with people.

239
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,593
Your crash was ten miles

240
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:48,225
from the orange county
progressive pain clinic.

241
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,437
You live ten miles
from mary's dress shop.

242
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,348
Yet, that's not
even on my list of reasons

243
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:54,648
that I think you're
secretly a transvestite.

244
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,004
If you're going to another
state to get more narcotics...

245
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,382
- <i>He's on drugs?</i>
- I went to visit your ex-ex-ex-wife...

246
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:01,947
Who lives in Thompson ridge.

247
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,811
I let her know about the extra money
you're making on the lecture circuit.

248
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:07,213
So she'll be sure
to adjust your alimony.

249
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:10,399
- You wouldn't do that.
- Yeah. I wouldn't do that.

250
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:11,524
Would you?

251
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,083
<i>You guys are friends?</i>

252
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:19,408
Shouldn't we be
entertaining our patient?

253
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,903
I performed Euripides
with sock puppets.

254
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:23,262
You just missed it.

255
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,845
House said we should.

256
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:26,665
The mind is like a muscle.

257
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,349
If you don't exercise it,
it'll atrophy, just like anything else.

258
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,726
Whoever's with him needs to talk.

259
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:35,021
Keep his mind active, and
it'll show House you still care.

260
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,276
Not sure if I do.

261
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,877
<i>Jeez, you're my doctor?</i>

262
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,360
Then why don't you just quit?

263
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:43,163
I'm not sure
I want to do that, either.

264
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:46,494
Maybe you should figure it out
before House figures it out for you.

265
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:50,065
<i>Yeah, maybe you should have
your midlife crisis after I'm better.</i>

266
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:55,611
We'll be right back.

267
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,986
Wait.
Wait, what did you just see?

268
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,594
Do you drink?

269
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:07,098
He's a roofer.

270
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:09,064
Alcohol hardly proves your theory.

271
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:10,839
Marchiafava bignami disease fits.

272
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:12,113
LFT's are normal.

273
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:14,648
<i>Speak english. Is it fixable?
What does that mean?</i>

274
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:16,103
<i>That hurts.</i>

275
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:17,413
No tremors.

276
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,732
How much do you drink?
A six-pack a day?

277
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,596
<i>I hate beer, I don't drink beer.</i>

278
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,572
Maybe more or less.
Or maybe something else.

279
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,424
It may not be alcohol at all.
Street opiates can also cause locked-in.

280
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:27,956
<i>I don't get high.</i>

281
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:31,114
So, either we play 20,000 questions
with every street drug,

282
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:34,205
or instead of talking to him,
we talk to the lesion.

283
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:35,422
<i>Talk to me.</i>

284
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:37,509
We're going
to biopsy the brain stem?

285
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,169
For the record, that doesn't
count as your inspired idea.

286
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:42,599
It's where I was heading.

287
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:45,309
<i>You're going to cut into my head?
Why?</i>

288
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:48,354
<i>Stop treating me
like a piece of furniture!</i>

289
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,406
<i>I have a right to know
what's going on!</i>

290
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:57,619
<i>Where's that going?</i>

291
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:00,055
Blood in your urine
clogged up your old catheter.

292
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,330
<i>Peeing blood?</i>

293
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,057
<i>That must be what
the insecure doctor saw.</i>

294
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:06,671
Every new clue gets us
closer to the answer.

295
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,088
<i>Damnit.</i>

296
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:11,210
The surgery will get us more clues.

297
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:19,648
You have visitors.

298
00:15:26,286 --> 00:15:27,286
Come in.

299
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,917
Daddy!
Daddy!

300
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:31,345
<i>I told you not to bring them.</i>

301
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,639
They wanted to see their father.

302
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:37,275
<i>I can't even hug them.</i>

303
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:38,477
They can handle it.

304
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,469
- It's going to be all right.
- <i>You're not so sure anymore, are you?</i>

305
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:45,406
<i>They must've told you
that it's dangerous.</i>

306
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:47,085
<i>That I could die.</i>

307
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:49,271
And that's why
you brought them in here...

308
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:50,990
I got an A+ on my test.

309
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,800
<i>To see me before I die.</i>

310
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:54,020
I love you, daddy.

311
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:55,544
<i>Daddy loves you too.</i>

312
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:57,719
I want to show you my drawings.

313
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:00,112
<i>Kids just want a dad.</i>

314
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,810
<i>Even if he's just a lump.</i>

315
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,010
Maybe you should go.

316
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,828
<i>No. They can stay, please.</i>

317
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,193
<i>Let them stay.</i>

318
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:13,246
Bye, daddy.

319
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,466
Bye, daddy.

320
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:24,023
Sorry.

321
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,360
You were crying.

322
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:28,172
<i>Damn.</i>

323
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,933
We're going to put you out,
just so we can drill the hole.

324
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:41,525
<i>That's very thoughtful of you.</i>

325
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:44,546
<i>Then we'll wake you back up.</i>

326
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:47,102
We'l'll need you to answer some
simple yes or no questions

327
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:49,331
while we're cutting, to make
sure we're not cutting...

328
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:50,721
<i>It seems to be working.</i>

329
00:16:50,846 --> 00:16:51,996
Deep breaths.

330
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:55,381
In about ten seconds,
you'll feel lightheaded.

331
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:57,773
And by now...

332
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,025
you should be floating high
with lucy in the sky.

333
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:20,704
How come I'm not better?

334
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:23,737
God's not supposed
to work in trial and error.

335
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,293
God's mistakes are well-documented.

336
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:29,028
If he'd done everything right the 1st
time, there'd have been 1 plague

337
00:17:29,153 --> 00:17:30,422
and zero great floods.

338
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,549
Those were
because of human mistakes.

339
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:35,135
You think your doctor has
an apartment on mount Olympus?

340
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,012
God put me with you for a reason.

341
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,296
I'm gonna be all right still, right?

342
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:42,808
I don't know.

343
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,630
<i>Lee. You with me now?</i>

344
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:55,877
Easy questions.

345
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:58,783
You'll be done before you know it.

346
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:00,285
Is this equation correct?

347
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:04,611
<i>What, so if you make a mistake,
I'm not going to know that anymore?</i>

348
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:06,509
Are these lines parallel?

349
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,440
Spatial relationships intact.

350
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,752
Take a look at this circle.

351
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:14,583
Is more than half of it shaded?

352
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,708
<i>Of course.</i>

353
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:19,430
Don't forget to blink. Is more than
half of the circle shaded?

354
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,375
<i>Sorry, yes.</i>

355
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:23,599
Look at me, Lee.
Again.

356
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:26,271
Is more than
half of this circle shaded?

357
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,463
<i>Blink.
Come on, Lee, blink.</i>

358
00:18:28,588 --> 00:18:29,431
Back out.

359
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,741
<i>Why can't I blink?
Why can't I blink?</i>

360
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:39,143
Why aren't his eyes moving?

361
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:41,466
Two options:

362
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,212
my neurologist screwed up, or else

363
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:47,211
something the hospital lawyer's going to
have to come up with when you sue us.

364
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:50,466
<i>Blinking and eye movements are
controlled by a small cluster of nerves,</i>

365
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:52,798
just millimeters
from the biopsy site.

366
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,520
But he's still in there, right?
He just can't communicate?

367
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:56,836
It's possible.

368
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,356
Also possible is that the
surgery caused so much swelling

369
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,316
in his brain stem,
that he's just gone.

370
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,830
He had one way to communicate,
and now that's gone.

371
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:07,055
Well played.

372
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:10,168
Brain biopsy revealed severe
damage to the myelin sheath.

373
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:11,435
Question is, why?

374
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,057
Epstein-Barr,
picorna viruses, malaria.

375
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:17,542
He runs a business, meets lot of people,
he could've picked up rotavirus.

376
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,390
Did he report
having bloody diarrhea?

377
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,404
The wife's not sure,
says he doesn't complain.

378
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,230
- Did you ask him?
- We've prioritized.

379
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:25,662
He can only blink, a real history
would've taken weeks.

380
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:27,581
With Epstein-Barr,
he'd have belly pains.

381
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,750
If he had picorna virus,
he'd have headaches.

382
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,322
Five other yes/no questions,

383
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:33,211
and maybe we'd know
what treatment to give.

384
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:35,123
And what treatment would kill him.

385
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:37,462
Unless he's already dead.

386
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,889
Maybe there's another way.

387
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,678
Brain computer interface...

388
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:48,644
better known as BCI.

389
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,203
The goal is to get
you to move that cursor

390
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:54,608
with your mind.

391
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,553
When you think "up,"
the computer records the pattern.

392
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,656
Think "up" enough times, it eventually
learns what you're thinking.

393
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:02,396
So...

394
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:05,113
start thinking "up."

395
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:25,911
You in there?

396
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:29,288
Are you trying?

397
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:49,305
I called the ex-ex-ex-wife.

398
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,833
She was at a sweat lodge
in new mexico last week.

399
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:55,544
What were you
really doing in New York?

400
00:20:56,904 --> 00:20:59,694
You know how you hate it
when I meddle in your lies?

401
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:02,018
I mean your life.

402
00:21:02,353 --> 00:21:06,322
Why are you being so evasive?
Unless you have something to evade.

403
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:08,227
Interesting.

404
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:13,200
This has nothing to do with you,
your ex-wife, or my pain.

405
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:16,231
I was heading to the down-state
correctional facility in fishkill.

406
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:20,068
One of your hookers
arrange a conjugal visit?

407
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:23,070
It's where foreman's brother
is being held.

408
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,132
This is going to mean
months of sleepless nights,

409
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,562
wondering if I could've
done something differently.

410
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:37,895
Maybe it's not
that I'm sick of House.

411
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,224
It's that I'm sick of

412
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:43,329
being scared out of my mind

413
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:45,647
to go to work every day.

414
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,510
Sorry.

415
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,600
Did that just...

416
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,571
was that you?

417
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,618
Are you really in there?

418
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:33,509
I knew you were in there.

419
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:35,419
<i>I was scared.</i>

420
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:36,733
Thank God.

421
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:39,634
<i>I am scared.</i>

422
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,859
<i>Molly, I love you so much.</i>

423
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,406
Have you had any bloody
diarrhea in the last 2 weeks?

424
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:50,513
Rotavirus out.

425
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,114
Any recent joint pain?

426
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:54,782
Epstein-Barr's out.

427
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,912
Have you traveled
out of the country lately?

428
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,987
What about inside the country?

429
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,337
He was in St. Louis.

430
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:06,675
Good.

431
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:09,303
Could be Missouri malaria.

432
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:11,169
Let's start treatment.

433
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,353
He was... he was there.

434
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,981
The machine must not be working.

435
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:23,879
Either that,
or he lied to you about it.

436
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:25,819
People do that sometimes.

437
00:23:26,457 --> 00:23:29,406
For example, I just lied to him
about Missouri malaria.

438
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:36,830
Did you go to St. Louis?

439
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,667
<i>I should've told you.</i>

440
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:43,279
<i>Why didn't I just tell you?</i>

441
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:45,166
<i>Down.</i>

442
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:56,549
When you weren't
in St. Louis for two days,

443
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:59,732
I assume you were getting
some strange for two days.

444
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:01,729
<i>So does she.</i>

445
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:03,761
<i>You have to tell her I wasn't.</i>

446
00:24:04,137 --> 00:24:05,137
Amazing.

447
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,667
A man who only has two blips
at his disposal can still lie.

448
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,239
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

449
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:14,210
If you were getting
some really strange strange,

450
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:16,452
you could've
contracted neurosyphilis.

451
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:19,338
Infection went to your brain,
froze you right up.

452
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:21,504
Good news is it's treatable.

453
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:24,990
You'll be up and moving in
time to sign the divorce papers.

454
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:27,281
Why would I tell you the
truth about being in st. Louis,

455
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:29,705
and then not tell you
the truth about this?

456
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,829
He just admitted he wasn't
in St. Louis in front of his wife,

457
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:37,161
and you think he's lying
when she's not even in here?

458
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:40,238
<i>I'm liking this one more and more.
Don't fire him.</i>

459
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,863
Were you out of the state?

460
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:45,138
<i>I never left.</i>

461
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:48,892
Were you within 20 miles
of your house?

462
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,889
Were you within five miles?

463
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,199
<i>Within two miles?</i>

464
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,820
Did you stay at a hotel?

465
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:06,157
You had to sleep somewhere.

466
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,594
Your car?

467
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,826
A friend's house?

468
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:21,059
That narrows it down,
depending on how popular you are.

469
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:24,020
Tell the wife to stop crying,
get in here.

470
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,251
He says that when he was
supposed to be in st. Louis,

471
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,704
he was staying at a friend's house.

472
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:36,139
Really.

473
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:39,841
Let's assume that
you believe him for the moment.

474
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:41,553
Name your friends within two miles.

475
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:43,028
Martin and kim's?

476
00:25:45,341 --> 00:25:48,218
Guess someone
who doesn't have a wife.

477
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,690
- Dave?
- Yes.

478
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,100
Got an address?

479
00:25:57,668 --> 00:26:00,972
If this is where he got sick,
someone else here should have symptoms.

480
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:04,010
Not if Lee was the only one
coming down to the basement.

481
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,855
Furnace is rusty, but no gas leaks.

482
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,961
Resumes and cover letters here...

483
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:11,056
some are weeks old.

484
00:26:11,484 --> 00:26:13,566
He's been spending time here
for a while.

485
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:17,661
Business wasn't going good.

486
00:26:18,672 --> 00:26:20,783
I didn't want
you and the kids to worry.

487
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,259
I was trying to protect you.

488
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:35,745
I wish you could hear me.

489
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,560
I wish I could
make all of this better.

490
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:42,720
Looks like he temped a few times.

491
00:26:43,212 --> 00:26:44,362
As a janitor.

492
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:46,833
Factory out on route 10.

493
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,839
Factory foreman says they make
rechargeable batteries.

494
00:26:54,964 --> 00:26:56,295
Mostly for cell phones.

495
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,835
Big step down from running
your own business, to sweeping up.

496
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:01,948
Doing what I had to do.

497
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:03,636
Metal filings.

498
00:27:05,138 --> 00:27:07,273
Judging by the color,
I'd say cadmium.

499
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:10,354
Which he'd aerosolize with the broom,
then right into his lungs.

500
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,018
Heavy metal poisoning...
explains everything.

501
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:29,140
The chelation will scrub
the heavy metals out of your blood.

502
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,606
If we are right about the cause,
we should see some movement

503
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:32,865
in about a day or so.

504
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,575
<i>Can't put this thing on turbo?
I'm getting a little anxious in here.</i>

505
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,791
Somebody will be here at all times

506
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,340
to irrigate your eyes,
keep you company.

507
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,792
Hopefully, it'll help make
the time go quicker.

508
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:47,917
<i>My eyes still feel really dry.</i>

509
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,298
Thank you...
for thinking "up."

510
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:54,225
For helping me find you in there.

511
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:58,079
Man, when you moved that cursor...

512
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:11,577
I bought my first girlfriend
a necklace.

513
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:12,910
It was silver.

514
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:17,462
It cost 180 bucks...
had to save for six months.

515
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,865
- She hated it.
- Really, seriously?

516
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,481
Did you tell this story
to someone who could walk away?

517
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:26,456
Never bought another
girlfriend jewelry again.

518
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:30,766
- Until Dr. Hadley.
- You're dating her?

519
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:32,912
You might want to start
all your stories with that.

520
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:34,182
Same thing...

521
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,766
she didn't even wear it.

522
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:38,263
The diamond thing, she
was wearing it the other day.

523
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:40,580
If she doesn't like it,
she doesn't like it.

524
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:42,698
Apparently, I suck
at picking out jewelry,

525
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,484
but at least have
the guts to tell me.

526
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:46,378
Okay, getting boring again.

527
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:49,060
How long until we know
if this treatment is working?

528
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,204
You lied to me.

529
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:55,203
I wasn't having an affair.

530
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:56,928
So we needed money.

531
00:28:57,707 --> 00:28:58,640
Who cares?

532
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:01,362
Last time business was slow,
you got migraines every day.

533
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,609
- Why would you do that to me?
- I'm sorry, I was...

534
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:05,397
I was stupid.
I was... Don't go!

535
00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:07,261
Don't!
Damn it, somebody...

536
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:09,872
Put "I'm sorry"
on this stupid computer.

537
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,666
My eye is killing me.

538
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,761
I want to keep my job.

539
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:25,981
Great.

540
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,630
All you got to do
is come up with a good idea.

541
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,124
How about we hook the guy's brain
into a computer,

542
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:33,562
so he can communicate?

543
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,501
That's a great idea.

544
00:29:36,364 --> 00:29:39,173
For the guy who invented the
computer that can read minds.

545
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,457
Your idea was to use his idea.

546
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,739
You didn't come up with it.
No one else came up with it.

547
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,325
If I didn't re-establish
communication,

548
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,488
- we never would've found...
- what's interesting

549
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:50,109
is why you're here now.

550
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,336
Not when I gave you the ultimatum.

551
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:54,875
Was it something the patient said?

552
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,989
I realized that...
what we do here...

553
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:05,928
terrifies me.

554
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,394
And...

555
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,769
overcoming that...

556
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:14,413
is the only way I can matter.

557
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:24,145
Kutner found the battery factory.
Kutner came up with the cadmium.

558
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:26,949
Maybe you don't matter.

559
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,926
I'm going to close your eyes
so you can get some sleep.

560
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:48,684
Hopefully, when you wake up,
we'll see some improvement.

561
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:51,665
Hope that includes
my eye feeling better.

562
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,895
Hand me the flourescein stain.

563
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,024
- What's that mean?
- Epithelium looks torn.

564
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:04,204
These drops sting.

565
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,405
I'm going to close your
left eye to keep it protected.

566
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:26,624
I'm going to blink your eye
a few times to distribute the dye.

567
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:36,143
Ulcerative keratitis.

568
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,457
Means it's not cadmium poisoning.

569
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:42,642
Which means you don't know...
what's wrong...

570
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:44,539
again.

571
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:59,056
When's the last time
you changed that dressing?

572
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:02,189
Judging by the smell of it,
I'd say never.

573
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:05,694
He's locked-in,

574
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:08,889
his kidneys blew a fuse,

575
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,702
and now his eye is oozing puss.

576
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:13,799
I assume you went over all
of that with your team.

577
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:15,959
I also assume they
didn't have any brilliant ideas,

578
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:18,000
or you wouldn't still be muttering
to yourself.

579
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,725
This is going to hurt.

580
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:24,646
The way he's losing his myelin

581
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:26,934
makes an infection most likely.

582
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:28,559
Could be varicella...

583
00:32:28,684 --> 00:32:31,365
Road debris has come to the surface.
I'm going to have to scrub it out.

584
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,083
But the initial acyclovir
would've treated that.

585
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,686
Which pushes me towards
an autoimmune disease.

586
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:38,497
Like behcet's.

587
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,541
Here... This is going
to hurt even more.

588
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,376
Take two now, two later.

589
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:58,146
Of course, if the varicella
was resistant,

590
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:00,342
it wouldn't matter
what they did up in Middletown.

591
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:01,554
Do an L.P.

592
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,857
You've been in the E.R. too long.

593
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:07,245
When the patient had head trauma,

594
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,620
white blood cells only indicate
that he had head trauma.

595
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:12,025
Or you could use the L.P.
for something useful.

596
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:14,325
If you find polys, it's varicella.

597
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,054
Lymphs, behcet's.

598
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,539
Why did I fire you again?

599
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,833
You didn't. I quit.

600
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:32,973
You weren't visiting
foreman's brother, either.

601
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,098
Busy...

602
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,138
kutner's doing an L.P.,
so I have to focus.

603
00:33:37,704 --> 00:33:40,118
I had prison security check
visitor logs, phone records.

604
00:33:40,243 --> 00:33:42,496
You've never had any contact
with anyone at fishkill.

605
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,647
So, I ask again...

606
00:33:45,301 --> 00:33:47,399
What were you doing up
in Middletown?

607
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:51,445
You know what's more interesting
than what I was doing?

608
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:55,366
The reason you are so obsessed
with what I was doing.

609
00:33:56,058 --> 00:33:57,117
Stop deflecting.

610
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,735
Says the deflector.

611
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,207
Tthe reason I was up there...

612
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,075
is the reason
you're scared I was up there.

613
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,671
I was checking out
your dirty, little secret.

614
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:13,035
How long have you
been sleeping with her?

615
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,180
How did you know?

616
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:21,873
Your only secrets are
the girls you find embarrassing.

617
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:23,994
And the only embarrassing girl
you've met recently

618
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,271
is the one at
your brother's cuckoo facility.

619
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,856
We've been out a few times.

620
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,901
She's a caregiver.
Like all of your other failed exes.

621
00:34:32,124 --> 00:34:33,987
And someone who
takes care of your brother.

622
00:34:34,887 --> 00:34:36,990
Who was the last person
who took care of your brother?

623
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:42,420
- You think this is oedipal?
- Actually, I was thinking masturbatory.

624
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,873
I guess your mom
took care of him first.

625
00:34:45,392 --> 00:34:47,626
So, the safe course

626
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,594
is to gouge your eyes out.

627
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:58,446
L.P. stands for lumbar puncture.

628
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:01,473
We use this needle to
collect fluid from your spine.

629
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,302
That's a really big needle.

630
00:35:03,427 --> 00:35:05,586
You're going to feel some
extreme pressure in your back.

631
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:07,746
I already feel pressure
in my front...

632
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:10,679
My chest hurts.
Something's wrong.

633
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:12,987
No, my chest!

634
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,061
Something's wrong.

635
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,865
I think I'm hav...
Oh, God!

636
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:20,784
Call the code.

637
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:33,292
There is no God.

638
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:36,383
You don't know what's wrong with me.

639
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:39,720
It doesn't seem that way.

640
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:42,973
So am I dead?

641
00:35:43,864 --> 00:35:44,864
Not yet.

642
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:49,768
But you're about to be.

643
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:51,393
Okay.

644
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:55,486
Charging... Clear.

645
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:58,386
Again... Clear.

646
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,517
He's back.

647
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:04,518
Let me go.

648
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:05,943
He can't fix me.

649
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:08,143
I've been here for three days,

650
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:09,618
everything hurts.

651
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,819
It's okay, just...

652
00:36:12,264 --> 00:36:13,746
Just stop fighting.

653
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:16,941
She's got to go on with her life.

654
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,083
The kids don't need this.
I can'...

655
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:23,395
I can't do nothing for them...
I can't...

656
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,020
Scratch this foot...

657
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:28,518
Tthat really, really itches.

658
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:30,144
So we put in a temporary pacer.

659
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:31,605
Shut up, shut up.

660
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:36,693
He's trying to talk.

661
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,308
Is something bothering you?

662
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,286
If there's still tightness
in your chest, it's expected.

663
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,038
Is it your eye?

664
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,195
Why is he saying "no" three times?
You only asked one question.

665
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:57,714
Maybe he's not saying "no,"
maybe he's saying "down."

666
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,055
Are you saying
that the pain is lower?

667
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,390
How low, your leg?

668
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:07,933
Your foot?

669
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,687
Left foot?

670
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,692
Check his... Let me see now...
Yeah, his right foot.

671
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,487
- No bruises, no rashes, no cuts.
- Then there should be no pain.

672
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,864
Is there a tingling sensation?

673
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:24,992
Is it itching?

674
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:32,578
Itchy foot means liver failure.

675
00:37:32,898 --> 00:37:35,586
The liver's fine. His enzymes have
been normal since we admitted him.

676
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:37,773
I didn't say "failing,"
I said "failure."

677
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,098
Just like you.

678
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:42,271
Liver's like a cruise ship
taking on water.

679
00:37:42,396 --> 00:37:44,269
As it starts to sink,
it sends out an S.O.S.,

680
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:47,014
only instead of radio waves,
it uses enzymes.

681
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,521
The more enzymes in the blood,
the worse the liver is.

682
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:51,364
And once the ship has sunk,

683
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:53,270
there's no more S.O.S.

684
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,332
You think the liver's fine, but it's
already at the bottom of the sea.

685
00:37:56,457 --> 00:38:00,090
So dying liver released toxins, damaged
the nerves, led to locked-in syndrome.

686
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:03,203
Now we just need to know
what's causing the liver failure.

687
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:05,032
Liver, plus eye, plus kidney...

688
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,909
Most likely sclerosing cholangitis.

689
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,703
Oh, God, if only Taub had said that,

690
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,800
It would've been a happy ending.

691
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,206
Do a biopsy to confirm.

692
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:21,173
I'm going to numb up the area where
we'll go in for the punch biopsy.

693
00:38:22,222 --> 00:38:23,467
Where's the new bracelet?

694
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,595
She was wearing the bracelet?

695
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,523
You didn't notice
that I was wearing it?

696
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:30,768
- Because you weren't.
- He noticed, and you didn't?

697
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:32,948
If you don't like it,
it's fine, it's not a big deal.

698
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:34,394
I like it, that's the point.

699
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,647
I'd rather have it
at home in the jewelry box

700
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,397
than getting peed on at work.

701
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:40,395
You got the patient's urine
on that arm?

702
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,694
When I was putting in the catheter.
Why?

703
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,597
You've got a rash.

704
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:46,897
- The bracelet's real.
- I figured.

705
00:38:47,022 --> 00:38:49,890
So what if the rash
isn't just a rash?

706
00:38:50,513 --> 00:38:52,021
What if it's an infection?

707
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,164
If there were rats in that basement,

708
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,896
then the liver failure could
be caused by leptospirosis.

709
00:38:58,021 --> 00:39:01,272
It transfers through urine.
Rat pee to him, his pee to you.

710
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,799
The infection would
need an entry point.

711
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,323
Look for any recent scratches, cuts.

712
00:39:11,025 --> 00:39:12,019
Look.

713
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,334
Next to his fingernail.

714
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,244
The infection destroyed your liver,

715
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:22,526
which released toxins that
caused the locked-in syndrome.

716
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,524
You were dying of a paper cut.

717
00:39:24,649 --> 00:39:26,437
I hope you're right this time.

718
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:30,158
We found rats
in your buddy dave's basement.

719
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,977
Tested positive for leptospirosis.

720
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:35,114
That means we're
on the right treatment.

721
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:37,514
So...

722
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,300
try moving a finger.

723
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,547
Your brain needs to get
used to doing its job again.

724
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:45,687
Try harder.

725
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,774
I'm sure you've lost hope.

726
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,891
I know we've told you several times
that we knew what this was,

727
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,859
but this time we're right.

728
00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:58,894
Concentrate.

729
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,690
Move one finger for me.

730
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,275
Welcome back.

731
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
I did it.

732
00:40:24,914 --> 00:40:26,026
Rat pee.

733
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:28,508
Very nice idea.

734
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:31,187
Who came up with it?

735
00:40:32,106 --> 00:40:33,055
I did.

736
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:37,462
Good.

737
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:45,942
You okay with him
claiming the credit?

738
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:48,778
It was his idea.
He saw the rash...

739
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:50,012
if he did,

740
00:40:50,236 --> 00:40:53,075
he'd have hung a "mission accomplished"
banner in my outer office.

741
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,026
Don't toy with him.

742
00:40:57,151 --> 00:40:59,639
- If you're going to fire him...
- The fact that he stole your idea

743
00:40:59,764 --> 00:41:01,643
means that he cares enough to lie.

744
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,668
That's all I needed to know.

745
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,336
Rat pee.

746
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:08,256
That's a very nice idea.

747
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,900
House.

748
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:14,415
You left this in my office.

749
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:17,608
No, I didn't.

750
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:20,651
- So either I have a hole in my pocket,
- That's right

751
00:41:20,776 --> 00:41:22,588
I remember now, I stole it.

752
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,232
Because if you had gone up there
to check out my girlfriend,

753
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,530
you wouldn't have come back here
and lied to me about it.

754
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,365
You would've thrown her
right in my face.

755
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,777
You underestimate the entertainment
value of your obsessions.

756
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:35,700
And then there were all those calls
you weren't taking in front of me.

757
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:40,080
So I dialed the number
of the calls you weren't taking.

758
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,374
You're seeing a psychiatrist.

759
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,928
You had no right
to invade my privacy.

760
00:41:56,768 --> 00:41:58,340
- Is... Is that...?
- Yeah.

761
00:41:58,465 --> 00:41:59,891
It's irony.

762
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,116
God...

763
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:08,275
sent you.

764
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,327
Suddenly, you're not so fascinating.

765
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,938
You're spying on your team.

766
00:42:18,354 --> 00:42:19,993
Prioritize, wilson.

767
00:42:20,118 --> 00:42:22,372
Is that what you really want
to torture me about right now?

768
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,963
I don't want to torture you at all.
I think this is a great thing.

769
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:27,212
Not something you have to drive
an hour out of town

770
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,795
to shroud in mystery.

771
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,903
Whining on someone's couch.
That's an excellent use of my time.

772
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:34,324
Maybe I'll discover that
my childhood wasn't perfect.

773
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:37,030
So your attitude about
therapy clearly hasn't changed.

774
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,041
And yet you went.

775
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:42,152
Which leads me to believe that
maybe something else has changed.

776
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:45,723
Maybe you think you can change.
I credit cuddy with that.

777
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:48,481
Not much credit to take,
because I'm not going back.

778
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:50,771
Oh, House, please...

779
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:53,069
I assume you went because
you're tired of screwing up

780
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,448
- Every chance you get at happiness.
- New contact. Delete contact.

781
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,627
Do not let the fact
that I found out about it...

782
00:42:58,752 --> 00:43:00,402
don't beat yourself up.

783
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:03,292
I'm not going back
because it doesn't work.

784
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:09,085
You'll end up alone.
