1
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,389
Are you ever coming to bed?

2
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,633
I still say I'm a vegetarian.

3
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:53,886
You can say that you're an astronaut,
but that doesn't make it true.

4
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:56,115
A salmon is not a vegetable,
Frankie.

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,557
Apparently, eight out of ten commenters
agree with you.

6
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,143
Except for the part where you said,
"I believe what I want to believe".

7
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:05,461
- That they found a little judgmental.
- You blogged our argument?

8
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:08,517
I asked you
to quit talking about me.

9
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:10,783
I don't want a bunch of people
that I don't know

10
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:12,947
hearing stuff
that's meant to be between me and you.

11
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,716
I write about my life.

12
00:01:15,562 --> 00:01:18,647
- And you're a big part of that.
- I want to be a big part of your life.

13
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:20,830
But I don't want to be
a big part of their lives.

14
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:23,525
Take it down, erase it, delete it.

15
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,010
Make it go away.

16
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:36,178
It's 2:00 in the morning.
The walls are made out of tissue paper.

17
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:38,556
I gotta be up in 3 hours
to do a wiring job in Edison.

18
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,826
I'm sorry.
We'll try to hold it down.

19
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:41,951
Sorry.

20
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:44,645
Frankie, what happened?

21
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,166
Something's wrong.

22
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,777
We need a police car
at 152 Haverhill.

23
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,934
What are you two talking about?

24
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,240
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,663
- Are you all right?
- I think it's coming from my gums.

26
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,977
R[H]ésus AB+ Team

Arrow - Benj - ShalimarFox

29
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:46,332
- What are you doing tonight?
- Masturbating.

30
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,353
I'd invite you,
but people are already talking.

31
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:52,978
It's pathetic. You divide your nights
between porn and the discovery channel.

32
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:56,356
Right. Playing dance dance revolution
is a much better choice.

33
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:58,482
That was a gift from a patient,

34
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:00,907
and it happens to be great exercise.

35
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,981
I mean, who rents porn anymore?
Can't you get these on the Internet?

36
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:09,647
You can. But you can't get disc two
with the director's commentary.

37
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,920
Come out with me tonight.
I'm going speed dating.

38
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:15,023
You mean you're dating on meth?
Count me in.

39
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:17,488
You need to meet somebody.
This way, you meet 20 somebodies.

40
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,798
Over a five-minute discussion of Proust?
Speed dating's a meat market.

41
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:23,452
Yeah, dozens of women
just waiting to be hit on.

42
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,331
Your odds of a happy ending are nearly
as good as staying home, watching porn.

43
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,175
You plan on doing any work?

44
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,136
I thought I might do a little
light doctoring in the afternoon.

45
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,053
28-year-old female
sudden unexplained coagulopathy.

46
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:46,867
- Could be congenital thrombocytopenia.
- Platelets look normal.

47
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,978
Patient makes money
doing freelance photography.

48
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,679
Some photographic processes
produce toxic gases.

49
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,309
She's a blogger. I can't see her photos
being anything but digital.

50
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,278
What does she blog?
Politics? Dominatrix? Cooking?

51
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,497
- 'Cause I need recipes.
- It's a personal journal.

52
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:02,032
- I don't get putting your life online.
- It's not that crazy.

53
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,993
Privacy's basically
a modern invention.

54
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:07,393
Towns used to be too small
for anybody to keep any secrets.

55
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:10,723
What if it's not the platelets,
but the glue that holds 'em together?

56
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:13,085
Thrombin and Von Willebrand factor
are normal.

57
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:16,576
And knowing too much about each other
is exactly why people leave small towns

58
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:17,892
and move to the city.

59
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:20,871
And a lot of people choose to stay
because, in return for zero privacy,

60
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:22,974
you get community, connection.

61
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,899
Big red as for our tunics.

62
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,016
Connections are for airports.

63
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,602
For people,
we have over 300 cable channels.

64
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,569
Her photos may be digital. Doesn't mean
she couldn't have been exposed

65
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:34,987
to some other toxin.
We should search the apartment.

66
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:37,512
Eeny, meeny, miny,
Thirteen and tiny.

67
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:44,325
This one's locked.

68
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,928
I'm surprised you took
the pro-community position.

69
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,135
I have friends. I like people.

70
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,860
You also like secrets.

71
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,670
You deny it,
it sort of proves my point.

72
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,965
When we're left to our own devices,
we make lousy choices.

73
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:05,735
Ignore it.

74
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,573
I can hear you in there.

75
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,143
Open the door,
or I'm calling the cops.

76
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,853
We're 4 stories up,
but there's a fire escape over there.

77
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,879
The ledge might be wide enough.

78
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:19,013
We're doctors.
We aren't stealing anything.

79
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:20,888
We're collecting samples.

80
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,365
- Who are you?
- The neighbor.

81
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,740
Did they say
that you could come in here and...

82
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:28,619
- What do you know about them?
- Not much.

83
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,246
The guy works a lot.
I see Frankie around.

84
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,177
We argue a few times a week,
and then we go back about our business.

85
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,460
- Why?
- Frankie's got some strong opinions.

86
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:39,046
Wants to recycle
every molecule of trash.

87
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:41,507
You take
the anti-recycling position?

88
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,956
Trash piling up for composting's
attracting the rats.

89
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,831
I had to put down poison.

90
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,807
- It's her private drawer.
- She said she doesn't have any secrets.

91
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,350
I'm taking her at her word.

92
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:54,132
Is there any chance
Frankie touched the rat poison?

93
00:05:54,257 --> 00:05:57,982
She grabbed a chunk of it
right out of the mouth of the schnauzer.

94
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,568
Now every time I put the stuff down,
she picks it back up.

95
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:29,971
- You brought a date?
- He seemed to think it was a good idea.

96
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:32,975
- You need to dive back into the pool.
- And he has to swim in ours?

97
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,653
You go to a bar,
you bring your ugly friends.

98
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,446
It's not a beauty pageant.

99
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,440
Life is a beauty pageant.

100
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:42,401
Little girls who kiss frogs
expect them to turn into you.

101
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,572
Come on.

102
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:45,779
- I'm not that good-looking.
- Yeah, you are.

103
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:48,782
You kind of are.

104
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,218
So you attribute every relationship

105
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:53,534
I've ever had to the height
of my cheekbones?

106
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,039
Just the beginning.

107
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:57,207
- The rest is your hair.
- This is ridiculous.

108
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,220
Women aren't as distracted
by appearances as we are.

109
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:01,503
They look deeper.

110
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,298
You wanna bet?

111
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:07,911
You can't tell anyone you're a doctor.
You're unemployed.

112
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:10,679
You're also a little slow,
misunderstanding everything they say.

113
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:12,536
And lose the accent.

114
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,261
A hundred bucks says you still
walk out of here with a dozen names.

115
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:19,855
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fun is about to start.

116
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,706
When I strike this gong,
each man should sit at the table

117
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:24,039
you've been assigned.

118
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:26,542
When I strike it again, date's over,

119
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:27,667
move on.

120
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:32,284
I'm an oncologist.

121
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,771
My aunt and my grandma,
they both died from breast cancer.

122
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,874
Do you wanna talk about it?

123
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:42,205
I'm a diagnostician.

124
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:46,590
I find out what's wrong with people,
and I fix it.

125
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,559
Don't all doctors do that?

126
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:52,372
Yeah, but they can't dance
like I can.

127
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,851
- I play video games.
- Professionally?

128
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:01,772
I wish, bro.

129
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:06,323
After six months of chemo,
we thought he was out of the woods.

130
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,572
- I don't want kids.
- Check.

131
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,824
I'm thinking about going
from a "C" to a "D".

132
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,033
Quadruple check.

133
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,120
And I'm on fire for the lord.

134
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,671
- I'm a chocolatier.
- I could tell by your hips.

135
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:24,419
Yeah, I guess I could afford
to lose a few pounds.

136
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:28,365
I don't think I know anybody
who died of cancer.

137
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,490
Thank God.

138
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,344
For you, I mean.
Obviously.

139
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,712
Except my cat.

140
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,356
She died a few months ago.

141
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:40,432
- I hate these things.
- What, are you here at gunpoint?

142
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:42,158
You need me to call 911?

143
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:43,522
Friend dragged me.

144
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:45,941
She keeps trying to fix my life.

145
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,860
Which, admittedly,
could use it, but...

146
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,504
still annoying.

147
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:52,096
You like puzzles.

148
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:56,076
I hoped my job would let me
play with puzzles all day long,

149
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:57,953
but it didn't work out that way.

150
00:08:58,312 --> 00:08:59,662
Police detective.

151
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,484
Turns out criminals are idiots.

152
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,749
If they're not gonna bother
to challenge you,

153
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,224
what's the point?

154
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,632
Is there a fire alarm we could pull?

155
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
Maybe get out of here.

156
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:15,316
Except...

157
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,252
maybe you're just too "swoft".

158
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,934
- Beg your pardon.
- Swoft.

159
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,853
It's one of your crossword answers.

160
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,880
I believe it means lying manipulator

161
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,900
who tells men
anything they want to hear.

162
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,194
You brought a prop
as a conversation starter.

163
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,856
Folded the paper to make it look read,
filled in some answers,

164
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:35,741
you couldn't be bothered to work at it,
so you just put in random letters.

165
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:38,580
You have some natural talent
as a liar,

166
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,536
but not enough brains
to see it through.

167
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,496
I'm gonna assume you're not a cop.

168
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:45,748
Are the five minutes up?

169
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,846
These women would welcome
a call from you.

170
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:01,083
And these women would
welcome a call from you.

171
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,818
My.

172
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:19,455
It's nice to have visitors.

173
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,224
- I'm updating my blog.
- And I'm reading it.

174
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:26,004
You realize you're in the same room?

175
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,377
Sorry.

176
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,213
I've been thinking.

177
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,082
And I'm sure I washed my hands
after I threw out the rat poison.

178
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,710
Apparently you did it multiple times
over a course of days.

179
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:39,596
- Can't be too certain.
- You must be Dr. Foreman.

180
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,481
Got to get back to work.
Take it easy.

181
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:47,396
What? She reads my blog.

182
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,776
I don't think
you're condescending at all.

183
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,276
That's not what I wrote.

184
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:57,531
When you were taking my history,
I told you I went whitewater rafting,

185
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,620
and you said,
"it was unlikely to be related".

186
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:02,743
I was just giving information.
Let's face it. You got a little snarky.

187
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:05,706
- You can't convey a tone in writing.
- I just put what you said.

188
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,676
If you don't want people
to think that,

189
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,793
maybe you shouldn't say
condescending things.

190
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,280
Can this wait a second?
'Cause I have to pee.

191
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:20,929
I think people behave badly
because there are no records

192
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:22,431
of what we say or do.

193
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,047
And nobody believes anymore
that god's watching.

194
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:26,587
God's not, but I am.

195
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:30,012
Everything is on the record,
including everything I do.

196
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:34,401
I don't think my pee
is supposed to be mud-colored.

197
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,240
We were wrong about the rat poison.

198
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,203
Coagulopathy plus kidney
equals what?

199
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,924
Hemolytic uremic syndrome.

200
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,711
- Normal creatinine levels.
- She has elevated cholesterol.

201
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:55,542
Can't find my pornos.

202
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,801
- Have you tried offering a reward?
- Gaucher's disease.

203
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:02,458
It would affect her ability
to synthesize vitamin K.

204
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,432
She's on a semi-vegetarian diet.
She gets plenty of vitamin K.

205
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,431
Sjogren's is more likely.

206
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:10,937
You moved them while you were dusting.
I checked the drawers, windowsill,

207
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:12,872
dvd player in your room.

208
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:14,983
The quiet ones
are always deeply repressed.

209
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,508
I returned them to the store.

210
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,322
She had a fish dinner.
Could be haff disease causing rhabdo.

211
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,893
What? Why did you
return them to the store?

212
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:26,756
It's no trouble. I had to stop next-door
for my dry cleaning anyway.

213
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,793
Sjogren's wouldn't inhibit
the clotting enzymes,

214
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,957
- infiltrate the kidneys...
- So does haff disease.

215
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,959
I'm not thanking you.
I'm asking you why.

216
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,449
Because if I did happen
to bring a woman home last night,

217
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:39,800
I wanted it to be a porn-free zone.

218
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,363
You do realize things
don't have to be socks

219
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,806
to go into a sock drawer.

220
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,516
I'm sorry.
Horribly, horribly sorry.

221
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,154
I thought you'd...

222
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:52,942
watched them all.

223
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,193
You completely ruined my morning.

224
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,760
I had to pull out
your old family photos.

225
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:02,103
Your mom was pretty hot.

226
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:08,203
Haff disease fits the timing best.

227
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,913
Start her on saline and mannitol.

228
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:22,008
You reading your patient's blog?

229
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,070
You should.

230
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:26,841
Could be some clues.

231
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,100
Too many.
Be like doing a whole body scan.

232
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,144
Send us up eight blind alleys.

233
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:33,937
Chase is doing it.

234
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,021
She mentions you.

235
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:39,177
She's never met me.

236
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:41,826
You're an unseen presence,

237
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:44,489
- Like the wizard of Oz.
- He was a fraud.

238
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,700
She couldn't have gone
with Keyser Soze?

239
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:49,327
Speaking of movies
that don't make any sense,

240
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,872
I stopped at the rental store
to get those pornos back.

241
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:55,614
I told the guy I was so grateful
that you'd returned them.

242
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:56,751
Guess what.

243
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:58,638
You only returned two.

244
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:00,994
You lost the third.

245
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:05,423
Decent of you to pay for it,
not let them put it on my bill.

246
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:06,598
You know...

247
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:10,561
- I can explain what happened.
- I'm sure you could.

248
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:13,588
But rather than listen to your lies,
I thought it'd be more fun

249
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:16,289
to drive all over town
and get another copy.

250
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:18,972
You have it here?

251
00:14:32,096 --> 00:14:33,460
Oh, God!

252
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:36,932
Okay, first,

253
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,326
that's not me.

254
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,851
It's not... Mostly not...

255
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,481
I was in college.

256
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:46,356
My roommate was minoring in film.

257
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,720
Are you hyperventilating?

258
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,513
Remember that covering
your mouth and one nostril can help.

259
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:53,558
He had to get this in
for some grade,

260
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,060
and he was desperate.

261
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,854
The only reason I did it was because
no one'd ever see it.

262
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:00,565
Who knew he'd become
an actual director?

263
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,190
He's not a director.

264
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,652
He's an artist.

265
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:06,863
The way he plays with light
and darkness and...

266
00:15:07,636 --> 00:15:08,636
Boobs.

267
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:10,403
Look! That's not me.

268
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,159
<i>What are you?
Where are you taking me?</i>

269
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,840
<i>Be not afraid.</i>

270
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:17,832
<i>The forest nymphs have taught me
how to please a woman.</i>

271
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:22,522
That's not me!
I mean, you can see it's not me.

272
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:27,155
He added extra scenes

273
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,885
so he could release it as a porno.

274
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,891
Be not afraid, Wilson.

275
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:32,916
You took risks for your art.

276
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:39,836
No one...

277
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,143
Look at me.

278
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,310
No one can know about this.

279
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:47,601
From this moment on,
my lips are sealed.

280
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,856
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

281
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:57,547
Be not afraid.

282
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,067
Find anything?

283
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,314
Relevant? No.

284
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,009
Interesting. I guess.

285
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,664
There's nothing she doesn't share.

286
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:12,304
"Angry sex is overrated.

287
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,161
"How can he expect me to be aroused
when I'm so pissed at him?"

288
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:17,392
That might earn her a new kidney.

289
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,811
An hour after she blogged
about her kidney failure,

290
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:22,355
the hospital got a call
from Singapore.

291
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,940
One reader
asking how hard it would be to donate.

292
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,762
How good-looking am I?

293
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:35,607
I'm not asking
if you're attracted to me.

294
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:37,496
I'm looking for an objective answer.

295
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,581
Then it's an appropriate question.

296
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,867
Last night,
I acted like a complete tosser

297
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:44,544
to prove to House
women don't go out with me for my looks

298
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,255
Cost me a hundred bucks
and my definition of myself.

299
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:48,965
- And women.
- Date men.

300
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,550
They're not shallow at all.

301
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:53,678
- Everything's physical.
- We are physical beings.

302
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,246
Some more than others.

303
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:58,058
Please don't define my entire gender
based on one night.

304
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,726
What if the patient's problem
is physical, not emotional?

305
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,256
What if her lack of arousal
had nothing to do with their fight?

306
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:07,859
Sjogren's would inhibit
her normal secretions.

307
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,713
Sorry for keeping you up.

308
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,764
I thought it better
not to wait till morning.

309
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:16,939
No problem.

310
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:18,513
I'm a night owl.

311
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:23,655
So you think I might have
this Sjogren's

312
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,507
'cause of my lack of discharge?

313
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,588
It's lucky you wrote about that.

314
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,132
A little crazy, you're thinking,
to share that much?

315
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Not crazy.

316
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:35,625
Unusual to be so intimate
with people you don't know.

317
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,138
But I do know them.

318
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,015
They read my blog,
I comment on theirs.

319
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,343
Cause you haven't met someone physically
doesn't mean you don't know them.

320
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:44,268
Are you in a relationship?

321
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,625
- It recently ended.
- I'm sorry.

322
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,950
Lie flat on your back all the way.

323
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,942
You saw each other every day, right?

324
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,944
Did you tell her
about what you were thinking?

325
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:01,900
Or did you just talk
about where you were going to dinner

326
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:04,175
and who needed to do the laundry?

327
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:08,044
Is that what your relationship
with Taylor is like?

328
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,072
Maybe a little.

329
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:14,217
You know, he's great,
but sometimes it's easier

330
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,691
to open up to people
who aren't looking at you.

331
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,082
Lie flat for the X-ray.

332
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,183
I'm not comfortable on my back.

333
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,374
- Can't we do it this way?
- Did you strain a muscle?

334
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:29,336
What's wrong?

335
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,837
I've booked her in
for heart surgery.

336
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:39,325
I was doing a sialogram

337
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,211
and she didn't wanna lie
on her back.

338
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,789
That's a complaint you hear from people
with heart valve issues, it fits.

339
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,460
Sjogren's damaged her heart,
causing clotting and kidney problems.

340
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,379
You based all that on the fact
that she didn't want to lie down?

341
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,800
That, and the cardiac echo I performed
after she didn't want to lie down.

342
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,221
Her mitral valve is nearly gone.

343
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,389
Which means she's nearly gone.

344
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,217
God, you're pretty.

345
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,274
We can replace the mitral valve
with a pig valve or with a plastic one.

346
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:15,578
From an actual pig?

347
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:18,990
It's the better choice
if you want to have children someday.

348
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:21,678
A plastic valve requires you
to be on anticoagulants,

349
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:23,161
which cause birth defects.

350
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:26,873
On the other hand,
the pig valve wears out quickly,

351
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,584
so you'd need another heart surgery
in ten years.

352
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,008
I know you're on the fence
about having kids,

353
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,713
but Taylor really wants them.

354
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,342
It's in the blog.

355
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:40,637
You will need to agree on that decision
earlier than planned.

356
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:51,485
It's your call.

357
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,110
Can you pass me my laptop?

358
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,052
- Seriously?
- I want some feedback.

359
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,280
You really think
that asking strangers

360
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:04,494
for some off-the-top-of-their-head
response is gonna be helpful here?

361
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,664
A lot of your readers
are into animal rights.

362
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,706
They've got you 2/3 of the way
to vegan.

363
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,844
What are they gonna say about you
buying your life with thatof a pig?

364
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,835
Whatever they say,
I don't have to do it.

365
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,418
It won't work out that way,
And we're gonna have to live with this.

366
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,134
Please, Frankie.

367
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,900
Don't tell them.

368
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:27,183
If I start picking and choosing,
I'm being dishonest.

369
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,169
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:04,178
Though I should thank whoever taught you
how to please a woman.

371
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:11,823
Maybe it was the forest nymphs.

372
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,693
Get my <i>Vertigo</i> poster back.

373
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:27,138
Be not afraid, it's exact change.

374
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,178
I'm looking to get something
on House.

375
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,717
Couldn't you just ask the love nymphs
for the secret?

376
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:46,005
Don't!
My mission is to find something

377
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,630
House would not like to see made public
and make it public.

378
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,381
In.

379
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:55,563
You know him better than anyone,
why do you need me?

380
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,607
He'd leave nothing secret
around the condo.

381
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,484
You've worked in the same office.

382
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,252
On and off, for years.

383
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:02,996
Think back.

384
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,656
Any odd phone calls

385
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,247
or visitors from the past?

386
00:22:06,372 --> 00:22:08,409
He brings prostitutes
into the hospital,

387
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,624
and he gambles with bookies
'cause he's too lazy to go to the OTB.

388
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,449
And you're asking for...

389
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,547
He's reading <i>The Golden Bowl</i>.

390
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:23,606
By Henry Kames?

391
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,027
He's not really reading it.

392
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:29,389
I don't understand.

393
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:33,393
That book's at least 400 pages long.
What he's reading is half that thick.

394
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:36,821
Maybe he's reading a version
with a smaller font.

395
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,565
He's not using his glasses.

396
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:41,567
Good point.

397
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:43,528
He took the cover off

398
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,250
and put it onto this other book
so no one'd know what he was reading.

399
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,625
Whatever it is, he's ashamed of it.

400
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,733
I'm going with plastic.

401
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,839
It just makes more sense.

402
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,008
I don't want another operation
later.

403
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,843
That's not why you're doing this.

404
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:12,932
When you were first telling me about
why you love the Internet, you said

405
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,892
that no one has to be alone again.

406
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,310
Whoever you are, whatever you love,

407
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,709
you can connect with someone.

408
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:22,160
If you want to recreate
the Boston tea party

409
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,554
while dressed
as imperial storm troopers,

410
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,655
you can find ten people in the world
that have always wanted to do that.

411
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,308
That hasn't changed.

412
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:30,867
But you have.

413
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:34,662
This thing that you do,
it's not about connection anymore.

414
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,473
It's about an audience.
It's a performance,

415
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:39,895
and you've got one eye
on the number of hits.

416
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:43,215
You've turned our lives
into their entertainment.

417
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:50,884
You're smart, you're fun to read,
it's okay.

418
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,556
But don't give them this.

419
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:59,869
Or if you do, don't...

420
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:02,325
Expect me to be here.

421
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,658
It's a good cover choice,
it's not like anyone would pick it up.

422
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:14,702
It's Cameron's favorite book.

423
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:18,790
- I don't even know what it's about.
- Don't do that to yourself.

424
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:21,334
What the hell?

425
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:29,836
Giving him a computer
is like giving plutonium to Dr. No.

426
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:31,699
Got it.

427
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:39,345
<i>Step by step:
Sermons for everyday life?</i>

428
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:47,735
These are literal sermons,
written by a minister.

429
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,989
Loving thy neighbor even when hisstereo
is keeping you up at night.

430
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:54,792
- Why would he read this?
- Why would he hide it?

431
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,922
He reads the Bible,
he reads the Koran,

432
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:59,618
he says he likes to know
what mistakes people are making.

433
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:01,749
You think he's sincere?

434
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,626
That he's getting something
out of this?

435
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:05,118
I don't know.

436
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,563
What a hypocrite.

437
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:11,855
How can we use this
in a cruel yet funny way?

438
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,015
You know what?

439
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,471
Don't mention this to anyone.

440
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:21,923
What was the point?

441
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:30,904
Are you gonna be here
when I wake up?

442
00:25:36,824 --> 00:25:39,024
I hate that you don't have a blog.

443
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:42,725
I hate that I don't know
what you're thinking.

444
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:46,306
Let's not get into it right now.

445
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:49,116
We need to get you through surgery.

446
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:52,924
I don't wanna go in there
knowing that you'll stick with me

447
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,929
'cause that's what good guys do,

448
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,806
- But once I'm better, you'll be gone.
- Let's not get into it now.

449
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,059
It hurts.

450
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,604
- Is it her heart?
- No, it's here.

451
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:11,194
Get her inside.

452
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:21,202
Your appendix burst,
we had to remove it.

453
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:24,527
And the biopsy confirms
it was full of abnormal cells

454
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:26,402
consistent with lymphoma.

455
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:32,197
I have cancer?

456
00:26:32,821 --> 00:26:35,218
We've postponed
putting in the new valve.

457
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,886
I guess we do chemo
and all that stuff?

458
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:41,015
Apparently you've had this
for some time.

459
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:43,851
When your appendix burst,
it was like a dam giving way.

460
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,187
The cells went streaming
throughout your body.

461
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:49,190
So you'll treat,
but you don't expect it to work.

462
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,192
That's why no valve.

463
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:52,762
It's pointless.

464
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:56,113
Our dean of medicine
has approved an experimental treatment.

465
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,741
We use your unique
cancer cell signature

466
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,057
to create a targeted
lymphoma vaccine.

467
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:03,522
Okay, so that'll cure me?

468
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,707
Well, we're not actually sure
what it'll do,

469
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,163
but the intention
is to train your immune system

470
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:12,257
to recognize and kill cells
bearing the same malignant signature

471
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,359
while leaving healthy cells alone.

472
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,513
But, as Dr. Foreman says,

473
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,067
it's experimental.

474
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:19,192
I see.

475
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,264
Without it,
what time are we talking about?

476
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,452
- An exact prognosis is impossible.
- How about a guess?

477
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:25,977
Something, please.

478
00:27:27,932 --> 00:27:30,632
Based on people
in situations like yours...

479
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:32,103
Maybe a year.

480
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,237
Baby,

481
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:39,807
whatever we have to do, we'll do.

482
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:41,617
I can take care of you.

483
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,335
I can work from home.

484
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:47,689
Sounds good.

485
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,264
Thank you for letting me know.

486
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,671
We'll start with the treatment
whenever it's ready.

487
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,307
Is she being a good soldier,
or is she in denial?

488
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,560
Denial's not unusual
for a first reaction.

489
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:09,206
Or it could be a symptom.
Some lymphomas affect cognition.

490
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:11,353
If it is denial,
she needs time to process.

491
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:14,608
If it's a symptom, hopefully treatment
with the vaccine will help.

492
00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:25,818
Can I borrow your car?

493
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,043
She gave me the keys.

494
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,149
You're a doctor.
She was doing you a favor.

495
00:28:34,274 --> 00:28:36,185
She barely knows me.

496
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:40,231
I've been deluding myself that
I'm actually connecting with people.

497
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:48,472
The first person I fell in love with
turned out to be a total tool.

498
00:28:49,357 --> 00:28:51,686
I mean, he came across
all funny and charming

499
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,481
and thoughtful, but it was an act.

500
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,650
He saw something he wanted, and he knew
he had to behave a way to get it.

501
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:00,780
In retrospect, the fact
that I was 17 and he was 30

502
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,358
should have been a clue.

503
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,150
Figuring out who people are
takes time.

504
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:09,156
It takes twice as much time
if they're trying to impress you.

505
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:12,116
Now I could take from this
that anyone who loans me their car

506
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:14,219
has an ulterior motive, or...

507
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:17,378
I can accept
that it's just a nice thing to do

508
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:20,043
and take people as they come.

509
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:25,314
You wanna do the first injection?

510
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:44,281
Why are you reading a book
by a unitarian minister?

511
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,159
Book club.

512
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,160
- Oprah was going on...
- I'm serious.

513
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:50,162
This... This is messed up.

514
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:52,555
Patient wrote it.

515
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:54,754
You've never treated
a patient with this name.

516
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:55,960
I looked it up.

517
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:00,214
It's an assignment
from my therapist.

518
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:01,491
No, it wasn't.

519
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:03,134
No one you respect

520
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,403
would give you this
and expect it to be helpful.

521
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:07,930
- It's a book!
- Of sermons.

522
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,890
For anyone else,
spiritually enlightening.

523
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,048
For you, it's practically
a psychotic break.

524
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:22,449
I know that you have trouble
sometimes with the pain

525
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:24,653
without the vicodin. Is that it?

526
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:26,826
Are you so out of options,

527
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,702
you're looking for answers
in what you consider irrationality?

528
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,121
I'm all right. Trust me.

529
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:37,376
Are you all right
because you're back on vicodin?

530
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,420
I said, "trust me".

531
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:43,799
I know this means something.

532
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:45,399
Do you mind?

533
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,438
I haven't finished it yet.

534
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,126
Thanks for the gift.

535
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:07,145
Obviously differs
from my own personal beliefs,

536
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,618
but if these stories have helped you
through some spiritual turmoil...

537
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:14,786
Read chapter six,
entitled "shut the hell up".

538
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:18,000
I appreciated the inscription
about the benefits of prayer

539
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,336
before medical treatments.
I think it's great

540
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,254
you've been called
to witness by the Lord.

541
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,122
Chapter two, "bite me".

542
00:31:30,143 --> 00:31:33,012
Thirteen's giving our patient
her third vaccine injection.

543
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:35,840
- She's responding well so far.
- Where'd you get all these copies?

544
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:37,728
- It's out of print.
- I called the author.

545
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,034
He's got cartons of the thing
in his basement.

546
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,107
You called him?
What'd you say?

547
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,023
That I knew some people who could
benefit spiritually from the book.

548
00:31:45,148 --> 00:31:46,722
Did you mention me?

549
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:53,200
Fever's at 104.

550
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,452
The antibodies tripped
her autoimmune response.

551
00:31:55,577 --> 00:31:57,278
The vaccine is killing her.

552
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:05,783
Well, clearly it's not working.
You have to stop the vaccine.

553
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,759
Sure. Give up.
Let her die on schedule.

554
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,983
It's better than speeding up
the schedule.

555
00:32:11,108 --> 00:32:12,452
How quickly did this come on?

556
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:15,301
She was all right when I woke her
this afternoon for the second injection.

557
00:32:15,426 --> 00:32:18,147
Of the stimulating agent,
which, added to the first injection,

558
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,377
switched her immune reaction
into overdrive.

559
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:21,950
Why was she sleeping?

560
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:25,484
Who can sleep in a hospital
during the daytime?

561
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,279
I'm not surprised. She's tired.
She's always been a night owl.

562
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,812
Just by treating her,
we've disrupted her schedule.

563
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:32,690
Is that what her blog says?

564
00:32:32,815 --> 00:32:34,633
- She's a night owl?
- No, she told me.

565
00:32:34,758 --> 00:32:36,996
In what tense? Is? Was?

566
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:38,289
Will have been?

567
00:32:39,262 --> 00:32:40,291
I'm not sure.

568
00:32:40,713 --> 00:32:41,932
What are you onto?

569
00:32:42,057 --> 00:32:43,967
Look at the time stamp on this post.

570
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:46,592
2:30 a.m.
Here's one at 4:00 a.m.

571
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,653
Whatever he's onto
doesn't change the fact

572
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:51,223
that she has lymphoma
and we gave her a dangerous vaccine.

573
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:52,849
- We need to...
- Six months ago,

574
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:54,763
she's posting in the daytime.

575
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,905
Two years ago, daytime.

576
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:00,321
- That's her natural rhythm.
- Day-night reversal.

577
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:03,194
- Sign of liver disease?
- Which doesn't fit lymphoma.

578
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,815
But we know she has lymphoma.

579
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:08,258
We know she has the cell atypia
that indicates lymphoma.

580
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,169
Biopsy her liver.

581
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:20,553
That was pretty cool
what I did, right?

582
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,480
You wanna make out?

583
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,006
You don't have lymphoma.

584
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,897
But my appendix
was full of cancer cells.

585
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:34,351
Your appendix was full of cells
that showed a lymphocytic atypia.

586
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:36,749
We now think they were
a granulomatous buildup

587
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:38,641
from some unknown cause.

588
00:33:41,674 --> 00:33:42,674
So...

589
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,253
I'm not dying?

590
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:52,112
You're actually dying
more quickly than we thought.

591
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,582
Unless we figure out
what's causing your liver failure...

592
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:03,915
You have three or four days.

593
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:16,076
What the hell do you mean
I have three or four days?

594
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:20,837
Well, we're past denial.

595
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,603
Maybe we didn't cause the fever.

596
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:54,144
We gave her the vaccine,
and her fever spiked.

597
00:34:54,269 --> 00:34:55,979
- Seems to me...
- But it persisted

598
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:58,233
after we took her off the vaccine.

599
00:34:58,358 --> 00:34:59,887
What if it's a new symptom?

600
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:07,276
So we add fever to cell atypia,
coagulopathy, kidney, heart, liver...

601
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:09,189
- It has to be an infection.
- Which one?

602
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,590
No one she knows is sick.
She hasn't traveled anywhere.

603
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:14,200
There's nothing in the history.
Nothing in her blog.

604
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:16,363
There has to be something unique
to this infection.

605
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,824
Something about its transmission
and the way it manifests.

606
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:21,550
There has to be something
she's not telling us.

607
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:22,703
There isn't.

608
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:26,507
She's told us,
and everyone else, everything.

609
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,100
Start her
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

610
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:37,637
Since we know everything,

611
00:35:37,962 --> 00:35:40,304
we might as well treat
for everything.

612
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:44,743
I picked up a copy of the book
that Chase left in the lounge.

613
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:48,073
If you're gonna be this way,

614
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,050
I'm not gonna invite you
to my baptism.

615
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,700
First time I'd seen
the real dust jacket.

616
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:56,046
The inside back flap,
there was a picture of the author.

617
00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:59,605
Imagine how surprised I was
when I recognized him.

618
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,919
Your biological father
is a minister?

619
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,723
Natural selection
is not an infallible force.

620
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,900
I don't get it.

621
00:37:13,379 --> 00:37:15,623
Okay, he was a friend of the family.

622
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:17,648
You'd only known him
when you were a kid.

623
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:19,993
But if you wanted to meet him now,

624
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:23,231
get an idea of what he's like,
why not just go talk to him?

625
00:37:24,998 --> 00:37:27,786
"Hi, it's Greg.
You slept with my mother."

626
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,917
You're capable of it.

627
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,839
I was mildly curious.

628
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:35,025
Enough to read a book,
not make a phone call.

629
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,262
Please. You didn't read this.
You studied it.

630
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,298
Why?

631
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:42,683
All your life, you've thought
this was crap.

632
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,353
You can't suddenly turn around

633
00:37:45,478 --> 00:37:48,472
and build a whole new worldview
based on crap.

634
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:51,406
Crap.

635
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,434
You better not be faking this
just to get out of a tough conversation.

636
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,200
Do you poop?

637
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:10,745
Come on. Everybody poops.

638
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:12,792
I read the book in medical school.

639
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,792
- Sinkers or floaters?
- This is the wizard.

640
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:19,101
Greasy and soft
or hard and pellet-like?

641
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,636
Floaters and...

642
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,990
the first one.

643
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:35,494
You just had to be so swoft.

644
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:41,276
You're a hypocrite. No lies, no secrets,
but everything stops at your colon.

645
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:44,321
4,000 pages, not one word about bms.

646
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,477
- I bet yours don't smell at all.
- Nobody wants to hear about that stuff.

647
00:38:47,602 --> 00:38:50,243
People who don't really
care about you don't. But doctors might.

648
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,853
The icky stuff changed,
right, a few months ago?

649
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:54,212
I became a vegetarian.

650
00:38:54,337 --> 00:38:56,823
A lot of people misunderstand
how a vegetarian diet works.

651
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:59,002
You take in less unusable material,

652
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,630
and your waste gets more efficient.
Harder and rounder.

653
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,764
Just look at the feces of rabbits.

654
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,379
- I think I might have some.
- Malabsorption.

655
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:08,637
Her system's not retaining
the necessary nutrients.

656
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,223
A G.I. infection
causes malabsorption,

657
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,964
granulomatous buildup of cells.

658
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:15,433
It's not contagious
since no one around her got sick...

659
00:39:15,558 --> 00:39:16,958
Whipple's disease.

660
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:19,927
Let's split the credit.

661
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:22,222
Start her on co-trimoxazole.

662
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,316
We all need some secrets.

663
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:28,154
As long as they don't kill us,
they keep us safe and warm.

664
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:34,275
I'm...

665
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,821
I'm gonna be okay?

666
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:41,530
You'll still need a new heart valve,
and you'll be on meds for a few years,

667
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:43,205
but, basically, yeah.

668
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:44,548
Your odds are good.

669
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:02,274
Thank God.

670
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:09,446
I think I wanna go
with the pig valve.

671
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:25,172
I know you'll go crazy
if you don't tell people.

672
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:27,812
Thank god you're an enabler.

673
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,129
Do you think people can actually
know each other better

674
00:40:37,254 --> 00:40:38,769
on the internet than face-to-face?

675
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,687
Faces can be distracting,

676
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:44,412
but there's nothing better
than looking into someone's eyes, and...

677
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,276
everything that goes with that.

678
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:47,786
I don't know.

679
00:40:48,284 --> 00:40:51,071
People meet,
they like something superficial,

680
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:54,065
and then they fill in the blanks
with whatever they want to believe.

681
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,619
Why are you so hung up on this?

682
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:59,136
I refuse to believe it's all because
you just noticed you have a nice face.

683
00:40:59,399 --> 00:41:00,999
You just came off a relationship.

684
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,367
You know things go deeper than...

685
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:08,425
Is that what this is about?

686
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:10,258
You and Cameron?

687
00:41:11,945 --> 00:41:14,045
I was the one that pursued her.

688
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:16,598
Maybe I was just filling in
the blanks.

689
00:41:16,864 --> 00:41:17,864
Maybe...

690
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,525
the first reaction was right.

691
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,651
We were just two people
who were in proximity

692
00:41:23,776 --> 00:41:26,004
and found each other attractive,
and I never...

693
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:26,983
<i>Paranoia.</i>

694
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:29,008
You felt something real.

695
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,183
So did she.

696
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:32,739
Don't try to take it back now.

697
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:36,889
Can I borrow your car?

698
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,968
Why would it make more sense for you
to read your father's book

699
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:53,539
- than to go talk with him?
- Can you write a book?

700
00:41:53,883 --> 00:41:55,677
So I can stop talking to you?

701
00:42:03,463 --> 00:42:05,386
You weren't looking
for some big catharsis.

702
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:08,536
You didn't want to hug the guy.
You wanted to know how his head works.

703
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:09,817
How he thinks.

704
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:12,643
'Cause I'm fascinated
with how ministers think.

705
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,518
Because you're not ordinary.

706
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:16,690
You're way out there
on the fringe somewhere.

707
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:19,728
I'm your best friend, and half the time,
I don't understand you.

708
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,187
You're alone.

709
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:22,831
Been alone your whole life.

710
00:42:25,748 --> 00:42:27,892
When you read that book,
you were hoping that

711
00:42:28,017 --> 00:42:30,612
somewhere, underneath
all that talk of god,

712
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:32,368
there would be a way of thinking,

713
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:34,475
a mind that you could recognize.

714
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,500
You wanted what we all want.

715
00:42:36,797 --> 00:42:39,376
The power to transform
into any water-based object?

716
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:42,851
To look across the gulf and know
there's someone else like you.

717
00:42:45,017 --> 00:42:46,645
At least tell me this...

718
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,543
did you find something there?

719
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:51,691
Underneath the God stuff...

720
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,279
More God stuff.

721
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:01,978
Get maintenance to take that down.
