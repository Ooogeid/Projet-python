00:00:02,622 --> 00:00:04,045
We will anger the Americans,

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,793
slipping out like this.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,056
If your son was a student

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,494
at one of the greatest
universities in the world...

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,216
So make him come to you.

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,811
You're protected near the U.N.

7
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:17,370
Once we cross 42nd street...

8
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,894
As always, I appreciate
your caution, Joseph,

9
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,731
but, as always,
you have far too much of it.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,687
Stay down, sir.

11
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,172
Get on the ground.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,352
Get on the ground.

13
00:00:57,302 --> 00:00:58,265


14
00:00:58,637 --> 00:00:59,975
I'm just serving process.

15
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,354
Your boss is being sued under title 18
of the United States code,

16
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,143
section 1350, for genocide,

17
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,362
crimes against humanity,

18
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:09,567
and torture.

19
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:15,700
Mr. President.

20
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,383
This is only a civil lawsuit.

21
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:19,858
We can ignore it.

22
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:28,393
Mr. President.

00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:06,333
- You want us to work for Foreman?
- Not permanently.

27
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:09,239
He is setting up interviews
to replace Taub and Thirteen,

28
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:10,896
but it might take a couple of weeks.

29
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:12,397
What happened to them?

30
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,523
He quit, and I had to let her go.

31
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:17,760
You actually fired your girlfriend?

32
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,848
You are both competent,
and I know I can work with you.

33
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,933
You really do know how to woo.

34
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:24,268
I need you.

35
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,605
It would be interesting.
We could work together.

36
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,648
Did you see who the patient is?

37
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,761
That's one of the reasons
it'll be interesting.

38
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:34,779
Dibala is one of the most repressive
dictators in the world.

39
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,906
You had no problem treating
a guy on death row.

40
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,727
Who was still in prison.

41
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:41,452
We fix Dibala, he gets on a plane
and executes half his country.

42
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:45,455
He's been repressing an ethnic rebellion
in the south, the Sitibi people.

43
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:47,708
It's getting worse.

44
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,187
Dibala is a guest
of the U.S. Government.

45
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:52,562
And he's been invited
to speak at the U.N.

46
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:55,939
I'm not asking you to love him.
I'm asking you to do your job.

47
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,286
Utterly incomprehensible.

48
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,626
And, of course, I'm talking
about you firing your girlfriend.

49
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,752
We weren't getting along
with her working under me.

50
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:08,745
- This'll help.
- Cameron and I work together.

51
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,648
But you weren't her boss.
And you stopped working together.

52
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,557
Why don't you just tell her
you were wrong?

53
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:15,032
Because I wasn't.

54
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:16,570
I know how this looks.

55
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,666
I know it might break us up.

56
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,726
But that's better
than definitely breaking us up,

57
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:23,023
which is what would
have happened otherwise.

58
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,846
Hemorrhagic ulcers in the lungs.

59
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,399
Oh, my God,

60
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:34,074
it's three years ago.

61
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,590
Does that mean I'm still crazy?

62
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,050
- You're back?
- You look good.

63
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:42,465
- We're just helping out because...
- I know. I just ran into Thirteen

64
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,591
while she was clearing out
her locker.

65
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:45,903
My condolences.

66
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:48,435
Although it's not like
she's the hottest woman in the world.

67
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,091
We haven't broken up.

68
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,064
- Are you back?
- Sort of.

69
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,611
- Did you get your license back?
- Not for a month or so.

70
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:57,862
So you'll be in charge.
I'm just gonna pitch in a little.

71
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,740
Dibala thinks
it was an assassination attempt.

72
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,248
Polonium,
like the Russian in London.

73
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,469
FBI checked the service
of process forms and his hotel room.

74
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,173
No radioactivity trails.

75
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,331
Acid reflux?

76
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,041
No history of asthma or heartburn.

77
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:15,345
He has a bug bite on his hands.
Malaria's endemic in his country.

78
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,089
Let's start him on coartem.

79
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,720
I don't want to step on any toes,

80
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,756
but I do have a higher duty
to the patient.

81
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,725
- If you have something to say, say it.
- You're rushing to a diagnosis

82
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,355
because you're rushing out of this room
because you're upset with me.

83
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,055
Although I wasn't the one
who made that asinine decision.

84
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,110
Do you have anything medical to say?

85
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:41,541
Poison fits better
because of the vomiting.

86
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,227
Bug bite might not be a bite.

87
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:44,916
It might be the start of chloracne.

88
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,638
Assassination attempt
through dioxin poisoning.

89
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,954
It's hard to detect.

90
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,433
Fits.

91
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,596
Start him on olestra.

92
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,426
You couldn't have just said
dioxin up front?

93
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:05,470
I was hoping you'd get there
on your own.

94
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,297
So I guess we should talk to Cuddy.

95
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:16,467
You are sure it is dioxin?

96
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,424
It's our best guess.

97
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:25,199
The olestra here binds to the poison
and flushes it out of your system.

98
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:27,743
- Where are you from, doctor?
- I'm Australian.

99
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,328
Do I hear a bit of the british?

100
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,114
Most people don't notice it.

101
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,177
Yeah, I kicked
around there for a while.

102
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,126
You went to medical school there?

103
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,928
Actually a year of seminary.

104
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:39,203
And you left.

105
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,430
There was a catholic mission
near my childhood village.

106
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,846
I liked the priests.
They were good people.

107
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:50,849
But when my two younger sisters

108
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:53,409
were dying from consumption,

109
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,010
it wasn't more priests we wanted.

110
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,863
I fired my girlfriend
because he said he was gone for good.

111
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,891
I need this in my life.

112
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,563
A week ago,
it was the last thing you needed.

113
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:12,538
It's a process.
I'm learning.

114
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,051
- And screwing me over as you go.
- Yeah, that's why I did it.

115
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:18,897
Sorry.

116
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:21,438
If you want,
I'll explain it to Thirteen.

117
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:22,673
He's not ready.

118
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,926
- He doesn't have his license.
- Then he can't practice.

119
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,503
But we'd be idiots
not to listen to him.

120
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,391
You're in charge,
he sits in on all the differentials.

121
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,691
Until you get your license back,
this is all unofficial.

122
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:37,980
No procedures, no patient contact.

123
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,525
Think I can probably deal
with that last one.

124
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:49,659
The only reason I let you go

125
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,062
is because our relationship
wouldn't work if I was in charge.

126
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,913
But I won't be in charge soon, so...

127
00:06:57,988 --> 00:06:59,793
I came to offer you
your old job back.

128
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:02,921
I know. I look bad.

129
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,206
But circumstances have changed.

130
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,448
- I don't want the job.
- Why not?

131
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:11,793
Because there's a much simpler
explanation for you firing me.

132
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:15,322
You wanted to break up with me,
but you were too weak to do it yourself.

133
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,144
Then why would I try
to hire you back?

134
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,648
Can we please

135
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
get some dinner tonight?

136
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:22,789
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,282
You're a follow-up?

138
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,917
You must not treat him.

139
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:38,832
Dibala killed my wife.

140
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:42,513
She was a trade unionist.

141
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,880
He took her

142
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,716
from our home...
while I was at work.

143
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:50,928
- Who took her?
- Dibala's youth labor league.

144
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,148
He pretends it's to get
young people off the street.

145
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,518
But he takes teenage boys
from the provinces

146
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:00,104
and feeds them drugs and alcohol

147
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:02,936
and teaches them how to torture.

148
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,976
They dumped her body in my yard
two weeks later.

149
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:09,863
They raped her.

150
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,567
They carved <i>inyenzi</i>,

151
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:13,787
cockroach,

152
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,401
onto her stomach

153
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:16,953
because she's Sitibi.

154
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,841
I'm very sorry,
but I can't discuss other patients.

155
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,579
You should talk to a lawyer,
talk to the U.N...

156
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,456
So they can sit and watch,
like they did in Rwanda?

157
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:29,193
There are 2 million Sitibi.

158
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,093
He's planning to massacre them all.

159
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,908
His radio stations
are talking about a final war

160
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,766
to exterminate the cockroaches.

161
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,197
He can't recover.

162
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,626
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,643
How was your first day of school?

164
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:58,036
Didn't pee once in the sandbox.

165
00:08:58,302 --> 00:08:59,529
How was it with Cuddy?

166
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:01,516
What did you think
I was talking about?

167
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,517
You didn't use garlic.

168
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,062
You didn't use it last night either.

169
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,626
We always use garlic
on chicken Florentine.

170
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,133
It tastes fine this way.

171
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,461
You seem to be losing
your sense of smell.

172
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,637
I think you're losing
your sense of mind.

173
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,110
I can check right now
if you pull my finger.

174
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,643
No, it's the...

175
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:26,732
Are you inventing
some big medical mystery here?

176
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,981
Because if you're imagining
things again...

177
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,153
You weren't wearing shoes
last night either.

178
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:34,900
Yes, shoes,

179
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:36,226
garlic...

180
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,907
I am vampire, Sookie.

181
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,962
I told you to get that echo fixed.

182
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,673
My downstairs neighbor,
after you moved in,

183
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:55,829
started complaining about the noise
and the cooking smells.

184
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:59,050
- What's his name?
- I don't want you making things worse.

185
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:02,178
He's on the condo board, and I'm trying
to get the back garden renovated.

186
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:05,646
The white coats taught me a whole bunch
of fun coping and relating skills.

187
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:09,742
He's not only a total jerk,
he's a decorated war hero

188
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,717
who lost an arm in Vietnam.

189
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,321
I mean, there's no winning
with this guy.

190
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,435
Coping skill number one...

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,010
complete avoidance.

192
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:20,226
You happy?

193
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:22,743
Booty call?

194
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,706
Give me 20 minutes to not shower.

195
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,013
- Patient's having a heart attack.
- Mask at 15, ladies.

196
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:28,877
Just thought you'd like to know.

197
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,754
Start of intravenous . Heparin.

198
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:38,804
Lassa fever.

199
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,976
You were mad I withheld it last time,
so I'm saying it right up front.

200
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,566
He's already stabilized,

201
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,373
so 40 ccs of ribavirin,

202
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:50,148
and we're home in time for <i>Ellen</i>.

203
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,651
I checked. There's no Lassa
in Dibala's country.

204
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,184
The rash is gone.
It rules out your dioxin theory.

205
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,657
He's running a fever,
which we can add to the heart,

206
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,243
- plus the lung ulcers.
- Ebola? Marburg?

207
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,067
Too long an incubation period.

208
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,715
Don't people sometimes travel?

209
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,880
To places that have,
you know, a fever

210
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,419
that originated
in the Nigerian town of Lassa?

211
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,818
He's been to three other countries
in the last two years:

212
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:15,242
here, Zimbabwe,
and Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

213
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,899
No Lassa there either.

214
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:18,635
Again.

215
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,005
Trypanosomiasis?

216
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:21,569
No sleep disturbances.

217
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:24,516
But fits best with the symptoms.
And it's geographically the most...

218
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:25,559
What?

219
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,133
The Egypt visit
was for the African union meeting,

220
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:31,140
where I'm guessing
he was meeting people from Africa.

221
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,568
Which includes Liberia, which sent
some members of their foreign ministry,

222
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:37,762
which has itself just been hit
by an outbreak of jock itch.

223
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,637
No, wait.
Not jock itch.

224
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,140
Lassa fever.

225
00:11:43,574 --> 00:11:45,202
I'll start the ribavirin.

226
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:48,081
I did say it up front.

227
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:51,107
It's great to have the old team
back together again, huh?

228
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,593
Yesterday, it's poisoning.
Today, Lassa fever.

229
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,054
- Maybe a specialist...
- Joseph!

230
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,680
Leave him alone.

231
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,518
These people
know what they are doing.

232
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:10,896
Are you married, doctor?

233
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,133
You have a girlfriend.

234
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,779
Judging by your tentative answer

235
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:22,348
and the complicated expression
on her face,

236
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,009
I believe that is she,
standing in the hallway.

237
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,367
I got a call from Douglas' department
at Princeton general.

238
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,214
They want me to interview with them.

239
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,883
Which is weird, because when I called
last week they had nothing available.

240
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:42,677
So I never sent in my resume.

241
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,807
- Douglas owes me a favor.
- Most people send chocolates.

242
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,983
I'd stand outside your apartment
all night

243
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:51,353
holding up a boom box,
but you hate '80s music.

244
00:12:58,261 --> 00:12:59,711
So, about dinner...

245
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:01,811
I'm free tomorrow night.

246
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:27,409
I was wondering what that noise was.

247
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:28,974
It's the damn cane.

248
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:30,475
And I'm Greg.

249
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,936
I can't sleep with you
banging around with that thing.

250
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,691
You're not actually saying
that I have too loud a cane?

251
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,815
Is that hard for you to understand?

252
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,696
It has a rubber tip on the end,

253
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:43,989
not a tap shoe.

254
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,991
Now you're getting cute with me.

255
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,473
Okay, we started badly.

256
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,515
I apologize for the noise,

257
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,707
and we'll figure out
a way to be quieter.

258
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,178
And a thousand other things
I don't give a crap about.

259
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:59,133
Now you keep it down,
or we're gonna have trouble.

260
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,729
You paged me?

261
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,477
This is Ama.

262
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,397
She is from our country,
but she lives here now.

263
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,524
We'd like you to use her blood.

264
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:20,895
For what?

265
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,820
She recovered from Lassa fever
two years ago.

266
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,087
Our health minister has advised us

267
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:30,202
that plasma from one
who has the antibodies

268
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,749
is much more effective
than ribavirin.

269
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,623
This is a signed consent form.

270
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:37,538
Will you take her blood, please?

271
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,225
I want to do this.

272
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,092
You understand we would be using

273
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,929
your blood to cure president Dibala.

274
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,097
I know.

275
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:52,307
Are you from the Sitibi people?

276
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,727
I am Sitibi.

277
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,129
Did they threaten you?

278
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,279
- Your family members back home?
- Please let me give the blood.

279
00:14:58,546 --> 00:14:59,546
Please.

280
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Do it.

281
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:05,237
She's being coerced.

282
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,405
If she is,

283
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:09,369
I'd rather have a needle prick
on my conscience

284
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:11,409
than the death
of her family members.

285
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:41,658
Don't let him in there!

286
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,035
That's enough!
We got him!

287
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:00,667
- You all right?
- Who is that man?

288
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:08,466
He shot him?

289
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,430


290
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,191
You need a lawyer.

291
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,394
You can get a court-appointed.

292
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,812
They can help you.

293
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,397
I can't be helped.

294
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:26,109
You did a stupid, terrible thing.

295
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,112
But given the circumstances
with your wife,

296
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:32,802
you could get a reduced sentence.

297
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:36,182
She wasn't my wife.

298
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,165
Who was she?

299
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,316
They never told us her name.

300
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:49,908
What this men...

301
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:52,479
made us do to that woman...

302
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:57,029
He is now going to do...

303
00:16:58,098 --> 00:17:00,211
to all the Sitibi.

304
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:06,166
- You could've got killed.
- He wasn't gonna hurt me.

305
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,193
He fired a gun in the hospital!

306
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:11,158
Come here.

307
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:19,704
Maybe next time
don't yell out that warning.

308
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,253
The bloody eye
was from an enlarged lymph node

309
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,742
blocking the retinal vein.

310
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:29,655
We restored circulation,
but it means

311
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,567
we've got to add lymph involvement
to the heart, lungs, and rising fever.

312
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,619
I'm just gonna sit here quietly.

313
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:38,452
Why?

314
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,554
I feel like I've been undermining
your authority

315
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,479
So I'm just gonna observe.

316
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,154
Not gonna say a word.

317
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:49,909
The heart could point
to sarcoidosis.

318
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,780
I'm thinking the X-rays indicate

319
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,158
a lack of hilar adenopathy,
which rules it out.

320
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:05,417
Staph aureus?

321
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:10,813
Because...

322
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:13,693
He...

323
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:15,448
smokes?

324
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:19,764
He's miming a thermometer.
He says the fever's not high enough.

325
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:24,561
- So some other infection.
- He's wrong!

326
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,404
The fever could be misleading us
into thinking infection.

327
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:29,983
Talk!

328
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,072
It could fit with lymphoma.

329
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,248
I need you to spread your legs
so I can do an h.

330
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:47,544
Can't be lymphoma.

331
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:50,032
LDH is normal.

332
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:53,631
He's got good liver function.
It's masking the elevated levels.

333
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,133
Biopsy the lymph node.

334
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,451
Check it out.

335
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,190
Makes sense.

336
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:02,375
I guess you don't need me.

337
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,026
By the way,

338
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,266
you might wanna close the blinds.

339
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:10,091
A little bright in here.

340
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:22,066
It's just a wild coincidence
that he thought you were a rude jerk.

341
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,538
Give me the benefit of the doubt.
You said he's a jerk. I barely talked.

342
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,756
You talked!

343
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,881
All I wanted was to sip
morning espresso

344
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,033
next to a peaceful,
burbling fountain.

345
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:36,814
You could be sipping Courvoisier

346
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,067
next to a replica
of the Playboy grotto

347
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:40,894
if you tell him what you got on him.

348
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,597
I don't have anything on him.

349
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,015
I don't want anything!

350
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,323
The closest he's been to Vietnam?

351
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:49,498
Ordering the Mee krob
at that place on the corner.

352
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,292
- Mee krob is from Thailand.
- Exactly.

353
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,634
What did you do?

354
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,027
- Why do you think he's faking?
- I saw his mail.

355
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,795
- Your broke in?
- No. He was holding it.

356
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,532
Private medical insurance.

357
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,191
Not from the V.A.

358
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:05,196
Plus, he's got to be early 50s.

359
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:06,567
Too young to be a vet.

360
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:08,790
- So I looked further.
- You did break in.

361
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,958
Online.

362
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:12,667
No reference to him
in the vet records.

363
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:16,019
- Why would he fake being a veteran?
- Just look how you're acting.

364
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,801
People have been tiptoeing around
this jerk for years.

365
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,587
Normally, we'd all tell the amputee
to go screw himself.

366
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:25,598
Victims get pity, heroes get adulation.
It's way better!

367
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,833
Thank you for helping me out
with my neighbor.

368
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,533
- Now forget the Vietnam stuff.
- I could prove this.

369
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,634
You won't because you'll be busy
writing him a letter of apology.

370
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,333
And dropping it at his door.

371
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,049
Without knocking at his door.

372
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,665
I didn't do anything.
That guy is a total ass!

373
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,947
It's the point.

374
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:43,012
It's easy to be nice
to people you like.

375
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:44,959
But being nice to people you hate,

376
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,273
that's a skill.

377
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:47,399
Do it.

378
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:54,218
Thank you for saving my life.

379
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:57,046
The man that tried to kill you,

380
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:59,465
he said that you were preparing
a massacre.

381
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:06,267
The Sitibi are my countrymen.

382
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:10,405
I am fighting a guerrilla war.

383
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,021
In a way
that's being called genocide.

384
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:14,892
20 years ago,

385
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:18,403
these same Sitibi rebels
took over the south,

386
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:21,198
They massacred tens of thousands,

387
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,373
and they would do it again!

388
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:25,837
I'm trying to impose order.

389
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:28,604
I'm trying to prevent

390
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:30,538
a genocide.

391
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,759
Genocide.

392
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:34,922
My own son,

393
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:36,778
my youngest,

394
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:38,453
he is a student here.

395
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:40,799
He hasn't spoken to me in years

396
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,459
because of what he read
in your newspapers.

397
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,367
But what he read is not true.

398
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,723
What about your youth labor league?

399
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:55,358
There...

400
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:57,787
I was at fault.

401
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,169
I hired men, who, in their zeal,

402
00:22:02,294 --> 00:22:03,894
stepped over the line.

403
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,992
And there were abuses.

404
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,636
But that will not happen again.

405
00:22:59,126 --> 00:22:59,961
Hello?

406
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,208
How's it going?

407
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,983
Normal-looking nucleus.

408
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,665
How's it going with you?

409
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,882
It worried me when you joked about
letting that man shoot Dibala.

410
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:42,307
I wasn't joking.

411
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:45,297
You can't want to kill anyone.

412
00:23:45,572 --> 00:23:48,240
- Especially not your own patient.
- It's natural to feel he should...

413
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:50,074
No, it's completely unnatural.

414
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:53,047
Only psychopaths can kill
without having a breakdown.

415
00:23:53,172 --> 00:23:55,058
Not when it's justified
Look at soldiers.

416
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,768
Even when it's justified.

417
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:00,073
Am I trying to kill our patient?
Of course not.

418
00:24:00,301 --> 00:24:02,133
But if he died,
am I supposed to pretend

419
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:04,142
that wouldn't be good for the world?

420
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,111
The cells are neatly differentiated.

421
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,379
This isn't lymphoma.

422
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,549
Thought I had detected

423
00:24:13,674 --> 00:24:16,074
the sickly sweet smell
of maple syrup

424
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,899
and socialized medicine.

425
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:19,838
It smells like...

426
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:21,891
victory.

427
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:24,545
That big flag in your place

428
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,928
prompted me to chat
with your housekeeper.

429
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:29,509
Turns out you're a citizen
of the Great White North.

430
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,312
- You broke into my apartment?
- Technically, no.

431
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:33,709
Well...

432
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:36,015
technically, yeah, but two steps.

433
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,731
- Hardly...
- You're going to jail.

434
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:40,351
Speaking of... You know
what can get you six months

435
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:41,976
and a $100,000 fine?

436
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,316
Falsely claiming that you won a medal
in Vietnam.

437
00:24:46,058 --> 00:24:49,193
- You think I'm faking?
- Canada did not send troops in Vietnam,

438
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:50,318
you idiot.

439
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:54,337
They sent troops

440
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,100
to reinforce the '73 peace accords.

441
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:00,453
Which is where I tried to free
a 12-year-old boy

442
00:25:00,578 --> 00:25:02,428
who stepped on a land mine.

443
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,211
36 years later, every second,
I feel pain in my hand

444
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:08,840
like I'm still grabbing his arm,
even though my arm isn't there.

445
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:10,561
So, no.

446
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:12,435
I'm not faking.

447
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:20,502
On a related note...

448
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:22,412
Go Maple Leaves!

449
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,193


450
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:31,988
Did you get the biopsy results?

451
00:25:32,702 --> 00:25:33,906
Is it lymphoma?

452
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,670
So we have to move on.

453
00:25:36,932 --> 00:25:39,182
Infection, perhaps autoimmune.

454
00:25:39,307 --> 00:25:41,289
Did you get the biopsy results?

455
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:43,852
Yes, I just told you.

456
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,459
Is it lymphoma?

457
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,198
Cameron and Chase?

458
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:53,717
They both really like diagnostics,

459
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:56,888
and I think they both really like
watching House torture me.

460
00:25:57,465 --> 00:26:00,515
Anyway, thank you for understanding
about the job.

461
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,771
I had two really
crappy alternatives.

462
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:10,445
- There was a third.
- What's that?

463
00:26:11,494 --> 00:26:13,154
You could have stepped aside.

464
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:16,032
We both would have lost our jobs.

465
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,603
You could've asked Cameron
or Chase to take your place.

466
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:19,924
They wouldn't have.

467
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:22,288
You just said they both
really like diagnostics.

468
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:27,356
- You want to go back in time?
- I want to make this work.

469
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:30,328
I want to understand you.

470
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,903
I mean, you know
how you made me feel.

471
00:26:34,816 --> 00:26:36,574
If you could do it again...

472
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:40,408
I made the right decision.

473
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:56,917
I need your confidential
medical opinion.

474
00:26:57,326 --> 00:27:00,126
Is the president capable
of thinking clearly?

475
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:02,697
Obviously not, right now.

476
00:27:04,328 --> 00:27:05,628
Will he ever be?

477
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:08,936
I think...

478
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:13,005
Neurons don't grow back,
and he's already in his decline.

479
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:17,510
Anything he tells you, any command
he gives, how will you ever know

480
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,894
it's not the delusions of a sick
mad, dying old man?

481
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,874
<i>He just started spiking a fever.</i>

482
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,360
It's scleroderma.

483
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,703
You don't have some clever way
of telling me this time?

484
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:46,539
Patient's dying.
I'm done with clever.

485
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,748
Look at his skin.
It's tight for a 75-year-old.

486
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:51,551
Based on his admission photo?

487
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:52,926
Bit subjective.

488
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:56,028
Fever points to infection.
Now he's got nodules on his fingers.

489
00:27:56,153 --> 00:27:58,403
- That's blastomycosis.
- Nodules?

490
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,077
And you're calling tight skin
subjective?

491
00:28:01,202 --> 00:28:03,781
I'm with Foreman. We would've seen
fungus balls on the head CT.

492
00:28:03,906 --> 00:28:05,391
Fungal lesions can be missed.

493
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,769
We could settle this with a test.
Anticentromere antibody would point it.

494
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,963
Point to, not prove.
And his fever's too high.

495
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:13,075
- We have to treat him now.
- We treat wrong,

496
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,484
we could send this disease
into overdrive.

497
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,651
- You're with me on the scleroderma.
- I guess.

498
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:20,531
I don't care enough about the patient
to waste my time to convince anyone.

499
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:22,950
You didn't want
to work on this case,

500
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,541
and yet you're still here.
Why don't you take a stand?

501
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,288
Do something about it or shut up.

502
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,210
Treat him for blasto if you want.

503
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,051
I'll get Cuddy.
I can convince her...

504
00:28:33,176 --> 00:28:35,963
This isn't a democracy.
I don't care who you get.

505
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:38,817
At least for right now,
this is my department.

506
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:42,219
We're treating him for blasto.
Start him on Amphotericin B.

507
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,815
If you inject my I.V.
with an air bubble...

508
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,593
- What are you doing?
- I'll have another heart attack.

509
00:28:57,718 --> 00:28:59,851
- No one will know.
- Let her go.

510
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:04,042
You tell my colonel, I'm a sick,
dying old man who can't be trusted.

511
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:06,177
I didn't say...

512
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,363
You were trying to put a gun in his hand
and point it at my head.

513
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:11,644
The gun is now in your hand.

514
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:14,559
That is a practical difference,
not a moral one.

515
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,296
If you want me dead,
then pull the trigger.

516
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,827
It is not so easy when you have
to do it yourself.

517
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:51,483
I guess I didn't want you dead.

518
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:01,417
You touch my wife again,
I'll kick your ass out into the street.

519
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:04,385
- I don't care who you are.
- I did her a favor.

520
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:06,846
I showed her her true character.

521
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:09,471
She's a better person than you are.

522
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:12,085
She is too weak to act
on her beliefs.

523
00:30:12,998 --> 00:30:15,952
But that is not her fault.
Most everyone is.

524
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:18,111
Even my own advisors.

525
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:19,704
My own colonel.

526
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,408
All they do is negotiate and debate

527
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,652
and sign treaties.

528
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:28,531
They are appeasers.

529
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,317
And all the while,
we are beset by assassins

530
00:30:31,442 --> 00:30:33,331
and traitors, the scum...

531
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:34,807
Cockroaches?

532
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:39,587
What are you going to do about them?

533
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:41,717
What is an enemy to you?

534
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:46,104
Some younger physician
who covets your office?

535
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,267
In my world,

536
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:52,099
there are dangers
and bloodshed and death.

537
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,434
And that makes you a man.

538
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:56,918
And men make choices.

539
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:01,951
And your choice is to send bands
of drunk, crazed children

540
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:04,153
to massacre an entire people?

541
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,243
Don't ask me questions
you don't want to know the answer to.

542
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:08,824
I saved your life.

543
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,660
I deserve to know
what you're planning...

544
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,009
Whatever it takes
to protect my country.

545
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:26,717
You broke into his apartment?

546
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,285
I didn't break in.

547
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:31,553
I wish I believed you.

548
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:33,188
I can fix this.

549
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:34,808
I already did.

550
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:38,347
He was going to press charges.

551
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:41,106
but... I promised him you'd leave.

552
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,027
You're kicking me out?

553
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,801
I'll explain it
to your psychiatrist, but...

554
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,897
You got to go somewhere else.

555
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:57,771
I know when things go wrong,
usually you just double down

556
00:31:57,896 --> 00:32:01,348
and get more involved,
but here you could go to jail.

557
00:32:02,203 --> 00:32:04,437
And I truly believe

558
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,466
that you've changed enough
to know this is the right thing.

559
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,891
We need a blood sample.

560
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,537
We got to do the anticentromere
antibody test.

561
00:32:18,662 --> 00:32:21,146
It'll show House is right.
It's scleroderma.

562
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:23,107
Why are you doing this now?

563
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,140
Because I didn't want to kill him

564
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,129
and you're right.

565
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:30,295
I have to take a side.

566
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:33,133
So I'm going to do what I can
to keep him alive.

567
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,412
I'll get you the blood.

568
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:41,396
Positive
for anticentromere antibodies.

569
00:32:41,521 --> 00:32:44,512
Better get him off the anti-fungals
and onto steroids immediately.

570
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:47,447
I told you before,
this only points to scleroderma.

571
00:32:47,572 --> 00:32:50,050
- It doesn't prove it.
- You're just gonna ignore the test?

572
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,963
Blasto still fits best.

573
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:54,513
It's not conclusive,
but when you put it with the other...

574
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,331
I've made my decision.

575
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,733
Have you told Thirteen
you were wrong to fire her?

576
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:08,621
What does that have to do
with anything?

577
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,879
I've worked with you
long enough to know you're reasonable.

578
00:33:12,004 --> 00:33:14,043
You can usually admit
when you're wrong.

579
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:17,160
But there's some deep part of you,

580
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:20,799
that when you find you're wrong
about the decisions you've made,

581
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:23,773
you get insecure
and you just retrench.

582
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:26,654
If you want to mess up
your relationship, OK,

583
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:28,839
but you mess this up,
our patient dies.

584
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:36,597
Switch him to steroids.

585
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:48,197
Hi, honey.

586
00:33:51,472 --> 00:33:52,822
How was your day?

587
00:33:57,989 --> 00:33:58,911
Morning.

588
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:01,928
First of all,

589
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:03,553
my bad.

590
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:06,782
I've gone through
this whole thing recently.

591
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,801
I don't want to bore you.
Short version:

592
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:12,407
I'm really trying
to work on some stuff.

593
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:15,170
This is a definite setback.

594
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,229
Although,

595
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,208
in fairness,
you really did make it tough.

596
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,103
Phantom pain in your missing arm?

597
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:28,899
Five different kinds of painkiller
in your medicine cabinet.

598
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,651
That's what this

599
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:34,238
magic box
of neurological trickery is for.

600
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,618
This would be a lot easier if you do
what the crazy guy who tied you up says.

601
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,481
Put your hand in there.
Put your hand in there.

602
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,408
Now, look.
It's mirror magic.

603
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,220
Your arm is back.

604
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,861
Now clench both your fists
at the same time.

605
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,873
Clench.
Real hard.

606
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,670
If you believe in God,

607
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,029
pray that this is gonna work.

608
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,846
You might also want to ask him
why he blew off your arm.

609
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,090
Ready?

610
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:26,135
Now let go.

611
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,521
Oh, my God.

612
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:42,984
It relaxed.

613
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:45,489
For 36 years, I've been in pain.

614
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,453
And it's finally gone.

615
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:49,873
Oh, my God.

616
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:58,709
Thank you.

617
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:02,747
O2 sat's down to 88.

618
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:05,954
Going through the main stem bronchus
into the right upper lobe.

619
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,873
Get them out of here.

620
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,666
- It's OK.
- Bleeder.

621
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,630
Cauterizing.

622
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,780
- Got it?
- Yeah.

623
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,637
Get the paddles!

624
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,223
- I'm going back in.
- What is happening?

625
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,767
- He's bleeding into his lungs.
- Another bleeder.

626
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,435
- I can get it.
- Hold on.

627
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:30,503
There's a third.

628
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,565
God, there's a dozen.

629
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:36,213
Shock him.

630
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,390
Clear.

631
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:42,283
Charging. Clear.

632
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:34,006
You want to curl up and cry,

633
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,503
Lounge chair's a little more comfy.

634
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,850
I switched is meds.

635
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,590
I thought I was wrong
so I took him of the anti-fungals.

636
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:45,276
Put him on steroids like you said.

637
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:46,889
You know what that means.

638
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:49,031
I was too late.

639
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,311
Or I was right in the first place.

640
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:57,081
So either you killed him

641
00:37:58,225 --> 00:38:00,825
by not having confidence
in your opinion,

642
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,397
Or you killed him by being
too attached to your opinion.

643
00:38:05,843 --> 00:38:08,501
If you're anything like me...
and, by the way, you are...

644
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:10,718
you need to know which.

645
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,648
He's under lock and key
in the morgue.

646
00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:17,241
His government wants
their own doctors to do the autopsy.

647
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:19,362
They're taking his body out
tomorrow.

648
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:22,275
There's a reason I hired you.

649
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,178
You used to know
what to do with a locked door.

650
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:38,774
I went down to the morgue
to rerun the antibodies test.

651
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:42,705
- We ran it twice.
- Turns out I couldn't get in.

652
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:44,947
They had an armed guard.

653
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:46,811
But I saw this.

654
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:53,524
It's a sign-in sheet
from the morgue.

655
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:55,540
Your signature.

656
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:57,903
9:45 this morning.

657
00:38:58,028 --> 00:39:00,295
That's right
before you guys ran the test.

658
00:39:01,793 --> 00:39:03,048
What were you doing there?

659
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:06,968
- Follow-up on a clinic case.
- What case?

660
00:39:07,093 --> 00:39:09,813
- You think this is really important...
- One of the patients in the morgue

661
00:39:09,938 --> 00:39:12,724
was a 70-year-old woman
who had scleroderma.

662
00:39:14,026 --> 00:39:17,225
You and Cameron,
if you took that woman's blood,

663
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,235
you could have messed up
the test results

664
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,655
so we treated Dibala
for the wrong disease.

665
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:26,238
She had nothing to do with it.

666
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:29,116
You son of a bitch.

667
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,434
He was going to kill the Sitibi.

668
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,859
- Every last one of them.
- I don't care what he was gonna do.

669
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:39,084
He came to us and put his life
in our hands.

670
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:41,286
All the good we've done...

671
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,364
every life we've saved...

672
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,854
it would have meant nothing

673
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:50,512
if we just sent him off
to kill hundreds of thousands of people.

674
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,190
Look at the news.

675
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:54,725
The moderates are taking over.

676
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:57,006
There's hope for peace talks.

677
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,064
You tell the world
that I faked this test,

678
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:03,708
Dibala becomes a martyr.

679
00:40:04,544 --> 00:40:05,694
The massacres begin.

680
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:07,988
I cover this up,

681
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,698
I become your accomplice.

682
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,826
You think you can guilt me
into that?

683
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:21,089
If the cops are gonna come for me,

684
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:23,173
please warn me...

685
00:40:24,627 --> 00:40:26,627
so that I can tell my wife first.

686
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:40,769
You really think
you can kill another human being

687
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:42,821
without any consequences
to yourself?

688
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,114
My neighbor called.

689
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,817
He sounded...

690
00:41:02,736 --> 00:41:03,585
happy.

691
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,480
That's nice.

692
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,221
Even nicer,
he's approving the garden expansion.

693
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:14,361
And even more nicer,

694
00:41:14,853 --> 00:41:16,878
he's not going to press charges.

695
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:19,267
Even if you don't move out.

696
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,168
What did you do to him?

697
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,448
I was nice.

698
00:41:27,936 --> 00:41:29,686
You really want to know?

699
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:32,890
I think...

700
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,742
I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

701
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:41,987
<i>Alligators eat fish, birds, turtles,</i>

702
00:41:42,112 --> 00:41:44,294
<i>snakes, mammals, and amphibians.</i>
