1
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:13,362
How the...

2
00:00:32,997 --> 00:00:34,108
Most people...

3
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:35,463
go for the...

4
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:37,747
hardwood or carpeting.

5
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,665
I think guitars and garbage
work just as well.

6
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,576
Got the urge to play last night.

7
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,386
Had to go back to my apartment.

8
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,455
Thought I'd save on future trips.

9
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:49,248
It's very eco-friendly of you.

10
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,051
How about keeping down
on the noise pollution?

11
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:55,888
6:33. You should be flossing by now.

12
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:58,231
I'm not going to work today.

13
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,793
I'm going hunting.

14
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:06,431
After I sleep in.

15
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,935
Is it that time of year again?

16
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:24,500
- He's a self-important jerk.
- He's my friend.

17
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,058
He's a self-important jerk.

18
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:29,422
Seems to be what I'm attracted to.

19
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:31,924
Guy calls you Jim.
Doesn't even know your name.

20
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,301
Jim is short for James.

21
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:35,688
Now go away,

22
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:37,185
Lim.

23
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:43,722
Nice shot.

24
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,536
I nailed that tree.

25
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:51,845
Maple syrup for dinner.
We should have got a guide.

26
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,952
Doesn't count as new adventure
if you have someone holding your hand.

27
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,139
On the other hand,
we are holding weapons

28
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:59,047
and have no idea what we're doing.

29
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:00,021
Fun.

30
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,988
We need to sneak up on them.

31
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:05,752
I read that the native Americans
say turkeys know what you're thinking.

32
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,050
So I should stop thinking
about German porn.

33
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,128
That'll lure them closer.

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,750
We're terrible at this.

35
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,676
At least it's cold

36
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,559
and my new boots leak.

37
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:29,003
It's almost time anyway.
Did you bring the bag?

38
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,957
May 30, 2004.

39
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,247
10:07 a.m.

40
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,891
Dr. Wilson informed me
that if treatment didn't go well,

41
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:53,339
my leukemia would give me
only six more months to live.

42
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,294
November 30, 2004.

43
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,843
Six months later, I didn't die.

44
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,921
As long as I am alive,

45
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,348
I will find new and exciting ways
to thank you

46
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,367
for giving me another year.

47
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:11,901
Now move very,
very far away from there

48
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,652
so that I can be sure
and thank you again next year.

49
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:33,402
Thanks, Jim.

50
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:39,291
All right, let's see
how many more turkeys we can miss.

51
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,507
This will work.

52
00:03:48,846 --> 00:03:50,270
- What the hell?
- God.

53
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,898
Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I can't move my arm.

54
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,119
Am I having a stroke?

55
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,367
I don't know.

Good news. Head CT doesn't show
any signs of a stroke.

61
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,829
So he's gonna be okay?

62
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:52,918
I cannot believe
how much you've grown up in five years.

63
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:53,876
She's...

64
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,795
She's not family.

65
00:04:57,393 --> 00:05:00,048
Ashley, my girlfriend.
New life, new adventures.

66
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,718
- Ashley, meet Jim.
- It's good to meet you.

67
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,471
So this arm thing,
does that mean his leukemia's back?

68
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:09,071
I checked blood counts
and blood cell morphologies.

69
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:11,789
- Everything is normal.
- So these blood tests,

70
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:13,520
it means it's not cancer for sure.

71
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:15,814
- He said I'm fine.
- So what it is?

72
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:17,952
Hopefully something innocuous.

73
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:20,109
There's a doctor I can speak to
who's great...

74
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,865
Who's great at diagnosing...

75
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,572
What?

76
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,564
Sorry, that cold sore,
how long have you had that?

77
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,642
Two weeks. I'm sorry.
I got the call.

78
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,916
- I didn't have time to cover it up.
- What is it?

79
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,566
That cold sore is caused by a virus.

80
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:40,255
Assuming you kiss,

81
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,816
the virus could transfer,

82
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,987
infect your spine,
and cause the paralysis.

83
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,844
A disease
called transverse myelitis.

84
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,712
- And is that good news or bad news?
- It's great news.

85
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:51,445
I'll get you a room
and start you on acyclovir.

86
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,019
I just had a House moment.

87
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,908
Diagnosed transverse myelitis
from a cold sore.

88
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,383
How cool is that?

89
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,684
Patients really eat that crap up.

90
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,311
It's why I'm loved.

91
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:40,232
- What am I doing here?
- Ultrasound is clear.

92
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,900
He's definitely not pregnant.

93
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,069
No gall stones.

94
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,030
Could be diverticulitis.

95
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:50,450
- Have you eaten any seeds?
- I'm joining you, Antonio Aguilar.

96
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:53,288
We'll play in God's Mariachi band.

97
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,713
Draw some blood.

98
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:59,057
The self-important jerk
does not have transverse myelitis.

99
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:00,919
He's got cancer.

100
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,129
How do you...

101
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,174
Maybe I paid the redhead down
in records a few bucks

102
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,259
to cc me on all your cases.

103
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,389
Patients die, you might get sad again.
Make a speech would end your career.

104
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,792
Frankly, I'm stalking you for you.

105
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,008
- How long does a blood draw take?
- Almost finished.

106
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,605
When you're finished
almost finishing it, test it.

107
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,090
<i>Mi estomago</i>'s ripped open
by the hand of God.</i>

108
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:25,902
- He spilled my blood.
- Confusion. Delirium.

109
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,470
Why rule out
the hand of God so fast?

110
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:30,490
Your guy's low white count

111
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,826
and right arm paralysis
equals a recurrence

112
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,202
of his leukemia.

113
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:35,647
Simple math.

114
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,916
Did you look past
the first page of the file?

115
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,586
No AML cells anywhere.
I did the blood smears myself.

116
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,087
It's still cancer.

117
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,423
You know how I know?

118
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,427
He's got an oncologist for a doctor.

119
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,742
And your magical leukemia detector

120
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,679
is more powerful
than a flow cytometer?

121
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,088
I look for zebras

122
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,554
because other doctors
rule out all the horses.

123
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,602
In this case,
you are those other doctors.

124
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,645
You haven't earned a zebra.

125
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:03,064
- 100 bucks.
- Are you serious?

126
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,705
Friends don't diagnose
friends with cancer.

127
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,651
I get it.

128
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,824
Your problem is you're not objective.
Your caring is clouding your diagnosis.

129
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:14,217
Just cut that out
and you could be a pretty decent doctor.

130
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:16,536
Just give me the lactic acid level.

131
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,511
27.

132
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:21,027
The fact
that you can't speak English

133
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:24,044
is not an excuse for you not being
humiliated by what I'm about to say.

134
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,243
It's also not an excuse for you
not telling us

135
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:28,419
that you were a tennis pro.
If you had,

136
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:30,467
- we wouldn't have wasted our time.
- Fine.

137
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,635
100 bucks.

138
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,729
Is Tucker settling in?

139
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:40,061
Already got
his first dose of acyclovir.

140
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,871
And don't worry,
I ordered his girlfriend the kiddy meal.

141
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:44,647
Next patient on deck.

142
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:47,982
Del Clinton, day six of chemo.
You just missed the grandkids.

143
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:49,798
That's all right.

144
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:52,773
Last time they were here,
they painted my tie.

145
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,452
You're almost ready to go home.

146
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,334
You feeling okay?

147
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:02,374
I feel like I felt
after the last four rounds.

148
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:05,043
In oncology,
familiar pain means all is well.

149
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,378
So that's good, right?

150
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,739
I heard Jesse and Zeke
were by earlier.

151
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:14,772
Sorry, Del, I gotta run.

152
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:21,550
How are they doing?

153
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:22,769
They're fine.

154
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,639
No game-winning hits?
No aced report cards?

155
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:28,817
- No school plays?
- I guess not.

156
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,861
I thought you had to go.

157
00:09:35,763 --> 00:09:38,159
- Are you depressed?
- I have cancer.

158
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,579
You've had cancer for a long time.

159
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:43,445
It's never stopped you from bragging
about the grandkids.

160
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:47,544
I guess I'm feeling
a little more down than usual.

161
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,688
Can you give me something?

162
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:54,733
I don't want you to get alarmed,
but sometimes depression can be a sign

163
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:58,288
that something else is going on.
I'm just gonna order extra tests.

164
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:08,773
- What's going on?
- It's his foot now.

165
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:10,566
- It's nothing.
- It's not nothing.

166
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:14,686
I just started getting
a little tingling feeling in my foot.

167
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,699
- Is that bad?
- It's gonna be okay.

168
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:21,036
It might mean his foot fell asleep.
It might mean nothing.

169
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,910
Could you give us a few minutes?

170
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,915
- Why can't you tell me?
- Because you're making him nervous.

171
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,073
Give us a few minutes, okay, hon?

172
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,318
It's not the disease
you thought it was?

173
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:35,467
The medicine I gave you
is not working.

174
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,602
I might have to hit it harder.

175
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:39,972
I'm gonna add ribavirin
to your treatment.

176
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,944
Are you sure
that this isn't a recurrence?

177
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:49,073
- So the brave face is just for Ashley.
- She's young, she's terrified.

178
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,656
- She's not really equipped.
- Don't worry.

179
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:54,110
Once you've had cancer,

180
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,362
recurrence is your biggest fear.
I get it.

181
00:10:57,368 --> 00:11:00,325
I've looked every which way there is.
That's not what's happening here.

182
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:03,620
Can you call my daughter
and ask her to come down?

183
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:05,701
You can't do it?

184
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:09,793
She hasn't exactly been talking to me
since I got together with Ashley.

185
00:11:10,138 --> 00:11:12,048
I'd really like her to be here.

186
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:14,776
Of course.

187
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:21,203
Exactly how serious does it have to be
to justify you coming to see your dad?

188
00:11:24,238 --> 00:11:25,418
No. I'm sorry.

189
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:28,760
I'd rather you regretted coming
than regretted not coming.

190
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,532
Thanks, Emily.

191
00:11:34,647 --> 00:11:35,568
How's Tucker?

192
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,447
He's made a mess of his personal life.
But physically, he's gonna be fine.

193
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:42,325
- Transverse myelitis.
- What does House think?

194
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:45,994
What is this?
Is House my overseer now?

195
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:48,401
No, it's just not always a good idea

196
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:50,898
for doctors to treat
their friends, that's all.

197
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:53,027
House has got 100 bucks on cancer.

198
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:55,712
So unless you want in
on the action...

199
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:57,985
Is Bonnie still a realtor?

200
00:11:58,461 --> 00:11:59,811
As far as I know.

201
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,636
Do you mind if I call her?

202
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,205
I'm looking for a new place.

203
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,089
I'm moving in with Lucas.

204
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:09,885
It wasn't the tennis.

205
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,313
You're moving in with Lucas?

206
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:17,464
You're Bonnie's friend.
You know how to reach her.

207
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,239
And yet instead of calling her,
you come and seek my permission.

208
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:24,200
You want my blessing,
and implicitly, House's blessing.

209
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:27,033
I don't need House's blessing.

210
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:28,093
Good.

211
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:37,784
So when will he be able
to move his arm again?

212
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:39,159
Should be soon.

213
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,233
Started smoking again?

214
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,429
Is it bad that he's coughing?

215
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:46,912
Hi, Dad.

216
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:50,393
Melissa, hey.
I didn't know you were coming.

217
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,072
I was at Mom's house
when Dr. Wilson called.

218
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:55,211
I can go if it's gonna be weird.

219
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:57,185
No, no, stay. It's fine.

220
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:00,427
- How are you?
- Is he okay?

221
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:01,948
He's okay.

222
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:04,604
I'm not a big fan
of this coughing though.

223
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,117
You must be Ashley.

224
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,254
Are you okay?

225
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:13,454
Do you think this cold sore thing
could've caused this?

226
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,794
No. Whatever's causing this
is affecting more than his nerves.

227
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,671
I need a crash cart in here!

228
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:22,702
{/pub}

229
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,933
Don't you guys have
a dying Mexican crooner to attend to?

230
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:33,269
He isn't dying anymore.
Found out he was on a popcorn diet.

231
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,813
Eating ten bags
of microwave popcorn a day.

232
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,274
Huffing the fumes scared his lungs.

233
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
That's...

234
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:43,279
very strange.
Where's House?

235
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,222
Performing his ritual "hiding from Cuddy
to avoid getting a new case" dance.

236
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:50,058
It's sort of a jazz-fusion
type of thing.

237
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,153
He's probably eating in the morgue.
I can page him.

238
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,250
Actually... maybe it would be better
if I talked to you alone.

239
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,003
House and I have a bet
about one of my patients.

240
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:02,006
You guys mind making him
100 bucks poorer?

241
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:06,636
43-year-old male
in remission from leukemia

242
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,314
presents with left arm paralysis
and trouble breathing.

243
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:12,308
- I assume House's money is on cancer.
- Thanks. That's very helpful.

244
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:15,338
- Subdural hematoma would explain...
- CT ruled it out.

245
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:18,064
I thought it was TM
I started antivirals, but he got worse.

246
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:19,581
Bacterial infection?

247
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:21,943
Bacteria'd move much faster.
He'd be dead already.

248
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,625
Could be fungal.

249
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,594
It would explain
his breathing problem,

250
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,963
but not his "unable to move
his arm" problem.

251
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:29,188
Actually,

252
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:31,555
if aspergillus fungus balls

253
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,870
took root in his lungs
and spread to his spine,

254
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,950
it would explain both.

255
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,757
The treatment involves riddling
the infected area

256
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,301
with BB-sized pellets
of antifungal meds.

257
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,990
I assume
you don't just load up the 12-gauge

258
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:51,597
and pepper me with birdshot.

259
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,780
No. We have a slightly
more humane delivery system.

260
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,436
But we do have to open you up.
It is surgery.

261
00:14:58,394 --> 00:14:59,898
And like any operation,

262
00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:01,954
there are risks.

263
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,829
What do you think, honey?

264
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,001
I don't know.

265
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:09,031
Is surgery really such a good idea?
He just seems so sick.

266
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:10,741
I just...

267
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,579
you should do
whatever you think is best.

268
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:17,280
Is this the only way
to go after this thing?

269
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:21,168
Because of the rapid progression,
we don't have time to test or try IVS.

270
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,795
And he's strong enough.

271
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,879
Definitely.

272
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:26,674
- I want you there during the surgery.
- Of course.

273
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,969
You gotta do it.

274
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:33,941
Good.

275
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,137
Dr. Chase will be in here soon
to get you set for the O.R.

276
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:41,072
Page Dr. Chase to Tucker's room
for a surgery consult.

277
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:44,020
- And can you get me...
- Mr. Koplovitz wants to talk to you.

278
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,386
- Everything all right?
- He wanted to talk to his doctor,

279
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:48,043
not his doctor's assistant.

280
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:51,003
- And House is looking for you.
- What did you tell him?

281
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:54,116
That you were in the clinic.
I figure that gives you about 10 min.

282
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,375
Here.
Mr. Koplovitz's chart. Go.

283
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:01,584
Hello, Saul.

284
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,628
- I heard you were looking for me.
- I'm very tired.

285
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,662
But I can't sleep.

286
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:08,215
Today's your lucky day.

287
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:10,411
I happen to be a sleep specialist.

288
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:12,784
Thanks, Doc.

289
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:30,786
- Can a guy get a little privacy?
- Nice hiding spot.

290
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:32,156
Actually, it's perfect.

291
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:35,090
It allows me to hide from Cuddy
and find you.

292
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,982
What did she want?

293
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,330
She was checking up on Tucker
thanks to you.

294
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,414
That's it?

295
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:43,751
Like what?
Something about you?

296
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,087
Something you could interpret
as being about you?

297
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,931
An anagram maybe?

298
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,801
Play hide and seek somewhere else.

299
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,293
- My patient...
- No problem.

300
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:53,665
Give me the 100 bucks you owe me
and I'm gone.

301
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,162
Tucker doesn't have cancer.

302
00:16:55,287 --> 00:16:57,681
He doesn't have a ball of fungus
in his lungs either.

303
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:00,392
Next time you want to use my team,
at least leave a tip.

304
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,461
I'm late for surgery.

305
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:06,308
Your assistant said you'd be in here.
I talked to Bonnie.

306
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:09,091
Let's take this outside.
Mr. Koplovitz just got to sleep.

307
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:11,260
Sorry. She found us
this fantastic loft.

308
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:13,562
- Outside.
- It's not a loft, it's more urban.

309
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,624
Not that I'm urban, but I used to.
Two bedrooms.

310
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:17,701
Got wonderful views.
It's a really great place.

311
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,602
Procedure should take about an hour.

312
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:21,804
I'll be observing the entire time.

313
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:25,374
Maybe it'd be better
if you stayed with Ashley.

314
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,218
She's more scared than I am.

315
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,050
Well, she's...

316
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:32,514
At her age...

317
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,345
she's not supposed to be dealing
with issues of life and death.

318
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,995
Wasn't what I was planning
when I went after her.

319
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,015
Why did you leave Melissa?

320
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:45,138
We got married young.

321
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:46,235
We...

322
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:51,958
I'm not sure.

323
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,627
There's nothing to talk about.

324
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,258
Why are you doing surgery
when I need you finding me a new case?

325
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:16,560
<i>You don't want a new case.</i>

326
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:17,685
Oh, right.

327
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,969
Guess I'm here for Wilson.

328
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,267
Obviously you didn't tell me

329
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,145
that Cuddy was moving in with Lucas
'cause you were protecting me.

330
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,316
Which is odd since I told you
that I'm fine with their relationship.

331
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:32,985
So obviously,

332
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,196
you question one of those assumptions
or you have an issue with logic.

333
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,920
Yes, you're fine with them dating.

334
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,098
But moving in together

335
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:43,379
is a whole other level
of commitment.

336
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:45,539
This is the 21st century.

337
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:49,636
I realize that the logical course
of any adult relationship

338
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,903
could one day lead to fornication.

339
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:53,297
Although,

340
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,050
the fact
that she wants to buy a loft

341
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,970
could mean that their relationship
is not as serious as I thought.

342
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,081
For God's sake, House,
don't do this to yourself.

343
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:04,099
It's a loft.

344
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:07,269
It has no deeper meaning
than open-space living arrangement.

345
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,057
If you bought into her diatribe

346
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,024
about rediscovering
her lost city girl roots.

347
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,026
And two bedrooms.
It just reeks of commitment issues.

348
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,039
Yeah. Or she has a baby.

349
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:19,921
This is classic
mid-life Cuddy crisis.

350
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,955
This is her version
of a two-seat convertible.

351
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,079
Clearly you're fine with it.

352
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,164
<i>Wilson, he's got global lung damage.</i>

353
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,917
<i>Means it's not fungal.
It's PCP pneumonia.</i>

354
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,759
Obviously something

355
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,042
is knocking out his immune system.

356
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,815
Three options.
HIV. Acquired SCID.

357
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,318
Or my personal favorite, cancer.

358
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,341
I'm sure you'll test for all three.

359
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,722
62-year-old African-American man

360
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,742
with lymphoma now in remission.

361
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,726
I did a CT and found a small lesion
on the upper lobe of his left lung.

362
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:10,613
If he's in remission,
why did you bother scanning him?

363
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:13,794
During a routine follow-up,
I realized the patient was depressed.

364
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:16,505
That's quite a call.

365
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:20,571
The treatment indicate...

366
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:23,049
Oh, I'm sorry.

367
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:25,483
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

368
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,208
It's a conference room

369
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:28,825
with glass walls.

370
00:20:29,415 --> 00:20:30,853
You thought I'd be alone?

371
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,437
Your patient has cancer.

372
00:20:33,422 --> 00:20:34,497
Not that guy.

373
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:37,609
He probably also has cancer.
And he's probably also your buddy.

374
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:39,789
Thought you'd want to know.

375
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:42,739
'Cause you owe me 100 bucks.

376
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:45,534


377
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:48,704
You have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.

378
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,713
A.L.L.

379
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:55,025
So it is a recurrence.

380
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:57,587
It's different.
It's a second leukemia.

381
00:20:57,712 --> 00:21:00,632
Probably caused by the chemotherapy
we gave him five years ago.

382
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,542
That's why you didn't see it.

383
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,845
Maybe they can rename it
ironic leukemia.

384
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,236
This is not the end.

385
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:08,682
Tests show that the cancer
is limited to your brain.

386
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,643
- That's good news.
- How can cancer in his head be good?

387
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:14,432
The blood brain barrier separates

388
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:16,983
the blood in your head
from the blood in your body.

389
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:19,026
Keeps the cancer bottled up.

390
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,645
We can go for a cure.

391
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:22,988
So give me the numbers.

392
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,406
90% chance of cure.

393
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,955
Really?
What if we're in the 10%?

394
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:31,496
Steady decline.
But six months of a good quality life.

395
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,378
Does he have to go through
another bone marrow transplant?

396
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,377
Chemotherapy.
We can go at this with drugs alone.

397
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:40,047
When do we get started?

398
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,884
We begin by surgically planting a shunt
so the drugs go directly into the brain.

399
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,177
I booked the O.R.

400
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:48,114
You're the only one who can make cancer
sound like good news.

401
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,091
We get it out of your head
and you walk out

402
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:51,725
paralysis gone and cancer-free.

403
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:58,405
We also need you to sign
a health care proxy.

404
00:21:58,658 --> 00:22:00,193
If something goes wrong

405
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,340
someone needs
to make decisions for you.

406
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:04,117
What are the chances
of that happening?

407
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:05,143
Very remote.

408
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:07,424
I think maybe Melissa
should be my proxy.

409
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:08,660
What?
No.

410
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:11,600
Coming through.
House got a new case.

411
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,562
Revised O.R. schedule.
Sorry, Wilson, had to bump you.

412
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:20,313
- It's not like your guy's bleeding out.
- Your guy's not bleeding out.

413
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,267
The nurse who books the O.R.
thinks he is.

414
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:25,842
- Your case is no more urgent than mine.
- Yeah, but you're way more patient.

415
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:28,583
It's okay.

416
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,693
You can talk about the paperwork
in the prep area.

417
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,929
You trust her more than me.

418
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,996
About this, yes.

419
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,527
You've been through the good stuff,
but she's been to hell and back with me.

420
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:46,488
She gives me the best shot
of getting through this.

421
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:50,158
- You still love her.
- Don't be silly.

422
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:51,511
I love you.

423
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:53,745
Please...

424
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,872
don't make this
into more than it is.

425
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:04,871
- Anything?
- No.

426
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:07,960
- Can you feel this?
- No.

427
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:09,677
How about here?

428
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:14,345
Where is everybody?

429
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,845
Melissa and Emily went downstairs
to get some breakfast.

430
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,942
- Ashley?
- She had work to do.

431
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,856
I thought she was off today.

432
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:23,390
She didn't really have work to do.
She was pissed

433
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:25,303
so she pretended to have work to do.

434
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:26,778
I let her pretend.

435
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:31,856
Move your fingers.

436
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,419
- The chemo's not working.
- Does that mean it's not cancer?

437
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:45,977
No. It means the chemo
from your first round of treatment

438
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:47,716
has made the leukemia resistant.

439
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:51,303
So I'm in the 10%
that don't get cured.

440
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:55,919
Maybe not.

441
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,082
We just removed a screw
from a guy's lung.

442
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:02,980
And the weird thing is
he didn't get better.

443
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:06,126
- Any idea what that means?
- It means you're not listening to me.

444
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:09,012
No. It means I'm ignoring you
to make a point. There is a difference.

445
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:11,933
The problem is,
I have no idea what point you're making.

446
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:15,098
That your idea is implicitly
not worth responding to.

447
00:24:15,223 --> 00:24:17,997
Doubling your patient's chemo dose
is stupid.

448
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:19,872
Damn. Now it's explicit.

449
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:22,539
It could swamp out the resistance
of the cancer cells.

450
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:25,621
The fact it theoretically should work
doesn't make it any less stupid.

451
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:26,943
Of course it does.

452
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:30,037
- It's exactly what you would do.
- I'm me. You're you.

453
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:34,547
And a table is a table.

454
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,749
And chemo is poison.

455
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,218
And double chemo is double poison.

456
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,898
I can handle it
when things go wrong.

457
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,023
You can't.

458
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,650
And things could go very,
very wrong.

459
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:50,120
I can handle it.

460
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:59,033
Sounds pretty dangerous.

461
00:24:59,736 --> 00:25:00,736
It is.

462
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,713
What do you think, Mel?

463
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:09,813
I think you should call Ashley.

464
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:13,043
You're my family.

465
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:16,580
I'm sorry I forgot that.

466
00:25:20,897 --> 00:25:23,134
I think that you should try

467
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:25,397
whatever could keep you
with us longer.

468
00:25:56,563 --> 00:25:58,534
- Look.
- I can move them.

469
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:04,826
What is it, Jim?

470
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:08,022
I'm gonna need to run some tests.

471
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,693
Intraepidermal superficial bullae.

472
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,159
- Could be Pemphigus.
- Or it could be from the fire.

473
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:15,655
Either way, he's dead.

474
00:26:16,505 --> 00:26:17,824
We can't stop the oozing.

475
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:19,808
Don't care.

476
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:24,079
I'm here because it's 1:15

477
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:26,291
and Wilson started testing at 12:45.

478
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,421
- Which means...
- The cancer's gone.

479
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,963
But over half his hepatocytes
are dead.

480
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,250
In only 24 hours?

481
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,761
He needs a new liver.

482
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:43,414
Look on the bright side.

483
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:46,686
You can publish the results
of this case study.

484
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:48,771
No one will ever
double the dose again.

485
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:55,201
The double dose of chemo
got rid of your cancer.

486
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:57,900
But it also trashed your liver.

487
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:00,867
If I don't find you a new liver,

488
00:27:02,637 --> 00:27:04,790
you've only got about 24 hours left.

489
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:08,492
So what do we do now?

490
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:13,880
Your father's been moved
to the top of the transplant list.

491
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:17,820
- But all we really can do is wait.
- That's it? We wait?

492
00:27:17,945 --> 00:27:20,529
- Tell me something that I can do.
- I'm sorry, Mel.

493
00:27:20,654 --> 00:27:22,756
You and Emily don't match
Tuck's blood type.

494
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:24,182
And neither does Ashley.

495
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,510
So a live liver donation is out.

496
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,768
The best thing to do
is just what you've been doing.

497
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:33,441
Be together.

498
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,764
Hope he already told you
that you're gonna die.

499
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:44,653
It's gonna make what I'm about to say
a lot more relevant.

500
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:47,728
I know it's raining
out there in the hallway, but...

501
00:27:47,853 --> 00:27:51,668
I was just in the ER testing my patient
for autonomic dysfunction.

502
00:27:51,988 --> 00:27:54,766
It's the only department with a shower
big enough for the whole team,

503
00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:57,131
plus the cardiac monitors, plus me.

504
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,890
Anyway, relevant part,
we're just wheeling the guy out,

505
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:01,125
trauma came in.

506
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,621
- Motorcycle versus semi.
- How bad?

507
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:05,932
Bad for the motorcycle.
Good for your liver.

508
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,892
- Blood type's match.
- Why wasn't I paged?

509
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:11,145
Because there's a problem.
No organ donor card.

510
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,565
Dead guy's sister is next of kin.
She's refusing to allow the donation.

511
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,859
- Where is she?
- 20 minutes away.

512
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:22,479
How do you get the call
that your brother's dead

513
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:23,950
and then run out the door?

514
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:27,847
"That reminds me,
I had dry cleaning to pick up."

515
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,124
Did Cuddy buy the place?

516
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:32,493
Not yet.

517
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:36,050
- You okay?
- Just making conversation.

518
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:39,549
- Yours was getting boring.
- What are you planning?

519
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:42,176
- I'm not planning anything.
- And I don't believe you.

520
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:44,413
How are you gonna punish her
for dating Lucas?

521
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,864
Now this conversation
is getting boring.

522
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,143
Are you really OK?

523
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,139
I am not okay.

524
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:54,731
Not even close.

525
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:00,105
See, that's very adult of you.

526
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,696
No, it isn't.

527
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:06,010
It's just me accepting the fact that
there's nothing I can do and moving on.

528
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:09,120
Which is, I think,
the definition of adulthood.

529
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:11,622
If it is,
being a kid is a lot more fun.

530
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:14,542
Showtime.

531
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,344
I didn't speak to him for years.

532
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,099
But when my parents died,

533
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,035
at their funeral,

534
00:29:31,024 --> 00:29:32,224
we made peace.

535
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:35,313
Our parents must've blessed it.

536
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:38,850
And I'm sure they would want him
to do good

537
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:40,610
with his last act in this world.

538
00:29:41,904 --> 00:29:43,904
They wanted us to be friends.

539
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:47,635
Our relationship wasn't strong,
but it was growing.

540
00:29:48,702 --> 00:29:50,703
If I allow you to defile his body,

541
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:52,955
it will destroy that bond.

542
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:54,957
The itai will be harmed.

543
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:57,668
It will save my patient's life.

544
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:04,116
What if I told you...

545
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,677
that he wasn't dead?

546
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,347
Are you saying my brother
is still alive?

547
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,349
You're being an idiot.

548
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,690
I don't have time to talk you
out of your religion

549
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:15,593
so I'm stuck with giving you
a technicality

550
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:18,077
that will let you justify
doing the right thing.

551
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:22,818
What if his last living act
was to donate a part of his liver?

552
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,197
Not the whole thing,
just one small piece.

553
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,283
Then I'm not defiling a dead body.

554
00:30:30,953 --> 00:30:33,162
The last generous act
of a living person.

555
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,492
It's too late.

556
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:38,546
The liver started to degrade.

557
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,878
It's no longer viable
for transplant.

558
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:45,967
Well played.

559
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:48,052
Religion killed another person.

560
00:30:56,486 --> 00:30:57,936
It's not fair, Jim.

561
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:01,857
You just helped me
get my family back together.

562
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,330
I'm not ready.

563
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:17,039
I would've had six more months with them
if you hadn't given me that extra chemo.

564
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:19,391
Now I have less than one day.

565
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:22,628
I'm sorry.
We knew the risks.

566
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:24,714
I don't want to lose them again.

567
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:27,008
I can't lose them again.

568
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:31,395
There's nothing more we can do.

569
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,050
Five years ago,
when I needed a transfusion,

570
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,467
you used your own blood.

571
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,897
We have the same type.

572
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:45,067
Which means you can give me
a part of your liver.

573
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:50,295
- I'm your doctor.
- You're my friend.

574
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:53,105
Should I die
because you're also my doctor?

575
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,994
- Of course not.
- Then. You're fired.

576
00:31:55,657 --> 00:31:57,153
Now you're just my friend.

577
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,828
Now you can do what's right.

578
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:03,377
Tucker, it's...

579
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:05,923
I can't.

580
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,143
Late night with the Pigeon sisters?

581
00:32:19,868 --> 00:32:21,136
Every now and again,

582
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:24,125
I'd like to come home
without getting interrogated.

583
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,829
Someone's cranky.

584
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:29,653
And late.

585
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:31,176
Where were you?

586
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:32,851
Just getting a drink.

587
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:35,868
Why are all my frozen dinners
thawing on the counter?

588
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:39,205
I needed room
for my margarita jell-o shots.

589
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:41,665
I use test tubes as bottles

590
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,812
so they'll be shaped like my cane.

591
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,474
Why'd you go out drinking alone
when you got such great company here?

592
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,976
Tucker wants me to donate
a lobe of my liver to him.

593
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:01,076
And you were out drinking.

594
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,136
So you're actually considering this?

595
00:33:04,487 --> 00:33:07,291
Yeah. I was out marinating
my liver in alcohol

596
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,568
to get it ready for the transplant.

597
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:11,838
Your mouth says no,

598
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:13,965
but your pathetic attempt
at a deflection

599
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,793
has guilt written all over it.

600
00:33:16,322 --> 00:33:18,786
It's my fault.
It is my fault!

601
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:22,289
- I gave him too much chemo.
- You cured his cancer.

602
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,459
- Killed him in the process.
- Quibbles.

603
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,380
He's had a predictable complication.

604
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:32,508
Surprise. Bad things
happen to people who are sick.

605
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:34,259
Doesn't make you responsible.

606
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,513
No... not legally.
Ethically.

607
00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:40,307
- Ethically!
- A table is a table.

608
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:42,770
Don't be a doormat.

609
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:46,772
Boy, you are...
you willfully ruined my food

610
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,868
and have taken over my living room
because you already think I'm a doormat!

611
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:52,293
You know what...

612
00:33:57,262 --> 00:33:58,412
you're wrong.

613
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:02,076
You... clean up your stuff
and get out.

614
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:07,468
You're wrong.

615
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:16,178
How's Tucker?

616
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:18,398
Still not dancing.

617
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,759
But scans came in on Del Clinton.

618
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:24,035
- It's good news.
- Thanks.

619
00:34:24,702 --> 00:34:27,187
Let me know as soon as Tucker
takes a turn for the worse.

620
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:28,805
I want to be there.

621
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:35,788
See that small spot
at the top of the lung?

622
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:39,209
That was then.
This is now.

623
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:40,668
Spot's gone.

624
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:43,676
That tiny little spot?

625
00:34:45,624 --> 00:34:47,312
It's not too impressive, is it?

626
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:51,014
That little dot could've killed me?

627
00:34:53,189 --> 00:34:55,112
Fortunately, we caught it early.

628
00:34:56,343 --> 00:34:57,681
It's gonna be okay.

629
00:34:58,106 --> 00:34:59,356
That's amazing.

630
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:03,474
You got all this off me
not talking about my grandkids.

631
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,980
Thanks, Bonnie.

632
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:15,279
Just gonna have to sit tight
for a while.

633
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:25,079
I put an offer on the loft.
Seller turned me down.

634
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:29,183
I offered exactly what a similar
unit sold for three months ago.

635
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,463
I want to donate a lobe
of my liver to Tucker.

636
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,925
- That's insane.
- I'm donating a small portion of...

637
00:35:40,258 --> 00:35:41,970
You have hundreds of patients.

638
00:35:42,546 --> 00:35:44,603
And until I run out
of excess organs,

639
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,767
why shouldn't I do everything
I can to help them?

640
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:48,393
Because you're a doctor,

641
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:49,955
not a donor.

642
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,987
Why did you make me
the head of oncology?

643
00:35:59,522 --> 00:36:01,439
Not because you have
the most organs.

644
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,868
You're thoughtful, caring.

645
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:07,463
Caring.

646
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:10,374
By your own criteria
a strength and not a weakness.

647
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,626
This is coming out of guilt.

648
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:14,545
This is coming out of friendship.

649
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:16,338
I have a friend who's about to die.

650
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:19,675
And I have the opportunity
to save his life.

651
00:36:40,663 --> 00:36:42,932
Call me a doormat,
get it all out of your system...

652
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,407
but I'm doing it.

653
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:49,962
Why?

654
00:36:52,395 --> 00:36:53,458
He's my friend.

655
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:55,335
I'm your friend.

656
00:36:56,872 --> 00:36:58,917
All the pain pills I've taken.

657
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:01,300
- What if I need your liver?
- Right.

658
00:37:01,468 --> 00:37:05,364
How selfish of me not to have
considered your possible future needs.

659
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,100
They're all dying.
They're all your friends.

660
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,808
I'm not here for an argument.

661
00:37:10,045 --> 00:37:11,476
No. Right.
That's room 12A.

662
00:37:13,924 --> 00:37:15,415
So why are you here?

663
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,969
Wanna make sure
that I called the moving van?

664
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:23,496
The operation is in two hours,

665
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,718
and I'd like you
to be there with me.

666
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:36,084
Why?

667
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:40,165
Because if you die, I'm alone.

668
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:10,351


669
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:45,365
How you feeling?

670
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:48,811
Can't complain considering
if it weren't for you, I'd be dead...

671
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:49,736
twice.

672
00:39:50,446 --> 00:39:51,297
You?

673
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:53,261
I feel good.

674
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:55,724
Sending out your laundry?

675
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:59,352
Going to rehab.
Some place up in Katonah.

676
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,345
Up by your new house,
not near your old house.

677
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:06,443
Easier on Ashley.

678
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:09,329
I see.

679
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:14,219
I was thrilled to get
the family back together

680
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:16,119
and Melissa's great in a crisis,

681
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:19,884
but the person you want
when you're dying

682
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:22,250
isn't the same as the person
you want when you're living.

683
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:31,267
Actually, it's James.

684
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:55,825
You ready to admit
that he's a self-important jerk?

685
00:40:57,478 --> 00:40:59,778
I still feel good about what I did.

686
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,408
You don't feel angry?

687
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,461
I'm a little disappointed.

688
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,950
Disappointment is anger for wimps.

689
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:14,830
You don't have to be so gentle
about everything.

690
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:18,015
It's okay to get angry
once in a while.

691
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,672
You can't change a table.

692
00:41:22,636 --> 00:41:23,971
Actually, you can.

693
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,980
Just need a coat of paint
and the guts to use it.

694
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,989
Bonnie told me what Cuddy bid.

695
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,074
You're gonna outbid her?

696
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:24,289
We do need a bigger refrigerator.

697
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:30,795
She hurt my friend.
She should be punished.

698
00:42:31,931 --> 00:42:33,031
You got mad.

699
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:35,617
I'm proud of you.

700
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:38,906
Cuddy won't share that sentiment.

701
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:41,472
How are you gonna explain it to her?

702
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:44,744
I'm changing our address
to a p.o. box.

703
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:46,311
She'll find out eventually.

704
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,324
A problem delayed...

705
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,940
is a problem denied.

706
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,080
I'll take it.

707
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,365
Baby steps.

708
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,584
