1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,900
<i>Previously on house.</i>

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,100
<i>I don't know how I got here.</i>

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,300
<i>I saw a symptom
before the crash.</i>

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,700
???

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,400
Medical hypnosis
can bring the brain

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,200
<i>to a class two theta state.</i>

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,900
<i>Taxing an already injured
brain.</i>

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,700
Someone is dying
because I can't remember.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,700
<i>It was amber.</i>

10
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,000
She was on the bus with me.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,400
She's the one who's dying.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,300
<i>Her heart won't stop racing.</i>

13
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,500
<i>No idea
what's causing it.</i>

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Sure it wasn't the bus
that landed on her?

15
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,300
It's not trauma.

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,700
<i>She was stable post-op.</i>

17
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>This didn't start
until an hour ago.</i>

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,900
Oh, my god.

19
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,700
<i>Delayed reaction
to the trauma.</i>

20
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
<i>She lost both her kidneys
in the bus crash.</i>

21
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
She ripped up
her femoral artery.

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
We fixed the artery,

23
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,300
got her on dialysis
for the kidneys.

24
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Whatever's doing this
to her heart,

25
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,500
it isn't from the crash.

26
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,800
- Check her potassium?
- Of course.

27
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,900
Why didn't you call me?

28
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,500
She's been under
the whole time.

29
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,300
<i>- she had no i.d.
- Pushed adenosine?</i>

30
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,800
and verapamil, and floated
the swan an hour ago.

31
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,100
Coronary angiography?

32
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,600
Three critical patients
ahead of her.

33
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,100
We'll have her in
within the hour.

34
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,100
We're 15 minutes away

35
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,100
from princeton plainsboro
by ambulance.

36
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,800
You want to move her?

37
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
Her heart rate is 130.

38
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
She's hemodynamically stable.
We're moving her.

39
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,300
You're not her doctor.
You can't make that decision.

40
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,800
Her husband can.

41
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Right?

42
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,800
Move her.

43
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,400
If the trauma
didn't damage her heart-

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
Why was she on the bus?

45
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know.

46
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,400
If she had
any underlying condition,

47
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,100
the accident could have
exacerbated it.

48
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,000
Why were you
with her?

49
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
I don't know!

50
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,100
<i>I'm not hiding anything.</i>

51
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,300
I just don't remember.

52
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,600
What else could damage
her heart?

53
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,300
Wilson, don't get lost.

54
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,400
I'm barely coherent.

55
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,700
I need your help right now.

56
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,100
V- fib.

57
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
<i>Charging.</i>

58
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay. Okay.

59
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
- Clear.
- Wait, wait, wait.

60
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,700
Protective hypothermia.

61
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,300
You want to freeze her?

62
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,200
Her heart's not beating.

63
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,500
Her heart's already damaged.

64
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,700
If you restart it, it'll keep
racing, shoot off free radicals,

65
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,000
<i>and kill her brain.</i>

66
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,000
We ice her down,
put her on bypass

67
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
until you've diagnosed her.

68
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,500
This is not a solution.

69
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
All you're doing
is pressing pause.

70
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,500
It gives you more time
to find a diagnosis.

71
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,800
House, this is amber.

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,100
Please.

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,400
Cold saline solution.

<i>Bypass circulating.</i>

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
She's stable.

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,100
Why are we doing this?

81
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,400
Bought us time
to think.

82
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,200
The trauma must have stimulated

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,800
a pre-existing heart condition.

84
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,600
<i>Autoimmune congenital anomaly,</i>

85
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,500
blood clotting disorder,
lead poisoning...

86
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
It could be anything.

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,400
Great,
let's explore that.

88
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,800
Quick, get her
on panacea.

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,700
<i>We can narrow it down</i>

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,500
by looking
for arterial blockages.

91
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,300
how?

92
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,200
On an echo?

93
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,100
<i>Can't see wall motion
when there's no motion.</i>

94
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,000
<i>Ekg, nope.</i>

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Heart's in the off position.

96
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,300
Thallium uptake scan?
Useless on a cold heart.

97
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,500
Yeah,
we get it.

98
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,300
Her heart's not beating.

99
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,700
It's gonna make it harder
to diagnose.

100
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,000
On the other hand,
she's not gonna die

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,100
while you're whining
about it.

102
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,000
<i>What else?</i>

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,700
there is another way
to narrow it down.

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
If you really did see

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
a symptom in amber
before the crash,

106
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
physostigmine helped
your memory last time.

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
Why not cyanide?

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,500
<i>He's a mess.
He needs to sleep.</i>

109
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,600
I had a heart attack
this morning.

110
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,700
I can't do any more drugs

111
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,500
<i>till lunch.</i>

112
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
<i>Get her an angiogram.</i>

113
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,300
It could show damage
even in a stopped heart.

114
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,700
The rest of you
search her apartment.

115
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
<i>Toxins, heavy metals,
drugs,</i>

116
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
anything that might make
her heart race.

117
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,700
I need to know if there's
anything medically relevant

118
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,600
that you couldn't share
publicly.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Is this a philanderers anonymous
intervention?

120
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,500
<i>You were obviously drinking</i>

121
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,200
last night.

122
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,100
Maybe you took amber
to a bar.

123
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,200
I left here
on my motorcycle alone.

124
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,700
You ended up

125
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,100
drunk on a bus
together.

126
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,500
<i>Maybe you met amber
in the bar.</i>

127
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
I was not having
an affair with her.

128
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,300
You can't

129
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,100
really say that
if you don't remember.

130
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,200
I lost four hours,
not four months.

131
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,700
Maybe it was
the first time.

132
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,200
If you drank together,
any chance you did any drugs?

133
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,900
I'll run a tox screen.

134
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,800
You coming?

135
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,600
Correspondence,
letters to patients,

136
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,500
she could have caught something
from one of them.

137
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Copy it
to a thumb drive.

138
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,800
Let's get out of here.

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Travel.

140
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Do you know if she's been
out of the country recently?

141
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,400
<i>It's just video clips.</i>

142
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
Maybe she narrates
where they are.

143
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,000
<i>And... Action.</i>

144
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,000
Looks like she didn't travel
very far.

145
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,400
You look beautiful.

146
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
You look nervous.

147
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,300
I've never done this before.

148
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,800
I have.
Trust me.

149
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,000
You'll love it.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
- Hey. 
- not even close to relevant.

151
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,800
As long as we don't know
what's wrong,

152
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,500
we don't know
what's relevant.

153
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,600
Yeah, maybe they're having sex
on a pile of asbestos.

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,700
Go watch it.

155
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
If we were
in a stranger's house,

156
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,200
you'd be watching the video.

157
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,900
You altered your behavior
because you're friends with her.

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Are you okay?

159
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,600
We shouldn't be treating her
at all.

160
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm gonna search
her bathroom.

161
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
<i>Are you okay?</i>

162
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,900
can't really say yes when it's
a hallucination asking.

163
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,200
Don't worry,
you're just dreaming.

164
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
What symptom did I see
in you?

165
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,000
A myoclonic jerk-

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,300
Boring.

167
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,400
An incredibly rare
neurological symptom is boring?

168
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,300
Am I in someone else's
subconscious?

169
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,800
What did we do
last night?

170
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,100
Was I meeting you
for a drink?

171
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,600
Is that all it was?

172
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,900
A man thinks a woman
is beautiful,

173
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
<i>admires her intelligence,</i>

174
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,600
admires the way she has to get
whatever she wants,

175
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
the things he likes
about himself.

176
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,300
Maybe she always had

177
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,200
a little thing for him.

178
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,400
His mind.

179
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,400
His blue eyes.

180
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,300
But someone gets
between them.

181
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
so.

182
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
They decide to meet
one night

183
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
at an out-of-the-way
little bar.

184
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,800
Does that sound familiar?

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,800
Do I feel familiar?

186
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,700
What do you feel?

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Electricity.

188
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,000
Electricity.

189
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,400
I know
I saw the symptom.

190
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,600
I know the memory's
locked in my brain.

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
Now I know how to get it.

192
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,200
no.

193
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,400
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

194
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,100
You need to rest.

195
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,300
I have yet to hear

196
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,200
<i>about any study
linking electricity</i>

197
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,300
and rest.

198
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,700
Deep brain stimulation.

199
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,000
<i>It's been proven.</i>

200
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
<i>Electrical impulses applied</i>

201
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,400
directly to the hypothalamus

202
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>could evoke
detailed memories.</i>

203
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,700
My mistake,
drilling a hole

204
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,900
and shooting lightning bolts

205
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,200
into an already-cracked skull

206
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,300
is very restful,
it's not fatal at all.

207
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,500
She's right.

208
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
You need to sleep.

209
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,000
Brain activity spiked.

210
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,800
Amber.

211
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Amber.
It's me.

212
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
Random spikes are common.

213
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Shut up.

214
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,300
It's gonna be okay.

215
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm here with you.

216
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,300
The team has found something.

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,900
Can you ask her
if we can be excused?

218
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
What?

219
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,900
Coronary angio
was negative.

220
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,300
So was the tox screen.

221
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,800
That's what you found?
Negative tests?

222
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,600
I could have told you

223
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,100
<i>she doesn't do drugs.</i>

224
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,200
We found these
in her apartment.

225
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,500
Sorry.

226
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
<i>Prescription diet pills.</i>

227
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Ssris, amphetamines.

228
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,600
<i>Diet pills cause
structural damage</i>

229
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
to the mitral valve,
could explain the tachycardia.

230
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
She'd have to be an addict
to take enough

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,100
<i>for it to damage
her heart.</i>

232
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,900
<i>I'd know.</i>

233
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Did you know that she was hiding
them in her vitamins?

234
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,400
<i>We have to warm her back up.</i>

235
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,700
Get her heart beating
so we can do a ct to confirm.

236
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,000
No, we've been
over this.

237
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,900
Starting her heart
could cause brain damage,

238
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,300
<i>could burn out
the heart muscle.</i>

239
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,700
Test her heart
without starting it.

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,800
<i>Crack her chest open,</i>

241
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,600
<i>reach a finger
inside the pulmonary vein,</i>

242
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,900
run it across the valve.

243
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,700
That's the safer course?

244
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,400
It is if we're wrong.

245
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,200
When did we start assuming
we're wrong?

246
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,500
If this were
any other patient-

247
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,600
If the valve is calcified,

248
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,000
that's our answer.

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
That's our cure.
go.

250
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,200
Thirteen.

251
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,300
Who found
the diet pills?

252
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,700
Kutner.

253
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,200
You didn't even go
in the bathroom, did you?

254
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,300
<i>You're suddenly mute</i>

255
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,600
in the differentials.

256
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,900
A blow-up doll
would be more useful.

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
<i>And yes,
that's the first time</i>

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,900
I've ever implied something
negative about a blow-up doll.

259
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
It's amber.

260
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,600
<i>- I don't-
- Normally, I'd be fascinated.</i>

261
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,900
Today, don't care.

262
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,700
Get over whatever it is
and do your job.

263
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,300
Wait.

264
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,300
Look at her eye.

265
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
She's jaundiced.

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,700
Her liver's shutting down.

267
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Diet pills don't kill
the liver.

268
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,900
????

269
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,900
Liver failure means
whatever this thing is

270
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,900
it's spreading, despite the fact
that she's frozen.

271
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,100
Hepatic and heart failure

272
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,800
could mean
antitrypsinase deficiency.

273
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,400
We can stick a needle
in her liver.

274
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,200
If we see fibrosis,
she's right.

275
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,700
Does amber drink sherry?

276
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,700
And the cardio fits
just as well.

277
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
<i>But there's no way
we can tell,</i>

278
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,000
<i>since we can't take
her temperature.</i>

279
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,300
I had a dream.

280
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,200
<i>She was pouring me
a glass.</i>

281
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,900
<i>And since I'm a scotch,</i>

282
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,500
beer, gin, and rum man...

283
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,700
If we warm her back up,
we should be able to tell

284
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
if she's got an infection.

285
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes, we can get
a diagnosis

286
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,700
by letting the disease run
rampant until it kills her.

287
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,900
<i>If it's spreading,</i>

288
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,600
we need to slow this
even more.

289
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,300
We've gotta cool her down
further.

290
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,200
I know you love her

291
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,000
and you're scared
she's gonna die.

292
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,900
But just making her colder

293
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,400
<i>and colder isn't a cure.</i>

294
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,000
It's not dealing
with the reality.

295
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,800
Sherry means something.

296
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,500
<i>Amber doesn't
even drink sherry.</i>

297
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,500
House.

298
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,400
<i>Can we get back-</i>

299
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,700
if she did drink sherry,
it would mean nothing.

300
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,600
<i>Since she doesn't,</i>

301
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,200
my subconscious is obviously
trying to make some other point.

302
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
There's a sharrie's bar

303
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,900
<i>on third
right off the bus route.</i>

304
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Wilson's right.

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,300
We need to make her colder.

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,100
Putting more ice on her
is just delaying the diagnosis.

307
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
Not on, in.

308
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,600
Fill her lungs
with slurry.

309
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,300
Where are you going?

310
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm taking wilson out
for a drink.

311
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Is this the place?

312
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,800
Maybe.

313
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
<i>Hey.</i>

314
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,400
I assume you are here...

315
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,300
For these.

316
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,200
Did you see me here
with a tall blonde woman?

317
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,100
Yeah, I think she joined you
after scotch number seven.

318
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,300
Did she seem sick?

319
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,800
She sneezed.

320
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,700
I gave her
a napkin.

321
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,100
Did you see the color
of the sputum?

322
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,200
I assume
sputum means snot.

323
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,400
<i>Look, I see a lot
of drunk chicks in here.</i>

324
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,100
I didn't have time
to stop and analyze

325
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,000
the color
of your girlfriend's boogers.

326
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,200
She's not my girlfriend,
genius.

327
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
<i>She was hot,</i>

328
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
you seemed into her,

329
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,500
<i>and she bought you drinks.</i>

330
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,600
Last night,
she was your girlfriend.

331
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,200
Blood in the sputum
could mean parasites.

332
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
Any recent travel?

333
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,100
You seemed into her?

334
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
If he had a brain,

335
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,400
<i>he wouldn't be tending bar.</i>

336
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,400
Sneezing's a new symptom.

337
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,500
Let's assume the runny nose
means an infection.

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,300
What did house
have to say?

339
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
He told me
I was raised by wolves

340
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,500
and that's why I use the same
hand for my fork and knife.

341
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,000
ooh.

342
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Not that one.
The slurry tube.

343
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
oh.

344
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,200
I know
this is different.

345
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,700
But it's not.

346
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Everyone dies.

347
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,300
She's not dead.

348
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,600
You're reacting this way
because she might be-soon.

349
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,700
Yeah, I am.

350
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,900
Why aren't you?

351
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,400
I'm an indian guy
named kutner.

352
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,900
Ever wonder what happened
to my parents?

353
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,400
I'm sorry,
I didn't-

354
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,700
I was six years old.

355
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,400
I used to like helping out in
my parents' store after school.

356
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Guy walks in
to rob the place.

357
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,600
Ends up shooting them both.

358
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Wasn't fair.

359
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Took years,
but I had to accept

360
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,300
that's just the way
it was.

361
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,300
So you gonna help me
fill her lungs up or not?

362
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,500
Tell me that the liver biopsy
showed infiltrates,

363
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,900
minor inflammation.

364
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,300
Yeah.
How-?

365
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Snot on a napkin.

366
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,700
Add the heart,
infiltrates...

367
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,600
Hep b.

368
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
Start her
on iv interferon.

369
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,400
I'll go tell wilson.

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,900
Good idea.

371
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,500
<i>And I'll go nap</i>

372
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
because I was concussed last night 
and had a heart attack

373
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
<i>this morning.</i>

374
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,400
I'll tell wilson;
you go sleep.

375
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,900
Hepatitis b
is a lame diagnosis.

376
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, god,

377
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,100
I get less rest
when I'm asleep.

378
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,700
I rise from the dead,
and that's the reaction I get?

379
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,100
If I had known, I would have
started a breakaway jewish sect.

381
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,700
Hep b fits.

382
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,700
Why are you doing that?

383
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
Because hep b doesn't fit.

384
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,800
Turn her over.

385
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
We're about to start
a second course of interferon.

386
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,100
Which she might not need
once you turn her over.

387
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,000
Small of her back.

388
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,400
<i>She's bruised.</i>

389
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Why is that significant?

390
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Look closer.

391
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
<i>A rash.</i>

392
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
How did you know what was
on the small of her back?

393
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,400
Either I'm still asleep,

394
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,700
or I'm starting to remember.

395
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,400
Looks like an influenza rash.

396
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,700
The flu wouldn't be killing
her organs one by one.

397
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,800
Dermatomyositis.

398
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,600
Wouldn't speed up
her heart.

399
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,100
Maybe it's an allergic reaction
to the interferon.

400
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,600
Yes, the symptom
that I saw on the bus

401
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,900
was a rare interferon allergy
that flares up

402
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,600
two days before you take it.

403
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,900
How did you see
the rash down there?

404
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,900
I don't know.

405
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,400
Maybe she leaned over.

406
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,900
Maybe it's not a rash
at all.

407
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,100
It could be
an abscess.

408
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
Thirteen, stick a needle
in there.

409
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,100
If there's pus,
foreman's right.

410
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,500
Ultrasound is safer.

411
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,700
I'm not asking you to stick
a needle all the way through.

412
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,600
Taub, you do it.

413
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,500
No, wait, I can do it.

414
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
No, apparently, you can't.

415
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,200
It's not fluctuant.

416
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,900
Clear.

417
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,100
It's not pus.

418
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,500
Means it's vesicular.

419
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Rocky mountain spotted fever.

420
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,800
We had dinner
with a friend last week.

421
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,300
<i>We walked their dogs.</i>

422
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,400
I guess she could
have gotten a tick.

423
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,300
It's treatable.
Doxycycline.

424
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Allow eight hours for
the antibiotics to take effect,

425
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,000
then we warm her up,
shock her heart.

426
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,700
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

427
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,400
If we're wrong, restarting
her heart could kill her.

428
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,900
<i>Run blood cultures first.</i>

429
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,700
The fastest way to test
is to treat.

430
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,500
If we're wrong,
it still should give us time

431
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,400
<i>to try something else.</i>

432
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,500
We are not starting
her heart

433
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
until we're 100% certain.

434
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,900
We're never 100% certain.

435
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,600
Run the blood cultures.

436
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
After we get confirmation,
then we'll restart her heart.

437
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,100
He's wrong.

438
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,700
<i>And you know
he's wrong.</i>

439
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,700
You can't change your mind
just because a family member

440
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,100
starts crying.

441
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,600
They're always scared.

442
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,500
I said,
run the blood cultures.

443
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,900
<i>Sorry.</i>

444
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,800
Wide stance.

445
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,500
You're right.

446
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
I'm screwing up.

447
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,500
Why are you screwing up?

448
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,800
I didn't even like her.

449
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,000
Did you hate her?

450
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,900
Not enough to want her dead.

451
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,500
So it's not guilt.

452
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,800
That just leaves fear.

453
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,400
A young woman dying.

454
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,600
<i>A young doctor dying,
in fact.</i>

455
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,400
<i>Does that sound familiar?</i>

456
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,700
yeah, I'm at risk
for huntington's.

457
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,400
I've dealt with it.

458
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,800
By not getting tested?

459
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,100
Dealing with it
by not dealing with it.

460
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,700
It's clearly working
beautifully.

461
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,500
You are the champion
of not dealing

462
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,300
with your problems.

463
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,700
My grandson gave me a mug
that says that.

464
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Okay.

465
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,800
Enough hand-holding.

466
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,100
Deal with it.
Get back in there.

467
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,100
Or pack up your stuff.

468
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,300
You're screwing up this case
worse than I am.

469
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,600
* love, love is a verb

470
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,600
* love is a doing word

471
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,700
* feathers on my breath

472
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,300
* gentle impulsion

473
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
* shakes me, makes me lighter

474
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,300
* feathers on my breath

475
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,700
* teardrop on the fire

476
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
* feathers on my breath

477
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,500
house is gonna kill
the patient.

478
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,900
What are you-
What are you doing?

479
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,300
She's up to 80 degrees.

480
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,800
We're gonna restart
her heart.

481
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,600
No, you're not.

482
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>There's still time
to undo this,</i>

483
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,300
cool her back down.

484
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,700
You weren't taking
the safe approach.

485
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,800
We've got to know
if the antibiotics are working.

486
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,500
Her eeg's slowed.

487
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,100
<i>Amber.</i>

488
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,300
Amber.

489
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,900
Well done.

490
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We still don't know what it is,
????

491
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
<i>this is exactly what I said
would happen.</i>

492
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,700
<i>It's in her brain now.</i>

493
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,500
Brain involvement gives us
a new symptom.

494
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,500
That wouldn't be there
if you hadn't-

495
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,100
It's where the disease
was going.

496
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,900
We needed to know that.

497
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Th was not your decision to make.

498
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
You went behind my back.

499
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,700
You went behind house's back.

500
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,200
Inside voices.

501
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
House wanted
to warm her up.

502
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,000
You just guilted him
into changing his mind.

503
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,500
Heart, liver, rash,
and now her brain.

504
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,600
Autoimmune fits best.

505
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,200
Crash trauma could have
set it off.

506
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,800
Start her on prednisone,

507
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,500
then we'll warm her up again.

508
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,600
House, if this is
some other infection,

509
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,200
the steroids will trash

510
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,000
her immune system.

511
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,800
He's the attending.

512
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,100
You're the family.

513
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
Go spend more time
with the patient.

514
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,300
You can't do this.

515
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
That's not a good argument.

516
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
It's not an argument
at all.

517
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm sorry.

518
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Cuddy's right.

519
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,600
I was afraid

520
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,500
<i>to do anything.</i>

521
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,800
<i>I thought if everything
just stopped,</i>

522
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,400
it would be okay.

523
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,600
And it's gonna be.

524
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,700
Taub's starting
the treatment.

525
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,400
<i>We're doing everything-
Not everything.</i>

526
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Before you warm her up...

527
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,200
You said you wanted to try
deep brain stimulation.

528
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,900
But there's no reason.

529
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,200
We know the symptom,
we know what I saw.

530
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,600
What if it's not the rash?

531
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
What if you noticed the rash
in the ambulance

532
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,000
or when we were putting her
on bypass?

533
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,700
What if there is
still something else

534
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,100
stuck inside your head?

535
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,100
You think
I should risk my life

536
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,000
to save amber's.

537
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,700
Inserting the ipg probe
into your ventral hypothalamus.

538
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,600
Give me three volts.

539
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,500
I can't hear him.

540
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,900
Can't hear who?

541
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,500
Everything's in black and white.

542
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,500
<i>Who was talking?</i>

543
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,300
is amber there?

544
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,400
You're supposed to be jolting
my hypothalamus,

545
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,700
not petting it.

546
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,500
We don't want to overload it.

547
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,700
As long as I'm risking my life,

548
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,700
I might as well be watching
a talkie.

549
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,300
Increasing from three
to five volts.

550
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
Sending impulse.

551
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
You're not getting them back.

552
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,700
<i>Hey,
you take my keys,</i>

553
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,400
you gotta give me
a phone call.

554
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,800
<i>Who are you calling?</i>

555
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,500
dial-a-wilson.

556
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,400
I was on call.

557
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,800
Amber was home.

558
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,100
I told her to find you.

559
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,200
Have you pick me up.

560
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,900
I said to find wilson.

561
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,700
He's working.

562
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,500
And I'm willing to suffer
this indignity on his behalf.

563
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,800
Did she seem sick?

564
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,300
Not yet.

565
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,600
Come on. Time to go. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

566
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,700
Need another round.

567
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
And a drink

568
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,200
for what passes
for a lady

569
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,300
around here.

570
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,400
What's your poison?

571
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,800
Nothing.
We're leaving.

572
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,400
We're leaving, leaving, leaving,
leaving, leaving-

573
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
Cosmos.

574
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,900
I remember wilson buying

575
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,300
cranberry juice.

576
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll have another.

577
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,300
And she'll have
a cosmopolitan.

578
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,500
The obstinate drunk thing
is not flattering.

579
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,100
Come on.
You called for a ride.

580
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,700
Drink your drink,

581
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
or I'll drink 'em both.

582
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,200
one.

583
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,000
And you leave
voluntarily.

584
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,900
Let's go.

585
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,700
<i>Hey.</i>

586
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,300
We need
another cosmo here.

587
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,300
She sneezed.

588
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,000
What color is it?

589
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,200
Thanks.

590
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,600
Looks like snot.

591
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,000
It seems
like a cold.

592
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Nothing else?

593
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,300
no.

594
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,500
Where are you going?

595
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,000
You think I paid?

596
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,200
House, what are you doing?

597
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,600
You can barely walk.

598
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Go home.
I'll take the bus.

599
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,100
Hey, someone's gotta pay
for this.

600
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,900
hi.

601
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
You forgot something.

602
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,800
You don't give up,
do you?

603
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,300
Yeah, I'm an idiot
that way.

604
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,200
You doing this for me
or for wilson?

605
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,100
For wilson.

606
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,400
Well, then it's even
more impressive.

607
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,900
Ugh, damn, do you have
a kleenex?

608
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,000
I got a sleeve.

609
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,100
I got two, actually.

610
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,500
I need more than that.

611
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
I'm getting
that nasty flu.

612
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,100
Is that it?
The flu?

613
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,100
Is there
any rare complication?

614
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
no.

615
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,300
It would explain the rash,
but nothing else.

616
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,000
Unless...

617
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,700
What?

618
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,900
Don't do it.

619
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,900
It wasn't the flu.

620
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,100
<i>It's what she did
for it.</i>

621
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,000
She has
amantadine poisoning.

622
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,000
The crash destroyed
her kidneys.

623
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,900
Her body couldn't filter
the drugs.

624
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,400
She ods on amantadine,
explains the heart, the liver...

625
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,200
<i>We just need to start her
on dialysis</i>

626
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,700
and flush the drugs out.

627
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,200
What?

628
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,700
<i>What's wrong?</i>

629
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,200
amantadine binds
with proteins.

630
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,900
Dialysis can't clear it

631
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,200
<i>out of the blood.</i>

632
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,400
There's nothing
we can do.

633
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,400
I'm so sorry.

634
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,400
Amber.

635
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,900
Amber.

636
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,900
Seizing.
Wilson, I need help here.

637
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,800
House suffered
a complex partial seizure.

638
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,300
<i>The violent shaking
widened his skull fracture,</i>

639
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,800
<i>causing a brain bleed.</i>

640
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,200
We won't know if there's
any cognitive impairment

641
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,500
until he's out of the coma.

642
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,600
He was right
about the amantadine.

643
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,500
Amber's body
couldn't filter it out.

644
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,900
That's what caused her heart
to beat too fast for too long.

645
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,500
It caused irreparable
structural damage.

646
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,900
Didn't matter if they
shocked her or froze her.

647
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,800
Her heart was dead once
it stopped in that ambulance.

648
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,400
What about a new heart?

649
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,900
Transplant?

650
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,900
All of her organs are damaged.

651
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,800
She can't qualify.

652
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,600
<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

653
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,000
Nothing we could have done.

654
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,500
We should call
time of death.

655
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,400
Well, technically,
she's still alive.

656
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,200
Could probably survive
a few more hours on bypass.

657
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,600
We could wean her
off anesthesia, wake her up,

658
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,400
give you a chance to-

659
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,900
It would be cruel.
Don't-

660
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Wake amber up.

661
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,400
See her again.

662
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Tell her
what she means to you.

663
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,700
Wake her up to tell her
that she's-that she's-

664
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,200
You are waking her up

665
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,900
so that you can both
say good-bye to each other.

666
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,300
She would want it.

667
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,800
hey.

668
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,600
You're in the hospital.

669
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,800
I'm on bypass.

670
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Yeah.

671
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,100
Do you remember
what happened?

672
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,400
Got on the bus.

673
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,600
I shouldn't have gotten on the bus. No.

674
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,000
No, it's not your fault.

675
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,100
It's not your fault.

676
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,500
How bad?

677
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,700
You had tachycardia.

678
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,300
It's complicated
by complete renal failure.

679
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,400
The tachycardia degenerated
into v-fib,

680
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,600
followed by hepatic failure.

681
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,500
The flu pills?

682
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,300
Yeah.

683
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,800
I'm dead.

684
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,400
I love you.

685
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,000
I love you too.

686
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,700
We should say good-bye.

687
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,000
She didn't even like us.

688
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,200
We liked her.

689
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,400
Did we?

690
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,900
We do now.

691
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
What do we say?

692
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,300
We don't need
to say anything.

693
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,300
* this my excavation and to...

694
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,600
* day is kumran

695
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,300
* everything that happens

696
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,200
* is from now on

697
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,000
* this is pouring rain

698
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,400
* this is paralyzed...

699
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm tired.

700
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,500
I think it's time
to go to sleep.

701
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Just a little longer.

702
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,400
We're always gonna want
just a little longer.

703
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,900
I don't think
I can do it.

704
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,700
It's okay.

705
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
It's not okay.

706
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,300
Why is it okay
with you?

707
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,500
Why aren't you angry?

708
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,500
That's... Not...

709
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,800
The last feeling

710
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,000
I want to experience.

711
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,100
* the sound of the unlocking

712
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,700
* and the lift away

713
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,900
* your love will be

714
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,400
* safe with me *

715
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,600
you're dead.

716
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,400
Everybody dies.

717
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,100
Am I dead?

718
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,000
Not yet.

719
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
I should be.

720
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,800
why?

721
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,700
Because life
shouldn't be random.

722
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,600
Because lonely,
misanthropic drug addicts

723
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,200
should die
in bus crashes,

724
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,600
<i>and young do-gooders
in love</i>

725
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,000
who get dragged
out of their apartment

726
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,200
in the middle of the night
should walk away clean.

727
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Self-pity isn't like you.

728
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,000
No, well,
i'm branching out

729
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,500
from self-loathing
and self-destruction.

730
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,600
Wilson is gonna hate me.

731
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,000
You kind of deserve it.

732
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,800
He's my best friend.

733
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,000
I know.

734
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,900
What now?

735
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
I could stay here
with you.

736
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,900
Get off the bus.

737
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,800
I can't.

738
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,700
Why not?

739
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,100
Because.

740
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,500
Because it doesn't hurt here.

741
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,800
I let it...

742
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,900
I don't want to be
in pain.

743
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,700
I don't want to be miserable.

744
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,800
And I don't want him
to hate me.

745
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Well, you can't always get
what you want.

746
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,600
* there are times that walk
from you *

747
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
* like some passing afternoon

748
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,400
*

749
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,400
* summer warmed
the open window *

750
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,100
* of her honeymoon

751
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,100
* and she chose
a yard to burn *

752
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
* but the ground remembers her

753
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,600
* wooden spoons,
her children stir *

754
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,700
hey, I'm here.

755
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,100
Blink if you can hear me.

756
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,900
* there are things
that drift away *

757
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,900
no, shh,
don't try to talk.

758
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
<i>Just rest.</i>

759
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,200
* autumn blew
the quilt right off *

760
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,700
* the perfect bed
she made *

761
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,700
* and she's chosen
to believe *

762
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,500
* in the hymns
her mother sings *

763
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,200
* sunday pulls its children

764
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,400
* from their piles
of fallen leaves *

765
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,600
* there are sailing ships
that pass *

766
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,600
* all our bodies
in the grass *

767
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,000
* springtime calls
our children *

768
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,300
* till she lets them go
at last *

769
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,300
* and she's chosen
where to be *

770
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,100
* though she's lost
her wedding ring *

771
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,300
* somewhere near
her misplaced jar *

772
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,100
* of bougainvillea seeds

773
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,300
* there are things
we can't recall *

774
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,900
* blind as night
that finds us all *

775
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,300
* winter tucks
her children in *

776
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,500
* her fragile china dolls

777
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,800
* but she'll mend
his tattered clothes *

778
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,600
* and they'll kiss
as if they know *

779
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,900
* a baby sleeps
in all our bones *

780
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,100
* so scared
to be alone *

781
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,200
感谢house又给了我们一季的快乐
希望下一季他跟wilson有情人能终成眷属

782
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,200
