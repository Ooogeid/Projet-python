3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:09,370
<i>It's been 76 days,
2 hours, and 37 minutes</i>

4
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:11,819
<i>since young Ned's father
deposited him</i>

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,094
<i>at the Longborough school
for boys,</i>

6
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:17,180
<i>and this, young Ned felt,
was long enough.</i>

7
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:20,695
<i>Tired of the dark and joyless
boarding school,</i>

8
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:22,886
<i>young Ned and his dog, Digby,</i>

9
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,992
<i>set out in search
of a new beginning.</i>

10
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:28,316
<i>Alone in the forest,
they didn't know what to expect,</i>

11
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:32,377
<i>and least of all
they expected giant butterflies.</i>

12
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:34,703
Come on, everybody. Look.
There's a nest! Let's go see.

13
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:38,466
<i>Miss Moss believed every child
was a butterfly at heart,</i>

14
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:43,010
<i>and her kindergartners knew
that every caterpillar learns to fly.</i>

15
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:47,473
<i>On this day, Miss Moss found herself
just out of reach</i>

16
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:51,604
<i>of an important lesson
on the life cycle of the yellow canary.</i>

17
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:55,825
Oh, I wish I could reach!

18
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:59,194
What do you think, there's eggs inside
or do you think there's birds?

19
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:02,654
<i>The yellow canaries, however,
believed a better lesson</i>

20
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:06,161
<i>might have been the risks
of environmental toxins.</i>

21
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:07,704
<i>In that moment,</i>

22
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:11,907
<i>young Ned decided that new beginnings
were a wonderful thing.</i>

23
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:14,183
- How many do you think are there?
- Six.

24
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:15,013
Six?

25
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,957
Aren't they beautiful?

26
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:25,430
Would you like to see
our class project?

27
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,757
<i>As the once-dead yellow canaries</i>

28
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,518
<i>had now been alive again
for over a minute,</i>

29
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:33,446
<i>young Ned knew that,
by the rules of his gift,</i>

30
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:36,180
<i>something else nearby
had to die.</i>

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,101
We've been nursing some red-breasted
woodpecker chicks back to health,

32
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:41,571
and today...
today we're gonna set them free.

33
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,431
<i>Unaware of the class project,</i>

34
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:46,826
<i>the boy had thought that
whatever creatures traded their lives</i>

35
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:49,120
<i>would be small, random,
and hidden in the woods.</i>

36
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,989
<i>Sadly, this was not the case.</i>

37
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,688
<i>As the boy and his dog
returned from whence they came,</i>

38
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:04,461
<i>young Ned concluded
that new beginnings</i>

39
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,815
<i>only lead to painful ends.</i>

40
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:09,611
<i>It's 20 years later,</i>

41
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:13,414
<i>and the boy has become
a pie maker who is in love.</i>

42
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:17,301
<i>It's been 1 year,
22 weeks, and 4 days</i>

43
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,652
<i>since he touched
his childhood sweetheart</i>

44
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,490
<i>and brought her back to life,</i>

45
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:24,704
<i>and 2 days, 10 hours,
and 28 minutes</i>

46
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:28,243
<i>since Charlotte "Chuck" Charles
moved across the hall.</i>

47
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:31,155
<i>Whilst Chuck had called it
"apartment-sitting",</i>

48
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,872
<i>the pie maker sensed
a new beginning beginning.</i>

49
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,378
- Morning.
- Morning.

50
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:40,547
Did you sleep okay
over there?

51
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:43,564
I woke up to the smell of toast and eggs
drifting through sun-dappled curtains,

52
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:47,626
and I thought how lucky I am to be alive
in a world with sun-dappled anything.

53
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:49,945
I got so excited, I was afraid

54
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,386
my smile was gonna vibrate
the veneer off the cabinets.

55
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,466
It was me...

56
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,645
cooking toast and eggs.

57
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:58,016
Well, thank you for that.

58
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,128
Thank you for bringing me back to life.
Not in that order, but...

59
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:03,840
How did you sleep?

60
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,351
<i>The pie maker had grown accustomed
to the feeling his heart made</i>

61
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>when it looked out his eyes
and saw her sleeping in the next bed.</i>

62
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,057
<i>He had not.</i>

63
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:13,837
- Slept great.
- Really?

64
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,000
'Cause that smile wouldn't
vibrate anything off anything.

65
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,110
<i>The pie maker wondered
if moving a little bit apart</i>

66
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:22,438
<i>hadn't moved them
a little bit apart.</i>

67
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,983
<i>A little bit to the west...</i>

68
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:25,763
Emerson Cod. Please hold.

69
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:27,682
Emerson Cod. Please hold.

70
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,675
Please hold.

71
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,074
<i>Well known for his uncanny ability</i>

72
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:34,807
<i>to solve murders
and apprehend suspects,</i>

73
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:37,018
<i>less so for his silent partner</i>

74
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:39,558
<i>who can wake the dead
and ask who did it,</i>

75
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:41,838
<i>Emerson Cod's business
was booming.</i>

76
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,986
You know how to knock?

77
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:47,372
I did knock.
I came in, I said to myself,

78
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:49,849
"I hope this good man
can help me... knock wood",

79
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,329
and then I knocked.

80
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:54,128
My name
is Georgeann Heaps.

81
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,704
It's my nature to reward pushiness
with inattention, Mrs. Heaps.

82
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,584
However, if you'd like
to make an appointment.

83
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:01,771
For when...
the 10th of never?

84
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:04,255
I can see your phone blinking
like a casino sign.

85
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,883
I'm pushy, Mr. Cod,
not an idiot.

86
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,188
My teenage daughter would disagree
on that point if she were here, but...

87
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,168
she's not.

88
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:14,349
She's disappeared.

89
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:15,955
Missing-persons case?

90
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:18,835
It's been three weeks
since I've seen her last.

91
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:20,685
I'm desperate to find her.

92
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,525
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good with emotion.

93
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:26,569
- What emotion?
- All of them.

94
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:29,300
Police think my Nikki's
just another runaway,

95
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,887
so they won't look for her,

96
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,667
but that's not who she is.

97
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:35,119
She's sweet and helpful.

98
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,788
Well, did you ask
her friends?

99
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:38,844
Even her best friend
doesn't know where she went,

100
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:40,724
and Nikki hates to be alone.

101
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:43,544
I don't mean to lose control
like this.

102
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:47,632
Are you a parent or guardian,
Emerson Cod?

103
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,392
<i>Unprepared for the question,</i>

104
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,429
<i>the answer tried to hang on
to the inside of his throat.</i>

105
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:54,634
I used to be.

106
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,020
Did you say...

107
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,170
"used to be"?

108
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,588
I said I'd take the case.

109
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:01,237
<i>The words that choked
in Emerson Cod's throat</i>

110
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,730
<i>were that he, too, was the parent
of a missing daughter.</i>

111
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:08,715
<i>And she and Nikki Heaps were not
the only missing persons that morning.</i>

112
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:10,361
<i>There was another.</i>

113
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:14,989
<i>After falling apart in what had come
to be called a world-class tanty,</i>

114
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:19,484
<i>aunt Lily, panicked that Olive
might let slip some very big secrets,</i>

115
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:22,364
<i>whisked Olive off to a nunnery
in the country.</i>

116
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:26,814
Chuck's mother isn't some
woman who died in childbirth.

117
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:28,760
In fact, she's not dead at all.

118
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,767
Dying, maybe,
because of all the drinking,

119
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,331
but alive and pretending
to be her aunt Lily.

120
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:36,395
And Lily doesn't ever want
her sister Vivian to find this out

121
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:39,397
because Vivian was engaged
to Chuck's father when she got pregnant,

122
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:41,606
and he fully admitted
to having the affair,

123
00:05:41,636 --> 00:05:44,186
but told Vivian
it was with someone else.

124
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,878
So Vivian ended it.

125
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,022
Are you listening to me?

126
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:50,223
<i>Pigby enjoyed the warbling sounds</i>

127
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:53,114
<i>that the nice-smelling thing
that fed him, made.</i>

128
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,323
Sister Olive,

129
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:57,952
it's time for middle mid-morning
prayers in the chapel.

130
00:05:58,112 --> 00:05:59,328
Coming, Mother Superior.

131
00:06:00,723 --> 00:06:03,458
<i>As Olive set off to make
the best of her new life,</i>

132
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:06,577
<i>she was sorely missed
in the one she left behind.</i>

133
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,742
The service here
is terrible.

134
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:20,183
No service. Service left in the middle
of the night. Chuck's just filling in.

135
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:22,185
When does employee of the month
come back?

136
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,144
Don't know.

137
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,845
You pretend that you don't miss Olive,
but you do.

138
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,025
So do I.
I wish I knew where she went.

139
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,903
Would you please quit
looking at the door?

140
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,333
Every time I hear those bells,

141
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:35,364
I'm afraid Chuck's aunts
are gonna walk in again.

142
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:37,185
I took care of them
for 20 years.

143
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:40,119
They never even left the house.
What happened was incredibly unusual.

144
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:42,789
Please take this the right way,
but so is being dead but not dead.

145
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:43,783
Amen.

146
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:47,361
While I'd be shocked to see your aunts,
people who are dead but not dead

147
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:50,630
traditionally come up against angry mobs
with pitchforks and torches.

148
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:53,239
Better?

149
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,138
- You didn't sleep well.
- It was deep and perfect,

150
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:58,846
like a nap in the backseat of a car
after a day at the beach.

151
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:01,808
Would anyone
like to make some money?

152
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:06,311
Sweet Nikki Heaps
disappeared three weeks ago.

153
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:09,315
- Who is that next to her?
- That's Randi Jean, her best friend.

154
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,709
I already talked to her.
She doesn't know anything.

155
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:13,489
Well, let me talk to her.

156
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:16,503
She's not gonna tell a big PI the truth
and rat out her friend.

157
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,626
I'm not gonna tell you
anything about Nikki, okay?

158
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:20,618
I've made up my mind.
And you should know...

159
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:24,098
my dad says my mind is like
an old refrigerator in a deserted lot...

160
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:26,173
If a secret's out
playing around and it climbs in,

161
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:29,168
it ain't never getting out, okay?
So quit asking.

162
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,882
That girl isn't gonna
tell her anything.

163
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:38,136
We need to get us
some new leads and fast.

164
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,804
People don't run away
for no reason.

165
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:40,806
Sure they do.

166
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,507
You don't think it's curious that
Olive left in the middle of the night?

167
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,935
Because I'm curious.
I'm very curious.

168
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:49,547
"Curious" is tighty-whitey for "angry,"
and you ain't angry 'cause Olive left.

169
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:53,839
You're angry 'cause dead girl up and
moved her ass into the empty apartment.

170
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:55,019
You're wrong.

171
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:57,127
Person gets this little sip
of a fresh start,

172
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:59,082
they want to start drinking it
from the hose.

173
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,759
Today, an apartment
across the hall,

174
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:03,744
tomorrow, Paris
and a croissant maker named Philippe.

175
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,179
That's not who she is.

176
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,708
Nikki's living with her boyfriend
in a van out on Rustic Road.

177
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,088
His name's Rocky.

178
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,373
How'd you do?

179
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,251
<i>The dead girl had improvised.</i>

180
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,713
Nikki's mom's really worried.

181
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:16,024
Hello.
That was kind of the point.

182
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,932
Maybe her mom won't be
such a medicated pad

183
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:19,836
next time Nikki wants to go out
on a weeknight.

184
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,856
- Where'd she get the guts to run away?
- You think it took guts?

185
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,520
Most people
just think it was stupid.

186
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,559
I just moved out on my own,
and it's kind of scary.

187
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:28,926
Are you trying to find things
in common so I'll lower my guard

188
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:30,479
- and tell you where she is?
- No.

189
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,315
'cause the good-cop
thing won't work.

190
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,942
I know. I hate it when people do
that good-cop thing to me, too.

191
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,153
Sometimes I want to run away
just like Nikki.

192
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:38,654
That's not why she ran away.

193
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:42,069
Nikki wants to be a big star,
but her mom wouldn't take her seriously.

194
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,659
She's over being sweet little Nikki.

195
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:46,209
Shoot.

196
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,258
- I didn't want to tell you that.
- I didn't want you to tell me that.

197
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,250
- Isn't that weird?
- We are so alike.

198
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,920
If we ran away together, do you think
we'd end up where Nikki is?

199
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:57,406
I wish. She moved in with a cute guy
in a really tricked-out van.

200
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,951
- He's in entertainment.
- No way!

201
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,609
Not the guy with the crazy van who has
that thing with the entertainment.

202
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,638
- I know him.
- You know Rocky Baselli?

203
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:05,848
Shoot.

204
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:11,062
Nikki Heaps?

205
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:12,704
Are you in there?

206
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,301
Hello?

207
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,754
"Mimes do it with imagination."

208
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:19,471
That's cute.

209
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:27,869
That thing should have said,

210
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,706
"If this van's a-rockin',
I'm being murdered."

211
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:33,334
Looks like
he's been dead about a week.

212
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:34,445
One minute.

213
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,890
You Rocky?

214
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,730
He really is a mime.

215
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,620
Hi, sweetie.

216
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,179
Were you living
with Nikki Heaps?

217
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:50,726
Did she kill you?

218
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,145
All right, that's enough.

219
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,857
Someone poisoned my makeup.
I don't know who.

220
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,859
- Where's Nikki now?
- She's with some clown.

221
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,403
- A real clown?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,624
We met the jackass and
all his jackass buddies at the disco.

223
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,135
They're with the traveling circus.

224
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:07,375
This one dude was telling her
all these stories about

225
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,855
their big, glamorous life
on the road.

226
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:11,870
- Next day, she took off.
- Took off?

227
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,850
Said she wanted a fresh start.

228
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:15,719
That was the last I saw of her.

229
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,004
- This circus got a name?
- A <i>Circus Of Fun</i>.

230
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:21,505
I know. It sucks.
They can't have gotten that far.

231
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:23,640
Hey, if you find Nikki,

232
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:26,046
would you mind giving her this poem?

233
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,126
Yeah, sure.

234
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:29,849
Would you mind doing the glassbox thing?
'cause I love that.

235
00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:37,109
I'm glad
we're going to the circus.

236
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,251
- Can I get a menu, please?
- Right over there in the pile of menus.

237
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,499
What's with the attitude?

238
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,885
<i>What was with
the "attitude lady" was this...</i>

239
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,911
- What do you mean I can't come?
- Someone's got to run the <i>Pie Hole</i>.

240
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:53,122
- The pie maker?
- Emerson needs me.

241
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:56,667
- Why? There's no dead body to wake up.
- Nice. Anyone not hear that?

242
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,584
Are you mad at me?
Is it about something else?

243
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,724
Nothing else. I promise
I'll let you come next time.

244
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:03,263
- Thank you for the permission.
- You don't need my permission.

245
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:05,957
Thank you for the permission
not to need your permission.

246
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:07,645
It's a traveling circus,

247
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,360
not a "wait around for you two
to work all your junk out" circus.

248
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,975
- I'll be back soon.
- And I'll be here forever.

249
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,048
That was curious.

250
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,830
<i>As the pie maker wondered
if Chuck moving out</i>

251
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,235
<i>was making him passive
or aggressive or both,</i>

252
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:27,573
<i>Olive wondered when her new beginning
would feel like it had begun.</i>

253
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:30,409
It's time for late mid-afternoon
prayer, Sister Olive.

254
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:31,994
Excuse me, Mother Superior,

255
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,206
does something ever happen where
you think everything's kind of blah,

256
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:39,028
like blah brick walls,
blah faux shaker furniture,

257
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:41,111
blah good works,
and then shazam!

258
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:43,756
All the little boring stuff
suddenly becomes full of meaning?

259
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,571
- Like an epiphany.
- Bingo.

260
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,851
Not very often.

261
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:49,178
It takes time to fill a life
with meaning.

262
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,389
Our days here are not easy,
Sister Olive.

263
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,816
But you will find that with hard work
and personal sacrifice,

264
00:11:56,181 --> 00:12:00,272
you will strip away everything
from your old life and start a new.

265
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:02,775
- Great.
- Come along soon.

266
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,070
Don't be late.

267
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,738
Oh, hey, Sister,
want a chapel buddy?

268
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:11,700
Lily! What are you doing here?
I thought you went home.

269
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,410
- Why did you come back?
- I can't be seen.

270
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,208
- Meet me in the chapel tonight.
- When?

271
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:22,334
Early mid-middle night prayer.

272
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:39,798
This ain't no circus.

273
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,231
A circus is supposed to smell
like popcorn and cotton candy,

274
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:45,401
not wet sawdust and underarm.

275
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:47,069
This is a damn freak show.

276
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:50,642
Why would sweet Nikki Heaps
want to run away here?

277
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:53,075
People decide they want to leave
and start over,

278
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:56,354
a switch flips, a fuse blows,
and then everything's got to change.

279
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,734
You can't just
have half a revolution.

280
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:02,125
And don't be looking at me
with them psycho-babbly eyes

281
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:04,112
like this case is personal to me
or something.

282
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:05,629
No eyes.
Just looking.

283
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,591
You are not allowed back here.

284
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,634
We don't allow any stubs
snooping around.

285
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:11,927
Stubs?

286
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:14,035
There are two kinds of people
in this world...

287
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:16,985
The ones that take the risks
and make you feel something

288
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:19,665
besides the dull thudding
of your own heart

289
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,947
and those that pay to watch...

290
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:24,815
- with a ticket stub in the pocket.
- I got it.

291
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:27,865
We're investigating the disappearance
of a young girl

292
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:29,354
and the murder of her boyfriend.

293
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:30,572
Sorry, I can't help you.

294
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,540
Have you seen the separate police lockup
they have for cocky young acrobats?

295
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,593
'cause I haven't.

296
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:36,660
I'm upside down, <i>mon ami</i>.
I'm not foolish.

297
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,913
So, Nikki was last seen
with the clowns.

298
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:42,356
Talk to <i>senor</i> Arnaud
in the office trailer.

299
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,627
He's in charge of the <i>Circus Of Fun</i>.

300
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,498
- Thank you.
- But remember...

301
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:49,372
There are two things
clowns make around here...

302
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:52,010
Balloon animals and enemies.

303
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:01,266
I don't know her.

304
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:04,563
We get a lot of people passing through.
Hard to keep track of everybody.

305
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:07,483
The girl we're looking for was hitching
a ride with a mime who ended up dead.

306
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,693
Guess that's one box
he won't get out of.

307
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,798
The clowns
haze the newbies pretty bad.

308
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:16,909
If she didn't quit, she's probably
been assigned to apprentice one of them.

309
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:21,054
- Where can we find these clowns?
- Drunk in a ditch would be my guess.

310
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,884
They usually stumble in
just before showtime,

311
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:25,626
and they always travel in a pack.

312
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,795
- Like wolves.
- More like cigarettes.

313
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:34,051
Yeah, well, thanks for your help.

314
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:36,378
Sorry I don't remember the girl.

315
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:43,064
You notice his secretary snort-giggled
whenever he made a joke?

316
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:46,411
- But she also snort-giggled when...
- When he said he didn't remember her.

317
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:50,074
- Could've been a nervous snort-giggle.
- 'cause she knew he was lying.

318
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:51,360
She's worth a second look.

319
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,826
- I'll go.
- Oh, let me.

320
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:56,396
<i>98 bottles of beer on the wall</i>

321
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:59,060
<i>98 bottles of beer,</i>

322
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,047
<i>take one down,
pass it around...</i>

323
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:09,483
- Did I leave my keys, Miss...?
- Dijon.

324
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,338
No, I don't think you did.

325
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:14,784
Miss Dijon...

326
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,511
- One more thing.
- Besides the keys?

327
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:18,361
Yes.

328
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:20,379
Because
those weren't really a thing...

329
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:23,237
More of an excuse for you
to walk to the door and then turn back

330
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,616
and ask me a real question,
which is coming right up.

331
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:28,578
Is it possible your boss knew something
he didn't tell about the missing girl?

332
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:31,025
- No.
- Is it possible you knew something?

333
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,327
Why didn't you tell us?

334
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:37,197
I didn't like that girl.
Nobody who met her did.

335
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,805
- But she was Sweet Nikki.
- Not around here, she wasn't.

336
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,870
I say she deserves
what she gets now.

337
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:45,039
- What does she get now?
- What she deserves.

338
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:47,541
The pie maker had gotten
the information he needed,

339
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:51,326
but not the information
he wanted.

340
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:54,376
Nikki was apprenticed to the head clown,
named Jackie Johnny,

341
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:56,884
who, according to her,
was a real lousy, low-down...

342
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:02,054
I've never heard you
say those words.

343
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,335
I'm just repeating them?

344
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,857
She left with Jackie Johnny
after the show last night.

345
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,260
No one's seen them since.

346
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,153
Well, we need to find
this Jackie Johnny and fast.

347
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,302
<i>In less than 16 seconds,
the dead girl who was not dead</i>

348
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:24,567
<i>would be involved in the
smallest of ironic coincidences.</i>

349
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,510
<i>For just as she said
to herself...</i>

350
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,700
I wish I were
where the action were at.

351
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,909
<i>She was where it were at.</i>

352
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,730
Sorry.
We're closing early today.

353
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:43,598
<i>Her aunt Vivian, who would
have dropped dead from shock</i>

354
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,878
<i>at seeing her niece
alive again...</i>

355
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:46,816
Hello?

356
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,289
<i>... arrived again.</i>

357
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,650
<i>Upon seeing her aunt Vivian
return to the </i>Pie Hole<i>,</i>

358
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,152
<i>it was not just Chuck's heart
that leapt.</i>

359
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,840
Hello?

360
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,288
I'm an acquaintance
of the pie maker.

361
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:09,135
A triple berry, to go,
if it's not that much trouble.

362
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,626
You must be new here.

363
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,794
Our friend Olive used to
deliver them to our house.

364
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,758
Always lifted the spirit.

365
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,044
Has anyone heard
from Olive yet?

366
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:26,236
I suppose not.

367
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,988
Quiet here without her.

368
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:35,482
My sister left again on
an overnight trip without explanation.

369
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:40,091
The emptiness at our house
was like a ringing chinese gong

370
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:41,989
which only pie can muffle.

371
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,069
<i>For many months,
Chuck had made her aunts</i>

372
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:45,844
<i>the pies Olive had delivered,</i>

373
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:48,537
<i>secretly adding
homeopathic antidepressants</i>

374
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,547
<i>to aid them with their grief.</i>

375
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:52,999
I didn't see it arrive.

376
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:54,633
Should I leave the money?

377
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:55,763
<i>But for now,</i>

378
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:59,426
<i>the only mood-altering
ingredients in this particular pie</i>

379
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:02,086
<i>were the endorphins
in Chuck's tears.</i>

380
00:18:02,116 --> 00:18:03,066
Thank you.

381
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:05,819
You were a very kind listener.

382
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,302
If Miss Dijon is right, this is the road
she saw them take when they left

383
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:24,656
and they weren't running away,
it dead-ends in a mile.

384
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,816
I don't like this road.

385
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,284
Got a...
"Kick out the window and run

386
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:32,497
'cause they about to cap your ass"
kind of feel to it.

387
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:34,917
I just want to find this girl
and get this case over with.

388
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:38,045
You think I made Chuck stay behind cause
I'm upset she moved out, but I'm not.

389
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:40,506
I know. You're upset
she's not upset she moved out.

390
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,486
I want to be happy, too,
but I miss her.

391
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,050
It's hard enough being in a relationship
where we can't touch, but...

392
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,730
we improvise,
figured out ways around that.

393
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,475
I've even built contraptions.

394
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:53,769
Do you understand
how a head works? Do you?

395
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:56,325
See, 'cause every time you say
something, I got to think it.

396
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:59,630
You say "Monkey in suit driving a car",
I think "Monkey in suit driving a car".

397
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,039
- Don't tell me what y'all do together.
- There's a weird mask.

398
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,264
Please. Now I'm begging you
to stop this.

399
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:06,657
No, there's a weird clown mask
back there in the bushes.

400
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,208
There's skid marks
over there.

401
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,288
- Car must have gone off the road here.
- Emerson.

402
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:23,441
What you want to bet
that's Jackie Johnny's clown wig?

403
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:24,521
Poor Nikki.

404
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,616
Got a male driver
in a clown costume.

405
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:52,244
That's got to be Jackie Johnny.

406
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:55,247
Got another male passenger,
clown costume.

407
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:58,746
That's not Nikki.
Thank goodness.

408
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:00,336
Yeah, but now we got
a missing girl,

409
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,083
a dead mime,
and two dead clowns.

410
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,163
Another one!

411
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:05,632
Dead mime
and three dead clowns.

412
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:07,285
Beelze-b!

413
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,595
There's a whole bunch
in the back.

414
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:31,406
The good news is
your daughter wasn't one of the

415
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:33,076
many bodies recovered from the car.

416
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,203
It seems you're no closer
to finding my sweet Nikki.

417
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:38,525
Well, we're doing all we can,
Mrs. Heaps.

418
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,585
The tragic death of all the circus
clowns was an unexpected development.

419
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:44,011
You need to find her, Mr. Cod.

420
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:46,919
I don't wear my feelings like a shiny,
sparkly brooch.

421
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:50,260
But if I did, my sadness and
anxiety would be mesmerizing right now.

422
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,904
We're making progress.

423
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,227
We know that Nikki was seen leaving
late last night with Jackie Johnny,

424
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:57,726
one of the unfortunate
clowns in the car.

425
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:58,984
What's your plan...

426
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:01,647
To bring him back to life
and ask him where she is?

427
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:04,478
That was a joke.

428
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:11,632
Hey, sorry.

429
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:14,664
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- That's okay.

430
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:17,072
So, which one's Jackie Johnny?

431
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:19,259
I'm sorry I asked you
to stay at the <i>Pie Hole</i>.

432
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:21,730
It was very pleasant, actually.
Quiet all day.

433
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:27,493
From now on, until Olive
gets back or we hire a new waitress,

434
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:29,581
I am closing the Pie
Hole whenever we have a case.

435
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:32,178
You can't close the <i>Pie Hole</i>.
People depend on it.

436
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,092
People can learn to live without
the <i>Pie Hole</i> for a few hours at a time.

437
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:37,538
No, not all people.

438
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:43,949
Vivian stopped by.
She never saw me, and then she left.

439
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:46,400
- I told you they'd come back.
- I know, and you were right.

440
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,804
But I took care of it myself.
I can do that, you know.

441
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:52,072
I've noticed that,
from where I live, across the hall.

442
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:55,580
Jackie Johnny?

443
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:57,642
- You got a smoke?
- No.

444
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,627
Mr. Johnny,
we're looking for Nikki Heaps.

445
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:01,226
She was last seen leaving with you,


446
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:03,166
but she wasn't with you
when we pulled you out.

447
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,044
Yeah, we left together, but
I sent her back in to clean up the mess.

448
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:07,753
- What mess?
- We had a little fun with

449
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:10,133
a volunteer from the audience...
maybe a little too much fun.

450
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:11,799
Nikki's lowest on the totem pole,

451
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,261
so I sent her back in to calm him
down and hose him off.

452
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:16,445
- What did you do to him?
- Let's just say it involves

453
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:20,380
Peppers the horse and a pound and a half
of chocolate-flavored diarrhetic.

454
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,311
It's off-putting now,
but hilarious in the moment.

455
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:25,104
After the show, you drove away...

456
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,642
And another car ran us off the road.

457
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,486
As a matter of fact, that guy from
the audience did threaten to kill us.

458
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:32,821
Do you remember his name?

459
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:34,533
Bryce Von Deenis.

460
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,716
I remember 'cause we made up
a limerick about him

461
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:38,621
and had the whole
audience sing it to him.

462
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:42,748
So Von Deenis is the last
person to be seen with Nikki.

463
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:46,220
And he may be responsible for driving
15 clowns off the road to their death.

464
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:48,958
There was a young
man named Von Deenis...

465
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:50,380
Who they said had a very big...

466
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,699
As the private investigator
laid a trap

467
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,817
for the last person to be seen
with missing girl sweet Nikki Heaps...

468
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:01,725
Lily returned to the nunnery
to make a confession.

469
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:07,481
Everything I told you is a lie.

470
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:10,342
Oh, get out.
You're not Charlotte's mother?

471
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:12,177
Okay, that part's true.

472
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:13,840
Charlotte is my daughter, but

473
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,641
I never, never slept
with Charles Charles.

474
00:23:19,184 --> 00:23:23,332
He was my sister's fiance,
and I would never do that.

475
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:26,458
But Charlotte thinks Charles
Charles is her real dad.

476
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:29,336
And so did he,
because I told him he was.

477
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:30,837
See, I tricked him

478
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:33,340
into raising Charlotte as his own.

479
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,050
But you said
you never slept with him.

480
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,757
I didn't...

481
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,638
because I would never do that.

482
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:41,318
But...

483
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:44,851
why did he believe you when you told
him that Charlotte was his daughter?

484
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,427
Damn it.

485
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:52,440
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!

486
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,534
So, it's not a lie, is it?

487
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:02,577
You just wanted to take it back.

488
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:11,485
You hide booze in your Bible?

489
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:14,753
Ever since I told you what I did,

490
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:19,136
the secret's like this
elephant in our parlor again.

491
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,971
I can't even look Vivian in the eye.

492
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:23,559
I was gonna wait to tell her
till one of us was on our deathbed,

493
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,142
but that'll be for-friggin'- ever.

494
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,979
<i>As Olive considered how the secrets</i>

495
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,314
<i>she and aunt Lily were keeping
were holding them back,</i>

496
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,683
<i>the pie maker tried
to explain his fear of letting go.</i>

497
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:36,741
How'd you sleep?

498
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:38,737
I'm afraid to answer that.

499
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:40,676
Hey, maybe this is all too fast.

500
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:43,357
There are real risks to being on
your own if people found out about you.

501
00:24:43,387 --> 00:24:45,436
If your aunts are coming
in to the <i>Pie Hole</i> now...

502
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,378
Yeah, but why are they
coming to the <i>Pie Hole</i>?

503
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:49,530
I mean, why is aunt Lily
on an overnight trip?

504
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,784
That's not who they are.

505
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:53,837
Well, apparently it is who they are,
so I don't know who they are.

506
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,077
Who they were was

507
00:24:56,107 --> 00:24:59,009
brokenhearted and in mourning,
which may be changing.

508
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,504
So they're allowed
to move on and start over,

509
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,428
but you don't want
me to move across the hall?

510
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:04,806
Excuse me.

511
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:09,102
I got this coupon
for a dozen free pies from the <i>Pie Hole</i>.

512
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,116
Congratulations.
Take a seat.

513
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,146
Thank you.

514
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:16,353
You win some pies, Mr. Von Deenis?

515
00:25:16,802 --> 00:25:18,100
How do you know my name?

516
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,321
Everybody knows it.
It's just one of those places.

517
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:22,908
We're looking for a girl
you met at the circus the other night.

518
00:25:22,968 --> 00:25:24,757
A teenager named Nikki,
a clown in training.

519
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:27,297
You were the last person to be seen
with her before she disappeared.

520
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,510
Yeah, I remember her.

521
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:32,146
She was mad because

522
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:35,210
the other clowns made her stay late
to clean me up.

523
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,129
There's witnesses say
you threatened them.

524
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:41,025
They stripped me down to my underwear,
marched me to the center ring,

525
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:43,670
where half the audience
threw chocolate pies at me

526
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,564
while they sang this "oh, so funny"
rhyming song about my name...

527
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:49,952
So I thought they were done.

528
00:25:50,206 --> 00:25:51,024
But, no...

529
00:25:51,054 --> 00:25:54,708
They said I needed a shower,
but there was no shower,

530
00:25:55,111 --> 00:25:57,317
just some horse named Peppers.

531
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,430
Oh, my god.

532
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,776
Somebody did that to me,
I'd want to kill them twice.

533
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:02,524
And I didn't even see it coming.

534
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:05,236
They made me wear some clown mask.

535
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:07,143
So when Nikki came back,

536
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,607
you grabbed her, followed the other,
 then ran them into the pond.

537
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:12,598
When you saw what happened,
you dropped your mask in the bushes.

538
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:14,992
- Where's Nikki, Von Deenis?
- I don't know!

539
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,420
I never chased after them.
Nikki did.

540
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,505
- Nikki?
- Yeah.

541
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:20,548
I gave her back the clown mask,

542
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:22,888
then she hopped
in one of the clown cars

543
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:24,963
and chased after them to catch up.

544
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:27,049
And you can prove it wasn't
you that went after them?

545
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,734
My kids wouldn't even
get into the car with me.

546
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,895
They made me play games in the midway
until my clothes dried off.

547
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:37,899
<i>The trail of Nikki Heaps
seemed to go cold.</i>

548
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,945
<i>The pie maker
returned to his apartment</i>

549
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:44,817
<i>and pondered what the temperature
of his relationship</i>

550
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:47,199
<i>with the girl across the hall was.</i>

551
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:48,929
Chuck?

552
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:54,525
I talked to that ring-toss guy.

553
00:26:54,555 --> 00:26:56,583
He confirmed Von Deenis
didn't leave the circus till

554
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:59,582
after them clowns would have
gone into the pond, so he didn't do it.

555
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,104
It's really late.

556
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,679
You got any tea?

557
00:27:07,662 --> 00:27:10,544
If Bryce was telling the truth about her
and she was the one who went after them,

558
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:12,553
then that puts Nikki
at the scene of the murders.

559
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:14,626
- And he said she was angry.
- Nikki didn't run

560
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:16,586
them clowns off the road.
That ain't who she is.

561
00:27:16,616 --> 00:27:18,666
I don't know.
I think you're right about people.

562
00:27:18,696 --> 00:27:21,650
They decide they want a fresh start, and
everything about them ends up changing.

563
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,851
I didn't come here
to talk about dead girl.

564
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,259
Why the change of heart about Nikki?

565
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:28,450
I guess my glass
is half full on this one.

566
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,338
I would say
you don't even have a glass.

567
00:27:30,368 --> 00:27:32,798
You just have a wet ring
on the table where the glass used to be.

568
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:35,501
We're talking
about a lost little girl.

569
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:38,039
Now, maybe she is
a little pissant pain in the ass,

570
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:39,723
but I don't think she's a murderer.

571
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,424
Why did you take this case?

572
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:49,266
Nikki's mother asked me if I knew
what it was like to lose a daughter.

573
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,822
Did your daughter run away?

574
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:58,146
Wife ran away...
took her with seven years ago.

575
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:00,607
- Does anyone...
- No one knows.

576
00:28:01,298 --> 00:28:02,925
- I know.
- Wish you didn't.

577
00:28:04,422 --> 00:28:05,632
I got to go.

578
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,657
Would you still recognize her?

579
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,068
She was a stubborn little thing.

580
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,001
I'd recognize that.

581
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:22,545
At least some things never change.

582
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,799
Why are you smiling?
This is all very weepy stuff.

583
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:29,761
Nikki's mother told me the thing
Nikki hated the most was being alone.

584
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:31,982
She left home with a mime,
then with the clowns.

585
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:33,769
I bet she never
even left the circus.

586
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:36,975
- I bet she's too scared to go very far.
- How can you be sure?

587
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:39,479
Wishful thinking.

588
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:44,234
I'm gonna find this girl.

589
00:28:47,823 --> 00:28:49,149
All right, we'll split up.

590
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,733
You two take the midway,
I'll go around back to the big top.

591
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,168
What if we can't find her?

592
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:56,024
Well, that means I'm wrong about her,
and we're back to square one.

593
00:28:56,054 --> 00:29:00,237
<i>As the private investigators set out
once again to hunt for the missing girl,</i>

594
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,095
<i>Olive and Lily ate the
morning porridge</i>

595
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,922
<i>and wondered if the truffle-hunting pig
might be retrained</i>

596
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:08,507
<i>to hunt for a packet of sugar.</i>

597
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:12,178
I'd forgotten how much I hated
this morning porridge when I was here.

598
00:29:12,513 --> 00:29:15,077
I could throw up in my mouth a little
and not even know the difference.

599
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:18,270
This is a terrible thing to say, but
I thought that when Charlotte died...

600
00:29:19,403 --> 00:29:22,086
My guilt over
what I did to Vivian might die, too.

601
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:23,850
But it didn't.

602
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,107
It lived on.

603
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,236
<i>It was then that Olive
realized she would now have</i>

604
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:31,239
<i>to keep an even bigger secret
from Lily, that Chuck</i>

605
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,797
<i>was still alive.</i>

606
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:35,596
Maybe there's some sort
of cosmic reason it didn't die.

607
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:38,957
Your guilt...
not Charlotte, of course.

608
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:40,762
I just can't seem
to put it behind me.

609
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,794
The truth is, I haven't really
put Charlotte behind me, either.

610
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,071
<i>Suddenly, without warning,</i>

611
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:50,234
<i>Olive Snook had a tiny,
yet very real, epiphany.</i>

612
00:29:50,264 --> 00:29:52,177
Maybe you shouldn't
put Charlotte behind you.

613
00:29:52,528 --> 00:29:54,734
Maybe you should
put her in front of you.

614
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:56,890
Don't completely let her go.
Cling a little.

615
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,391
What about a fresh start?

616
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:00,058
It's too soon.
You need to go home.

617
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:03,444
Your sister needs you. She's lost
her niece. She can't lose you, too.

618
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:05,606
I can't make you stay
in this place forever.

619
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:09,660
I came here to keep your secret,
but I'm staying to keep one of my own,

620
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,044
one that I could never,

621
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,749
ever,

622
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:14,675
ever...

623
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,160
- tell you.
- Tell me.

624
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,560
I still love the pie maker,
and he loves someone else.

625
00:30:20,822 --> 00:30:21,968
Damn it.

626
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,579
Forgive me.

627
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:33,737
Can I say I know you can
take care of yourself?

628
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:36,638
When you moved out, I panicked because
I thought everything was changing and...

629
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:38,237
Everything is changing.

630
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:40,425
Way to ruin a good apology.

631
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:43,144
What is so terrible
about starting fresh?

632
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:45,605
Because "starting fresh" means
something else is ending stale.

633
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:48,540
You're Chuck,

634
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:52,362
who I destroyed play-doh cities with,
Chuck, my best friend, my first kiss.

635
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,493
- I don't want that to change.
- Yeah.

636
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,892
And I'm also Chuck
who went on a pleasure cruise

637
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:00,745
and got a plastic bag
put over her head.

638
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:03,248
- That's not as much fun to remember.
- But it happened.

639
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,608
And when it was happening,
I was thinking...

640
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:08,752
I was thinking, "Son of a bitch, why'd
I have to go get ice for my ginger ale?"

641
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,255
But really I was thinking,

642
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:12,590
"I finally get to live my own life,
and it's already over."

643
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:14,840
And then you...

644
00:31:16,784 --> 00:31:18,929
you came
and you gave me another chance.

645
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:20,110
So it's my fault.

646
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,353
My first time around,
I was terrified of change,

647
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,851
and I'm not gonna make
that mistake again. I can't.

648
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:27,981
But how can you start again with someone
who only knows who you were before?

649
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,232
How do we make it work?

650
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:33,249
I knew the caterpillar, but maybe it's
time for you to become the butterfly.

651
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,488
You did not just say that.

652
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,240
Did not know you were there.

653
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:40,743
Truckload of mimes just pulled up,
and they ain't talking.

654
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,687
I mean, they can talk.

655
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:45,398
They just aren't saying anything

656
00:31:45,428 --> 00:31:48,009
except they knew there'd be jobs
opening up at the circus.

657
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:50,712
Word must have spread about
the clowns needing to be replaced.

658
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,922
Wait a minute. Rocky was looking
for a job, too... Look.

659
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:58,368
"Mimes, jugglers are invited to
fill positions available immediately."

660
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:00,208
There's no name, but...

661
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:02,473
same number.

662
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,430
We found Rocky three days ago.

663
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,241
Before they disappeared.
So how did the circus management

664
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:10,055
know they need to replace the clowns
before they even knew they were dead?

665
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:12,254
Unless someone knew
they were gonna be dead.

666
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:13,793
Arnaud.

667
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,614
It was a union dispute.

668
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:17,586
Union?

669
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:19,422
The clowns
would pretend to go drinking,

670
00:32:19,452 --> 00:32:22,070
but I knew they were having
secret meetings, trying to organize.

671
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,059
They wanted health care, more money.

672
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,788
I was gonna fire 'em, not kill 'em.

673
00:32:25,972 --> 00:32:27,749
How'd you know about
these secret meetings?

674
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:29,507
Nikki was my spy on the inside.

675
00:32:29,977 --> 00:32:31,998
The other clowns had no idea.

676
00:32:32,337 --> 00:32:34,404
She left here to follow them
to a meeting the night

677
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:37,558
they got run into the lake.
I swear, it was the last time I saw her.

678
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:40,267
- Why didn't you tell us?
- 'cause I know I'd look guilty.

679
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:42,722
When she disappeared
and you all came looking for her,

680
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,224
I got scared I'd get put away.

681
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:45,975
Why would Nikki want to be your spy?

682
00:32:46,035 --> 00:32:47,976
Said everyone thought
she was a wallflower,

683
00:32:48,006 --> 00:32:50,324
so she was gonna start
over and be a star.

684
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:52,245
Yeah. Yeah.

685
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:55,276
She didn't like having to pay her dues
with the other clowns so we made a deal.

686
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:57,352
She'd spy on
the clowns' union activities...

687
00:32:57,382 --> 00:32:58,997
In return,
you'd put her in the show.

688
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,934
She said she'd do anything
not to go back to who she was.

689
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:04,285
I just didn't think
she was capable of murder.

690
00:33:04,722 --> 00:33:05,703
What was that?

691
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:10,875
Oh, hell no!

692
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,504
Get down!

693
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:27,146
I think the human
cannonball was meant for us.

694
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:31,194
<i>Well aware that the range
of a human cannonball is less</i>

695
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:34,356
<i>than the diameter of
a low-rent traveling circus...</i>

696
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,133
Was that Nikki?
Did she shoot at us?

697
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:37,043
No.

698
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,240
But I think I know who did,

699
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,780
and if Nikki is still here,
we better find her before they do.

700
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,262
<i>The private investigator felt</i>

701
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:46,035
<i>he was closing in on the answers
to the mystery.</i>

702
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:54,108
Hey, listen.

703
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,600
I know you're in here.

704
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,690
We know
you were spying on the clowns.

705
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:18,510
You saw them get run off the road.

706
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,410
We know that 'cause we found
the mask that Bryce gave back to you.

707
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,571
You didn't run them off the road,
Nikki, but you saw who did.

708
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:28,995
And now you're scared.
Am I right, honey?

709
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,584
You're right.

710
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:38,536
Why would
you stay here in the circus?

711
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:41,566
I was too scared to leave,
and I couldn't go home.

712
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,574
- My mom's gonna kill me.
- Did you know we were looking for you?

713
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:46,692
Well, yeah,
but I figured you thought

714
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:49,052
I had run the clowns off
the road, so I hid.

715
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:50,305
I don't understand...

716
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:53,325
The only other person you told about the
clowns' secret meeting was Mr. Arnaud.

717
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:55,747
Well, he didn't kill them.

718
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:57,669
How could anyone else have known?

719
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:00,568
Arnaud was the only one she told, but he
wasn't the only one who was listening.

720
00:35:01,096 --> 00:35:03,340
Ain't that right, Nikki? Nikki!

721
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,696
<i>The facts were these...</i>

722
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,536
<i>Nikki Heaps had come to snitch.</i>

723
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:11,286
<i>Reporting to management that the clowns
were planning their secret meeting,</i>

724
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,080
<i>she was sent back out to spy.</i>

725
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,865
<i>But someone else was spying on her.</i>

726
00:35:15,895 --> 00:35:18,906
<i>Wanting to keep the budding clown
union from blooming,</i>

727
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:20,406
<i>the acrobat leapt.</i>

728
00:35:20,614 --> 00:35:23,161
<i>The clowns drove off
to meet secretly in the woods,</i>

729
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:25,486
<i>hoping to officially
form their union</i>

730
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:27,933
<i>and plan their stand against
circus management,</i>

731
00:35:27,963 --> 00:35:30,206
<i>leaving Nikki behind on cleanup.</i>

732
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,643
<i>The acrobat followed
the clowns into the darkness,</i>

733
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:37,271
<i>unaware that the left-behind
Nikki was done with her duty</i>

734
00:35:37,331 --> 00:35:39,034
<i>and was now quickly catching up.</i>

735
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:53,828
<i>The acrobat would make
sure that the only labor movement</i>

736
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:56,950
<i>that night was a sudden
movement off the road</i>

737
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,090
<i>and into cold, murky water.</i>

738
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:03,714
<i>And as he would catch
sight of young Nikki</i>

739
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:06,329
<i>witnessing
his terrible clownicide...</i>

740
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:10,429
<i>The snitch
would need to be snatched.</i>

741
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:11,737
Look!

742
00:36:14,744 --> 00:36:17,332
That union would have
put us all out of business!

743
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:20,798
Who ever heard of a circus
with a fair and safe workplace?

744
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:22,108
You fools!

745
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:24,317
I only wished to scare the clowns!

746
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:27,154
Yeah, well, what about Rocky the mime?
Were you just trying to scare him, too?

747
00:36:27,214 --> 00:36:29,185
No, I wanted it to look
like the clowns did it

748
00:36:29,215 --> 00:36:31,037
to scare off the mimes
from taking the jobs.

749
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:33,646
You see, I just wanted
everything to stay the same.

750
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,145
Is that so terrible?

751
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:38,207
<i>Pierre, est-ce que je peux avoir
un minute avec Nikki, s'il vous plaît?</i>

752
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:39,583
<i>Oui,</i> one <i>minute</i>.

753
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:41,711
Nikki, Rocky wrote you a poem.

754
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:44,379
Oh, he did?
He was always so nice.

755
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:47,198
"No matter
where you go or what you do,

756
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,509
you'll always be
my sweet Nikki Heaps."

757
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:50,895
Thank you.

758
00:36:51,094 --> 00:36:52,388
That's beautiful.

759
00:36:53,049 --> 00:36:54,343
My demands are simple!

760
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:58,020
- First, in return for the girl's life,
- Hand me one of them things.

761
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,257
I demand
safe passage across the border.

762
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:01,481
Secondly...

763
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:12,844
You won me a prize.

I still can't believe
you did this to me.

775
00:38:00,942 --> 00:38:03,042

776
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:04,263
You know what?

777

"Find my daughter.

779
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,785
Find my daughter."

780
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:12,385
Well, I found your daughter.

781
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:14,377
I don't know who she is anymore.

782
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:16,597
She's completely changed.

783
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:18,391
Love what's there.

784
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:20,851
Love it.

785
00:38:26,648 --> 00:38:27,888

I make pies and wake the dead.

796
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,322
I live alone.

797
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:26,788
And this empty bed next to me has never
been slept in by anyone

00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,210
at any time.

799
00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:29,311
I'm Chuck,

00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:32,996
a single girl who recently moved
into her own apartment in a big city,

801
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:36,416
raised in a small town by two
unmarried sisters I call my aunts.

802
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:40,094
I have unexciting,
yet realistic, hopes for my life.

803
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,543
I'm yet to meet anyone new here,

804
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:45,894
and today is just another day in
which I fully expect nothing special...

805
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:47,571
- Or exciting...
- To happen.

806
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:54,152

We're two strangers in a big city.

I work in the <i>Pie Hole</i> downstairs.

813
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:13,324
Really?

814
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:15,174
I own the <i>Pie Hole</i> downstairs.

815
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,676
May we... walk together?

00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:20,856
- Well, that would be swell, Harvey.
- It's Ned, actually.

817
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:23,225
