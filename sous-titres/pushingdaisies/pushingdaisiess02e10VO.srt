Pushing Daisies - Season 02 Episode 10
"<i>The Norwegians</i>"

3
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:11,298
<i>At this very moment
at the Longborough school for boys,</i>

4
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:15,639
<i>young Ned had convinced
Eugene Mulchandani to go to war.</i>

5
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:22,257
<i>For not only was it proof
of his undying patriotism,</i>

6
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,668
<i>it was also a much-needed escape</i>

7
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:28,905
<i>from an advanced geometry lesson
in proofs of the Pythagorean kind.</i>

8
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:32,168
<i>However, like all hill-advised
troop deployments,</i>

9
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:36,249
<i>it did not come without its share
of unexpected casualties.</i>

10
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:46,102
<i>As they approached
their first combat fatality,</i>

11
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:48,825
<i>Eugene's emotional radar
was overcome,</i>

12
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:50,667
<i>forcing a hasty retreat.</i>

13
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:57,135
<i>Young Ned, on the other hand,
stood his ground.</i>

14
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:01,531
<i>He rationalized that,
if he solved the hunter's murder,</i>

15
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:05,400
<i>the acclaim would bring
his father back into his life.</i>

16
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:11,007
<i>But the hunter revealed
his cause of death was accidental</i>

17
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,375
<i>and self-inflicted.</i>

18
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,992
<i>There was no murderer to be caught.</i>

19
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:18,538
<i>Though the park ranger
would believe otherwise.</i>

20
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:22,557
<i>Waking the dead had landed
young Ned in jail.</i>

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,130
<i>Both boys were perceived,</i>

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,767
<i>by Papen County juvenile
correction officers,</i>

23
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:28,349
<i>as anything but heroes.</i>

24
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,786
<i>And while his comrade secured
an honorable discharge,</i>

25
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:38,566
<i>through the strength
of his parental allies,</i>

26
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:46,128
<i>young Ned realized that his father was
not going to fight his battles for him.</i>

27
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,545
<i>For in jail, as in life,</i>

28
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:51,890
<i>he needed to take responsibility
for his actions.</i>

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,475
- Dad!
- <i>It's 20 years, 10 months,</i>

30
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:57,363
<i>8 days, 4 hours
and 17 minutes later.</i>

31
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:01,324
<i>Once again, waking the dead
was a cause for concern.</i>

32
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:05,780
<i>The dead in this instance
was Chuck's father, Charles Charles,</i>

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,371
<i>who had chosen to flee.</i>

34
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,301
What's he doing?
Where's he going?

35
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,440
That's my car.
He stole my car!

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,965
He's not supposed to leave.
He's my dad.

37
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,445
This is really bad.

38
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:22,724
This...

39
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,255
is really...

40
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:25,797
bad.

41
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,179
Really...

42
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,577
really, really, really, really bad.

43
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:30,919
He just left.

44
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:34,290
No explanation, no apology,
no forwarding address.

45
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,627
At least mine left a forwarding address
to a new house, with a new family.

46
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,761
Now I know how you feel. Losing your dad
because he die is horrible enough,

47
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,298
but losing him because he chooses
to leave is just really horrible.

48
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:48,032
Basically I've been
dumped by my own dad.

49
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,144
You haven't been dad-dumped.

50
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:53,554
I'm the one he's mad at.
He asked you to choose, me or him.

51
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:54,589
It's my fault.

52
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,341
I'm the reason he left after you risked
everything to bring him back.

53
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:59,899
I risked you.
I used you to bring him back.

54
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,285
It was wrong and selfish, and
we're in this mess because of me.

55
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,844
What if dad goes and tells people
there's a pie maker who has a knack for

56
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,024
baking and...

57
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:08,783
waking dead people?

58
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:12,095
Change of career?
No more waking and/or baking?

59
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:14,998
I just want to hold your hand.

60
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:16,867
Me too.

61
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,457
I am done
with this by-proxy hand jive.

62
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,825
What's the matter?

63
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:37,186
You two are acting all lovey-dovey
when you ought to be squawking mad.

64
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:39,165
You screwed up when you used
his witchin' finger

65
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,477
to conjure up a corpse
and then not tell him.

66
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:44,115
You screwed up by not tapping her pops
when you had the chance

67
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,751
and I screwed up by cahooting
and colluding and covering up

68
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:50,533
and ended up having another dead body
in dear, old ghost dad's empty grave.

69
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,083
And both of you ladies ought to be mad
as hell at dear, old dead dad

70
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,419
for stealing your car
and stealing off into the night

71
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:57,749
with a corpse face that ain't gonna do
no favors for nobody.

72
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:59,720
Now that you mention it, I am mad.

73
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,294
- I'm furious.
- Get over it, fool.

74
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,159
Bitchin' and whinin' time has gotten
the boot. We need to fix this.

75
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:05,909
Fix what, chitchatters?
What you fixing?

76
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,599
Fixin' to tell you to mind yours.

77
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:09,636
You working a case?
Well, break it down.

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,636
Are there dead bodies?
Murder? Missing persons?

79
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,641
- Who are the players? Lay it on me.
- It's one of them need-to-know cases.

80
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:17,352
And you do not need,
therefore you shall not know.

81
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,314
No casual case chitchat to pass the time
whilst perusing the menu?

82
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,149
We don't chitchat where we eat.

83
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,559
But I'm your itty-bitty.
I'm helpful.

84
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,987
Strawberry-kiwi crumble <i>à la mode</i>.

85
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,320
Golden cherry crimson pear,
also <i>à la mode</i>.

86
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,783
Just coffee for me, thanks.

87
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,372
- Hold up, yo.
- Oh, boy.

88
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,194
I'm not some yo-yo
you can jerk up and down

89
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:41,843
on a "today let's include her,
tomorrow let's not" whim.

90
00:04:41,873 --> 00:04:42,948
'cause if I am,

91
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:46,981
there are only so many knots I can tie
in my yo-yo string before it snaps...

92
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:48,675
- for good.
- Please, Olive.

93
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:51,094
"Please, Olive", my ass.
Where's my pie?

94
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,301
You know what? I hate this.
Olive is my friend.

95
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:58,918
We can't make her our depository
of secrets one minute, and then...

96
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,392
not include her the next.

97
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:02,887
- Why can't we just tell her everything?
- Oh, look at that.

98
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,967
A dumb idea just found a friend.

99
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,310
Think again. We ain't gonna
poke a stick in our business

100
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,040
and then snap it off by telling
little big mouth all our problems.

101
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,757
Maybe little big mouth
has earned it.

102
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:15,576
All she does is trust us
and help us and all we do is lie to her.

103
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:17,099
We can't afford to tell her.

104
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,831
With everything that's happening,
we don't need another variable.

105
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,388
<i>Little did they know,</i>

106
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:27,575
<i>another unfortunate variable
was already on its way</i>

107
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:29,218
<i>in the form of one half</i>

108
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:33,139
<i>of a renowned synchronized-swimming duo
and sister neurotics,</i>

109
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,470
<i>who was called...</i>

110
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:36,007
Miss Vivian!

111
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:38,558
Well, to what do I owe the pleasure?

112
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,934
I need you to find someone for me...

113
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:43,938
Dwight Dixon, my gentleman caller.

114
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:48,241
He hasn't come calling
since our last <i>rendez-vous</i> went awry.

115
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:50,523
Something horrible has happened!

116
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:51,445
<i>The facts,</i>

117
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:54,745
<i>as Emerson Cod knew them
and Vivian did not, were these...</i>

118
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:58,495
<i>Dwight Dixon romanced Vivian
to get what he wanted,</i>

119
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,872
<i>and what he wanted was a watch.</i>

120
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,042
I have a small confession
about Charles' pocket watch.

121
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:07,170
We buried it with our niece,
lonely tourist Charlotte Charles.

122
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:09,250
<i>Dwight dug up her niece's grave,</i>

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,300
<i>but found the watch missing
and Chuck still alive.</i>

124
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,589
Very nice to meet you.

125
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,720
<i>So Dwight Dixon stole
the watch from Chuck</i>

126
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,528
<i>and Lily stole the watch
from Dwight,</i>

127
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:22,602
<i>but she didn't stop with one watch,
she stole Dwight's watch, too.</i>

128
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,005
<i>Believing Chuck and the pie maker
to be the thieves,</i>

129
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:29,032
<i>Dwight Dixon set about
to kill them both,</i>

130
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:30,692
<i>but Dwight failed to realize</i>

131
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:34,704
<i>his murderous plan made him
the target of a cosmic exchange</i>

132
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:37,683
<i>that allowed Chuck
to keep her father alive,</i>

133
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,636
<i>while taking
Dwight's life in trade...</i>

134
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:43,471
<i>An accidental, inadvertent death</i>

135
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:47,169
<i>that Emerson Cod hid
in order to protect his friends.</i>

136
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,352
<i>And so Dwight Dixon,
villain and thief,</i>

137
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:52,058
<i>was buried in the grave</i>

138
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:54,777
<i>once occupied by Charles Charles.</i>

139
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,455
What makes you think something
happened to Dwight Dixon?

140
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,642
Because he cared about me.
He wouldn't leave without explanation.

141
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:04,936
Even worse, he could be dead.

142
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:07,601
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

143
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:09,898
Let's just start with the facts.

144
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:13,194
You say he was your gentleman caller.
How many times he call on you?

145
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,070
Three.

146
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:16,036
He call you his girlfriend?

147
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,956
Give you a sock drawer?

148
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:19,559
- Offer you bling?
- No!

149
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,339
Well, did you two have...

150
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:22,829
intimate relations?

151
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:23,843
Very.

152
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,434
Long walks, clarinet concer...

153
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:29,001
I meant in the biblical sense.

154
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,322
Well, then allow me
to put this to you delicately.

155
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,697
You see, men are dogs.

156
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,948
They come, you know,
sniffin' around, barking up your tree,

157
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:40,263
but if they don't see a kitty cat up in
that tree, soon they just stop barking.

158
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,575
Dwight ain't missing.

159
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:43,765
He's barking up
somebody else's tree.

160
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,690
Dwight wouldn't do that.
He's a romantic...

161
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,560
a romantic who may need help.

162
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,774
I'm advising you
to not look for Dwight Dixon.

163
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:55,278
Then find him for me
so I don't have to.

164
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:58,700
Now, you listen to me. You have no idea
what kind of man Dwight Dixon is.

165
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,728
He's a bad man, a sociopath, a man
who'd stab a friend in the neck

166
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:04,120
or shoot 'em in the back with
a long-range, high-powered rifle.

167
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:05,696
Dwight Dixon's gone away.

168
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:08,166
Now, you just accept that
and stop trying to bring him back.

169
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,720
Thank you...

170
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,314
for your time.

171
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:15,874
<i>Emerson Cod hated dropping the bomb
on Vivian Charles' heart,</i>

172
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,941
<i>but a shock-and-awe campaign
was the only way</i>

173
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,921
<i>to stop her search for Dwight.</i>

174
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:26,278
Slice me up something fresh and
expensive and it better be on the house,

175
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:29,300
'cause I just saved both of your asses
a whole pile of grief.

176
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,440
- Why, what happened?
- Your aunt Vivian came to visit me.

177
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,902
She tried to hire me to find
her missing paramour, Dwight Dixon.

178
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:39,233
- What did you tell her?
- Oh, I said, "no need to pay me".

179
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:42,611
"I know damn well where Dwight Dixon is.
Buried in the ground where I put him."

180
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,687
- What you think I said? I said no.
- Poor Vivian.

181
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:47,008
She's carrying a torch
for a flame I extinguished.

182
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:48,510
- With my finger.
- Don't worry.

183
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,946
I gave her plenty of reasons
to forget all about him.

184
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:52,150
The last thing we need

185
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,087
is somebody investigating
the disappearance of Dwight Dixon.

186
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,292
Good day, Emerson Cod.

187
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:00,577
Hide.

188
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,080
Hello, Magnus.

189
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:10,520
We've been consigned to investigate
the disappearance of Dwight Dixon.

190
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,132
Hello, Magnus.

191
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:19,414
If it isn't Papen County's most
surprisingly successful detective.

192
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:22,889
And his pie-baking,
pretty-boy sidekick.

193
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,151
As flattering as that is,
you're not welcome here.

194
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:27,831
You either, Hedda.
Stay out of my kitchen.

195
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,865
I'm still mad, so ignore my caring tone,
but why are we hiding?

196
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:38,813
<i>Chuck was hiding to avoid
a crack forensic team from discovering</i>

197
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:43,307
<i>she was infamous murder victim
lonely tourist Charlotte Charles.</i>

198
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:47,836
<i>As proud members of the Norwegian
ministry of justice and police,</i>

199
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,496
<i>lead detective Magnus Olsdatter,</i>

200
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,541
<i>his trusted criminalist,
Nils Nilsen,</i>

201
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:56,924
<i>and loyal profiler
Hedda Lillihammer,</i>

202
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:00,889
<i>were an investigative trio
without equal</i>

203
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,354
<i>until their beloved homeland,</i>

204
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:07,159
<i>ranked an astonishing 37th
in the world of homicides,</i>

205
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:10,259
<i>no longer deemed
their services necessary.</i>

206
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:12,992
<i>They abandoned their motherland</i>

207
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:16,091
<i>when reports of a small place
with a big murder rate</i>

208
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:18,957
<i>halfway around the world
caught their eye.</i>

209
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:22,435
<i>Positive their forensic know-how
and advanced skill set</i>

210
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:26,198
<i>would make them a big fish
in a small but lucrative pond,</i>

211
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:29,771
<i>only to find themselves
consistently trumped</i>

212
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,887
<i>by a large fish of another kind
by the name of Cod...</i>

213
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:35,932
<i>Emerson Cod.</i>

214
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,967
Today our services were commissioned
by Vivian Charles

215
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:41,027
to locate a man
by the name of Dwight Dixon.

216
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:44,345
Imagine our surprise when,
during our debriefing of our client,

217
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,767
we began to suspect
that you knew something

218
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:49,035
about his disappearance
that you were not telling!

219
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,265
Tell us now
and save yourself the humiliation.

220
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:53,664
I don't know diddly

221
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:55,333
or squat.

222
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:57,960
Unfortunately for you,
the facts say the opposite.

223
00:10:58,312 --> 00:11:00,671
Nils, refresh Mr. Cod's memory.

224
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,756
Fact 1:

225
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:04,258
Vivian Charles claims
you refused her case.

226
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,963
History shows Emerson Cod
never turns down easy money.

227
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:11,307
History shows I had a full docket,
just like my pocketbook.

228
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:12,798
It was nothing personal.

229
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:13,628
Fact 2:

230
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:16,756
When discussing Dwight Dixon with
Ms. Charles, you referred to him as a...

231
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,398
"Bad man, a sociopath,"

232
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:21,672
"the kind of man who'd stab a friend
or shoot him in the back."

233
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:24,291
I was merely trying to talk her
out of a bad relationship.

234
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,947
I didn't even know the man.
It's pure conjecture.

235
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:27,967
Fact 3:

236
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:29,200
it wasn't conjecture.

237
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,619
You and Dwight hobnobbed
in the same circles!

238
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,222
The hell I did.

239
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,830
We didn't nob no hobs.

240
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,624
And certainly not in no damn circle.

241
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:38,876
We have copies of
Dixon's credit-card statements.

242
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:41,212
He was a frequent eater
at this very eatery.

243
00:11:41,598 --> 00:11:44,577
Therefore,
establishing a reasonable link?

244
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:47,857
Not reasonable.
Unreasonable and purely circumstantial.

245
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,192
- And a little rude.
- Not for all.

246
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:52,700
For I believe we will soon prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt

247
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,892
that you're hiding something
of importance to this case.

248
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:56,102
How you plan to do?

249
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,490
With help from our Mother,
the most sophisticated

250
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,648
mobile investigative
laboratory facility of its kind,

251
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,916
providing instantaneous
evidence collection,

252
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:05,943
inspection and documentation.

253
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,114
If there's a shred of evidence
connecting you to Dixon's disappearance,

254
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,375
Mother will find it.

255
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,646
Run on home to your Mother
because you're not welcome here.

256
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:13,916
This is my <i>Pie Hole</i>.

257
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,787
No clues, no dirt, no service.
Now go!

258
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:19,067
You'll find us
at the <i>Come and Sleep hotel</i>!

259
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,547
Big Mother is watching.
Any last words?

260
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:23,685
Thank you.

261
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:29,885
What just happened?

262
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:31,220
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

263
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:35,015
We are in a crisis, people.

264
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:37,637
We need to shut down
these Norwegians <i>pronto-mundo</i>.

265
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,892
Also <i>pronto-mundo</i>,
we need to find my dad.

266
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,787
Put daddy dead bucks on hold.

267
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:43,923
We need to cut these Norse fools
off at the source.

268
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:46,534
But what if these Norse fools
find Chuck's dad?

269
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,866
Or worse, he finds them
and tells them what happened.

270
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,542
And then there's
the waking and baking.

271
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:54,027
If he wants me to stay out of
Chuck's life, that's one way to do it.

272
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:56,973
Okay, fine,
you look for daddy dead bucks.

273
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:59,308
But I still need somebody
to take a second crack at Vivian

274
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:02,959
to call off the hounds while I find out
what these Norwegians dig up.

275
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:09,322
Oh, itty-bitty.

276
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:12,286
I'm itty-bitty again?

277
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:14,345
You mean it?

278
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,049
All I can tell you

279
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,522
is if you don't convince Vivian
to call off her investigation

280
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:28,486
into Dwight's disappearance,
we are gonna be in a lot of trouble.

281
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:31,757
What did you do, kill Dwight?

282
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:34,172
I'm just kidding.

283
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,451
- You didn't, did you?
- No, but...

284
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:37,463
But what?

285
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:40,954
- I still can't tell you what happened.
- Oh, hells bells!

286
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:42,848
The least you could is lie.

287
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:45,258
What hurts the most
is the total lack of effort.

288
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:47,479
None of you even seem
to care or mind the fact

289
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:49,882
that you won't let me in
on your super-secret pow-wows.

290
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,968
I promise you, it is not out of spite.
We're just trying to protect you.

291
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,032
But I don't need protection.

292
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:57,681
That's what I have several
long-standing restraining orders for.

293
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:00,328
I need to feel like I belong.

294
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:03,047
I need to feel appreciated, Chuck.

295
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:08,567
I want a full-fledged membership and
an all-access pass to the PI palooza.

296
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:10,402
So you'll do it?

297
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:11,748
Yes.

298
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:16,455
- Thank you, thank you.
- You're welcome. You're welcome.

299
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:22,783
I will not call them off,
not until they find Dwight.

300
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:25,084
Are you still mooning
over that creep?

301
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:26,576
Moons wax and wane.

302
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:29,713
I am steadfast in my investigation
of Dwight's disappearance.

303
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:31,659
I don't know if Vivian's told you,

304
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,165
but she's hired a team
of Norwegian PIs to find him.

305
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:37,227
Right now, they're running a couple
of those bright-blue body-fluid lights

306
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,515
all over his motel room,
looking for evidence of foul play.

307
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,430
There's been foul play?

308
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,605
Says... says who?

309
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:44,937
And who are these Norwegians?

310
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,599
They came highly recommended.

311
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:50,359
In their home country, they're the most
decorated figures since Thor Bjorklund,

312
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:52,695
inventor of the hand-held
cheese slicer.

313
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:56,484
<i>Lily's sudden spike
in body temperature stemmed,</i>

314
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:58,742
<i>not from hearing
Thor Bjorklund's name,</i>

315
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,007
<i>but from the fear that if Dwight Dixon
was the victim of foul play,</i>

316
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:04,911
<i>amongst his possessions,</i>

317
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:09,331
<i>the Norwegians would discover
a trail of evidence leading them to...</i>

318
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:10,963
<i>Lily herself.</i>

319
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,895
Call off the Norwegians.

320
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,968
- Let well enough alone.
- Not until I find out what happened.

321
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:17,595
Nothing happened to Dwight!

322
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,081
You don't know that.

323
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:21,253
What I do know
is Dwight was menacing.

324
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:23,553
He even snuck in to the <i>Pie Hole</i>
once after hours

325
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,394
and menaced me right to my face.

326
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:27,735
See? It's a good thing he's gone.

327
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,316
Why on earth would he menace you?

328
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,527
It's on a need-to-know basis.

329
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:35,133
Well, then, I need to know.

330
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:39,296
I'm tired of being a pushover.
I deserve the truth,

331
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,702
and I don't need anyone
to protect me from it.

332
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,883
Yes, you do.

333
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,051
Why?

334
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:47,782
I can't tell you.

335
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:50,335
This gives me pause.

336
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,338
A manicure might help.

337
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:56,409
No, pause, like one step past "play"
and not quite to "stop".

338
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,676
Because...

339
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,230
I've been hearing this conversation
on repeat all day,

340
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,139
and I'm finally hearing the music.

341
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,224
And I've heard enough to know
when people say,

342
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,183
"I can't tell you.
It's for your own good",

343
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:08,724
what they really mean is "I won't
tell you 'cause I don't trust you".

344
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:12,027
Because they don't think that you're
responsible enough to handle the truth.

345
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,957
So they have these private chitchats
in corners and in booths.

346
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:18,582
And when you shimmy on over to just say
a simple, "top o' the mornin' to ya"!

347
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:21,411
They clam up and avoid you
like you got the Ebola.

348
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:25,747
Aren't you tired of feeling like you
have to live your life from the outside?

349
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,403
You deserve to have those answers.

350
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:32,598
And if you want to enlist a crack team
of PIs from the land of Norwegia,

351
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:36,713
you go, girl! Because maybe then,
you'll finally get the respect,

352
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:39,718
trust, and honesty you deserve
from your "so-called" best friends.

353
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,392
<i>As Olive Snook broke ranks with Lily
and came to the defense of Vivian,</i>

354
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,840
<i>she began to wonder if there were
other alliances in her life</i>

355
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,591
<i>she should be breaking.</i>

356
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,274
<i>Emerson Cod hoped that any evidence</i>

357
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,773
<i>the Norwegians gathered
from Dwight Dixon's motel room</i>

358
00:16:57,803 --> 00:16:59,969
<i>was of no significance at all.</i>

359
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,334
That's Lily's handwriting.

360
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:24,695
- Hello, Lily.
- Vivian.

361
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:29,285
Lily, I'm afraid
this is going to be a confrontation.

362
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:31,655
Is it, now?

363
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,939
Would you like to tell me

364
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:37,443
what happened at the cemetery
between you and Dwight?

365
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:42,405
Nothing happened at the cemetery
between me and Dwight.

366
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,291
He stood me up,

367
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,979
- just like he did you.
- I wasn't stood up.

368
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:49,537
You ran him off with both barrels
cocked at his manhood.

369
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:52,791
Then invited and/or lured him
to the cemetery for Heaven knows why.

370
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,741
I won't call you a liar.
If you say he didn't show, then...

371
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,703
I believe you.

372
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,921
He didn't show.

373
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,757
I don't believe you.

374
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:02,806
I can't protect you from the Norwegians
if you don't tell me the truth.

375
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:04,265
Protect me? What...

376
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:05,929
What is it you think I did?

377
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:07,587
Something rash.

378
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,692
Honestly, and this is a petty
accusation, therefore I'm not proud...

379
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:15,564
but I don't think you like
that he made me happy.

380
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:17,827
Dwight Dixon is trouble.

381
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:20,649
Dwight Dixon lavished me
with courtly blandishments

382
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,030
and picnics complete
with <i>crudités</i> and soup.

383
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:27,332
There may have been involvement
with a criminal element in his past,

384
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:29,203
but that's behind him now.

385
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:32,491
It ain't behind him. It's right
on top of him, if not inside him.

386
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:37,102
His motel room had enough buckshot
to blow Coeur d'Coeurs to Timbuktu!

387
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,296
What were you doing
in his motel room?

388
00:18:41,781 --> 00:18:43,131
Looking for this.

389
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,500
Charles' pocket watch.

390
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:50,551
Your kind Dwight
stole it from Charlotte's grave

391
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,802
right after you told him
where it was.

392
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,982
He didn't... He couldn't... He...

393
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:57,503
He dug her up?

394
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:00,069
He dug her up and took it from her.

395
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,297
So I took it back
and took his watch, too.

396
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:07,082
You want to know what was gonna happen
between me and Dwight

397
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,950
at the cemetery if he showed?

398
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,448
Me and both barrels
were gonna convince him

399
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:13,919
to dig Charlotte's grave
right up again

400
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:17,334
and put that watch back
exactly where he found it.

401
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,686
And your intentions after that?

402
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,714
That was gonna be up to Dwight.

403
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:29,596
Congratulations, Lily.

404
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,015
I know how you like being right.

405
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:34,125
I didn't want to be right...

406
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:36,751
I knew I was gonna be,
but I didn't want to be.

407
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,774
I don't get any satisfaction
from seeing you hurt.

408
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,585
Now, I really don't believe you.

409
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:51,531
<i>As the cold snap between
the aunts grew colder,</i>

410
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:54,329
<i>the pie maker and Chuck
were investigating</i>

411
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:57,998
<i>the equally serious matter
of the missing Charles Charles.</i>

412
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,377
Bringing back the dead
is always complicated.

413
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:04,633
Sometimes you have to focus
on the tree instead of the forest.

414
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:07,301
You have to find that one thing

415
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:09,056
and that tiny glimmer of hope

416
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:10,636
and just hold onto it.

417
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,390
Wait.

418
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,875
What's that?
It's another button,

419
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,189
a big brass button.

420
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,027
It's placed conspicuously
on the windowsill.

421
00:20:20,057 --> 00:20:22,073
It might have popped off
my dad's sweater 21 years,

422
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:25,736
2 months, and 24 days ago...
The day he moved out and abandoned me.

423
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:28,326
Or maybe it's a sign from my dad.

424
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:31,845
He'd always give me a button to hold
onto on long journeys to summer camp,

425
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,716
or he'd sneak one in my pocket on
the first day of school to let me know

426
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:38,457
that he was there and he was watching me
and that everything would be okay.

427
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:39,558
Chuck, it's...

428
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,665
Maybe the reason that I can't believe
that he just...

429
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:45,528
left is because he didn't.

430
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:48,258
Maybe he's keeping a safe distance.

431
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,669
Is that realistic?

432
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,586
My life has been so...

433
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:54,622
unreal. I don't know
what realistic is. I died...

434
00:20:55,381 --> 00:20:57,880
and then I was alive again.
And so was my dad, and it's something

435
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,949
that we both share that nobody else can,
which is why I know.

436
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:02,817
Ned, I know,

437
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,805
and I feel it deep, deep down inside
of me that he wouldn't abandon me.

438
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:06,873
He's here.

439
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:08,235
He's here somewhere.

440
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:13,305
You can't hang all that on a button.

441
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:14,814
Yes, I can.

442
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,609
I'm his button-button.

443
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:19,368
<i>While Chuck hoped the old</i>

444
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:23,596
<i> brass button was significant evidence
of her father's comforting presence,</i>

445
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:25,964
<i>131 miles due north,</i>

446
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:29,052
<i>the Norwegians continued
their investigation.</i>

447
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:32,960
<i>All the while, keeping
a watchful eye on Emerson Cod,</i>

448
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,894
<i>who they believed knew more
than he was willing to say.</i>

449
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,456
<i>Meanwhile, Emerson Cod was
once again keeping his eye on them,</i>

450
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:42,838
<i>in the hope
that the forensic bread crumbs</i>

451
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,275
<i>from Dwight's motel room would not lead
the Norwegians back his way.</i>

452
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,577
<i>Using the gumshoe skills
that made him great,</i>

453
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:55,784
<i>the number-one detective in Papen County
took the fight to his opponent.</i>

454
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:59,329
<i>His plan was this: first...</i>

455
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,873
<i>assess
the true nature of the threat.</i>

456
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:06,378
<i>Two, find and exploit
their weaknesses,</i>

457
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,500
<i>- and three...</i>
- Shut your mouth.

458
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:12,134
I can't believe you guys think my former
friends are up to no good, too.

459
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,063
<i>Oh, hell no.</i>

460
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,015
Damn you, you itty-bitty traitor.

461
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:19,547
I don't have enough fingers

462
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,643
to count the secrets
that they flaunt in my face.

463
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:25,397
And that Dwight Dixon, he did
hang around the <i>Pie Hole</i>... a lot.

464
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:26,686
Until he didn't.

465
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,303
And then you guys show up,

466
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,694
and they're jumpier than a bunch
of kangaroos on a pogo stick.

467
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:34,003
So, I come bearing gifts.

468
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:36,344
The pie maker's saliva...

469
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:38,628
'cause they have things
in their mouth and in their hands

470
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,490
that they do not want spread around.

471
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,319
The kinds of things that
would lead them to kill a man, perhaps?

472
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:45,501
Well, that's why I'm here.
You tell me.

473
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:48,219
There's plenty of somethin'- somethin'
going on with those dirty birds,

474
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:51,347
and since you're all about
getting answers, and so am I,

475
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:53,720
I figured it was about time
I joined the A-team.

476
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,809
Which is why we were excited
to receive your...

477
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,954
inquiry about
joining our organization.

478
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:02,476
The DNA analysis that
I performed on your hair

479
00:23:02,537 --> 00:23:05,312
told us everything
we needed to know.

480
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:09,108
I was under the impression
that penicillin would clear that up.

481
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,444
No, what he means is that
you're of good,

482
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:15,238
strong, shapely Norwegian stock.

483
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,282
- <i>Skal</i>!
- <i>Skal</i>!

484
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:18,250
<i>Skal</i>.

485
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,362
Thank you. Thank you!

486
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:25,313
You too.

487
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:28,377
Which goes without saying since you're
so obviously from the land of Norwegia.

488
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:30,513
And, as it turns out, so am I, so

489
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:34,257
it makes it swell to be home,
don't ya know.

490
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:38,053
I must say, you guys have
seriously pimped this ride.

491
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:40,128
This is fancier
than Liberace's camper!

492
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:42,725
Mother is the heart
and soul of what we do.

493
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,216
- Without her, we'd be just another...
- Emerson "Clod"?

494
00:23:49,282 --> 00:23:51,191
So, what do you think
happened to Dwight Dixon?

495
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:52,689
He appears to have vanished.

496
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:55,529
And how he vanished probably
wasn't pretty like you.

497
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:58,926
He had enough weapons in his room
to arm the Norwegian militia.

498
00:23:58,956 --> 00:24:01,791
All evidence points
to a dangerous man

499
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,219
with a destructive agenda
who most likely met with a violent end.

500
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,289
All in all, a bad man.

501
00:24:10,376 --> 00:24:11,552
Can you handle more?

502
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:13,795
It's getting hotter from here.

503
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,924
We also find a shovel
under Dwight's bed.

504
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,926
The mineral content of
the caked-on dirt

505
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:20,737
matches that of
the local cemetery exactly.

506
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:24,485
More importantly, what Dwight Dixon
was doing by Charles Charles'

507
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:28,008
and Charlotte Charles' graves with
the shovel, we can only speculate.

508
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,502
For now.

509
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:32,488
An exhumation order.

510
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:35,819
You don't mean...
you're gonna dig 'em up?

511
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,820
Ja.

512
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:37,982
Ja.

513
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,309
Ja.

514
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:40,327
No.

515
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:43,119
- Olive's a Norwegian.
- Maybe it's Stockholm syndrome.

516
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,526
They've lured her in,
and she doesn't know what she's doing.

517
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:48,532
Chitty-chatty-boo-hoo
knew exactly what she was doing.

518
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:51,084
She was sufficiently lubed
and ready to spit tacks.

519
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:53,848
She even gave them your saliva swab
to get into their clubhouse.

520
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:55,467
What would they want with my saliva?

521
00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:56,581
It's my fault.

522
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:59,399
She warned us not to push her,
and then I pushed her away,

523
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:03,206
and I pushed her to talk to Vivian,
and that pushed her to switch teams.

524
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,750
You're not that pushy, and you're not
to blame. Olive betrayed us

525
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,786
because we can't let her in
and we can't because of my magic finger.

526
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:11,672
Somehow or other, it always
comes back to my magic finger.

527
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,754
Maybe so, but in about five minutes,

528
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:17,119
the Norwegians are gonna have
the coffins of dead girl

529
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,710
and her pops exhumed.

530
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,915
And when they open them up,
they're gonna find hers empty

531
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:22,722
and Dwight's dead ass
in the other one

532
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:25,410
and enough forensic evidence
to lead them right back here to us.

533
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,149
<i>Stunned by what they heard,</i>

534
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,914
<i>the pie maker and the girl named
Chuck prepared for the worst.</i>

535
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:33,459
<i>While in a graveyard
in Coeur d'Coeurs,</i>

536
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:37,561
<i> the Norwegians found themselves
unprepared for the shocking discovery</i>

537
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:41,147
<i> that Emerson Cod's prediction
was only half right.</i>

538
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:44,012
<i>Both coffins were empty.</i>

539
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,496
Empty? Why are they empty?

540
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:50,560
I understand why one of them is empty.
Why is the other one empty? You're sure?

541
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,148
I made friendly with the ground's keeper
by way of a few benjamins.

542
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,456
The Norwegians popped
the tops on them coffins,

543
00:25:56,486 --> 00:25:59,466
saw they were nobody, loaded 'em
up in the mama-mobile and took off.

544
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:01,176
But how could
my dad's coffin be empty?

545
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:02,891
It's supposed to be full of Dixon.

546
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,366
Oh, god. We buried him alive.

547
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:08,161
Should I feel worse about you
burying him alive or him getting out?

548
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:09,841
Ain't nobody buried alive.

549
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,123
Dwight Dixon
is deader than a doornail.

550
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,790
Somebody moved the body.

551
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,585
Who else knew he was in that coffin?

552
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,748
My dad. Who else could it be?

553
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,173
"Button-Button". Don't you see?
He moved the body to protect us.

554
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:21,609
What a good dad.

555
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:25,407
You don't suppose he wiped down both the
caskets with industrial bleach, do you?

556
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:28,771
'cause that's the only way there isn't
gonna be some trace of some forensic

557
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:32,435
tiddly-bit that's gonna lead everybody
back to every somebody at this table.

558
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:35,479
They're gonna find my DNA, aren't they?
I should have worn a hairnet.

559
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:38,254
You can say that your DNA got
there at my dad's funeral, but, Emerson,

560
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:39,818
your DNA is all over the grave.

561
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:42,720
And with no real reason for it
to be there, you're gonna look guilty.

562
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,822
I am guilty. It wasn't my hand

563
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:47,409
that touched Charles Charles
and put Dwight Dixon in the grave.

564
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:49,425
And it definitely wasn't my hand

565
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:52,122
that forced the magic finger
to wake dear dead dad.

566
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,144
But none of your hands would be dirty
if it wasn't for me.

567
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:59,635
Hell, you were just a pie maker,
and she was grass fertilizer.

568
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:02,286
I brought you
into my PI organization.

569
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,629
It was my job to keep you in line,
and I didn't.

570
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:08,471
So if anybody deserves to face
the Norwegian firing squad...

571
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:09,556
It's me.

572
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:13,608
Don't put on your blindfold or smoke
your last stogie yet. I got a plan.

573
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:16,855
You're gonna tell the Norwegians
everything you know.

574
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:20,024
- Let me tell you everything I know.
- There's nothing you can tell us

575
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,819
that Mother can't once
she finishes her analysis.

576
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,510
Although we don't wish to look
a gift whore in the mouth, Mr. Cod,

577
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,074
why would you tell us
everything you know?

578
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,731
Well,
confession is good for the soul.

579
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:35,539
When you look at a case
through a lens of a microscope,

580
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:38,211
you tend to really miss on
what matters.

581
00:27:39,462 --> 00:27:40,879
It's the people, people...

582
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,173
people you work with,
clients you work for.

583
00:27:43,234 --> 00:27:44,674
Clients like Vivian Charles?

584
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:47,316
You certainly didn't
people-people-person her.

585
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:48,220
True.

586
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:50,301
When you make a mess,

587
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:51,521
clean it up!

588
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:53,850
It's your responsibility.

589
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,188
Detective work is a lot like money.

590
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:58,386
It don't really come
with instructions.

591
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:01,046
I learned that from
the greatest detective in the world.

592
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:03,568
Of course, I'm talking about Shaft.
You can dig it.

593
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:07,879
<i>Meanwhile, as Emerson Cod
served as decoy, on the street,</i>

594
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:11,785
<i>the pie maker and Chuck prepared
to enter Mother's empty nest.</i>

595
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,901
I love "I have a plan" Ned.
Who says spontaneous is sexy?

596
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:17,510
"Sexy" is a man with a to-do list,
some schematics,

597
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,623
and the right tools to hot-wire
a Norwegian RV.

598
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,130
- Shall we?
- We shan't. At least, you shan't.

599
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,992
I shall steal Mother alone,
and you shall stay here as a lookout.

600
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:29,855
I shan't do any such thing.

601
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:31,930
We're in this jam
because I brought my dad back.

602
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,913
I don't blame you
for bringing him back.

603
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:36,683
I couldn't stop myself from bringing
back the person I loved either.

604
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:41,290
And Emerson never forced me
or my finger to join his PI team.

605
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:44,442
I poked of my own free will.

606
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,612
And so if there's anyone to blame,
it's me.

607
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:49,015
My finger...

608
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:51,268
my fallout.

609
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:53,576
I'm driving solo this time.

610
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:11,462
- You!
- You! This isn't what it looks like.

611
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:13,689
You're not trying to hot-wire Mother
so you can drive away

612
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,226
with the evidence they have on you?

613
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:16,811
Okay. It is what it looks like.

614
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:18,893
I'm sorry we shut you out, Olive.

615
00:29:19,044 --> 00:29:21,380
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was shut you out of my life

616
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,993
and open you up to the Norwegians.

617
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:24,733
Is that
what you think this is all about?

618
00:29:24,793 --> 00:29:26,276
You gave them my swab!

619
00:29:26,337 --> 00:29:28,820
- Pig spit.
- Don't deny it. Emerson saw you.

620
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,217
No, dummy... pig spit.

621
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:32,121
The swab I gave them
came from Pigby, not you.

622
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:34,480
- So, you're not a turncoat?
- A reversible jacket.

623
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,980
I wouldn't turncoat on you.

624
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,266
I was working deep cover to dismantle
this operation from the inside out.

625
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:40,817
I know they have dirt on you, but

626
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:43,185
I don't know what they did
to make you look so dirty.

627
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,502
I got myself dirty.

628
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,796
Well, allow me to soap up
those hard-to-reach places.

629
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:48,853
By helping me destroy the evidence?

630
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:51,217
- A simple "thank you" would suffice.
- Oh, thank you.

631
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:53,900
This itty-bitty's always on your side,
no questions asked.

632
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,597
- What if I guessed?
- Olive!

633
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:58,475
Are we talking about Dwight
and those empty coffins?

634
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:00,294
I'm not supposed to tell you.

635
00:30:00,324 --> 00:30:02,824
Can you answer "yes" or "no"
if I ask the right questions?

636
00:30:02,854 --> 00:30:04,768
Can you ask the questions
while we steal the RV?

637
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:07,275
That's a yes-or-no question,
and the answer is yes.

638
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:09,688
Go, go, go!

639
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,530
Poor, heartbroken Vivian Charles.

640
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:14,254
Well, I admit I was insensitive

641
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:17,494
about the sensitivities of Ms. Vivian
and her missing Mr. Goodbar.

642
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,580
But I intend to right
that wrong coming right up.

643
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,081
Would this be your confession?

644
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:24,209
There ain't gonna be any confession.

645
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:27,447
We don't need your confession
to solve this case...

646
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,676
Not when we have Mother.

647
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:32,675
Where's Mother going?

648
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:38,929
Looks like you about
to become orphans.

649
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:41,832
Stop!

650
00:30:42,147 --> 00:30:43,046
Stop!

651
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:44,464
- Stop!
- Stop!

652
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:45,999
- Mother!
- Mother!

653
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:47,878
- Mother.
- Stop.

654
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:49,488
Mother.

655
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:52,911
Do you know why
Charles Charles' grave is empty?

656
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:54,364
- Yes.
- Was his grave robbed?

657
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:56,440
- No one took the body?
- No.

658
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,372
Then what'd he do,
just get up and walk away?

659
00:30:58,402 --> 00:30:59,202
Yes.

660
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:02,015
- Chuck's father's alive?
- Yes. Hold on.

661
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:08,375
When Chuck faked her death
and her father faked his death,

662
00:31:08,405 --> 00:31:10,053
- was Dwight onto them?
- Yes.

663
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,091
Okay. Then he disappeared. You have
anything to do with his disappearance?

664
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,425
I didn't mean to but I did.

665
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:16,861
And when you inadvertently,
unintentionally and without malice

666
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:20,306
or forethought disappeared Dwight, did
you disappear him in a permanent sense?

667
00:31:20,392 --> 00:31:22,016
- I don't understand.
- You kill him?

668
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:23,837
- Dead end!
- Is that an admission?

669
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,083
No. Dead end!

670
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:43,507
Thank God for my naturally
clingy nature.

671
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:47,618
Olive,
I'm sorry I got you into this.

672
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:50,611
I'm sorry you felt you had
to prove yourself. I'm sorry about...

673
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:53,228
- so many things.
- I'm not.

674
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:54,882
Well, maybe one thing.

675
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:58,950
I'm sorry you never looked at me
the same way you look at Chuck.

676
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,221
I wouldn't say never.

677
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,482
<i>Of all the secrets untold,</i>

678
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:06,144
<i> this was the one Olive Snook
wanted to hear most.</i>

679
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:13,151
Hold on, Ned.

680
00:32:14,118 --> 00:32:15,535
Hold on.
I got you.

681
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:17,691
If you've got me, who's got you?

682
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:21,762
<i>The mysterious masked man
who rescued the pie maker and Olive</i>

683
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,549
<i>would remain
a mysterious loose string.</i>

684
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,206
<i>Regretting
his previous bad behavior,</i>

685
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:30,835
<i>Emerson Cod sought to tie up
another loose string.</i>

686
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,964
I'm here against my better judgment,
considering the callous braggadocio

687
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:39,302
with which you previously
gave me the... heave-ho.

688
00:32:39,362 --> 00:32:42,718
Well, if I did do any ho-heaving,
it was for your own good.

689
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:47,185
There's a time for callous braggadocio
and a time for sensitivity.

690
00:32:47,246 --> 00:32:49,520
To the Norwegians,
that time is never.

691
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,940
I suppose it's a holdover
from their viking ancestry.

692
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,444
It would be difficult to rape and
pillage with the subtlety of a humanist.

693
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,946
Well,
that's why I called you up here.

694
00:32:59,522 --> 00:33:02,716
I didn't want the vikings to give you
the news that'll break your heart.

695
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,744
That sort of thing ought
to come from a friend.

696
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,397
When the Norwegians exhumed
the body of your niece and her father,

697
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:10,565
their coffins were empty.

698
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:11,527
What?

699
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:14,279
Our Charlotte?

700
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,422
Dwight... stole her?

701
00:33:16,482 --> 00:33:18,320
I wish there was something
I could say

702
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,096
to explain why or make you feel better,
but I do know this.

703
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,710
You can't steal someone's soul
by robbing their coffin.

704
00:33:27,655 --> 00:33:30,395
The Charlotte that you knew
wasn't in that box.

705
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,183
She's right here with you.

706
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:35,066
And although you can't see her
or talk to her anymore,

707
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,411
you have to believe that whatever
was taken from that grave,

708
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,864
that wasn't your niece.

709
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:44,281
Thank you... Mr. Cod.

710
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,573
It seems my... sister was right.

711
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:52,917
Dwight was indeed... a bad man.

712
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:55,877
Only now it appears he was more

713
00:33:56,543 --> 00:33:59,340
of a monster
than she or I ever knew.

714
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:02,002
Oh, my sweet, sweet Charlotte.

715
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:06,465
Knowing this will surely
shatter Lily's heart.

716
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:10,009
<i>As Vivian contemplated
the emotional damage yet to come,</i>

717
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,399
<i> in Olive's apartment,</i>

718
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:15,636
<i>a girl named Chuck tended
to the physical damage already done.</i>

719
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,941
He knew your name?

720
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,526
We think our masked man
was your pops.

721
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,265
I told Olive all about
your dad and how he...

722
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:25,616
faked his own death.

723
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:30,266
It must have been your father. Although,
I say that having never met him

724
00:34:30,296 --> 00:34:32,656
and not getting a good look at
who pulled us up from that cliff.

725
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:37,086
- He was covered from head to toe.
- He has a very delicate skin condition.

726
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:40,173
- Like your allergy to Ned!
- Yes! Exactly like that.

727
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:41,758
A hereditary link.

728
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:44,302
So our masked man is your father.

729
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:46,220
Yes, it certainly seems that way.

730
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:49,916
I'm sorry I thought you were being
unrealistic before.

731
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:52,545
My reality is that dads don't come back,
they move on.

732
00:34:52,575 --> 00:34:54,878
- But your dad didn't move on, he...
- hovered...

733
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:58,066
- like a guardian angel.
- What's he guarding you from?

734
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:03,863
Oh, Jiminy Jehosaphat!
I went out on a limb for you people...

735
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:08,430
A tree limb jutting from a cliff with
my limbs dangling over certain death!

736
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:12,162
So don't leave me dangling
with Dwight's disappearance unless...

737
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,584
He's permanently disappeared, aka...

738
00:35:17,035 --> 00:35:19,337
dead, aka murdered.

739
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:21,297
Olive, murder is a very big word.

740
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:23,633
- Did he die of natural causes?
- Yes.

741
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:27,720
Are either of you referring
to "murder" as a natural cause?

742
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:30,657
We are officially
non-referential starting now.

743
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,725
What's stopping now
are the questions.

744
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,228
So that's how it is.
You want to roll army style...

745
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,003
"don't ask, don't tell."

746
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,656
Guess what works in the foxhole
works in the <i>Pie Hole</i>.

747
00:35:42,686 --> 00:35:44,987
<i>Unfortunately for Olive Snook,</i>

748
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:49,033
<i>what worked in the</i> Pie Hole
<i>did not work for the Norwegians,</i>

749
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:52,328
<i>who adhered to a strict
"do ask, do tell" policy.</i>

750
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,915
I see you're back to playing
for the other team.

751
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:58,460
Hello, Hedda.
You're looking lovely tonight.

752
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,212
You killed our Mother!

753
00:36:05,985 --> 00:36:07,677
I am the victim here.

754
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:10,179
I was Mother-jacked.

755
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:12,390
Can you identify the perpetrators?

756
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:16,291
Just their fists as they pummeled
my eyes. And the bottom of their...

757
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,688
boots as they kicked me out
of your mobile crime lab...

758
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:20,523
our mobile crime lab.

759
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:24,281
Okay, your mobile crime lab.

760
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:27,161
Then they beat me
with a blue-and-yellow sock

761
00:36:27,191 --> 00:36:29,448
as they got high on ABBA
and tiny little meatballs.

762
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,700
- Swedes.
- Swedes.

763
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:32,076
That's them.

764
00:36:33,028 --> 00:36:34,422
Should I believe you?

765
00:36:34,732 --> 00:36:35,939
Your pulse races.

766
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:39,359
Only because
you're standing so close.

767
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:41,919
She's lying.

768
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:44,813
- Who are you protecting?
- I'm not protecting anybody.

769
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:47,761
That would imply that I'm protecting
the people who killed Dwight Dixon.

770
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,844
And why would I protect killers?

771
00:36:50,022 --> 00:36:51,762
I'm not protecting killers!

772
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:55,391
She's telling the truth.

773
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:57,983
There's activity
on Dixon's credit card.

774
00:36:58,013 --> 00:37:00,160
He just checked back in
to the <i>Come and Sleep hotel</i>.

775
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,296
Yes! He's alive!

776
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,191
That's good, huh?

777
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:05,243
Right?

778
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:06,926
Yeah, that's something.

779
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:10,347
<i>Racing to the site of
Dwight Dixon's credit-card hit,</i>

780
00:37:10,377 --> 00:37:13,860
<i>the PI and pie maker
found themselves in a jam.</i>

781
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:18,038
Listen,
we're all professionals, people.

782
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,829
This doesn't have to get ugly.

783
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,018
Your shirt suggests otherwise.

784
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,758
Once we find Dwight,
all will be illuminated.

785
00:37:30,926 --> 00:37:31,767
Or not.

786
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:37,141
We will soon get
to the bottom of this.

787
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:40,629
The bottom of this keeps dropping.

788
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:44,482
Well, when they get to the bottom,
what exactly are they gonna be scraping?

789
00:37:44,543 --> 00:37:46,528
'cause dead men don't run up
their credit cards

790
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,957
checking back into motels
they never checked out of.

791
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:51,155
You don't think Chuck's dad
could have done all this?

792
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:54,214
Whatever ridiculous speculations
you have are moot.

793
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:56,326
The details speak loud and clear.

794
00:37:56,388 --> 00:37:57,912
Come, details.

795
00:37:57,972 --> 00:37:59,130
Speak to us.

796
00:37:59,307 --> 00:38:02,262
<i>The details in the case
did speak loud and clear.</i>

797
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:06,671
<i>But the story they told was a lie,
for the facts were not these...</i>

798
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:10,383
<i>Every item scrutinized
in the room told a story</i>

799
00:38:10,444 --> 00:38:12,286
<i>precisely crafted. For,</i>

800
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,662
<i>despite the fact that Dwight Dixon's
life had simply gotten up and left him,</i>

801
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:19,044
<i>the lack of visible signs of trauma</i>

802
00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:21,852
<i>told a far more logical tale
of a man</i>

803
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:24,480
<i>who had simply died
of natural causes.</i>

804
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:29,638
<i>For hidden booty of heirlooms and
gold crowns stashed under the mattress</i>

805
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:31,861
<i>implied a seasoned grave robber</i>

806
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,021
<i>and the can of fuel accelerant</i>

807
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:37,451
<i>indicated the two bodies robbed
had gone up in flames.</i>

808
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:43,123
<i>In the end, all the evidence pointed
to Dwight acting and dying alone</i>

809
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:45,953
<i>with nobody else responsible</i>

810
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,629
<i>because that's
what they were supposed to find.</i>

811
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,999
<i>And Vivian Charles found herself
buoying her sister Lily's spirits</i>

812
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:08,533
<i>after learning that their beloved
Charlotte's body was gone.</i>

813
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:14,739
<i>Meanwhile, the pie maker meditated
on his own responsibilities.</i>

814
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:16,934
- Any sign of your dad?
- Nope.

815
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:19,365
No hide nor hair nor button.

816
00:39:20,112 --> 00:39:21,537
But he's out there somewhere.

817
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:24,749
I don't know if I like the idea
of Charles Charles as my guardian angel.

818
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,815
He hasn't told anyone that
there's a pie maker who has a knack

819
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:29,712
for baking and waking the dead.

820
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:35,259
You're... you're using fresh fruit.

821
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,646
I am now.
I mean from now on.

822
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:41,766
Touching dead things has only
gotten me into trouble, so... no more.

823
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:46,889
Besides, I've already got
the best thing I'm gonna get from it.

824
00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:48,189
You.

825
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:51,192
No more dead fruit,
no more dead people?

826
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:53,027
Yeah, I'm going cold turkey.

827
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,547
From now on, investigating crime
is Emerson's business,

828
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:58,949
and baking pie is mine.

829
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,870
- This is all my fault.
- I'm not looking to blame anyone.

830
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,365
Waking the dead creates
too many unfortunate variables,

831
00:40:05,395 --> 00:40:07,875
and I'm just taking myself
out of the equation.

832
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,960
But my dad,
he already fixed everything.

833
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,172
I don't want your dad
