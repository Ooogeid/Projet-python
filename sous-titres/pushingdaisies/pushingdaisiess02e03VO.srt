3
00:00:04,758 --> 00:00:07,324
<i>At this very moment,
young Olive Snook</i>

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,533
<i>was 9 years, 20 weeks,</i>

5
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:13,461
<i>4 days, 11 hours,
and 33 minutes old.</i>

6
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:16,338
<i>Two hours had passed
since her first riding lesson</i>

7
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:19,418
<i>when she asked her parents
for an Arabian stallion.</i>

8
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:21,986
- No.
- No.

9
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:24,268
<i>Endowed with a tenacious spirit</i>

10
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:27,368
<i>and the inability to accept
negative statements,</i>

11
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:29,823
<i>young Olive set her intention</i>

12
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,520
<i>to get the horse herself.</i>

13
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:35,213
<i>Digging to Arabia
would be easy...</i>

14
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:39,092
<i>Head to the center of the earth,
then turn right.</i>

15
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,422
<i>Two weeks into her quest,</i>

16
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:46,600
<i>she found a creature
of a different kind...</i>

17
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:50,645
<i>a 65-million-year-old
triceratops.</i>

18
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:54,027
<i>The discovery got the attention
of a Saudi royal,</i>

19
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:57,042
<i>who brought one of
his prized stallions to trade,</i>

20
00:00:57,072 --> 00:00:58,445
<i>per Olive's request.</i>

21
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:02,270
<i>That day, Olive Snook
learned a valuable lesson:</i>

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,610
<i>though digging was messy work,</i>

23
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,505
<i>it could also unearth
untold treasures.</i>

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,696
<i>Subterranean treasures
continued to exist</i>

25
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:13,444
<i>in the life of Olive Snook,</i>

26
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:17,893
<i>namely the underground mushroom,
the black Perigord truffle.</i>

27
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:19,400
Pigby, pull!

28
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:22,709
<i>Truffle-harvesting season
had come to the convent</i>

29
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:24,979
<i>of the Sisters
of the Divine Magnatum,</i>

30
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:29,130
<i>causing Olive to reflect on the reasons
she had come to this place...</i>

31
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:31,770
<i>her unrequited love
for the pie maker,</i>

32
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,030
<i>and her vow to keep the secret</i>

33
00:01:34,148 --> 00:01:37,650
<i>that Lily Charles was not
Chuck's aunt, but her mother.</i>

34
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,020
Pigby, pull!

35
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:42,822
<i>While sequestered in this place,
Olive found a new friend.</i>

36
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,862
What a divine specimen.

37
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:49,287
<i>Sister Larue was the beloved head
of the convent's truffle operation.</i>

38
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:52,546
<i>Observing Olive's penchant
for burrowing,</i>

39
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:55,314
<i>she took the new arrival
under her wing.</i>

40
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,925
What do you smell?

41
00:01:58,596 --> 00:01:59,346
Honey.

42
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:02,353
Pepper.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,761
You missed the most important thing.

44
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:09,198
Sex.

45
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:14,521
A truffle's scent mimics the hormones
of the male pigs ready to breed.

46
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:17,136
That's why sows
are the best hunters.

47
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:20,012
Trying to get your groove on,
girl?

48
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,402
I know how that feels...

49
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:22,457
Felt.

50
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,203
Duty tolls.
Time to polish the bells.

51
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,413
Save me a seat at midday prayers.

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,725
And be sure to give Pigby a little...
what do you call it...

53
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,043
something-something.

54
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,000
Excuse me.

55
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,015
Amen.

56
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:47,218
Pigby.

57
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:50,932
Rise and shine.

58
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:53,593
We got eats... fresh and French
on your doorstep,

59
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:56,446
which is odd to say, because
your doorstep used to be my doorstep,

60
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,108
and though I'm sad you moved out
and into Olive's vacated apartment,

61
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:01,645
I'm trying.

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,194
All right, thank you.

63
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:06,558
I'll talk to you then.
Bye.

64
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:08,524
Who was that?

65
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:11,952
Mr. Pennybaker. I hired him,
but that's the end of the story.

66
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:13,601
Digby, are they for me?

67
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,981
Thank you.
Come in. Come in. Come in.

68
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,613
Come on.

69
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,820
Sorry, where was I?
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,837
So, last night,
I was polishing the furniture

71
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,888
you brought back from my childhood
bedroom, and I found this in the desk,

72
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,268
from third grade.

73
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:29,933
Your family tree.
You didn't finish it.

74
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:31,486
No, because I had no resources.

75
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:34,683
Mom died in childbirth, and Dad...
Well, you know what happened there.

76
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:35,887
<i>The pie maker did,</i>

77
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:40,148
<i>and even though Chuck had forgiven him
for his hand in her father's demise,</i>

78
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,390
<i>the mention of it still stung.</i>

79
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,318
Your aunts couldn't help?

80
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:47,725
Not when they're step-aunts.
See, Dad was in his 20s

81
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,336
when his dad married
Lily and Vivian's mom,

82
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,808
so they barely knew each other.

83
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:53,494
But they must have known something.

84
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:55,602
Nothing, and they felt
so terrible about it

85
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:59,015
that Vivian cried nonstop
and Lily went on a 6-day bender.

86
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:00,662
So I handed my assignment in as was

87
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:03,968
and never questioned
or pondered my lineage again.

88
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:06,188
Not until last night.

89
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:07,468
I've decided...

90
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,322
... I got to make the most
of this second chance at life.

91
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:12,155
So I donned a disguise...

92
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:13,816
Oh, yeah, sorry.

93
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:17,718
And I went about digging up
my own answers

94
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:19,729
with the help
of Cyrus Pennybaker,

95
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:22,872
catch as King Can, Inc.,
your genealogy unearthed

96
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,409
in 24 hours.

97
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:27,338
You're making a scowly face.

98
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,618
No scowl.

99
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,616
My not-scowl is an expression
of not understanding

100
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:34,285
why anyone would want to go
rooting around in their past.

101
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,427
After all that shoveling,
you still wake up in the same bed,

102
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,125
do the same job,
live the same life,

103
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:41,917
except now you're grimy
with a kink in your back.

104
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:47,513
<i>While Charlotte Charles
pondered her past,</i>

105
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,533
<i>Olive Snook
considered her future.</i>

106
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,700
Father, I wish to stay here
forever and serve.

107
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,430
If this is not Thy will,
then drop me a line.

108
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:12,646
It is with heavy heart

109
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:15,827
that I report Sister Larue died
at her own hand.

110
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,640
She was alone in the belfry.

111
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,955
We have no evidence of struggle,
no sign of accident.

112
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,212
But I just saw her.
She was very happy.

113
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,770
To take one's life is a mortal sin.

114
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:29,823
Only prayer can help mitigate
her soul's anguish

115
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,551
in the everlasting fires of hell.

116
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:33,845
Hell? Sister Larue?

117
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,291
<i>For Olive Snook,</i>

118
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:39,124
<i>negative statements
were still unacceptable,</i>

119
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:41,204
<i>and praying wouldn't be enough.</i>

120
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:45,674
<i>Private detective Emerson Cod
rarely stayed late at the office.</i>

121
00:05:45,704 --> 00:05:48,268
<i>Tonight, it was a blessing he did.</i>

122
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:53,281
- What can I do for you, Sister?
- Emerson, it's me, Olive.

123
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:56,482
Olive Snook.

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,658
<i>As Olive Snook explained why
she needed Emerson Cod's services,</i>

125
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:17,346
<i>her words went unheard.</i>

126
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:21,687
<i>The veteran P.I.
was having trouble</i>

127
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:24,440
<i>wrapping his head
around the face before him.</i>

128
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:26,707
You're killing me.

129
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,608
Have you had your fun?

130
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,240
As I was saying,
this is a matter of Heaven and Hell.

131
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,949
I need you to prove that
Sister Larue didn't commit suicide.

132
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,188
Yeah, okay,
wait a second.

133
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,356
- Why are you pretending to be a nun?
- Oh, I'm not pretending.

134
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,873
I'm a postulant.
That's a nun in training.

135
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,292
What got thee to a nunnery?

136
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,045
Oh, Emerson.
You really want to know?

137
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:50,406
Not especially.

138
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,872
That was just my attempt
at polite wee talk.

139
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:54,801
Moment's passed,
so let's talk compensation.

140
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:55,778
Well,

141
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:57,455
I have none.

142
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:59,913
Vows of poverty and all.

143
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:04,773
But I could pay you
in prayer.

144
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,353
<i>Olive braced herself,</i>

145
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:09,970
<i>knowing that Emerson Cod
prayed to a god all his own...</i>

146
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,649
<i>the almighty Dollar.</i>

147
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,362
- <i>To her astonishment, he simply said...</i>
- Deal.

148
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,235
I present...

149
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,320
<i>What she didn't know</i>

150
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,436
<i>was a world-weary detective
with a missing daughter</i>

151
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,480
<i>needed all the prayers
he could get.</i>

152
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,166
Oh, praise be!
All right.

153
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:30,703
Here's the sitch.

154
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,190
My sisters and I?
Straight-up sequestered.

155
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,981
Strangers and drop-bys
are a no-go.

156
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,431
I need you to find an airtight way,
and one that doesn't involve me.

157
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,390
IE, we've never met.

158
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:44,976
Last, but certainly not least,

159
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,656
and I can't put
too fine a point on this...

160
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:51,983
... no Ned or Chuck!

161
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:56,512
Why'd you bring him here
when you said you wouldn't?

162
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,575
I need pie boy's special skill set,
and pie girl comes with pie boy.

163
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,578
Why isn't pie girl
minding the <i>Pie Hole</i>?

164
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,745
Because she'd rather
be minding his.

165
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:08,114
Besides, he hired a new waitress.
Brandy, Candy, I don't know.

166
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:10,412
Somebody named after
booze or food.

167
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,879
I'm sorry, Olive.
I couldn't wait any longer.

168
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:16,067
<i>Olive trusted her arms
to encircle Chuck.</i>

169
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:19,964
<i>Sadly, she did not trust her mouth
with the same proximity,</i>

170
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:23,870
<i>for it increased the probability
of truths being spilled.</i>

171
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,677
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know you.

172
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,851
Come on, Olive.
We're all alone up here.

173
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,714
One is never alone
in the house of the Lord.

174
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:31,977
That's bat crap.

175
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:33,900
It's a freakin' convent!
Show some respect!

176
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:36,764
I'm showing you bat crap.

177
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,912
For somebody who was supposed
to keep this place all spic-and-span,

178
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,948
Sister Larue was Sister Half-ass.

179
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:44,015
She just polished the bells.

180
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:46,600
Sister Olive?

181
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:51,289
Why didn't you alert us
to our guests' arrival?

182
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:52,528
Our apologies.

183
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:54,673
I'm Mother Mary Mary.

184
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:57,298
This is Father Eduardo De Donde.

185
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,425
Father De Dowling.
Vatican police.

186
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:01,214
And...

187
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:03,638
These are my associates,
Father Mulcahy and Sister Christian.

188
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:06,345
We had assumed you'd be Italian.

189
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:09,649
We are...

190
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,461
Italian.

191
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:12,813
Part-time.

192
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,990
Meaning, our work is here,

193
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,527
but our hearts will always be
in Piazza San Pietro.

194
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:22,520
Can you think of any reason why
Sister Larue may have been upset?

195
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,252
The truffle harvest hasn't been
as good as in years past.

196
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:29,365
It's caused strain
on the convent's finances,

197
00:09:29,543 --> 00:09:31,293
but the Lord will provide.

198
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:32,540
He always does.

199
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:34,460
Well, I'm going to need to...

200
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,195
... see the body of Sister Larue,

201
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,746
as well as inspect her room,
maybe some of her paperwork.

202
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:42,172
I can assist Father Dowling.
I did know Sister Larue best.

203
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:43,476
You...

204
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:48,206
have a penance list to complete
for skipping yesterday's vespers.

205
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,331
Now, then, the mortal remains.

206
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:54,648
I'm not sure how I feel
about doing this...

207
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:55,565
here...

208
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,135
with Her... and Him.

209
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,840
It ain't like He ain't never done it.
Remember Lazarus?

210
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,203
Come on, let's do this while
I still got the joint locked down.

211
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,368
You know Chuck hired a genealogy service
to put branches on her family stump?

212
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:11,426
Not because she could expose herself.
She dodged that with a hooker wig.

213
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:13,708
It's because she's throwing
her heart into it willy-nilly.

214
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,571
What's too great about the past?
It's past...

215
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,387
Correction.
What's so great about your past?

216
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,258
From what you tell me, nothing.
That's why you don't want to delve.

217
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:24,719
But something's pushing dead girl
toward clearing up hers,

218
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,929
so why don't you just
step out the way and let her?

219
00:10:30,347 --> 00:10:33,697
Good, take that as your cue
to get to crackity-cracking.

220
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:41,485
Am I dead?

221
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,820
Sorry, Sister.

222
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:45,156
Are you... kidding me?

223
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,022
You "shh"!

224
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:51,228
I've been putting up
with silence for 10...

225
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:54,665
Can we just ask you a...
just a couple questions?

226
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,834
I got a question for you!
Where's my white light?

227
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:00,163
I knew this afterlife stuff
was...

228
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:04,258
Where's my... diamonds?

229
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,135
Wait, diamonds?
What diamonds?

230
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:09,180
Whoever shoved me off that tower
and stole my stash is gonna pay!

231
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:16,145
Back to "shoved"...
As in murdered?

232
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,731
Of course, murdered.
What else would it be?

233
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,277
Nun on the run!
Nun on the run! Nun on the run!

234
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,953
Let some...

235
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,910
We're so going to hell.

236
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,620
So, before Sister Larue
was Sister Larue,

237
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:36,023
she was Dr. Linda Frank, mycologist,

238
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:37,929
that's a fancy word
for fungi specialist.

239
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,835
Talked more like a sailor
than a scientist.

240
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:43,325
You're not far off. It says here
she's from a long line of longshoremen.

241
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:46,910
Isn't it fascinating? You can put
a lady through a PhD program

242
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,564
and cloister them
for almost a decade,

243
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:50,679
and still the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

244
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:53,246
What's the status of your tree?
Family, not apple.

245
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:56,310
Pennybaker should be putting the final
touches to each limb as we speak.

246
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:59,150
I don't mean to sound negative.
You're always so supportive and good...

247
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,512
I did something bad just now.

248
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,566
As you were pawing through
Sister Larue's paperwork,

249
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,505
I was digging through
Olive's file.

250
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:08,307
I know it was wrong,
but I needed to know

251
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:11,340
if it was my fault she ran away
and joined a convent.

252
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,056
- The part of the application was blank.
- Then you're off the hook.

253
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:15,806
You saw how she treated me
in the tower.

254
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,865
There was a hook.
An ice-cold one, and I was on it.

255
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:20,459
Now, if I've upset her,
I got to fix that.

256
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,294
She's the closest thing
to a sister I have.

257
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:25,553
How is there a breeze in here?

258
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:28,074
These walls should be
3 feet thick.

259
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:35,492
This isn't a wall...
It's a door.

260
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,720
Oh, God!

261
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,771
To be able to clutch your arm
right now...

262
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,761
Come on! Somebody's coming.
Let's hide.

263
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:55,180
Sister Larue was murdered?

264
00:12:56,145 --> 00:12:59,206
I hired you
to disprove a suicide!

265
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:01,709
Oh, this can't happen!
Not here!

266
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:03,145
There are commandments!

267
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:05,838
We follow all 10,
and I am commanding you to stop!

268
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,054
Emerson, this is my refuge,
my home.

269
00:13:14,114 --> 00:13:15,973
You want to share it
with a homicidal maniac?

270
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:18,489
Not particularly.

271
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:20,575
Dang it!

272
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,938
Educate me about Larue.

273
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:26,025
- She ever mention... diamonds?
- No.

274
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:28,135
- What about enemies?
- Everyone looked up to her.

275
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:29,715
When she wasn't in the orchard,

276
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:32,114
she was down here in her room
with her science books,

277
00:13:32,174 --> 00:13:35,618
trying to improve our meager harvest
and turn our fortunes around.

278
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:39,997
This wall is hollow.

279
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:47,502
CDs?

280
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:49,561
Magazines?

281
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:53,856
Top-shelf fem-care.

282
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:56,012
This stuff is all forbidden!

283
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,117
Someone's there.

284
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,483
Please let me go!

285
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,610
Not until you face off
with the papal fuzz.

286
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,058
Exactly what's been coming
to pass up in here?

287
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:13,715
I try so hard to be good,

288
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:17,739
but I cannot deny there are times
when I would kill for...

289
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,120
Candy corn.

290
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,039
In exchange for doing our chores,

291
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,430
Sister Larue would get some for me
from the outside.

292
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,253
Will I ever be forgiven?

293
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:29,501
Yeah, penance list.

294
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:31,346
This should do it.

295
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:32,841
Scram.

296
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,011
We have a lead.

297
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:38,298
We saw Mother Superior
coming out of a secret door.

298
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,307
And we're gonna check it out.
Olive, you're in?

299
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:43,348
I'm, I'm busy.

300
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:46,259
Here's what I got.

301
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,409
Sister Larue was running goods
for her sisters.

302
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:51,189
Everything from lip gloss
to romance novels.

303
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:54,835
I bet blessed boss lady found out
and dropped a hallowed hammer.

304
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:57,312
Killing over that
seems a tad extreme.

305
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,118
But people kill for diamonds
all the time.

306
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,205
What if Larue's guilty pleasure
wasn't soft lips or Harlequin tingles?

307
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:04,623
What if it was bling?

308
00:15:04,906 --> 00:15:07,960
And she smuggled ice
into the penguin house for herself?

309
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,543
If Mother Superior
found Larue's shiny stash...

310
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:14,923
Then all it would take was one push,
and the convent would be back in black.

311
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:17,052
By-proxy high five.

312
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:26,186
Get...
before I by-proxy vomit.

313
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:31,550
Good evening,
Mother Superior.

314
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,551
Father Dowling requested
I peruse your visitors' log.

315
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:36,894
<i>While Chuck distracted
Mother Superior,</i>

316
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:40,810
<i>the remaining Vatican police
paid a visit to her secret room.</i>

317
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,395
It's truffle storage.

318
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:46,098
I guess Mother Superior
was just checking in on the crop.

319
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:48,678
And capping off
a do-it-yourself project.

320
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:52,838
The bricks don't match.

321
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,084
The mortar's wet, too.

322
00:15:58,447 --> 00:15:59,597
Jericho time.

323
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:02,348
Wait, what are you...

324
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:11,310
Looks like we found
Larue's way in and out of here.

325
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:18,072
We were hoping to interview
people who knew Sister Larue,

326
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,457
but from the looks of this,
she didn't have visitors in 10 years.

327
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:25,295
Some families disagree with their
daughters' decisions to be cloistered.

328
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:27,695
Often they cut off contact,
not the novitiate.

329
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:31,275
How did your family react
when you decided to take the veil?

330
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:33,112
Take the... the what?

331
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:35,714
Become a nun.

332
00:16:39,555 --> 00:16:41,005
They weren't around.

333
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:42,991
I lost my dad when I was 8,

334
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:45,391
and my mom died having me.

335
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,143
God bless you.

336
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:49,754
God bless her.

337
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:51,416
I don't really dwell on it,

338
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:55,496
but unexpectedly, I think of her,
and then, more specifically, this...

339
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,319
hole in my heart
where a mother should be.

340
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,182
I didn't know her, and I never will.

341
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,062
Of course you will, my dear.

342
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,701
In Heaven.

343
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,537
I don't even know
if I'm going to Heaven.

344
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:08,497
<i>Future uncertain,</i>

345
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:10,666
<i>Chuck could only cling
to the past...</i>

346
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:13,850
<i>A past being pieced together
by a genealogy expert,</i>

347
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,422
<i>whom she needed to call
at that very moment.</i>

348
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:19,393
Do you mind if I use
your phone, please?

349
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:23,611
<i>20 feet underground and
one quarter-mile to the east,</i>

350
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:27,239
<i>the pie maker and Emerson Cod found
Larue's secret door</i>

351
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:29,928
<i>led to a surprise destination.</i>

352
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,531
What the hell is this?

353
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,181
We're in the back
of a restaurant kitchen.

354
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:49,371
He must be the chef.

355
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:50,788
Or leatherface.

356
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,083
My God!

357
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:55,126
Leatherface has
a 4-quart food processor

358
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:57,380
with a 2-horsepower motor
and an extra-large feed tube.

359
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,824
I've wanted one forever.

360
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:00,375
Juliennes like a dream.

361
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:04,553
Where is my Larue?

362
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,634
Tell him.

363
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:08,140
Rule number one...
don't buy fish on Monday.

364
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:10,768
Rule number two...
don't poke an angry German.

365
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,046
Swiss German...

366
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:14,813
His accent sounds like the chef who
taught my tortes of Europe pastry class.

367
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:17,149
- He don't look too Swiss to me.
- Sorry, sir?

368
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,853
Larue is dead.
We had nothing to do with it,

369
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:23,532
so please consider your neutral
homeland and put the cutlery down.

370
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:28,995
<i>The facts were these:</i>

371
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:32,797
<i>Hansel Von Getz,
Switzerland's acclaimed chef,</i>

372
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:35,015
<i>decided to conquer America.</i>

373
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:39,319
<i>He opened a restaurant neighboring
the Sisters of the Divine Magnatum,</i>

374
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:41,507
<i>where, unbeknownst to him,</i>

375
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,330
<i>Sister Larue discovered a doorknob
that hadn't been used</i>

376
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,775
<i>since prohibition deliveries
of communion wine.</i>

377
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,964
<i>Just as a truffle grows
among tree roots,</i>

378
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:58,090
<i>so did the nun and the chef
form a symbiotic relationship.</i>

379
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:01,603
<i>He would supply her and her sisters</i>

380
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,382
<i>with earthly delights
from the outside world.</i>

381
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:07,950
<i>She would supply him
with his favorite ingredient.</i>

382
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:11,644
<i>Often, they dined together
at lavish meals.</i>

383
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,648
<i>One night, his guest
surprised him with dessert.</i>

384
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,869
This is delicious.

385
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:21,074
Really amazing.

386
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:24,517
That rotten meal you saw...
it was to celebrate our anniversary.

387
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,301
I didn't have the heart
to throw it away.

388
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:28,178
So Larue never made it
to the wingding.

389
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,888
When hours became days,

390
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:32,298
I went into the catacombs
to look for her,

391
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:34,016
but a wall blocked my path.

392
00:19:34,077 --> 00:19:36,312
Tell me about the last time
you saw Larue.

393
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,375
Did she seem scared, upset?

394
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:39,940
Her mood was joyous.

395
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:42,644
We made love here.

396
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:44,902
And then,

397
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,697
she gave me this...

398
00:19:46,757 --> 00:19:48,996
An Italian white truffle,

399
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:51,660
the most sought-after culinary
delicacy in the world.

400
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:54,490
Its aroma has driven men mad.

401
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,732
<i>But Emerson Cod's gaze
was not on the priceless morsel</i>

402
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,601
<i>known scientifically
as tuber magnatum.</i>

403
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:04,558
<i>It was on a piece of stationery
which bore the same word.</i>

404
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:07,293
Say, could you throw puppy a bone?

405
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:08,844
Certainly.

406
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:12,139
At $4,000 a pound,

407
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:14,955
no wonder they call it
the diamond of the table.

408
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,102
- Diamond?
- Yep.

409
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:19,509
- Gotta go.
- Listen, we find anything else out,

410
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:21,616
we'll just pop up
and, fill you in, huh?

411
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,234
Larue was the love of my life.

412
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:29,069
I will not rest until
you find out who killed her.

413
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:30,407
"You are a vile man

414
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:33,528
who will stew in the juices
of your sin for all eternity.

415
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:35,661
Do not try to see me again.
Sister Larue."

416
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:37,609
Boyfriend's name
was Hansel Von Getz.

417
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:39,557
And they were together,
in the biblical sense.

418
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:41,748
- Sure were.
- Let me get this straight.

419
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:44,386
She took an underground
tunnel to a restaurant

420
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:46,289
owned by a Swiss chef,

421
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,009
who traded black-market swag
for truffles.

422
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:50,876
Nun dumps chef, chef gets scary,

423
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:53,674
nun gets scared and walls up
the basement tunnel to keep him out.

424
00:20:53,704 --> 00:20:56,515
Somehow he finds a way out,
follows her up to the bell tower,

425
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:58,193
and it's raining nuns.

426
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,415
As for the mystery diamonds,
they're Italian white truffles...

427
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:04,065
the diamond of the table.

428
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:06,894
Except she couldn't
have had white truffles.

429
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:08,538
They only grow in Italy.

430
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:10,906
Everything else seems about right,
though, so great job.

431
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:13,033
Peace be with you
and also with you.

432
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,299
That was way too easy.

433
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:18,511
Oh, yeah.

434
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,025
Any minute, it's about to blow.

435
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,027
I know you're upset.

436
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:24,338
Let's talk.

437
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:27,480
- Why would I want to do that?
- Because I'm your friend.

438
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,745
Really? Have you thought about
me once since I left?

439
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,577
Go on.
I'll be your punching bag.

440
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,301
Jab all your misplaced anger away.

441
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:35,197
Chuck feels awful and
wants to apologize.

442
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,264
For what? I ain't mad at Chuck.

443
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,476
- I'm mad at you!
- I didn't do anything.

444
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:41,839
I had feelings for you!

445
00:21:43,064 --> 00:21:44,693
And when I made
those feelings known,

446
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:47,275
you made it known that you
didn't feel the same way.

447
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:51,915
An awkward patch, absolutely, but
we talked about it, and it's behind us.

448
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:54,107
No. It's behind you.

449
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:57,284
You don't like messy.
You don't like feeling bad.

450
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,163
So as soon as you could,
you just moved on and

451
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:01,408
abandoned me.

452
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:03,835
Well, if I'm gonna have
to get over you all by myself,

453
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,613
I'd kind of like to do it
in a place where

454
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:07,462
I don't have to see
your face every day.

455
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:10,206
But this place isn't you.
You belong at home.

456
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:11,705
This is my home.

457
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:14,734
And if I were to ever go back to home,
which I won't be, I can't.

458
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:17,012
What if I slip
and tell the secret to Chuck?

459
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:18,052
What secret?

460
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,998
No secret. Did I say secret?

461
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:22,252
Weird.
I must be speaking in tongues.

462
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,321
Stop it. That's not even
good gibberish.

463
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:29,673
This is why I can't be around
any of you.

464
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,601
I get lured into a sense
of familiarity, and my...

465
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,906
and my lips just...
just loosen up and I blurt!

466
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:38,220
This is your last warning.

467
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,255
Please stop digging.

468
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:42,429
I won't, and you know who really
won't stop digging

469
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:45,115
when I tell her what you said,
and believe you me, I'm telling?

470
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:48,628
No, ple...
Please, please!

471
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:52,155
Ned, I'm sworn to secrecy, Ned!

472
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,325
What if I guess?

473
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:57,729
I don't get what I'm looking at.

474
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,504
Look harder and faster.

475
00:22:59,534 --> 00:23:00,515
Okay,

476
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:03,238
nuns from 29 years ago...

477
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:05,604
Is it how many nuns,
like a number puzzle?

478
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:08,717
Something to do
with the sacred feminine?

479
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,026
- Are Freemasons involved?
- Oh, Lord, help me.

480
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:15,798
A nun.

481
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:17,555
Okay.

482
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,492
What? She's fat?

483
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:25,055
She's not fat, but she looks fat.

484
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:27,501
- She's... pregnant.
- Yes!

485
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:29,055
Yeah!

486
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:31,248
Did she... have her baby?

487
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:34,219
Did she... have to give it up?

488
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,075
No idea what that means.
Moving on.

489
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,807
Do you know this fallen nun
personally?

490
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:43,355
You do. Do I?

491
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:46,455
I do?
She doesn't look familiar.

492
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:49,898
Lily Charles!

493
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:50,897
So...

494
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:54,912
Aunt Lily had a baby
29 years ago,

495
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,566
right around the time
that Chuck was born.

496
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,245
So Chuck...

497
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:01,701
has a cousin her same age, but

498
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,704
not really her cousin, because Lily
and Vivian aren't really her aunts.

499
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:06,525
You are killing me!

500
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,595
Not really her cousin,

501
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:10,868
'cause not really
her aunts...

502
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:15,345
'Cause really her mother.
Oh, my God. Lily is Chuck's mother.

503
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:17,996
The weight has been lifted!

504
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:19,469
Let's go.

505
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,820
That's why Chuck couldn't
complete her family tree.

506
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:23,725
Everyone lied to her.

507
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,601
My head is about to explode.

508
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:28,215
Why did I make you tell me?

509
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:30,095
I told you to stop digging.

510
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:38,095
Jiminy Crispies.

511
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,195
Are you paying final respects?

512
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:45,995
You were right...

513
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:49,259
about digging around
in my past.

514
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,334
Digging did me nothing but
get me sore all over.

515
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:54,240
Turns out Mr. Pennybaker

516
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,214
is no better than a third-grader.

517
00:24:56,974 --> 00:25:00,724
No further information on my dad and
no record of my mom.

518
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:03,255
So I'm a person with no past

519
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,140
and no future.

520
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:06,681
'Cause of what I am.

521
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:10,355
Chuck, I have something
to tell you...

522
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,125
something about your...

523
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,925
What do you mean,
"because of what I am"?

524
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:18,407
You know,

525
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,089
how I am.

526
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,179
I don't know.
How and what are you?

527
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:24,796
And why do I suddenly feel contrite?

528
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,872
You know, the sisters are saying
that Larue's haunting the bell tower.

529
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:32,108
They say she rings the chimes to let
people know that she's not dead,

530
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:33,911
but she's not alive either.
She's just...

531
00:25:34,877 --> 00:25:36,379
somewhere in between.

532
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,925
I don't believe in ghosts, and
Larue is right here.

533
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:43,441
What if we've interrupted
the natural transition

534
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:44,859
between life and the afterlife?

535
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:47,015
I mean, I didn't move on
to where mom and dad are,

536
00:25:47,774 --> 00:25:50,936
and I didn't return to where I was,
either. I'm just... I'm just stuck.

537
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:54,126
I'm stuck, and I'm absolutely alone,

538
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:56,601
and I don't know if I can go on like
this or even if I want to.

539
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:00,707
Are you...

540
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,740
saying you want me
to touch you again?

541
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:06,451
Father Mulcahy,

542
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:07,869
I need your help.

543
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:16,545
Penance list! One for every day
since I arrived.

544
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:19,898
By burning your bossier-than-thou
handwriting into my brain,

545
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:22,624
these lists have dug you
a hole to hell. Know why?

546
00:26:22,654 --> 00:26:24,593
'Cause I also know you wrote this!

547
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:28,283
You just stumbled onto
Larue's contraband side business

548
00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:30,454
and her affair
with chef Boyardee, and

549
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:34,835
then you killed her in some god-fearing
rage, and left this fake break-up note

550
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:37,892
hoping that her boyfriend wouldn't
suspect foul play, but it was foul play!

551
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:41,307
It was the foulest of the foul!
Exodus 20:16...

552
00:26:41,337 --> 00:26:43,962
"Thou shalt not bear false
witness against thy neighbor..."

553
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,075
or push them out of bell towers!

554
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,105
Ring a bell?

555
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:49,792
You never could grasp
the meaning of that verse,

556
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,371
but there is truth in your words.

557
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,667
I did compose that letter.

558
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:57,639
Take her down, Father Dowling!

559
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:58,955
Yes, Father Dowling...

560
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:01,380
Just like you did
in your TV show.

561
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:03,089
Perhaps your associate,

562
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,593
"Mash's" Father Mulcahy,
would like to help.

563
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:09,805
I decided to do some investigating

564
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:12,233
after chatting
with your female colleague.

565
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:14,644
Her ignorance of the term
"taking the veil"

566
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,434
might have been explained away
by a simple slip of the brain.

567
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,450
But when she doubted
her place in Heaven,

568
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,075
I began to wonder
if she had any faith at all.

569
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:24,643
A call to the Vatican explained...

570
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,015
everything.

571
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,233
Sister Christian is nothing

572
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:30,852
but a heavy-petting power ballad.

573
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:32,704
We're motoring.

574
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:41,713
I'm usually
the one in that seat, but

575
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,397
tonight I yearned
to unburden my soul.

576
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:45,707
Should we...

577
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:48,928
jump in and get it over with?

578
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:50,847
Ready when you are.

579
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:57,304
I can't do this
after a day like today.

580
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:58,396
Really?

581
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,156
Do you want to...

582
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:01,688
Yeah.

583
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:17,995
So...

584
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,182
all this time, I thought
my colleagues and I were

585
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:24,023
getting along great,
talking out our issues,

586
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:27,138
and as it turns out,
I'm a giant disappointment.

587
00:28:27,297 --> 00:28:28,120
Because?

588
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,121
Because I don't like messy, and
I bring them back from the...

589
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,307
place they were.
Look, specifics aren't important.

590
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:39,098
But I wasn't trying
to screw up everyone's life.

591
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:42,454
We aren't born with bad habits.
Where'd you learn them from, Father?

592
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,680
<i>His entire life,
the pie maker had never felt safe</i>

593
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,599
<i>poking at paternal scars,</i>

594
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:50,280
<i>but in the cool quiet
of the confessional,</i>

595
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:53,446
<i>and with nothing to lose,
he allowed himself.</i>

596
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:56,308
My father deserted me
in boarding school when I was 9.

597
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:58,865
Months passed with nothing
but a postcard.

598
00:28:59,165 --> 00:28:59,998
So...

599
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:03,255
I went to the school chapel

600
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:05,115
every day and prayed...

601
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:08,202
prayed that he would...

602
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:11,658
just walk through the door and...

603
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,306
give me a hug and tell me
I was forgiven for...

604
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:20,088
whatever it was
that made him leave.

605
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,808
Then he was the one
who taught you to run.

606
00:29:24,838 --> 00:29:28,088
If I act like my father,
it's strictly by coincidence.

607
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:30,658
I wouldn't know him from Adam.

608
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,778
You never tried to reach out,
track him down?

609
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,960
I see no reason
to sift through ancient history

610
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,893
when I know everything
back there is rotten.

611
00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:39,437
That's where you're wrong.

612
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:41,291
The boy abandoned in the chapel

613
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:44,018
is the same man
abandoning people now.

614
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:47,708
If you ever want to change,
you've got to rectify your past.

615
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:50,378
Otherwise, you won't have a future.

616
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:51,649
Thank you...

617
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:55,180
... I guess.

618
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,641
Now why don't you tell me
who you really are?

619
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,086
Shame on you.

620
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,594
Sister Olive's locked
in the laundry room.

621
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:11,749
Go calm her down.

622
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:13,710
Where's Sister Christian?

623
00:30:25,938 --> 00:30:28,144
Father Ed, you've got to help me.

624
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,815
Mother Superior is a killer.

625
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,808
The Vatican police are really
three detectives that I hired.

626
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:34,511
Now, one of them is a pie maker...

627
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:36,387
Sister Olive, no more of this!

628
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:38,765
Mother Superior is a holy woman.

629
00:30:38,826 --> 00:30:42,642
Now, calm down and try to channel
inner peace through hard work!

630
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:45,036
You come down here,
dump off your laundry,

631
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:48,788
and expect me to pretend that
that menopausal maniac's a saint!

632
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:52,258
How does one person get
so much bat poo on themselves?

633
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,058
Looks like you had a brawl in the...

634
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:57,934
Bell tower.

635
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,295
Geez Louise.

636
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:03,164
You pushed Larue.

637
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:05,658
Sister Olive,
let me explain what I...

638
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,165
Did you find the keys?

639
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:14,462
I assure you,
if I locate anything keyish,

640
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:16,261
you are the first person
I will tell.

641
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,720
Help!

642
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:19,653
That's Olive.

643
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:21,182
All right,
we bustin' outta here.

644
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,869
<i>At that moment,</i>

645
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:29,188
<i>Sister Christian
had a crazy thought...</i>

646
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,057
<i>If ghosts did exist...</i>

647
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:32,108
Sister Larue?

648
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:35,778
<i>Sister Larue might be the one entity
with whom she could commiserate.</i>

649
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:38,211
I'm sorry to barge in
on you like this, but...

650
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,533
I just thought,

651
00:31:41,183 --> 00:31:42,633
if you're up here...

652
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:46,052
you may be feeling
god-forsaken.

653
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:48,658
So maybe I could...

654
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:53,408
Maybe I could do
some polishing,

655
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:54,963
and we can...

656
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:57,414
we can feel that way together.

657
00:31:57,444 --> 00:32:00,989
<i>Charlotte Charles knew a great deal
about removing tarnish,</i>

658
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,686
<i>for she had spent countless hours
polishing her aunt's stockpile</i>

659
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,698
<i>of copper, brass,
and bronze cheese knives.</i>

660
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,246
<i>The metal before her, however,
was...</i>

661
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:14,732
Stainless steel.

662
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:18,084
<i>Meaning the nun whose chore
was to polish the bells</i>

663
00:32:18,114 --> 00:32:19,978
<i>never needed to do so.</i>

664
00:32:20,194 --> 00:32:21,783
<i>It was a revelation which made </i>

665
00:32:21,844 --> 00:32:25,136
<i>the footprint on the bottom
of the bucket even more strange.</i>

666
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:26,908
<i>If she wasn't polishing,</i>

667
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:30,205
<i>what did Sister Larue need to reach?</i>

668
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:36,350
<i>Chuck expected to hear the
dulcet chime of a tiny bell...</i>

669
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:38,005
<i>not the thud...</i>

670
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:42,308
<i>of Sister Larue's
secret truffle laboratory.</i>

671
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:44,852
Help!

672
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:46,448
Olive?

673
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:49,270
Olive?

674
00:32:50,957 --> 00:32:53,357
<i>At that moment,
Charlotte Charles discovered</i>

675
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:55,811
<i>who had killed Sister Larue.</i>

676
00:32:55,984 --> 00:32:59,656
<i>It was a secret she would be
taking to her grave... again.</i>

677
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:02,533

<i>to an educational film on alligators</i>

00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:07,003
<i>on what to do when pursued by one:</i>

00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,253
Chuck!

683
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:17,298
Sister, I wanted to help Larue,
not hurt her!

684
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:18,425
Whatever!

685
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:28,893
Step away from the door, or you gonna
have communion with your shovel.

686
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:30,144
Please, help me!

687
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,219
- Help me!
- We're coming!

688
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:36,098
Oh, God! Help!

689
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:38,695
Help, help, help!

690
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,388
Sisters, help him!
Go! Help him!

691
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:44,283
- The rest of us pray!
- Come on. Come on.

692
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:45,570
Chuck!?

693
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,337
I got you!

694
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:49,956
Chuck, I'm so sorry I was cold.

695
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:51,685
I didn't want to hurt you.

696
00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:53,661
And now you're still
gonna be hurt,

697
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:55,878
and I'm gonna lose the closest thing
to a sister I have!

698
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:58,589
Thank you.
That really means a lot to me.

699
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:03,344
If this ends up going downhill,
I know who killed Larue.

700
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:04,762
I know... Father Ed.

701
00:34:04,822 --> 00:34:06,597
No. No, look.

702
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:10,818
Pigby?

703
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,200
I was holding the truffles.
It was unintentional,

704
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,666
but it's encoded in her genes
to go after them.

705
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:18,067
I'm slipping! I'm slipping!

706
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:20,403
I'm going!
Pigby,

707
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:21,946
pull! Pull!

708
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:23,363
Pigby, pull!

709
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,858
- Thank you!
- Of course!

710
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:32,622
Oh, glory be to g...

711
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:36,711
Olive!

712
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:41,007
<i>As she fell, Olive was
overcome by a sense of peace.</i>

713
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,498
<i>She said a prayer that the pie
maker and Chuck would be happy,</i>

714
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:47,768
<i>that Emerson would be rich,
and that a slice of Georgia peach</i>

715
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:50,286
<i>served hot with cinnamon ice cream</i>

716
00:34:50,316 --> 00:34:53,695
<i>would be forever known on the
</i>Pie Hole<i> menu as an...</i>

717
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:55,353
<i>Olive Snook.</i>

718
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,896
Stupid ass!

719
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:00,359
It is finished, Lord.
Take me home.

720
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:02,487
<i>Home in this instance was the cart</i>

721
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:05,383
<i>hauled strategically
into place by...</i>

722
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:08,488
Hi.

723
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:10,221
Good catch.

724
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,858
<i>The facts were these...</i>

725
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,673
<i>Dr. Linda Frank, mycologist,</i>

726
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:22,048
<i>was hired by agricultural giant</i>

727
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,062
<i>"I thought you were hungry"
foods</i>

728
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:26,718
<i>for one mission:
the test-tube cultivation</i>

729
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:29,674
<i>of the elusive
Italian white truffle.</i>

730
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:33,079
<i>It would be a landmark
achievement until...</i>

731
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:37,317
<i>... all funding was pulled.</i>

732
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:41,129
<i>Hearing of the Sisters of the
Divine Magnatum's truffle farm,</i>

733
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,956
<i>Dr. Frank became Sister Larue,</i>

734
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:46,488
<i>who would use the nunnery
for her own gain.</i>

735
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,118
<i>She began work
on her own experiments.</i>

736
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:52,829
<i>But labs need equipment,
and so...</i>

737
00:35:53,906 --> 00:35:57,754
<i>Sister Larue found her way
to Hansel Von Getz,</i>

738
00:35:57,784 --> 00:36:01,575
<i>the next victim she would exploit
to keep her research going.</i>

739
00:36:02,123 --> 00:36:06,438
<i>Years passed, and Larue
finally achieved her goal.</i>

740
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:09,600
<i>The discovery would make
her filthy rich,</i>

741
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,764
<i>and so she planned her exit.</i>

742
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:16,231
<i>On the eve of her departure,
she brought her chef a gift.</i>

743
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:20,400
<i>He never realized it was
the equivalent of a culinary kiss-off.</i>

744
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,817
<i>And she never realized
Mother Superior had followed her.</i>

745
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:28,252
<i>Desperate to bring
a stray lamb back into the fold,</i>

746
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:30,152
<i>a plan was hatched.</i>

747
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:32,868
<i>Mother Superior
would end the relationship.</i>

748
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,580
<i>Father Ed would save Larue's soul.</i>

749
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:37,747
<i>The gentle priest
expected contrition,</i>

750
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:40,427
<i>not a million-dollar
scientific breakthrough</i>

751
00:36:40,457 --> 00:36:42,879
<i>and a false nun
possessed by greed.</i>

752
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:47,918
<i>Staring into the face
of what he considered true evil,</i>

753
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:51,861
<i>the priest ordered Larue
to take her discovery and leave.</i>

754
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:55,933
<i>As she took one last look
at the place she had despised for so</i>

755
00:36:55,993 --> 00:36:58,707
<i> many years, Larue never realized</i>

756
00:36:58,737 --> 00:37:02,732
<i>it would be the last look
she would ever have.</i>

757
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,848
<i>The priest mistakenly assumed</i>

758
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:09,773
<i>that his condemnation
led Larue to take her own life.</i>

759
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,296
<i>With the truth uncovered,</i>

760
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:15,197
<i>life returned to normal
at the nunnery.</i>

761
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:17,958
Where's Dowling and Christian?

762
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:20,302
Just bringing the car around.

763
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:22,018
So...

764
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:25,423
How did your sisters
take the truth about Larue?

765
00:37:25,656 --> 00:37:26,807
It was rough.

766
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:29,087
She betrayed
every sweet soul here.

767
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,493
Luckily, this particular sinner
had a silver lining...

768
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:36,356
For all her wickedness,
Larue was a fungal genius.

769
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:39,705
Mother Superior wants to build
the lab and continue her work.

770
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:40,946
Cha-ching.

771
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,274
Wouldn't have happened
if you didn't insist on digging.

772
00:37:46,104 --> 00:37:47,965
Go on.
It was a team effort.

773
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:49,955
Hey, they...

774
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,573
tapped me to be the new head
of truffle operations.

775
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:54,671
You'll be great.

776
00:37:57,032 --> 00:37:59,288
Because you are great...
person-wise.

777
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:02,772
You're right about a lot of things,
like what you said about us

778
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:05,086
when things got messy,
I took off and left you in the dirt,

779
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:07,156
not literally, but I'm sure
it felt that way.

780
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:09,799
That's not great.

781
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:11,095
No.

782
00:38:12,075 --> 00:38:13,402
That wasn't great.

783
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:18,936
Actually, it was awful. I was awful, and
I'm ashamed of myself, because I know

784
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:22,571
what it feels like to be abandoned, how
you think you're worthless and unlovable

785
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,439
and your heart hardens
to the person who did it to you.

786
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,529
Forgiving them
is inconceivable, but...

787
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:33,928
So I know I have no right to ask for
your forgiveness,

788
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,617
but I still want to tell you...

789
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:40,212
I'm sorry.

790
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:48,413
I just came out here to see
if I could catch a ride home,

791
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:49,713
but...

792
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:52,174
that was nice, too.

793
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:54,243
You want to come home?

794
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,084
My work here is done.

795
00:38:59,182 --> 00:39:01,224
Of course, I still have
to figure out a way to avoid

796
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:03,060
blabbing Lily's secret to Chuck.

797
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:06,272
Well, once I talk to her tonight,
it won't be a secret.

798
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,961
I know, but...

799
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:12,311
trust me.

800
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:15,543
I do.

801
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:20,202
Let me go hand in my habit, and
we'll hit the bricks.

802
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:22,990
Are you gonna miss this place?

803
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:25,817
Yeah. Yeah.

804
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,817
Of course, they gave me
a little souvenir.

805
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:32,813
Come on, Pigby.

806
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:38,385
<i>A secret that was 9 months plus</i>

807
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,003
<i>29 years, 11 months,
2 weeks, 5 days,</i>

808
00:39:42,033 --> 00:39:45,002
<i>15 hours, and 45 minutes
in the making</i>

809
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:48,481
<i>was undone in three seconds
with three words...</i>

810
00:39:49,131 --> 00:39:50,483
<i>"Lily's your mother".</i>

811
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:55,101
<i>Now the pie maker
could only wait for a response.</i>

812
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:58,092
Are you okay? Your expression is hard
to read. Maybe you could, you know...

813
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,910
Look at me.

814
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:05,913
Tears.

815
00:40:07,664 --> 00:40:08,868
Happy ones.

816
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:14,673
So you took that news and
chose to make it good?

817
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,485
That's inspiring.

818
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,013
Makes me realize I've got
some digging of my own to do.

819
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:29,688
For you.

820
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:32,413
I thought you might
want to fill it in.
