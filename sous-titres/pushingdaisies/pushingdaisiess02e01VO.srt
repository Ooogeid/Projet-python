1
00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:03,279
<i>At this very moment
in the town of Coeur d'Coeurs,</i>

2
00:00:03,309 --> 00:00:06,559
<i>a girl named Chuck was attending
her father's funeral.</i>

3
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:09,729
<i>The only parent she had ever known
was accidentally,</i>

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,774
<i>inadvertently killed
by the boy she loved,</i>

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,237
<i>who was, at this very moment,</i>

6
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:17,457
<i>attending his own
mother's funeral,</i>

7
00:00:17,574 --> 00:00:20,131
<i>who had
actually died twice.</i>

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,880
<i>It was a blood vessel
bursting in her brain</i>

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,078
<i>that caused
Ned's mother's first death.</i>

10
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:29,712
<i>However,
young Ned had a secret gift.</i>

11
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:33,556
<i>He could touch dead things
and bring them back to life.</i>

12
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:35,917
I must've slipped.
Clumsy.

13
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:37,828
Did the timer go off?

14
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:40,552
<i>It was a gift
with two simple caveats.</i>

15
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:44,268
<i>Keep a dead thing alive
for more than a minute,</i>

16
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,507
<i>and something else
would die in its place.</i>

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,590
<i>And touch a dead thing twice,</i>

18
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:58,016
<i>it dies again,
this time... forever.</i>

19
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:03,732
<i>Young Ned felt responsible,
not only for his mother's death,</i>

20
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:06,369
<i>but the death of Chuck's father.</i>

21
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:09,641
<i>His feelings of guilt
were amplified</i>

22
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:12,985
<i>because he, too, was in love.</i>

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,140
<i>The next time young Ned
would see the girl named Chuck,</i>

24
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:20,035
<i>she would be dead.</i>

25
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:24,443
<i>Unlike Chuck,
young Ned still had a father.</i>

26
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,639
<i>But after a brief mourning period,</i>

27
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:30,328
<i>he would deposit Ned
at the Longborough school for boys.</i>

28
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:33,080
<i>After her own father's death,</i>

29
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,395
<i>Chuck was fostered
by aunts Lily and Vivian,</i>

30
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:40,308
<i>a renowned synchronized swimming duo
and sister neurotics</i>

31
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:44,609
<i>who helped her build a new home
bee by bee.</i>

32
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:49,127
<i>It was aunt Lily who found the ad
on the back pages of the thrifty nickel</i>

33
00:01:49,157 --> 00:01:52,511
<i>in a fleeting wisp of something
resembling maternal instinct.</i>

34
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,919
I just wanted you to stop staring
at that spot where your father died.

35
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,720
<i>Young Chuck rebuilt her home
by building a new home</i>

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,989
<i>for a homeless queen
and her hive.</i>

37
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,986
<i>The bees thrived.
So did Chuck.</i>

38
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:06,994
<i>And while Chuck thrived,</i>

39
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:09,774
<i>Ned waited for his father
to bring him home.</i>

40
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:11,385
<i>And waited.</i>

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,110
<i>And waited.</i>

42
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:16,954
<i>Just as Chuck remembered
how home felt,</i>

43
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,053
<i>Ned tried not to forget
what home was.</i>

44
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,992
<i>He held on to it
the only way he could...</i>

45
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,055
<i>... and became the pie maker.</i>

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,208
<i>And the girl named Chuck
became dead.</i>

47
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,669
<i>She was 28 years, 24 weeks,</i>

48
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:40,575
<i>3 days, 11 hours,
and 51 minutes old</i>

49
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:43,323
<i>when murdered
on a Tahitian getaway.</i>

50
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:45,897
<i>But one touch
from the pie maker...</i>

51
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,887
Hey, I think
somebody's truck's on fire.

52
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:49,889
Oh, geez!

53
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:52,256
<i>... and she was alive once more.</i>

54
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:54,561
Sorry I'm late.

55
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,480
<i>The pie maker
could never touch her again.</i>

56
00:02:57,736 --> 00:03:01,026
<i>Chuck's survival now depended
on a delicate dance,</i>

57
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:04,070
- <i>a ballet of avoidance.</i>
- Going.

58
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,647
- Stopping.
- Crossing.

59
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:07,699
- Waiting.
- <i>The pie maker took precautions</i>

60
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,159
<i>to ensure Chuck felt safe
at home.</i>

61
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:12,912
<i>Slippers were worn
adorned with bells.</i>

62
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,945
- Going.
- Stopping.

63
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:16,398
Following.

64
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,251
<i>Digby kept his eyes
open to the hazards of touch,</i>

65
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:23,204
<i>a canine proximity alert
who could not only play dead...</i>

66
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,473
<i>... but could do so
from experience.</i>

67
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:32,357
<i>Neither the pie maker
nor Chuck could move</i>

68
00:03:32,387 --> 00:03:34,337
<i>without the other one knowing.</i>

69
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,764
<i>And to the pie maker,
it felt like home.</i>

70
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:42,955
<i>So, Chuck and the pie maker
built a home together</i>

71
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:44,886
<i>bee by bee.</i>

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,157
<i>Tragically, rogue pesticides
killed those bees,</i>

73
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:50,266
<i>but only briefly.</i>

74
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,761
This will go better
if you wear less clothes.

75
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,934
You've already got me
shucked like an ear of corn.

76
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:56,125
Well, I'm shucked, too,

77
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:57,832
all the way down
to my silky intimates

78
00:03:58,377 --> 00:03:59,876
just to put on a beekeeper's suit.

79
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:02,795
Remind me why
you're shucked and silky.

80
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:04,172
I thought it was only fair.

81
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:09,074
You stopped being fair.

82
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:11,652
Right. You do realize
I can get new bees.

83
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,765
I can make a new home
for new bees.

84
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,281
You love these bees.

85
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,840
A happy hive's a happy home,

86
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,061
and you can't be happy
if you're dead.

87
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,064
There are 1,000 dead bees here.

88
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:25,495
I don't want 1,000 butterflies to die
because you bring my bees back to life.

89
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,930
Think about it
as a pest-control issue.

90
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,907
There's a water bug infestation
in the drainpipes.

91
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:33,171
If I touch 1,000
little dead bees to life

92
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:36,282
maybe 1,000 little water bugs
will no longer be a problem.

93
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:38,515
Last time I asked you
to bring something back to life,

94
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,595
you said no.

95
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:40,812
It was your dad.

96
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:43,002
That would have been weird,
if not actively traumatic.

97
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:47,262
To bring my dad back, even
for a minute, may be ghoulish, but

98
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:48,490
it's also sweet.

99
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,136
It's like a taxidermied pet, or stuffing
someone's ashes in a Teddy Bear.

100
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,431
If you could bring your dad back just
for a minute, you say you wouldn't?

101
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,105
That would be
an awkward minute.

102
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:59,268
I haven't seen or heard
from the man in 20 years.

103
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:00,769
I'll stick to bees.

104
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,849
At least they know what home is.

105
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:05,607
This is very, very sweet of you.

106
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:07,276
And will probably sting.

107
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,344
Well,
don't offend the bees.

108
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,116
How would I offend
the bees?

<i>Believing Chuck

<i>Olive kept the secret

<i>But the secret that weighed the most
in Olive's satchel of deception</i>

118
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:02,199
<i>was that she was still in love
with the pie maker.</i>

<i>At that very moment,
private investigator Emerson Cod</i>

<i>Mr. Cod had time to author pop-ups</i>

126

My wife has been murdered!

129
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:34,447
What the po-po got to say
about your wife murder?

130
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:36,657
A work-related mishap.
Said she was sloppy.

131
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:38,574
- Was she sloppy?
- She wasn't sloppy.

132
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:39,829
She was having an affair.

133
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:42,374
Said she was gonna leave me or him...
I'm not sure which.

134
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:45,083
She wasn't using proper nouns,
but thank god I was eavesdropping.

135
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:47,030
If your old lady
was stepping out on you,

136
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,669
why you give a damn
who killed her?

137
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:50,790
I was hoping she was gonna
leave him, and not me.

138
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,070
I couldn't bear it
if she left me.

139
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:55,348
What line of work she in?

140
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:57,386
Bees. Do you know
anything about bees?

141
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,681
I know somebody who...
who knows somebody.

142
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:05,144
Let me just say that
I'm sorry about your loss.

143
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:09,016
And I do accept
credit cards.

144

<i>The facts were these.</i>

145
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:14,847
<i>One Kentucky Fitz, wife of Dusty,</i>

146
00:07:14,877 --> 00:07:18,301
<i>was the number-one bee-girl
of Betty's Bees.</i>

147
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,083
<i>Betty's Bees, trademark,</i>

148

<i>was all the buzz in beauty

<i>with honey
and honey-based moisturizers,</i>

150
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:29,544
<i>anti-aging creams, soaps,

151
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:34,650
<i>Kentucky was 26 years, 3 weeks,
5 days, and 39 minutes old</i>

<i>when found stung to death</i>

153
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:40,096
<i>behind the wheel
of her Betty's Bees bee-mobile.</i>

154
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:41,867
Which one is Kentucky Fitz?

155
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,547
- Biscuits.
- Biscuits?

156
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,916
You got biscuits,
you got shrimps.

157
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:47,270
Biscuits.

158
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:48,734
Shrimps.

159
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:50,858
You got something
we could use to flip her over?

160
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,218
Why you got to flip her over?

161
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:54,115
Front don't look no different
than the back.

162
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,770
It ain't like you gonna be
having a conversation.

163
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,950
It sure ain't.

164
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:11,092
Kentucky?

165
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:14,714
Maybe she's paralyzed
from all the bee stings.

166
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:18,214
I'm just taking in my surroundings.
Apparently, I'm dead.

167
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,583
Really?

168
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:24,432
Oh, I'm sorry,
but was your death accidental?

169
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,268
Was I accidentally swarmed
by bees? No.

170
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,372
I may have been up
to some mischief.

171
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:31,060
Your husband thinks
what got you killed

172
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,316
was some workplace romance
going all sorts of sour.

173
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,884
And my husband has a problem
with eavesdropping.

174
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,028
There was no romance.

175
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:40,489
It was my workplace went sour.
I was leaving Betty's Bees.

176
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,700
Did you tell Dusty
you were leaving Betty's Bees?

177
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:44,342
If I told him
I was quitting,

178
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:46,110
he would worry
and ask a lot of questions,

179
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,826
and then I'd have to lie
about sabotaging Betty's Bees.

180
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:50,374
Why did you sabotage Betty's Bees?

181
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,292
Why?

182
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,211
Because Betty had it coming.

183
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,922
Intention was to quit
before I got caught.

184
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,271
- Who caught you?
- I couldn't see his face.

185
00:08:58,301 --> 00:08:59,389
Or her face.

186
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,958
All the lights went out
one by one.

187
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:05,532
And then there was
a terrible hum.

188
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,582
Then out of the darkness,
it came for me.

189
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:11,512
It spit something,

190
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,731
and then a swarm of bees attacked.

191
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,025
I tried to get
a good look at it,

192
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:18,945
but the bees were already
stinging my eyes.

193
00:09:19,853 --> 00:09:21,203
That's terrifying.

194
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:24,029
That's terrifying!

195
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:25,849
Oh, sorry.
5 seconds!

196
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,270
- How'd you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- Do you have any last wishes?

197
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,997
My only wish is
that Dusty not be alone.

198
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:31,874
Yeah, yeah.
How'd you sabotage Betty's Bees?

199
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,125
With a lot of might.

200
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:36,921
That's nice.

201
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,925
We don't know what she was doing,
but we do know it took a lot of effort.

202
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:43,928
Do you hear something?

203
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,807
- Is she still breathing?
- That's not breathing.

204
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,885
I told you
not to turn her over.

205
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,204
Could that have happened to me
on the roof?

206
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,756
Could I have been swarmed?
In my underwear, too.

207
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:08,035
I could have been swarmed
in my underwear.

208
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:08,902
Hey!

209
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:12,362
Don't get to put pictures in my head.
That's an assault on my imagination.

210
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:14,152
Poor Kentucky.
What a horrible way to die.

211
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,090
Thousands of little stingers
stinging you.

212
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,588
Like little stinging secrets
that don't just sting you once.

213
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,105
They keep stinging you until
you're bloated and full of pus.

214
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,242
Who wanted a la mode?

215
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:28,222
Kentucky was bloated and full of pus
because she was sabotaging Betty's Bees.

216
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:31,566
Boy, Kentucky sure had it in for Betty,
but who had it in for Kentucky?

217
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:33,561
The terrifying beeman.

218
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,488
What if he was made
entirely out of bees,

219
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,926
that's why she couldn't see his face,
because he didn't have one?

220
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:40,394
I mean, what if there's
a whole beefolk society

221
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,236
who walk around
shaped like people?

222
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:45,531
You think about how you can train bees
to walk around in people shapes.

223
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:46,365
Yeah.

224
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:49,080
Ain't no bees walking around
in no people shapes.

225
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,703
Kentucky was
wiggety-wiggety-whacked.

226
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,872
With a swarm of bees.

227
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:54,734
Smells like
an inside job.

228
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:56,781
Kentucky was talking
to someone at Betty's Bees

229
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:58,210
when Dusty was dropping eaves.

230
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,005
Someone who knew what she was doing
and who would want to kill her for it.

231
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,344
Well, if it is an inside job,
we're gonna need an inside bee-girl.

232
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:07,036
No.

233
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,721
We got to tap this honey
at the source.

234
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,517
"Calling All Bee-Girls!"

235
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,992
<i>Under the nom de plume
of Katherine "Kitty" Pimms,</i>

236
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,949
<i>Chuck answered the call
calling for bee-girls.</i>

237
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:24,472
You know,

238
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,967
I find that the most amazing creatures
have furry behinds.

239
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:30,201
<i>Sitting in Woolsey Nicholls' office,</i>

240
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,180
<i>discussing
the furry behinds of bees,</i>

241
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,490
<i>Chuck realized this was
her very first job interview ever.</i>

242
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:41,334
<i>She considered this fact
for a moment, then had to ask...</i>

243
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:42,514
I have to ask.

244
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:45,132
Are you the Woolsey Nicholls
from Bzzz! Honey and more?

245
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:47,365
Yes, I am.

246
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:50,221
Well, why are you here?
Isn't Betty's Bees your biggest rival?

247
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,514
I own Betty's Bees now.

248
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:54,045
We made the acquisition
very quietly.

249
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:57,073
These days, merger can send
brand loyalists into a tizzy.

250
00:11:57,103 --> 00:11:59,772
Well, I'm a honey loyalist,
and you'll get no tizzy from me.

251
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:02,714
I just hope
you're not killing bee-girls.

252
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:05,360
- I beg your pardon?
- The bee-girls sales division.

253
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,780
With any acquisition, there's always
downsizing and restructuring.

254
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,830
I just hope it doesn't affect
the bee-girls.

255
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,685
The bee-girls will always
have a home in my hive.

256
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:17,141
Unfortunately,
although fortunate for you,

257
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:20,308
we've recently had an opening
in the bee-girl division.

258
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,378
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
Kentucky Fitz...

259
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:25,131
Something about
a honey-harvesting tragedy?

260
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,357
Yes.
It's very sad.

261
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:30,796
She had a very bright future
here at the new Betty's Bees.

262
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:31,576
Yeah.

263
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:35,853
I also heard that she was thinking of
leaving Betty's Bees before she died.

264
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:40,249
- You sure hear a lot of things.
- Very gossipy office.

265
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,068
Yes. Well, I think you will find
that particular rumor to be false,

266
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:46,277
because Kentucky
was invested.

267
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:49,113
She was the new face
of Betty's Bees.

268
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:52,123
We designed
our entire brand relaunch around her.

269
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,285
But Betty is the face
of Betty's Bees.

270
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,275
Oh, no.

271
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:58,222
See, Betty...
Betty's the old face, huh?

272
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,332
"Old" being the operative word.

273
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:02,293
She's 37.

274
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:03,925
She's 38,
which rounds up to 40,

275
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:06,022
which rounds up to 50,
which rounds up to old.

276
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,714
And if you were
in the business

277
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:10,657
of trying to sell a product

278
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,769
that promises youth,
beauty, and vitality,

279
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,555
you have to make
a strong case for it.

280
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:16,557
Correction.

281
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,672
We have to make
a strong case for it.

282
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:20,352
Kitty, I would be honored

283
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,840
if you called Betty's Bees

284
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:24,365
your new home.

285
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,383
Betty's Bees
is my new home.

286
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:28,860
Stupendous.

287
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:33,175
Chuck has a new home.
I blame you.

288
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:35,312
I blame me, too.
That went well.

289
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:37,392
<i>Emerson Cod's inside man,</i>

290
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:41,073
<i>a.k.a. Betty's Bees'
newest bee-girl Kitty Pimms,</i>

291
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:44,033
<i>buzzed through the offices
of Betty's Bees</i>

292
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:48,533
<i>until she buzzed
upon the office of one Kentucky Fitz.</i>

293
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:53,828
<i>Chuck/Kitty searched for
any hint of a saboteur's agenda.</i>

294
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:06,361
<i>What she found...</i>
Aaah!

295
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:08,188
<i>... was the eponymous Betty Bee.</i>

296
00:14:08,218 --> 00:14:11,736
- What are you doing in there?
- Cognitive therapy for claustrophobia.

297
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,572
- You're Betty Bee.
- That's right.

298
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,174
Why am I explaining myself to you?

299
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:18,287
You should be
explaining yourself to me.

300
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,354
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this office was vacant.

301
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:22,544
I'm Kitty Pimms.
I've just been hired.

302
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:23,457
By whom?

303
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:24,750
Woolsey Nicholls.

304
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,117
Woolsey?

305
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,333
So you're replacing Kentucky?

306
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:32,617
A little soon after her death
seems distasteful, don't you think?

307
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,736
It does, but it also speaks
to the efficiency

308
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,387
of your human resources
department.

309
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,849
I wonder how else
you'll be replacing Kentucky.

310
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,518
Since I'm a withered hag,

311
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:45,153
tattered by every grain of sand
in the hourglass,

312
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,106
Betty's Bees still needs
a fresh, young face,

313
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,160
and after what happened
to Kentucky, well,

314
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,735
no one wants to think about that
when they're buying lip balm.

315
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:54,839
Welcome to Betty's Bees.

316
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:02,405
<i>Kentucky's affairs were
clearly a bee in Betty Bee's bonnet.</i>

317
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,339
I just wanted to say what an honor it is
to be working with you.

318
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,300
Thank you.
Get out.

319
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,829
<i>And so Chuck got out.</i>

320
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:18,493
<i>But the question remained.</i>

321
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:21,461
Betty Bee...
Co-conspirator or killer?

322
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:25,060
Kentucky was gonna be the new face of
Betty's Bees, which give Betty motive.

323
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:27,980
Being replaced by young and
better-looking always gives you motive.

324
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,332
But Kentucky was sabotaging
Betty's Bees' trademark,

325
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:34,153
which was owned by Woolsey Nicholls,
which gives Woolsey motive.

326
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,688
Woolsey's a businessman.

327
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:36,999
Somebody sabotaged him,

328
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:38,866
he'd send in a swarm of lawyers,
not bees.

329
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:40,514
I know.

330
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:43,167
They were lovers
of the same-sex persuasion,

331
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:45,706
and the key is for their love nest.

332
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,462
We've ruled out workplace romance.

333
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,545
I'll just cross that
off my list, then.

334
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,340
I haven't ruled out
workplace romance.

335
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,216
Romance does
give you motive.

336
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,595
Somebody always loving somebody
they shouldn't be loving.

337
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,194
Is that for your aunts?

338
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:05,641
Extra vanilla.

339
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:08,020
<i>Olive Snook
discovered it wasn't vanilla</i>

340
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,530
<i>while delivering pie
to Chuck's aunts.</i>

341
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,318
<i>It wasn't the only secret
she would discover that night.</i>

342
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:16,790
<i>The high doses
of herbal mood enhancers</i>

343
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,808
<i>not only caused
particularly vivid side effects,</i>

344
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:22,249
<i>but they also prompted
a confession.</i>

345
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,383
I'm Charlotte's mother.

346
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:27,539
<i>It was a confession not even
Lily's sister, Vivian, had heard,</i>

347
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,910
<i>and to ensure that she never would,</i>

348
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,935
<i>Lily banished Olive
from their lives.</i>

349
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,886
<i>Since both Chuck and her mother
were supposed to be dead,</i>

350
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,034
<i>neither could know
the other was alive.</i>

351
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,738
I don't know
if Betty killed Kentucky

352
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:42,257
or if she didn't kill Kentucky,
but I know this.

353
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,403
Betty knows something
about something.

354
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:47,058
- I'll give Betty a shakedown tomorrow.
- No. No shaking.

355
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,955
What if someone from Betty's Bees
finds out you're a spy?

356
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:52,773
Spying is a lot like sabotage
in that they kill you for it.

357
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,507
That's what you do with spies
and saboteur, you kill them.

358
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:58,653
And you don't feel bad
because they're spying and sabotaging.

359
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:00,625
They're not gonna kill me
during office hours.

360
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:01,405
Yeah.

361
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:03,867
Stop trying to spook
my inside man.

362
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:06,206
- You could die.
- And you're already dead.

363
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:07,788
Told you she wasn't dead.

364
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,962
If I could breathe,
I would vomit.

365
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,340
Olive Snook,

366
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,634
every week a delicious life-giving pie,
and then nothing for months.

367
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:23,223
I thought you were dead,
and so soon after Charlotte.

368
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:25,306
I was beginning to take
everyone's dying personally.

369
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,717
We would have called,
but by the time I knew we were coming,

370
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,309
Vivian was already on the bus.

371
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,876
Lily was very tenacious.

372
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:33,950
She tried to get me to come home
in six consecutive stops.

373
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,558
She insisted on coming all this way

374
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,444
just to ask
why you stopped delivering pies.

375
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,930
I'm...

376
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,615
... really flaky.

377
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,951
- That's what I told her!
- It's not about the pies,

378
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,662
although the pies were always
lovely and so vivid.

379
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:52,147
I got to go get
somebody's, uh, something.

380
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,181
Get outta here.

381
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:04,668
They're here because you stopped
delivering their special pies.

382
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,763
All this time I've been making
them, and what...

383
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,494
Dosing them with God knows what

384
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,581
you claim that is vanilla,
but that ain't vanilla.

385
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:13,145
I'm gonna dose the both of y'all
with a scoop of shut-the-fudge-up.

386
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,813
<i>The weight of kept secrets</i>

387
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:17,983
<i>had become unbearable
for the pint-sized pie slinger.</i>

388
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,028
Why won't you talk to me?
I thought you were my friend.

389
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:22,696
Like I said, flaky.

390
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:24,406
I got something to say.

391
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:27,564
I'm gonna say it to you
and you and you and your hump.

392
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:29,549
<i>Olive wanted to let loose</i>

393
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:32,956
<i>the secrets and lies
she'd been force-fed by her friends...</i>

394
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:36,453
<i>That Chuck was still alive,
that Lily was her mother.</i>

395
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:39,406
<i>But instead
what came out was this...</i>

396
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:51,071
What's gotten into you?

397
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,977
I am a sawed-off shotgun
full of secrets!

398
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:57,280
- Did she say she was armed?
- No, I don't have a gun. I am a gun.

399
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,443
At any moment, truth buckshot
could come spewing out of my muzzle.

400
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,453
- Look out!
- That's enough.

401
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:05,322
Truer words were never spoken.

402
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,713
This rifle is gonna go away
in a little satin-lined case

403
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:10,797
with the trigger locked
and the safety on.

404
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:13,080
I quit.
I'm quitting you.

405
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,732
And... and this.

406
00:19:15,424 --> 00:19:17,312
And, you know, all of this.

407
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:20,294
Olive, you don't have to quit.
You have to calm down.

408
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:22,172
You want a drink?
Lily, hand me your purse.

409
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,495
I'm not thirsty.

410
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,640
I'm tendering my resignation

411
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:33,022
and resigning my tenders

412
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:35,987
to the cold, harsh reality

413
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,302
of what's not meant to be.

414
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:40,999
But you can't just leave.

415
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:44,611
Vivian, go wait outside.

416
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,730
- But...
- Haven't you caused enough trouble?

417
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:51,892
This is your home.
Where will you... go?

418
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:55,639
I know a place.

419
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,528
Aunt Vivian used to always say

420
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:10,178
there's nothing sadder
than an empty birdcage.

421
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,214
- Is Olive ever gonna come home?
- She didn't say... Wouldn't say.

422
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,405
She said her apartment was paid
till the end of the year,

423
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,604
and she asked me
to water her plants.

424
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:19,871
I feel like I broke her.

425
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:23,734
I enlisted her to spy on my aunts
and then turned her into a

426
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,069
homeopathic drug mule.

427
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,155
What kind of homeopathic drugs
was she muling?

428
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:32,724
I baked antidepressants into their pies
to try to get them out of the house.

429
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:36,079
Something I've always wanted to do when
I was alive, but I never had the chance.

430
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:38,233
I... guess it worked?

431
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,084
I got them out of the house.
Olive got them out of the house.

432
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:43,639
They got out of the house.

433
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:47,054
Aunt Vivian took the bus.
She never takes the bus.

434
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,218
She thinks it's too intimate.

435
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,012
I wish there was a way
I could thank Olive.

436
00:20:53,073 --> 00:20:55,349
You know, today was my first day
at Betty's Bees,

437
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:57,174
and that was my first
job interview ever.

438
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:59,353
I mean, I haven't gone anywhere
with my life,

439
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:01,021
and this is my second one.

440
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:02,884
All I have is a fake resume

441
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:05,115
filled with things
I've never even done.

442
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:07,347
I mean,
I've never even lived alone.

443
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,013
- How long did you live alone?
- Long enough.

444
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:13,254
Don't you think that's odd? I think
that's really odd. My entire life.

445
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:16,574
My aunts swept in the moment my dad died
and then you swept in the moment I died.

446
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,830
You're thinking about
living here now, aren't you?

447
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:20,870
Yeah.

448
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:24,152
Well, you hate corduroy
and sleigh-bell slippers,

449
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:28,422
I'll stop walking in on you doing things
you don't want me to know you're doing.

450
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:30,633
It'd never have happened
if you had your slippers on.

451
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:33,178
- It'll be romantic.
- I'm confused. More.

452
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,811
- More?
- More of an explanation.

453
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:37,641
How is it romantic? You've got a job
and now you're moving out?

454
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:39,963
But I didn't get a job.

455
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:42,454
I'm undercover Kitty,
and I'm not moving out.

456
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:43,839
I'm just moving next door.

457
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:47,948
I mean, it's french.
It's very first-class Parisian living.

458
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:49,861
You know,
his-and-hers suites

459
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:51,800
and coy midnight knocks on the door

460
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,241
- to share a lover's boudoir.
- You'll be knocking?

461
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:55,450
You can knock, too.

462
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:58,492
<i>This was not romantic
for the pie maker.</i>

463
00:21:58,522 --> 00:21:59,360
Yay.

464
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:00,786
Knocking.

465
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:04,654
Where's Olive?

466
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:09,116
<i>Olive Snook was
where Lily had taken her.</i>

467
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,979
<i>It was a place that valued
Olive's silence as much as Lily did.</i>

468
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:45,128
Hello, Betty!

469
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,335
A little bee tells me
you've met Kitty Pimms.

470
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:48,670
Briefly.

471
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:52,504
Well, this morning Kitty says to me,
she says, "I want to speak to Betty Bee.

472
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:55,096
Bee-girl to bee-girl, tell her
how much she means to me."

473
00:22:55,261 --> 00:22:56,260
Bless.

474
00:22:57,363 --> 00:23:00,154
And, if there's a lull
in the conversation,

475
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:02,673
you just ask Kitty
why she loves bees.

476
00:23:03,185 --> 00:23:04,394
You'll be glad you did.

477
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:06,045
Thank you.

478
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,192
Betty, look. I know Kentucky was
your number-one bee-girl,

479
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,870
and I'm not looking to replace her.
I just want to live up to her standard

480
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,820
of honey harvesting
and sales excellence.

481
00:23:14,316 --> 00:23:17,156
You're not really going to stand there
and kiss my ass, are you?

482
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:18,962
Or didn't Woolsey tell you?

483
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:20,876
- He didn't.
- How politic.

484
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,146
- Tell me what?
- Woolsey's acquisition

485
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,664
was a hostile takeover.

486
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:26,813
No, he didn't mention
the hostile part.

487
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:28,744
Oh, yes.
The ass you were just kissing

488
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,338
is now just the ass
of a retired honey mascot.

489
00:23:31,884 --> 00:23:33,131
That's my new title:

490
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,095
Honey mascot/consultant.

491
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:37,260
It used to be founder
and president.

492
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,697
That would make me
stinging mad.

493
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:43,850
I get to keep my old office,
just not my dignity.

494
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:47,395
When all of your bees die,
it's hard to care about any of it.

495
00:23:47,924 --> 00:23:49,397
All your bees died?

496
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,340
The colony collapsed.
Mites might have caused it.

497
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,820
In fact, we know they did.
Took over every hive

498
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:57,214
not long after Woolsey
took over Betty's Bees.

499
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:01,326
Might almost be poetic if...
It didn't suck so much.

500
00:24:01,658 --> 00:24:05,628
<i>Kentucky didn't sabotage
Betty's Bees with a lot of might.</i>

501
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:07,992
<i>She sabotaged Betty's Bees with...</i>

502
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:09,918
A lot of mites.

503
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,204
It would take a lot of mites
to cause a colony collapse.

504
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,445
Sure does.

505
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:17,321
I grew up with generations
of those bees.

506
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:20,523
The first hive was...

507
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:23,348
an infestation in the corner
of my bedroom.

508
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,737
I was 5.

509
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,040
I tried to kill it.

510
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:33,248
I was stopped. Mother was a methodist,
and daddy was a pragmatist, so...

511
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:36,140
God put those bees there
for a reason.

512
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:38,113
They were right.

513
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:41,543
You lived with bees?
That sounds magical.

514
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,688
We called it the honey house.

515
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:47,068
The honey house
is empty now.

516
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:49,240
We left together, me and the bees.

517
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:53,044
Those bees built Betty's Bees.

518
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,339
What happened to those bees?
Could it be sabotage?

519
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,675
A conspiracy?

520
00:24:58,736 --> 00:24:59,975
How dramatic.

521
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,096
You think someone
intentionally murdered my bees.

522
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:06,338
- Just a thought.
- It wasn't sabotage, Kitty.

523
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,804
Sometimes bad things just happen.

524
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:14,103
<i>Unbeknownst to Chuck,
a.k.a. Kitty Pimms,</i>

525
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:18,483
<i>something bad was about to
"just happen" to her.</i>

526
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,492
Did Kentucky talk
about colony collapse?

527
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,233
Is it upsetting? She tends not to tell
me things if they might be upsetting.

528
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:28,139
It's when a beehive
becomes inhospitable.

529
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:29,908
In this case, infested with mites.

530
00:25:29,938 --> 00:25:32,722
Then all the bees fly away to die.
It's a natural phenomenon.

531
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:35,712
Except when a bee company gets
bought out by its chief rival

532
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,279
and its star employee dead,

533
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:39,257
then maybe it don't happen
so naturally.

534
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:42,941
See, Kentucky.
She was sabotaging Betty's Bees,

535
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:45,969
which took a lot of might, as in effort,
and a lot of mites, as in pests.

536
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:48,098
She was infecting the hives.

537
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,267
Somebody found out,
and they killed her for it.

538
00:25:50,328 --> 00:25:52,312
How do you know
she was sabotaging anything?

539
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:54,022
She confessed.

540
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,941
Before she died.
But... not to us,

541
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:59,736
but to a reliable source,
who wishes to remain anonymous.

542
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,655
Is your reliable source
Betty Bee?

543
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,245
- What makes you say that?
- Kentucky was very close with Betty.

544
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:08,211
They were like sisters until someone
asked Kentucky to be the new Betty.

545
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:11,439
I know it must be very hard to learn
that your wife was killed because

546
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,785
of sabotage, but at least
she wasn't cheating on you.

547
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:16,543
She loved you very, very much,
and she'd never hurt you.

548
00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:18,720
She was the only family I ever had.

549
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:21,684
You know that I liked
and liked me.

550
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:25,076
If I was more comfortable
with you people, I'd cry.

551
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:26,957
- Oh, you can cry. It's okay.
- Thanks.

552
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:30,600
It is not okay
for a grown-ass man to weep in public

553
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:32,644
with a bunch of happy families
enjoying pie.

554
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:39,720
If you can't hold it, you take
your ass to the men's room

555
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,034
and cry in private on the toilet...

556
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:45,165
- Like a man!
- I need to use the men's room.

557
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,578
Look, I know where Betty put the key.
I can get it tomorrow.

558
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:51,542
She's not gonna stay
in her office all day.

559
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:55,500
What?

560
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:58,359
I thought you was gonna start
squawking about how dangerous

561
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:00,213
it'd be to go back. Squawk, squawk.

562
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,958
I'm not gonna wag my finger
if that's what you expect.

563
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,770
It's Chuck's life,
and she can live it however she'd like.

564
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:08,563
I can't expect her to sit
inside all day and...

565
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:10,640
- Hide!
- No, I don't need to...

566
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,975
Woman, hide your ass!

567
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:17,689
Vivian. I didn't know you were here.

568
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,075
We're just closing up.

569
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,901
There.
All closed.

570
00:27:22,962 --> 00:27:26,027
- There's still people inside.
- Cleaning crew. How are you?

571
00:27:26,216 --> 00:27:29,339
To be honest, I wasn't craving
pie, I was craving company.

572
00:27:29,537 --> 00:27:30,868
Lily absconded with herself.

573
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:33,550
First time in 30 years
I don't know where she is.

574
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,957
I didn't know where else to go.

575
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,365
It's all right.

576
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:39,183
I'm sure Lily will be back.

577
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:40,250
Oh, yes.

578
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,158
Though I don't know
about Olive,

579
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:44,131
and then, of course,
there's Charlotte.

580
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:48,101
Everyone seems to be leaving me.
Home is my haven now.

581
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:51,556
Everything there just reminds me
of everything not there.

582
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:54,363
Chuck.
I mean... Charlotte.

583
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:56,586
Her room is how she left it...

584
00:27:56,616 --> 00:27:59,757
Clothes in the closet,
her books on the shelves...

585
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:02,442
Her special pillow
still at the head of the bed.

586
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:04,762
I didn't know
she had a special pillow.

587
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:05,987
It was her father's.

588
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:08,137
I'm sure it's teeming
with fungus

589
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:10,858
and microscopic bugs
that feed on flakes of human skin,

590
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,243
but she was fond of it.

591
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:15,587
I know you loved having
Charlotte safe at home,

592
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:20,460
smiling on the other side of the room,
but she's gone. She's moved out.

593
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,371
I mean, on.
She's moved on.

594
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,915
Maybe it's time for you
to move on

595
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:30,762
and... get rid of that pillow.

596
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:36,413
<i>As the pie maker
considered Chuck's worldly belongings</i>

597
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:38,466
<i>and how Vivian clinged to them...</i>

598
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:41,414
<i>... Olive was clinging to her own.</i>

599
00:28:41,711 --> 00:28:42,819
Excuse me.

600
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:45,315
Mother superior?

601
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:49,238
I have been here for a day

602
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,324
and was told the porter
would come for my things.

603
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:53,701
Do I need to tell him
what room I'm in?

604
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:56,889
The poor, sister.
The poor will come for your belongings.

605
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,373
Part of your vow of poverty.

606
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,667
I thought that was
a temporary vow

607
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,377
since I'm only gonna be
a temporary nun.

608
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:06,005
Don't you have some kind
of storage facility?

609
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:10,117
This is your home
for as long as you're here,

610
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:13,439
and as long as you're here,
you will live as a nun.

611
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:15,340
But I like my belongings.

612
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,811
That's why they belong to me.

613
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,269
I want to be poor in other ways.

614
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:22,962
We offer sanctuary,

615
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:24,774
but it doesn't come
without a price.

616
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:26,986
Work hard,
and you will see results.

617
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,224
Commit yourself,

618
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:30,113
and you may even find
that you wish to stay.

619
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:34,077
Like a gym membership.
I can cancel at any time?

620
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:35,465
God...

621
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:39,122
in his wisdom,
has led you here.

622
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,582
Take refuge and hide...

623
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:42,959
your secret from the world.

624
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:45,422
And once your baby is born,

625
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,836
you can return
to the outside world.

626
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:51,346
Hold that pregnant pause.

627
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,034
I'm not with child.

628
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:55,103
Unless it's immaculate conception

629
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:56,893
or I wore a strange man's underwear.

630
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:59,809
I just assumed
based on who brought you here.

631
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,145
This is where Lily came
to have Chuck?

632
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:04,973
Here come the poor.

633
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:08,902
Come, help yourselves.
Help yourselves.

634
00:30:08,963 --> 00:30:10,531
- No, I...
- Look at this.

635
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:13,444
No. I... Look at that beautiful case.
I really am. I'll just take this.

636
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,314
What a surprise that'll be
when you get home.

637
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:17,049
Hey, listen, poor kid.
You get...

638
00:30:20,412 --> 00:30:21,362
My couch.

639
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:23,883
Is Betty in?

640
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:26,044
She's on a call.
Can I take a message?

641
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:30,363
- Ned, what are you doing here?
- Filing, fielding calls, making coffee.

642
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:32,050
What happened
to Betty's old assistant?

643
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:34,882
He had to... scoot.

644
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:37,378
<i>What happened to Giancarlo was this.</i>

645
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:39,178
<i>After eating a slice of pie</i>

646
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:42,984
<i>from what he believed
was a secret admirer in accounting,</i>

647
00:30:43,014 --> 00:30:45,956
<i>Giancarlo experienced
what could best be described</i>

648
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:49,324
<i>as extreme intestinal distress.</i>

649
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,319
You pruned his pie?

650
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,737
Sent him home with the scoots.
Then I hid in human resources,

651
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,819
waited for them to call
Happy Time temp agency,

652
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:58,335
then I called Happy Time temp agency,
canceled the order,

653
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:01,120
and showed up with a smile
and a pleasant attitude.

654
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:04,082
I think that's the most
romantic thing I've ever heard.

655
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:07,126
He is stalking you.

656
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,504
<i>You don't think
I'm stalking you?</i>

657
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:12,810
I'd be a hypocrite to judge you
for dosing someone's pie.

658
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,217
Why?
Are you stalking me?

659
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:16,624
That depends. Now that we're living
our new Parisian lifestyle,

660
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:18,854
does that mean I can't be close
when danger's afoot?

661
00:31:18,884 --> 00:31:20,566
I feel safer now that you're here.

662
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:22,717
Then this isn't stalking.

663
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,478
It's just good,
old-fashioned chivalry.

664
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:31,154
Walk with me.

665
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,017
Cancel all my appointments.
I'm leaving early.

666
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:35,452
I've got one more thing to do.

667
00:31:35,482 --> 00:31:37,425
Have my car waiting
for me downstairs.

668
00:31:37,838 --> 00:31:40,995
<i>With the pie maker
serving the perfect distraction...</i>

669
00:31:42,632 --> 00:31:45,789
<i>Chuck beelined
for the stolen bee key.</i>

670
00:31:51,147 --> 00:31:53,840
<i>She found the bee key
exactly where Betty Bee put it.</i>

671
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:57,517
<i>Then she made an equally
important discovery...</i>

672
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,846
<i>Of a different kind...</i>

673
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:05,616
<i>... before she herself
was discovered.</i>

674
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,385
Chuck!

675
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:21,425
I told you this was dangerous. Just
because you're alive again doesn't mean

676
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:23,493
you can't die again.
There's a reason I don't let

677
00:32:23,523 --> 00:32:25,065
Digby play in traffic.

678
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:27,438
I suppose
we can talk about this later.

679
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,170
Why are you point-
Why is she pointing at me?

680
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,080
Why you - Why you
rolling her toward me?!

681
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,841
Because you're in front of the door!

682
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,337
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.

683
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:44,757
Don't offend the bees.
Don't offend the bees.

684
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:57,987
What happened to you?

685
00:32:58,048 --> 00:32:59,800
<i>What happened was this.</i>

686
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,780
<i>The beeman
was not composed of bees.</i>

687
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,180
<i>The drones nested
around their queen,</i>

688
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,900
<i>safe inside the beeman's mouth.</i>

689
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:12,080
When he spat the queen,

690
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,079
She signaled her drones to
attack any perceived predator.

691
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:17,300
<i>But unlike Kentucky Fitz,</i>

692
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,343
<i>Chuck kept a cool head
and an open mouth.</i>

693
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:24,348
<i>She was not perceived as a predator,
but a nest.</i>

694
00:33:25,891 --> 00:33:26,910
Look.

695
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:28,999
That's Betty Bee
as a little girl.

696
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,270
Well, either she was
an unfortunately hairy child.

697
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,898
Or Betty Bee is
the terrifying beeman.

698
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,357
Wasn't she with you?

699
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:38,619
She didn't get off the elevator with me.
She must have come back up here to...

700
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,800
... wiggety whack
you for being a spy.

701
00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:43,045
Like she wiggety-whacked Kentucky.

702
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:46,306
Well, my wiggety wasn't whacked.
And I got the bee key.

703
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:49,040
- That's a house key.
- I know what house it goes to.

704
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,000
<i>As Chuck followed
the bee key that was key,</i>

705
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,470
<i>Olive Snook followed
her homesick heart to the confessional.</i>

706
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:57,900
Forgive me, father,

707
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,059
for I am going
to file a police report

708
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,100
on all my worldly possessions.

709
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,400
I know it's greedy and wrathful,
But there's been a miscommunication.

710
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:09,072
And since we're discussing it,

711
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,102
I'm not really belonging here.

712
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,897
I knew you'd lapse.

713
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:15,860
You!

714
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,070
You have some crust
coming in here like that.

715
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,493
How long have you been lurking?

716
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:22,200
I've been lurking
since you walked through those gates.

717
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,663
I had to make sure
you didn't get any ideas

718
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:26,670
in that nubb of yours
about leaving.

719
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,403
It's your fault I'm here.

720
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,873
You and your damn,
Hail, Mary, secrets!

721
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,000
I spent so much time praying,
I've run out of things to say.

722
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:37,300
I'm having awkward
silences with God!

723
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,070
I want to go home.

724
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,800
Where's home?

725
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,342
Back to slinging pies?

726
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,303
Where you spend every waking minute

727
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:49,265
praying that the man you worship
will show you some sign of his love?

728
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,100
You can do that here...

729
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,100
And commiserate.

730
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,270
These nuns aren't my people.

731
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,850
Unless you're telling me
"flibbertigibbet" is a title of respect.

732
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,500
You know things
about me nobody knows.

733
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,781
This place knows things
about me nobody knows.

734
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:08,570
Like that you holidayed here 30 years
ago and found a baby in a cabbage patch.

735
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,036
And by "cabbage patch,"

736
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,779
I mean your lady parts.

737
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:15,541
Vivian can never know about that.
She thought I was in Paris,

738
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,899
apprenticing
in a world-Class fromagerie.

739
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:19,500
Why don't you just tell her?

740
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,891
Charlotte's father, my lover,

741
00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:25,551
was Vivian's fiancé.

742
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:31,474
You did not just tell me
another secret!

743
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,850
You're a homewrecker, too!

744
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,600
- Jiminy Crispy.
- Don't "Jiminy Crispy" me.

745
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:38,981
Chuck thinks her mother died
during childbirth.

746
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:40,971
I mean, according
to Vivian, Chuck...

747
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,777
Charlotte thought
her mother died during childbirth.

748
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:45,869
Well, it doesn't matter
what Charlotte thought.

749
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:46,886
She's dead now.

750
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:50,300
Look at you all pious.

751
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,415
You'd think you'd fit right
in a nunnery.

752
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,136
Hell, it might even
do you some good.

753
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,916
Who are you -
The Good-For-Me police?

754
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,170
Oh, come on.

755
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,070
That epic tanty you pitched
back at the pie hole.

756
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,480
That wasn't all my doing.

757
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,870
I realize I have
some men issues to sort out.

758
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:08,600
So, sort them out.

759
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:12,300
Sort them out here,
where men won't be an issue.

760
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:16,504
Stay as long as you like...
until your head is clear.

761
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:20,570
<i>But Olive feared Lily's idea
of "as long as you like"</i>

762
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,249
<i>was considerably longer than hers.</i>

763
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,670
<i>39 miles away,
north by northeast,</i>

764
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,270
<i>the private detective,
the pie maker, and Chuck</i>

765
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,300
<i>climbed a windy road
to the childhood home of Betty Bee,</i>

766
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,800
<i>a home that was supposed
to be vacant.</i>

767
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,900
<i>But the home
was not vacant at all.</i>

768
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,500
That colony collapse was a hoax.

769
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,200
Her bees didn't die. She stole them.

770
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,304
Damn.

771
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:55,500
You know, suddenly a crazy cat lady
don't seem so crazy no more.

772
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,370
So Kentucky helped Betty
steal Betty's Bees,

773
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,926
they fake a colony collapse,

774
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:04,170
and get away with conspiracy,
sabotage, and grand theft.

775
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,860
But why would
Betty want to kill Kentucky?

776
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:08,700
Maybe she didn't kill Kentucky.

777
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,870
Woolsey handpicked Kentucky
to be the new face of Betty's Bees,

778
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,200
and then she betrayed him.

779
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,170
Yep, she sabotaged his company
and stole his bees.

780
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,000
She played him
like Boo-Boo the fool.

781
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,100
Boo-Boo had it coming.

782
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:24,800
Woolsey tells me I'm too old

783
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,600
and slaps my name
on an inferior product.

784
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:30,370
Did you know there's
now 60% less honey

785
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,494
in all Betty's Bees' honey-based
products, including honey?

786
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,837
Fine. He wants the company,
he can have it.

787
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,729
But I'll be damned
if he can have my bees.

788
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:39,416
Hello, Kitty.

789
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,770
And you.
You're not a temp.

790
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:43,570
Who are you people?

791
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,799
We're private investigators hired by
Kentucky's husband to find her killer.

792
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:49,500
There is no killer.
That's what the police told me.

793
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:51,900
Can't prosecute
a swarm of bees for murder.

794
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,800
You can prosecute Woolsey Nicholls.

795
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
I loved Kentucky like a sister.

796
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,570
But if I told the police
that Woolsey killed her

797
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,279
because we were
sabotaging his company,

798
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:03,337
I would go to jail a lot longer
than Woolsey ever would for murder.

799
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,961
Jail might be a safer place for you.

800
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,770
Betty, I was attacked
in your office by a swarm of bees,

801
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,298
and those bees were meant for you.

802
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:12,365
If you loved her like a sister, you have
to tell the police what you know.

803
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:15,366
- You can't let him get away.
- Woolsey is gonna get away with murder.

804
00:38:15,396 --> 00:38:17,598
Unless you can pull
his DNA off one of those bees.

805
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,984
Please don't get up.
Allow me to introduce myself.

806
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:26,870
My name is Emerson Cod,
private investigator.

807
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,460
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about the murder of Kentucky Fitz.

808
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,970
Kentucky wasn't murdered.

809
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,600
The swarm chased her to her car
all the way from the colony.

810
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,683
That swarm followed her
all the way from you,

811
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:39,536
and you tried to kill Betty
the same way, except that wasn't her.

812
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:42,470
This is the Queen-Bee case that you spat
at me while covered in bees.

813
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,100
We found it outside
Betty's office under a swarm.

814
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,088
And if we tested it for spittle,
I'm sure we'd find plenty of yours.

815
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,700
Well, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

816
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
<i>The facts were these:</i>

817
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,900
<i>Woolsey Nicholls was madly
in love with Kentucky Fitz.</i>

818
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,000
<i>The operative word was "madly."</i>

819
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:12,199
<i>Betty Bee was a withered hag by the mere
fact that she wasn't Kentucky.</i>

820
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:15,670
<i>Shortly after Kentucky gratefully
accepted Woolsey's offer</i>

821
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,400
<i>to become the new face
of Betty's Bees,</i>

822
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,570
<i>he discovered
her gratitude was insincere</i>

823
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,443
<i>and her intention was sabotage.</i>

824
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:28,500
<i>Infected bees were found
in Kentucky's possession.</i>

825
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,199
<i>She was smuggling mite-infested
bees into his new colony.</i>

826
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,570
<i>Betrayed and brokenhearted,
but not sloppy,</i>

827
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,970
<i>Woolsey dealt with Kentucky
using a means</i>

828
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,500
<i>that would also imply
accidental death.</i>

829
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:46,470
<i>Woolsey Nicholls confessed
to the murder of Kentucky Fitz</i>

830
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,100
<i>and attempted murder of Betty Bee.</i>

831
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,900
<i>He never knew
the colony collapse was a hoax</i>

832
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,600
<i>or that Betty
had stolen back her bees.</i>

833
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,900
<i>Since Kentucky Fitz
was like a sister to Betty Bee,</i>

834
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,970
<i>Betty Bee was like
a sister to Dusty Fitz</i>

835
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,100
<i>and made him her new partner.</i>

836
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,681
<i>Realizing that his colony
had not collapsed,</i>

837
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:10,752
<i>but had merely expanded
into his-and-her suites,</i>

838
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,400
<i>the pie maker labored to make
Chuck's suite feel like home.</i>

839
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,600
Are those my books?

840
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:22,972
And my furniture and...

841
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,300
My special pillow.

842
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,200
How?

843
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,300
Welcome home.

844
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,400
<i>And so the pie maker
had come to understand</i>

845
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,821
<i>home did not mean four walls
and a door you never walk out of.</i>

846
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,700
<i>Home was a feeling
of where you belong.</i>

847
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,400
<i>For Emerson Cod,
home was "Lil' Gum Shoe,"</i>

848
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,100
<i>the tale of a girl
whose father couldn't find her,</i>

849
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,100
<i>so she had to find him.</i>

850
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,270
<i>Mr. Cod insists
it's a work of fiction.</i>

851
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,370
<i>But if published,</i>

852
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,394
<i>it could serve as a how-to manual
for an audience of one.</i>

853
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,100
<i>For Olive Snook,</i>

854
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,577
<i>home was the place
she hoped to find herself</i>

855
00:41:09,607 --> 00:41:14,018
<i>and perhaps find new friends
with not so many secrets.</i>

856
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:15,200
Hiya, Pigby.

857
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:20,400
<i>For lonely tourist
Charlotte Charles, a.k.a. Chuck,</i>

858
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,742
<i>Home was where the pie maker was.</i>

859
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,070
<i>And this home was a place</i>

860
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,500
<i>the pie maker's father,
who abandoned him, would return to...</i>

never knew he was there.</i>
