Pushing Daisies - Season 02 Episode 05
"Dim Sum, Lose Some"

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:07,238
Subtitle (XOR v.1.00): <i>A²S Team</i>
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

3
00:00:07,784 --> 00:00:12,062
<i>Long weekends at the Longborough
school for boys were a quiet time,</i>

4
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,729
<i>as most children went home
to their families.</i>

5
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:19,149
<i>There were those students, however,
who gathered not out of friendship,</i>

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,729
<i>but because they had
nowhere else to go.</i>

7
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:25,636
<i>Young Ned found himself
a member of this elite group.</i>

8
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:30,495
<i>Ingmar Todd was the son
of roving missionaries.</i>

9
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,076
<i>As there was very little else to do,</i>

10
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:36,116
<i>Ingmar's room became
a center of activity.</i>

11
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,214
Place your bets, gentlemen.

12
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,051
<i>He had arrived at boarding school</i>

13
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:44,292
<i>with a professionally certified
and balanced roulette wheel</i>

14
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,516
<i>and a tawny owl named Casper.</i>

15
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:50,645
<i>All young Ned had to wager
was the box of chocolates</i>

16
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:52,988
<i>he'd hastily snuck
into his suitcase</i>

17
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,650
<i>the day his father dropped him off
at boarding school.</i>

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,157
<i>It was then he noticed the note
tucked into the box.</i>

19
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:05,766
<i>He realized the individually
wrapped chocolates currently in play</i>

20
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:08,414
<i>had been intended as a gift to him</i>

21
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:10,539
<i>from his dearly departed mother.</i>

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,683
Bets are closed.

23
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:19,299
<i>Like many beginning players,
young Ned bet on both red and black</i>

24
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:23,479
<i>but failed to consider
the double zero on the wheel.</i>

25
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:24,835
Double zed.

26
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,141
House wins.

27
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,048
<i>He lost everything.</i>

28
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:29,845
<i>The lesson was clear...</i>

29
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:33,252
<i>In gambling, no matter how well
you think you know the odds,</i>

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,390
<i>there's always an outcome
you can't see coming.</i>

31
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,485
<i>During the years that followed,</i>

32
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,037
<i>the pie maker avoided
taking gambles,</i>

33
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,583
<i>with a few notable exceptions.</i>

34
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:46,213
<i>He invested his life savings
in a bakery</i>

35
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:50,326
<i>at a time when carbohydrates
had fallen completely out of fashion,</i>

36
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:52,028
<i>and, more importantly,</i>

37
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:55,353
<i>he had gambled on the love
of his childhood sweetheart,</i>

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,941
<i>the girl next door
who had returned from the dead.</i>

39
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:00,766
Try this.

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,300
- Like the fork.
- Like being alive.

41
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:07,805
It's a new flavor, spring passion fruit.
Now, I know it's not spring here,

42
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:10,660
but it is in New Zealand,
which is exotic and upside down,

43
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,113
which is how we could serve it.

44
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:13,210
<i>Betting on Chuck</i>

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,737
<i>had made the pie maker happier
than he had ever been.</i>

46
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,983
- We'll put it on the menu.
- I like Daring Ned.

47
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,987
It seems since you arrived,
Cautious Ned has left the building.

48
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:24,989
Who's the new guy in the booth?

49
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:27,950
The handsome, brooding older man
with a sensual twinkle?

50
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:29,536
Plus, he smells good.

51
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:33,414
He mumbled something odd
to me earlier.

52
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:36,489
<i>There was no word
that completely described the feeling</i>

53
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:39,753
<i>the square-shouldered older man
had given the pie maker.</i>

54
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:41,833
Do you ever shiver when you pee?

55
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:43,997
That's how I felt when he spoke.

56
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,982
- More coffee?
- Thanks.

57
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:49,264
Pie is delicious.
As good as your mother's.

58
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,860
He said that?

59
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,333
- Did he know your mother?
- I didn't ask.

60
00:02:56,363 --> 00:02:58,129
A stranger says
a strange thing in passing,

61
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,316
chances are I misheard him
or misunderstood.

62
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,525
Maybe when he said
"your mother's pie",

63
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,537
he didn't mean my mother,
he meant everyone's mother...

64
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:08,827
the iconic all-American mother
created by advertisers and politicians

65
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:12,850
as a shorthand for family values
and a longing for baked goods.

66
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:14,987
Would that make you shiver?

67
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:17,085
If someone said something
to me about my family,

68
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:20,044
it would give me the piss-jitters,
but I'd ask him, not hide in a kitchen.

69
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:21,336
I'm not hiding.

70
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,549
I think he's cute.

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,892
I'm... probably making a mountain
out of a molehill

72
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,904
over a random comment
I probably misheard,

73
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:39,162
and I'm hoping to offset any awkwardness
you are or will be feeling

74
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:42,158
by providing your slice
of three-plum on the house.

75
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,794
You're a nervous talker...
Like your dad.

76
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:48,156
This complicates things.
You may need to pay for the pie.

77
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:50,488
Look. Dwight Dixon.

78
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,897
I was a friend of your father
25 years ago.

79
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,977
I mean, you are Ned, am I right?

80
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,191
Nope.

81
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,942
Yes, you are, silly.

82
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,323
- Hi. I'm Olive.
- Hi, Olive.

83
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:02,937
- I'm Kitty. Kitty Pimms.
- Nice to meet you.

84
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,048
So you knew Ned's parents?

85
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,467
Yeah, back,
when they were dating.

86
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,594
It was the peak of peach season.

87
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,889
She baked a brown-sugar crust.
Your dad didn't have a chance.

88
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:14,223
They never mentioned you.

89
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:17,352
Oh, I was in the service with your dad,
back before you were born.

90
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,395
You know what?
Your dad didn't like to reminisce.

91
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:21,522
Probably a lot of things
he didn't talk about.

92
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,569
Sounds familiar.

93
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:26,149
I'm actually trying to find him.
I was hoping you could help.

94
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:27,905
Really love to see him.

95
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,146
You got his face, you know,
especially around the eyes.

96
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,270
<i>The pie maker had hoped
never to be likened to his father,</i>

97
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,927
- <i>whether it be around the eyes...</i>
- I'm afraid we lost touch...

98
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:40,248
- <i>... or the heart.</i>
- ... 20 years ago.

99
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:41,759
Oh, that's a shame.

100
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:44,561
- Any thoughts on where I might look?
- Nope.

101
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:47,037
And though you're obviously speaking
from a good and helpful place,

102
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,631
it's not good and helpful...

103
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:49,676
to me, so...

104
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,972
<i>As Chuck marveled
at the pie maker's refusal</i>

105
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,131
<i>to help search
for his only parent,</i>

106
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:58,642
<i>Emerson Cod marveled
at the digestive coma</i>

107
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,670
<i>produced by beef balls
and curried cuttlefish</i>

108
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,238
<i>from the </i>Dim Sum<i> restaurant
downstairs.</i>

109
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,397
<i>His phone silenced,</i>

110
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,269
<i>Emerson knew the world
of clients and murders</i>

111
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:13,074
<i>would soon be lost in the cloud
of a power nap.</i>

112
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:16,286
What the hell?

113
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:28,503
<i>Arriving downstairs
in search of a new case,</i>

114
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:31,134
<i>the PI stumbled on one
from his past...</i>

115
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:35,625
<i>Simone Hundin,
obedience expert</i>

116
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:39,546
<i> and widow of deceased, polygamous
dog breeder Harold Hundin.</i>

117
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:42,123
<i>While investigating
her husband's murder,</i>

118
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:45,630
<i>Emerson and Simone
had forged a close bond.</i>

119
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,710
Emerson Cod.

120
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:48,253
Simone.

121
00:05:48,786 --> 00:05:50,194
What have you been up to?

122
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,640
<i>It was a friendship
that had very nearly,</i>

123
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,992
<i>but not quite, become...</i>

124
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:55,866
Breeding.

125
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:58,128
My Bubblegum's in heat.

126
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,793
It was a long night.
Sit.

127
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:01,955
But what a treat
bumping into you.

128
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:03,833
I didn't know
you were a <i>Dim Sum</i> connoisseur.

129
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,315
Best pork buns in town.
My office is upstairs.

130
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,295
It's a dangerous combination.

131
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:09,418
Bun?

132
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,090
No, I'm really trying to...

133
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:15,681
<i>The private investigator considered
how his inescapable desire</i>

134
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:18,680
<i>to be obedient
to this obedience trainer</i>

135
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,007
<i>was at once thrilling
and terrifying.</i>

136
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:24,504
<i>Then he remembered his case.</i>

137
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,440
Hey, did you send me
a message in a cookie?

138
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,273
Wasn't me.

139
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,026
I find there are more reliable ways
to send a message.

140
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:34,125
Leave it.

141
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,824
It's been a pleasure, Mr. Cod.

142
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:39,572
Perhaps we'll cross paths again.

143
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:49,295
<i>Fortunately,</i>

144
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:52,805
<i>Emerson had a distraction
from his conflicting impulses...</i>

145
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:54,392
<i>a client.</i>

146
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:00,431
Excuse me, ma'am?

147
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,142
I'm Emerson Cod,
the private investigator from upstairs.

148
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:05,269
Did you by any chance contact me?

149
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,522
I've seen your billboards.

150
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:10,287
My name is Lai Di.

151
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:11,484
"Lady"?

152
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,069
Lai Di.

153
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm married to Bao,
the chef.

154
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:19,370
Picking up some things of his.

155
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,220
You're married to the chef?

156
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,661
Ma'am, may I just say,

157
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:25,206
your husband's pork buns
make me glad to be alive.

158
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:26,904
The man's a true artist.

159
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:28,916
Well, not anymore.

160
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,161
He's dead now. But...

161
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:34,507
I'll hire you to find
who killed him.

162
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,690
<i>The facts were these...</i>

163
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:40,429
<i>Lai Di and her husband, Bao,
immigrated from Beijing</i>

164
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:42,807
<i>with the hope of opening
their own restaurant.</i>

165
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:48,141
<i>Bao quickly established himself
as the premier authority</i>

166
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,648
<i>on the delicate art
of bun steaming.</i>

167
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,357
<i>He demanded privacy
while he worked...</i>

168
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:59,172
<i>both to eliminate distractions
and protect his unique recipes.</i>

169
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:02,326
<i>But even with his daughter
working as a waitress,</i>

170
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,809
<i>Bao could never save enough money
for his own restaurant.</i>

171
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,069
<i>It was after a 16-hour shift</i>

172
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,852
<i>that Lai Di had noticed
Bao could not sleep.</i>

173
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,813
<i>Something had him terrified.</i>

174
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:16,041
<i>Bao chose to reply in English.</i>

175
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,467
- Pressure!
- Pressure?

176
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:22,501
<i>Lai Di would remember
Bao's misgiving as ironic.</i>

177
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:28,851
<i>Police were satisfied Bao's death
had been an accident,</i>

178
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:32,424
<i>but Lai Di was convinced
there had been foul play.</i>

179
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,301
Let's be delicate.
He may not speak English.

180
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,862
And with the pipe the way it is,
I don't know if he'll speak at all.

181
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,120
You speak Chinese?

182
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,332
Watch out.

183
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:52,084
Please, don't hurt me!
I'm sorry I lose the bet!

184
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:54,341
- Look, we're not gonna hurt you!
- What bet?

185
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:57,423
Gambling at the <i>Dim Sum</i>!
Now someone's going to kill me.

186
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:58,799
Going to kill you?

187
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:01,764
I don't know how they're going to do it,
but they're going to do it for sure!

188
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:03,475
Yeah, who...
who wants to kill you?

189
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:05,056
Who were you gambling with?

190
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:07,225
I tell you that,
and I'm a dead man!

191
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,941
See, what we need now is a mirror.

192
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,721
I got to get out of here!

193
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:12,700
Bao, no! Wait!

194
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,846
<i>As it appeared
the bun steamer's buns</i>

195
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:27,304
<i>were steamed over a bet
at the </i>Dim Sum,

196
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:31,625
<i>Emerson Cod returned to the restaurant
for a chat with Bao's daughter.</i>

197
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:35,639
I don't know why my mother hired you.
My father's death was an accident.

198
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:37,780
Your mother had a hunch.

199
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:41,133
I could gold-leaf my bathroom
with what I made off mother-hunches.

200
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:43,488
And what I really need
to know is...

201
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,801
Are those the new chiu-chao dumplings?
May I?

202
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,310
Pork...

203
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:51,029
... dried shrimp.

204
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,509
Chives, mushrooms...

205
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,827
in a glutinous rice flour.

206
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:57,397
Girl, your father could make
a grown man cry.

207
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:01,168
This is Rubbie Wu, my fiancé.

208
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,030
Also manager of the Dim Sum.

209
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,533
Son, you got a hell of a restaurant.

210
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:08,429
I'm a lucky man in many ways.

211
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:12,081
Mr. Cod, right?
You work upstairs.

212
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:16,700
Cuttlefish, beef balls
and taro dumplings every Sunday at noon.

213
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:19,978
I'm sorry about your loss,

214
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:22,883
both in the human
and gastronomical sense.

215
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,984
Speaking of the genius
who was your father,

216
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:27,009
is it possible
he was he also a degenerate gambler?

217
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,514
I heard he was killed over a bet.

218
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,619
He didn't have time
for anything but work.

219
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,243
Least, as far as I know.

220
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:35,281
My father and I weren't very close.

221
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,564
What about gambling here
in the restaurant, you know,

222
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,426
with employees
or maybe customers?

223
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:41,118
We're just a <i>Dim Sum</i> restaurant.

224
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:43,350
If Bao was in trouble
'cause of gambling,

225
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,930
it didn't happen here.

226
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,587
So, it sounds like

227
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:58,523
Mei didn't seem too broken up
about dear old dead dad.

228
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,330
Didn't waste many tears.

229
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,338
That being said, I searched
the entire restaurant.

230
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:05,232
There's no basement
or secret card room or the like.

231
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:07,451
Maybe Bao meant something else
when he said he lost a bet.

232
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:10,459
Maybe Bao had a pipe through his head
and we're chasing smoke.

233
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,639
I'll call you when I find a lead.

234
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:16,792
- What are you doing?
- I just...

235
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:17,890
Why don't you...

236
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:23,057
Dwight stopped by again.
Didn't say much.

237
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:26,627
Just that kind, warmhearted smile
with the crinkly eyes that say,

238
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:30,241
"Oh, I wish I could find my old friend,
Ned's dad, before I die alone".

239
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:37,421
I know that face.
It's the...

240
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,252
"I'm still waiting to hear why you
won't help your father's friend" face.

241
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:43,005
No, it's a "you don't know my face
as well as you think" face.

242
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:46,516
I keep my feelings about my father
behind a door that's closed for so long,

243
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:48,887
it's wallpapered over,
and you can't see the seams.

244
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,221
And that's how I like it.

245
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:53,211
Dwight showing up is like
a corner peeling.

246
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,851
And I see that peeling corner,
and I want to rip it off.

247
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:57,778
You wouldn't if you knew
what was underneath.

248
00:11:57,808 --> 00:11:59,180
In my case, it's a...

249
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,917
colorful mix of anger,
chronic distrust, and misplaced guilt.

250
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,608
My mom's been lying to me
for three decades about who she is.

251
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:08,806
We've a whole pile of stink to work out,
and I would if I could, but I can't.

252
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:10,866
But you can, if you could,
and you should.

253
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:16,525
What is that?

254
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,416
It's my clue pad
for writing down clues.

255
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:21,627
I love that you have a clue pad.

256
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,948
My father's address...
You can give it to Dwight.

257
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,257
That's as much as I can do.

258
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:27,842
How long have you had this?

259
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:28,944
A while.

260
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:30,886
<i>By "a while",</i>

261
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,719
<i>the pie maker meant 20 years,
11 months,</i>

262
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:36,023
<i>3 weeks, 5 days, and 6 hours</i>

263
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:39,144
<i>since he had gotten word,
whilst away at boarding school,</i>

264
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:42,773
<i>that his father had moved on
and started a new family...</i>

265
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:44,165
<i>without him.</i>

266
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,840
Can I help you?

267
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:06,587
This is Hua Jiang.
He overheard Emerson at the restaurant.

268
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:12,482
Yeah, he said that there's been
illegal gambling at the Dim Sum

269
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,346
since it opened
in the days of prohibition.

270
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:21,626
He says they'd pull the shades
and play cards for money all night long.

271
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:24,190
And when your luck was running,
you'd have a woman on each arm

272
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,484
and all the milk you could drink.

273
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:27,883
"Milk"?

274
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:30,446
Might not be the right word.
My mandarin's a little rusty.

275
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:33,782
This went on until the police
finally caught on and shut them down.

276
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:37,677
But he says they always found a way
to keep the card game going.

277
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,727
I've already searched
the whole damn restaurant.

278
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,045
Well, there were gin joints
in the '20s, that...

279
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:48,613
used to have underground passages
and secret panels,

280
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:52,320
and you used to have to know a password,
like "Antwerp" or "Fiddlesticks".

281
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:54,966
What?

282
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:57,907
I was expecting Emerson
to say something snarky.

283
00:13:59,066 --> 00:13:59,916
Emerson?

284
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:09,004
- Are we spying? I love spying.
- Shut it.

285
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:11,612
- Isn't that...
- Simone?

286
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:13,864
That dog lady you dated?
Is that why we're hiding?

287
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:16,069
- We ain't hiding, and we didn't date.
- You wanted to.

288
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:17,961
- Yeah, and then I didn't.
- Why you didn't?

289
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,370
No kidding. She's gorgeous.

290
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,404
There are complicated issues in this
situation you don't know nothing about,

291
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:25,371
except that their complexities
are so complex,

292
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:27,261
it makes
this shallow conversation absurd.

293
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,264
Strange.

294
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:31,594
- You calling my romantic life strange?
- No.

295
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:34,110
It's strange none of the people
at that table are eating.

296
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,819
<i>As they continued to observe
the diners who were not dining,</i>

297
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:40,801
<i>several unusual details
became apparent.</i>

298
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:44,433
<i>All plates at the table
were covered with a lid.</i>

299
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:48,816
<i>Before serving, the waitress would
spin the food on a lazy Susan.</i>

300
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:54,238
<i>Each diner took five plates...</i>

301
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:58,867
<i>then placed a number of soybeans
in the center of the table.</i>

302
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,162
Let's see 'em.

303
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,605
<i>While this behavior
did not seem consistent</i>

304
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:07,085
<i>with diners enjoying
a Dim Sum dinner,</i>

305
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,092
<i>when the scene was reimagined
in a different way,</i>

306
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,290
<i>it began to make sense.</i>

307
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:17,093
I do love winning.

308
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:20,514
Those folks are playing
poker with food.

309
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:27,663
<i>Faced with a table
full of unsavory poker players,</i>

310
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:32,361
<i>Emerson Cod summoned a steely bravery
acquired from years of PI work,</i>

311
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,673
<i>as he questioned
what was, for him,</i>

312
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:37,142
<i>the group's
most intimidating player...</i>

313
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:38,752
<i>Simone.</i>

314
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:42,109
Given the amount of cash you left with
in your doggie bag last night,

315
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,066
I'd say this wasn't the first time
you been gambling at the <i>Dim Sum</i>.

316
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:47,226
Aggression is a sign of fear,
Mr. Cod.

317
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:49,293
Sometimes aggression
is a sign of being aggressive,

318
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:51,934
which I will be until I catch
whoever killed Bao Ting.

319
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:53,839
Now tell me about
<i>Dim Sum</i>-style poker.

320
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:56,371
It's quite simple.

321
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,945
You give the password to the hostess,
which is <i>Hao Shou Yun</i>

322
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,662
and means "Fortune"
in mandarin.

323
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:02,796
You buy-in at the table.
Each plate is a card,

324
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:05,375
and the meats are the four suits:
Shrimp, pork, chicken, beef.

325
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:07,389
The appetizers represent
different numbers.

326
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:09,521
Other than that,
it's traditional five-card draw.

327
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,106
Except you can eat
your cards.

328
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,150
Which is what you do
when the police arrive.

329
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,028
Did you know Bao Ting?

330
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,260
His steamed buns blurred the line
between eating and sex,

331
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:22,034
but we were not acquainted.

332
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:25,187
Any of these regulars
seem like the type to push a pipe

333
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,081
through your skull
if you owed 'em money?

334
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,261
Shrimpboy's a gangster
in charge of running the table

335
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,001
and paying off the manager.

336
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,546
Anson Chen did eight years
in the state pen for armed robbery.

337
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:38,162
Jin Quin is a thug for hire,
will do anything for a few dollars.

338
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:41,470
Louie Lu strangled his mother-in-law,
got off on a technicality.

339
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:44,107
Jim... is a plumber.

340
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:47,715
They all take gambling seriously,
and they're all dangerous.

341
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,144
Any of them could have done it.

342
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:50,711
What about you?

343
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:53,855
Please.

344
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:56,793
I was at a dog show that night,
which is 800 alibis,

345
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:58,707
1,200 if you include canines.

346
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:00,121
Are we <i>fini</i>?

347
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,007
I've made a career out
of training animals

348
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:10,874
to overcome
and subdue their instincts.

349
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:13,360
That being said,
without raw instinct,

350
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,440
life is nothing more
than a series of empty tricks.

351
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:17,312
You...

352
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:20,356
pretending this is
all business between us...

353
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,552
seems like an empty trick.

354
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:26,967
Something I learned the hard way...

355
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,102
Whenever I'm with someone,

356
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,313
- the more I begin to feel...
- Inadequate?

357
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,538
- Never.
- Tongue-tied?

358
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:34,682
- No.
- Aroused?

359
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,658
Ye...
I'm just saying...

360
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:40,627
The more I'm into somebody,

361
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,770
the greater the odds
that it's gonna end badly.

362
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:46,410
And based on that,
how would we end?

363
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,022
Extremely badly.

364
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:55,784
You hear what I just said?

365
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,070
<i>This was the first time</i>

366
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,339
<i>the private investigator
had ever been ordered to...</i>

367
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:01,454
Come.

368
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:12,226
<i>As Emerson went against what
he was sure was his better judgment,</i>

369
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:15,470
<i>Chuck and Olive did the same</i>

370
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,875
<i>by paying a visit to Ned's father.</i>

371
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,959
- Pie delivery!
- Surprise random pie delivery!

372
00:18:21,989 --> 00:18:24,448
- Just a minute.
- This is a good idea. Right?

373
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,755
- Sounded good when you described it.
- Imagine if we'd have dragged Ned here

374
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:29,843
and we find out that his dad's
an emotional disaster?

375
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:33,058
And it turns out he's older and crankier
and drinks $6 bottles of sour mash?

376
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:35,083
Ned would have a trump card
of an I-told-ya-so.

377
00:18:35,498 --> 00:18:36,348
Come in!

378
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:39,529
Hi...

379
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,329
It'll take just a minute.

380
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:44,802
Great. We're actually
just looking for an older...

381
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,588
Okay. All right.

382
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:50,257
<i>Voilà!</i>

383
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:53,936
Thank you.

384
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:02,786
It's not my fault.
The stupid false bottom keeps jamming.

385
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:03,946
It works when I do it.

386
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,241
Twins! Oh, I love twins!

387
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:11,036
I'm Ralston. This is Maurice.
We have a big show coming up.

388
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:13,540
Oh, actually, we were looking
for an older man that lives here?

389
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,707
He won a pie in a raffle. We have
a raffle every week. Very exciting!

390
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:19,710
The only older man was our dad,
and he hasn't lived here for a while.

391
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,170
Did you say... "dad"?

392
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:24,137
Yeah. He hasn't lived here
in a few years.

393
00:19:24,386 --> 00:19:26,119
He kinda... disappeared.

394
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:28,801
Then our mom shacked up
with someone else, so we kept the house.

395
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:31,334
<i>It was then
that Chuck and Olive realized...</i>

396
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:33,307
You have the same eyebrows as him!

397
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,547
They do!
They do!

398
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:38,151
I said that twice,
once for each of you.

399
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,487
You have seen twins before, right?

400
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:42,441
Yeah. She didn't mean the same
as each other...

401
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:45,831
<i>A pause as they considered
how the pie maker might react</i>

402
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:48,470
<i>if he knew they had discovered
his half-brothers.</i>

403
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,203
- Dad must be very handsome.
- Oh, yeah. Enjoy the pie.

404
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:52,640
- Thanks.
- Bye.

405
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:59,398
<i>Simone come and gone,</i>

406
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:03,379
<i>Emerson felt flushed
with a post-coital sense of achievement</i>

407
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:06,033
<i>and renewed powers
of mental clarity.</i>

408
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:07,216
<i>He spotted something.</i>

409
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:10,263
Who are you,
busboy in every picture?

410
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,726
<i>And, looking more closely...</i>

411
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,122
Meet me at the <i>Dim Sum</i>.

412
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,065
Three reasons I want to speak
to that busboy.

413
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,613
One, he makes $5 an hour,

414
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:31,470
and he's wearing a $2,300 Omega
Deville prestige quartz wristwatch.

415
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,876
Two, he's always hanging
around that poker table.

416
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:37,140
And, three, he's been watching us
ever since we came in here.

417
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:39,340
Since we came here.
Where were you?

418
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,033
Gambling. For you.
And I hit a jackpot,

419
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:44,370
but maybe not the kind you'd like.

420
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,978
What other kind is there?

421
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:48,755
Busboy's making a run for it.
Let's go.

422
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:51,676
How could you go to my dad's house
without telling me?

423
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,179
I can't believe you didn't tell me

424
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:54,802
- you have brothers.
- Half-brothers.

425
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:58,404
Two half-brothers, which is like one
whole one, and, anyway, they're family,

426
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:00,721
and your dad
did the same thing to them.

427
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:04,701
And, Ned, they have your eyebrows,
and they do parlor magic!

428
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,944
So, Maurice, he jumps into one trunk and
then Ralston jumps out of the other one.

429
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,343
"Maurice" and "Ralston"?

430
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:12,091
You didn't even know their names?

431
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:15,304
I'm glad dad got so fun
and creative with naming after I left.

432
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:18,137
Goodbye, Ned.
Hello, Mercutio and Ribald!

433
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,807
Maurice and Ralston!

434
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,814
That's what happens
in a second marriage.

435
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:24,297
People loosen up, drop their baggage
and live a little.

436
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:25,951
I was the baggage.

437
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,557
Busboy's not in the kitchen.

438
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:32,478
Hey, wait a minute.

439
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,054
Yeah, right, over there.

440
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:40,482
This is where Bao worked his magic.

441
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:43,126
It's terrible that your dad left you,
but it's not your brothers' fault.

442
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:45,517
It's not even half their fault.
Why not try to get to know them?

443
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:48,068
I know other nice people
my father didn't abandon me for.

444
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,692
Oh, no, too much pressure.

445
00:21:52,722 --> 00:21:54,241
No, this isn't good!

446
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:55,328
What is that?

447
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:58,078
That is a newly repaired
bun steamer!

448
00:21:58,806 --> 00:21:59,925
Watch out!

449
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,103
Who shrieked?

450
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:11,850
I might have shrieked.

451
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:14,844
It sounded like it came
from over there.

452
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,102
I think I found him.
It's the busboy.

453
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:24,154
You think just 'cause you dead,
you ain't gonna tell us

454
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:26,545
what you was up to,
but you are so wrong.

455
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:36,533
What the hell's that?

456
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:39,411
I believe it's a three-foot length
of copper pipe.

457
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:41,872
I wonder if that's excluded
under "special circumstances".

458
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,498
What "special circumstance"?

459
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:44,809
My life insurance policy.

460
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:46,918
That's what I do...
investigate policy claims.

461
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:49,127
I'm Perry Long
with Dawson & Stubbs...

462
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:50,672
previously.

463
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,559
Well, Perry, judging by
the man-made crimp in the pipe,

464
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:56,344
I think we looking at your
garden-variety premeditated murder.

465
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:58,638
Nice!
It's a solid payout.

466
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:00,536
If you're an insurance investigator,

467
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:02,184
what you doing
posing as a busboy?

468
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:03,475
Working undercover.

469
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:06,898
Checking out a suspicious policy claim
by a chef named Bao Ting.

470
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:07,978
We know Bao.

471
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:11,782
Bao took out a $200,000 life insurance
policy one day before he died.

472
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:13,862
- What are we, idiots?
- Who's the beneficiary?

473
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:15,262
His daughter.

474
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:17,491
Name's Mei.
She works at the restaurant.

475
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:19,911
Thanks, Perry.

476
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,933
You think he left me money?
I'll believe it when I see it.

477
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:27,938
Well, 200 grand's a lot of dough.

478
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:31,317
Maybe enough for somebody who felt
ignored and neglected to cash in?

479
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,981
Will you excuse me?
I have a table waiting.

480
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:36,035
Wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

481
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:39,031
Since I'm waiting on an order,

482
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:40,847
maybe you ought
to let her do her job.

483
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:42,641
- Yes. Good idea.
- Yeah, you right.

484
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:48,031
And that is Shrimpboy.

485
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,270
He runs the poker table.

486
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:53,298
- He didn't like us talking to Mei.
- Maybe they're all in on it together.

487
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:54,298
Yeah.

488
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:56,272
Mr. Cod? Food to-go.

489
00:23:57,859 --> 00:23:59,131
I didn't order this.

490
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,373
<i>Although the handwriting
was familiar to Emerson,</i>

491
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:09,476
<i>as it turned out,
the author was a surprise.</i>

492
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,135
You think I killed my father?

493
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:15,790
Then why would I send you the fortune
cookie the first time asking for help?

494
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,165
- Your mother sent me that cookie.
- No!

495
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:19,718
I sent you the cookie.

496
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:22,553
Knowing she was there that day
collecting my dad's belongings.

497
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:24,935
I wanted her to run into you.

498
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:27,435
I knew she was suspicious
of how dad died.

499
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:29,235
Why couldn't you just hire me?

500
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:31,012
Because Shrimpboy watches me!

501
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:33,984
I know all his secrets,

502
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:36,055
but mom doesn't know anything,

503
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,293
not even about the gambling.

504
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,829
If he knew
I was talking to you now...

505
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:44,901
Was he afraid of
what you gonna say?

506
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,623
That I'll tell you about
the bet my father lost.

507
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:51,042
Did you say "bet"?

508
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,669
<i>The facts were these...</i>

509
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:56,605
<i>Chasing money for his own restaurant
at the Dim Sum poker table,</i>

510
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:59,731
<i>Bao had gambled away
his life savings.</i>

511
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:03,132
<i>He then begged the other gamblers
to let him play on credit.</i>

512
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:06,059
<i>Shrimpboy agreed,
on one condition...</i>

513
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,945
<i>If Bao lost the next hand,</i>

514
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:11,012
<i>his daughter would be forced
to marry Shrimpboy's</i>

515
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:15,380
<i>socially handicapped cousin Rubbie,
manager of the Dim Sum.</i>

516
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:19,710
<i>20 minutes later, Mei was engaged.</i>

517
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:23,031
<i>And since Shrimpboy believed
the terms of a bet</i>

518
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:24,910
<i>should be followed to the letter,</i>

519
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:27,299
<i>he kept a close watch on Mei.</i>

520
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,440
It's the wrong bet.

521
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:33,335
Bao gambled away
his daughter's hand in marriage,

522
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:35,598
but so far,
Mei's kept her end of the bargain.

523
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:36,938
There's no motive.

524
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,390
No way she's gonna stay
in some kind of an arranged marriage.

525
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,949
She ain't going anywhere,

526
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:43,002
not as long as she's under
Shrimpboy's thumb.

527
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:45,277
We got to prove
that Shrimpboy killed Bao,

528
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:47,198
and to do that, we got
to question Shrimpboy.

529
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:49,070
But there are bodyguards involved,

530
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:50,311
very big ones.

531
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:53,021
- Maybe Simone can help.
- Simone can't help.

532
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,148
I thought you talked to her.
Or did you...

533
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,358
more than talk?

534
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,686
You did more than talk.

535
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:03,228
We decided to cool things off
as a mutual agreement

536
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:05,700
amicably reached by
two highly mature adults!

537
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:08,809
Excuse me.

538
00:26:12,227 --> 00:26:13,943
What's the matter with you?

539
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:18,374
I owe you an apology.

540
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:21,174
Is this an apology for going
to Ned's dad's house?

541
00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:24,678
And if so, can I please get in on it?
Because I, too, am very sorry.

542
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:27,332
I was thrown that you went
behind my back to look for a man

543
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,432
who made my tender, formative
years pure misery.

544
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:33,478
That said,
I appreciate the apology.

545
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:36,928
Well, we weren't gonna tell you
anything if we didn't have good news.

546
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,215
Your brothers are friendly
and very cute...

547
00:26:39,245 --> 00:26:41,990
not that you care about that,
but I thought it qualified as good news.

548
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,989
Especially the "brothers"
and the "friendly" part.

549
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,947
Yeah, and it was wrong to be sneaky.
I was trying not to be pushy

550
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:49,736
and replacing "sneaky"
with "pushy" was a big mistake,

551
00:26:50,494 --> 00:26:51,329
but...

552
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:52,244
"But"?

553
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:55,335
But I know you. You say
you don't want to feel connected but,

554
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,211
I don't believe that.
I mean, everyone needs family.

555
00:26:58,461 --> 00:26:59,546
You're my family.

556
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:03,008
And you,
to a slightly lesser degree.

557
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:05,185
Thanks,
to a slightly lesser degree.

558
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:08,583
I've spent my life not having things
in common with my father,

559
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:09,931
which is a good thing.

560
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:11,978
But if I reach out to my brothers,

561
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:14,383
I'm betting it'll make my dad
feel good, wherever he is.

562
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,008
I don't want that.

563
00:27:16,287 --> 00:27:18,907
If that seems petty
and vindictive and small,

564
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:21,497
think of it as an homage
to my father

565
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:23,386
and the tiny part of us
that is the same.

566
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:25,885
<i>As Chuck and Olive
pondered the distance</i>

567
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:28,613
<i>Ned put between
himself and his past,</i>

568
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:32,618
<i>Emerson pondered ways
of getting closer to Shrimpboy.</i>

569
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:36,453
<i>While tracking the potentially
murderous gangster,</i>

570
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:40,252
<i>the PI came up against something
far more frightening...</i>

571
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:41,463
<i>Simone.</i>

572
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,612
<i>The mutual decision
to let things "cool off"</i>

573
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:47,941
<i>had not, in fact, been mutual.</i>

574
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:50,937
<i>But as he gazed up at the stars,</i>

575
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:55,067
<i>his thoughts turned to
his favorite warm, puffy pastries</i>

576
00:27:55,496 --> 00:27:58,331
<i>and the delicious surprises
hidden inside.</i>

577
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:01,312
<i>And then, he got an idea.</i>

578
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:26,377
<i>Emerson's plan
involved a pot of green tea</i>

579
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:29,211
<i>and Chinese herbs
which Mei had supplied.</i>

580
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:32,240
<i>When ingested,
the herbs were known to cause</i>

581
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,227
<i>an uncomfortable fullness
of the bladder.</i>

582
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,293
Little cousin wins again.

583
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:50,979
How 'bout that, huh?

584
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,026
Boss?

585
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:56,463
I got an uncomfortable fullness
of the bladder.

586
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:57,893
Yeah, me too.

587
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:18,948
I'm sorry, we're closing.

588
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:21,430
What if I said we was here
for the "Hao Shou Yun" special?

589
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,987
Same for me, darlin'.

590
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,720
That's right.

591
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:27,566
What's up, players?
Which one of y'all be Shrimpboy?

592
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:29,528
Depends. Who's asking?

593
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,377
"Who's asking" is Jimmy the Ace.
Ricky the Hammer will vouch for me.

594
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:35,159
We did time in the joint together.
Where is Ricky, that lovable cutthroat?

595
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,402
Never heard of him.
And this game...

596
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:38,704
is full.

597
00:29:38,981 --> 00:29:41,279
Yeah, well, that's too bad,

598
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,966
'cause the sucker behind me

599
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:45,418
got pockets so deep,
he write a check and the bank bounce.

600
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,361
He's a grade-A fish.

601
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:49,591
I thought I'd bring him in here
so we can pick him clean.

602
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:54,079
Rubbie, why don't you
and Louie sit this one out?

603
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:55,159
Yes, Rubbie.

604
00:29:58,591 --> 00:29:59,894
Have a seat, player.

605
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,394
It's a grand buy-in.
Hope that's not a problem.

606
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:04,945
Oh, I always carry around
some loose change.

607
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,182
Damn, woman,
you got the kung fu grip.

608
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:23,365
Ain't you the Shrimpboy
won himself a bride in a poker game?

609
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:26,679
I heard about that. I thought,
"that fella needs to get out more.

610
00:30:26,982 --> 00:30:28,715
There's better ways to meet girls."

611
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,677
I was playing her dad.
Girl wasn't for me.

612
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:38,712
See, my cousin ain't too hot
with the ladies, so I did him a favor.

613
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:42,306
Yeah, I bet her daddy was pretty angry
when he lost that bet, huh?

614
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,562
Well, if he was, why'd he play
the hand in the first place?

615
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:48,046
See, around here, a bet's sacred.

616
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:50,652
Your word is all you got.

617
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,424
Bet's to you, new guy.

618
00:31:00,097 --> 00:31:01,312
$300 to stay in.

619
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,424
Oh, is that all?

620
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,952
You can raise.

621
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:07,897
No, I like to begin

622
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:10,533
with an insignificant sum,
like this,

623
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:12,713
and then work my way up
to the real money.

624
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,833
Yeah, speaking of real money...
If I was you,

625
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:18,312
I'd have kept right on betting
with that fool.

626
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:19,905
He sound like an easy mark.

627
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:22,241
He came back,

628
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,907
felt guilty about his daughter
having to marry my cousin.

629
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:27,005
Said he wanted to win
her freedom back.

630
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:28,898
So it wasn't about money
this particular time.

631
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,692
He was just trying to help
his daughter.

632
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:33,978
Except he had nothing to bet with.
So I told him to get lost.

633
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:36,112
Yo, you in or what?

634
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,262
Oh, yeah, yeah.

635
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:39,866
All right.
Let's switch 'em.

636
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,463
Hey, somebody!

637
00:31:44,745 --> 00:31:45,595
Open up!

638
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:52,629
Keep walkin'.

639
00:31:52,883 --> 00:31:55,887
I love gongs!
Nothing wrong with that.

640
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,328
<i>The bodyguards still indisposed,</i>

641
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:02,932
<i>the private investigators
considered their latest clue...</i>

642
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,835
<i>that the bet
that had gotten Bao killed</i>

643
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:08,969
<i>had not been with Shrimpboy
after all,</i>

644
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:10,731
<i>but with someone else.</i>

645
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:13,009
Bao wanted to win back
Mei's freedom.

646
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,246
If Shrimpboy wouldn't play,
there's always someone else

647
00:32:15,276 --> 00:32:18,206
- Bao could have played against.
- You mean Rubbie?

648
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,040
Yep.

649
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,454
Bao would've gone directly
to her fiancé

650
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:22,994
to try to win Mei back from him.

651
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:26,537
Hey. Time to put up
or shut up.

652
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,053
Oh, yeah, yeah.

653
00:32:28,935 --> 00:32:30,393
Let's do this.

654
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,626
Pork buns, shrimp dumplings,

655
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:37,768
full house.

656
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:41,304
Beef pot stickers,
straight to the nine.

657
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:44,281
Bao had life insurance.
What if he gambled that?

658
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,166
I mean, Mei's the beneficiary,

659
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:48,181
but if Rubbie marries her,
then he gets the money.

660
00:32:48,211 --> 00:32:50,495
And Rubbie wouldn't collect
as long as Bao was alive.

661
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:52,649
<i>At last, the truth was clear.</i>

662
00:32:52,922 --> 00:32:55,276
- Rubbie murdered Bao.
- Beef and sticky buns...

663
00:32:55,468 --> 00:32:56,568
empty. You bluff.

664
00:32:57,322 --> 00:33:00,081
We better hurry up and finish
this business and then call the police.

665
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,242
- What's with the whispering?
- Show the damn cards.

666
00:33:03,303 --> 00:33:04,253
Oh, yeah.

667
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:07,914
10 high.

668
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:10,933
Shrimp dumplings,

669
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:12,727
four of a kind.

670
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:14,003
Winning hand.

671
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:15,301
I won?

672
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,277
Yeah, I won!

673
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:22,334
Time to cash out.

674
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,229
It ain't to be so tied,
I got bad circulation.

675
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:34,846
Keep them here until me
and my fiancée are on the plane.

676
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:37,694
We're taking our honeymoon early.
Right, honey?

677
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,876
Hey, crab cake, you help him,
you're an accessory,

678
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:42,496
and I'm not talking Gucci handbag.

679
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:44,535
I'm talking hard time
in the pen, the joint,

680
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,420
the hoosegow, the forbidden city.

681
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:49,288
My cousin won a bet,
and around here...

682
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:50,539
A bet is sacred.

683
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:54,877
What? I'm... just repeating
what he said.

684
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:56,573
<i>The facts were these...</i>

685
00:33:57,111 --> 00:34:00,787
<i>Bao's desperate plea for a chance
to win his daughter's freedom</i>

686
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:03,469
<i>was paired with an unfortunate
lack of funds.</i>

687
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:05,638
<i>When Shrimpboy refused,</i>

688
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:09,038
<i>Rubbie suggested Bao
simply wager the payout</i>

689
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:11,040
<i>from a life insurance policy.</i>

690
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,264
<i>If Rubbie won the hand,
he would marry Mei</i>

691
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:17,483
<i>and wait for Bao to die
before claiming his reward.</i>

692
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:21,413
<i>Rubbie won the poker game
with an amazing straight flush.</i>

693
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:24,490
<i>Bao had failed his daughter
and was devastated.</i>

694
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,260
<i>Even more devastating
was Bao's next realization,</i>

695
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,326
<i>that his future son-in-law
demanded payment...</i>

696
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:33,624
<i>immediately.</i>

697
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:37,837
Papa was risking his life for me.

698
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:39,997
I wouldn't even speak to him.

699
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:41,207
It's not your fault.

700
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:43,416
I thought I knew my father,

701
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:45,222
but I didn't know him at all.

702
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:48,642
<i>It struck the pie maker,
he'd always believed</i>

703
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:51,723
<i>his father's actions
spoke for themselves.</i>

704
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:54,527
<i>But... maybe he was wrong.</i>

705
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:56,159
Speak of the devil.

706
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:58,941
Simone?

707
00:34:59,508 --> 00:35:01,486
Nobody locked the door?

708
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:03,432
I don't think
this would be the best time.

709
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:05,623
And when would be the best time?
Certainly not earlier,

710
00:35:05,653 --> 00:35:07,867
when you dived into your car
to hide from me.

711
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,410
No, see, you don't underst...

712
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:11,769
I require honesty, loyalty,
and respect...

713
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:14,496
Qualities you've done
an extraordinary job of not showing.

714
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:16,160
So let's try a new set of rules.

715
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,044
From now on,
you will not speak to me...

716
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:19,670
- but I...
- ... or call me...

717
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,547
- but I...
- ... or come within 20 feet.

718
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:24,091
- but I...
- And stop calling me "but I"!

719
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,589
Lady.

720
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:29,899
What's going on?

721
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,061
- We have a plane to catch.
- No! No!

722
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:37,605
Bubblegum, stop begging!

723
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:40,191
Do you have food in your pocket?

724
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:41,317
No.

725
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:43,778
You do, don't you?

726
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:45,712
- What are you talking about?
- I was waiting

727
00:35:45,742 --> 00:35:48,682
on you when you beat Shrimpboy at poker.
And I bet you beat him

728
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:51,035
because you had
the winning pork bun in your pocket.

729
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:52,593
You're a cheater.

730
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:54,459
Cheater, cheater,
cheater, cheater.

731
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:55,330
Cheater!

732
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:57,782
Yeah, and you know
he was cheating when he played Bao.

733
00:35:57,812 --> 00:36:00,002
And around here,
a bet is sacred. Right?

734
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,791
Out of my way!

735
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:07,927
<i>While there were things
Shrimpboy could forgive,</i>

736
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:11,303
<i>such as homicide, kidnapping,
and illegal poker,</i>

737
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,349
<i>he drew the line at cheating.</i>

738
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:16,853
<i>In part,</i>

739
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:20,394
<i>it was the countless hands
of poker he'd lost to Rubbie</i>

740
00:36:20,424 --> 00:36:21,914
<i>in the years since childhood,</i>

741
00:36:22,665 --> 00:36:25,792
<i>now seen in a different light.</i>

742
00:36:25,822 --> 00:36:27,864
<i>As Rubbie had cheated Bao,</i>

743
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,760
<i>Shrimpboy agreed
the bet was non-binding.</i>

744
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:33,394
<i>Mei and her friends were free to go.</i>

745
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,187
<i>And Mei's engagement
was disengaged.</i>

746
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:37,040
Sparkly.

747
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,337
<i>Because Shrimpboy believed
that all games are meaningless</i>

748
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,533
<i>unless we risk something real.</i>

749
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,380
<i>Rubbie risked something real,</i>

750
00:36:45,524 --> 00:36:48,031
<i>and what he gained,
as Olive predicted,</i>

751
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:50,094
<i>was a visit to the hoosegow.</i>

752
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:54,613
<i>After the insurance company made
a grudging payout to Mei,</i>

753
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,283
<i>she shared it with her mother,
who shared it with Emerson...</i>

754
00:36:58,313 --> 00:37:00,839
<i>payment for a job well done.</i>

755
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,154
<i>Still,
Emerson was forced to acknowledge</i>

756
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:07,714
<i>it had been a job not so well done</i>

757
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:10,150
<i>where Simone was concerned.</i>

758
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,870
Simone! Simone!

759
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:17,902
Damn it, woman!

760
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,267
Whatever it is, say it quickly.

761
00:37:20,802 --> 00:37:21,667
Look,

762
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:25,953
you all about control.
Now, I'm not gonna deny that's a turn-o

763
00:37:25,983 --> 00:37:27,840
but you never show your cards.

764
00:37:28,824 --> 00:37:31,160
I figured if I went all-in,
I'd be out on the street somewhere

765
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,429
with a tin cup
and a borrowed blanket. You with me?

766
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:36,015
For about 10 more seconds.

767
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:39,536
But when you barged
into the restaurant to tell me off,

768
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:43,314
well, that was a whole new Simone,
because that meant you were...

769
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:44,982
Hiding a shred of vulnerability?

770
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:47,026
Well, hell, a shred's
better than nothing.

771
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:49,870
All I'm saying is...

772
00:37:52,057 --> 00:37:55,701
... you show me your cards,
I'll show you mine.

773
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,118
<i>It struck Emerson,</i>

774
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:05,045
<i>that while some people
are terrified of a gamble</i>

775
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,066
<i>and others can't say no to one,</i>

776
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:11,173
<i>the best approach lies somewhere,
in the middle.</i>

777
00:38:12,814 --> 00:38:14,868
I would ask what changed
your mind...

778
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:16,002
Except?

779
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:18,357
Except you haven't rang
the doorbell yet,

780
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,538
which would prove
that you have changed your mind.

781
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,553
All right, anything I say now
is tempting fate.

782
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:25,990
It's easier to make
assumptions about dad

783
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,687
and why he did what he did
than admit I don't know.

784
00:38:29,882 --> 00:38:31,170
I don't know my family,

785
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,376
or what it would be like
to know them.

786
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,955
And the finding-out part...

787
00:38:37,338 --> 00:38:38,993
makes me a little queasy.

788
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,726
Well, whatever happens,
I'll be right here, okay?

789
00:38:43,564 --> 00:38:44,407
Thanks.

790
00:38:46,737 --> 00:38:48,055
Come on.
Come on.

791
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,166
- Hello?
- Hi.

792
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:56,598
I'm Ned.

793
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:58,491
I thought I'd stop by because...

794
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:00,894
basically, we have the same dad.

795
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:19,104
<i>As the brothers gazed at each other
for the first time,</i>

796
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,033
<i>the pie maker sensed
this gamble would pay off</i>

797
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:26,087
<i>in ways he could never predict.</i>

798
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:32,164
<i>And from his vantage point
