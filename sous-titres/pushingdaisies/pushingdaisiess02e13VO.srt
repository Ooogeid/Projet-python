Subtitles (BIA v.1.00): <i>A²S Team</i>

3
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:08,680
<i>At this very moment
in the town of Coeur d'Louise,</i>

4
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:12,515
<i>young Lily Charles was 5 years,
16 hours and 2 minutes old.</i>

5
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:16,760
<i>Three days earlier, her sister Vivian
was born with a hole in her heart.</i>

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,320
<i>Cardiologists patched the flaw
and Lily received her orders,</i>

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,215
<i>put her vulnerable sibling
before herself.</i>

8
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,293
<i>On her 11th birthday, land-loving Lily
was given a backyard pool</i>

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,405
<i>and a swimming suit
that matched her sister Vivian's.</i>

10
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:37,040
<i>Lily would soon realize that constant
exposure to her younger sister</i>

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,120
<i>made Vivian a devoted mimic.</i>

12
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:45,202
<i>From matching swimsuits
and backyard poolery,</i>

13
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:47,445
<i>The </i>Darling Mermaid Darlings
<i>were born.</i>

14
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:50,763
<i>The renowned synchronized swimming
sisters were loyal beyond separation</i>

15
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:53,095
<i>until Charles Charles.</i>

16
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,834
<i>Engaged to sister Vivian,
but in love with sister Lily,</i>

17
00:00:55,874 --> 00:00:59,862
<i>Charles Charles not only planted
the seeds of betrayal, he sowed them.</i>

18
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:03,160
<i>Shamed by the affair
with her sister's fiancé,</i>

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,135
<i>Lily joined the Sisters
of the </i>Divine Magnatum

20
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:08,960
<i>where she hid her love child
from Vivian and the world.</i>

21
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:11,760
<i>No sooner was Lily's lovechild born</i>

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,304
<i>than Lily had to give her up
to keep the secret.</i>

23
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:17,645
<i>Somewhere between losing her daughter
and losing her eye,</i>

24
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:19,480
<i>Lily lost the will to perform.</i>

25
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:22,641
<i>Lily's daughter, Charlotte,
was raised by her father</i>

26
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,355
<i>and told her mother died
giving birth.</i>

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,015
<i>When Charlotte's father died,
her mother came back into her life,</i>

28
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,600
<i>but not as her mother,</i>

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,885
<i>as her aunt.</i>

30
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,235
<i>Incapacitated by the lie,
she was forced to keep telling,</i>

31
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:37,203
<i>Lily retreated from the world</i>

32
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:39,587
<i>and took Vivian
and Charlotte with her.</i>

33
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,545
<i>And then, Charlotte died.</i>

34
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:45,028
<i>At this very moment, Lily and Vivian
were commemorating a birthday,</i>

35
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:48,831
<i>specifically a half birthday
for their niece/daughter Charlotte,</i>

36
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:51,640
<i>who passed away
one and one half birthdays ago.</i>

37
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,810
She was such a happy girl.

38
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:58,105
It's as if when she died, the merriment
in this home died with her.

39
00:01:58,145 --> 00:01:59,145
Good Lord!

40
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,635
Sorry for being dismal.

41
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:03,640
It would be a relief to be
as strong and stoic as you.

42
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,435
Dear me. The <i>Aquacade</i> is in town!

43
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,599
Remember taking Charlotte there
for her half birthdays?

44
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:12,560
It's as if an angel
called the <i>Papen County Picayune</i>

45
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,655
and placed an ad on the back page.

46
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:17,440
You done gawking?
The bird cages need fresh liners.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,840
Lily, let's go to the <i>Aquacade</i>.

48
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:24,315
It could be just the thing to help
the gloom pass. Please. For me.

49
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,943
<i>Though Lily was weak with grief,
her compulsion</i>

50
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:31,633
<i>to put her sister's happiness
before her own drove her to say</i>

51
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,085
Find my opera gloves.

52
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,956
All those children,
tourists and culottes,

53
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,280
the place will be
crawling with germs.

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,160
<i>And so Vivian made a wish.</i>

55
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,085
I can't believe you remembered
my half birthday.

56
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,160
- How could we forget?
- You never shutting up about it.

57
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:50,000
A little something from me.

58
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:51,207
The first edition.

59
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,480
And it's signed by the author!
Thank you, Emerson.

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,275
Now, where's yours,
boyfriend of half birthday girl?

61
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:59,400
- Ned thinks he's a terrible gift-giver.
- I am.

62
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,640
He's obsessed with finding
the gift that doesn't exist.

63
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,585
- It does.
- Then he psychs himself out

64
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,455
to the point where
he doesn't gift anything,

65
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:08,360
but he's already given me
the greatest gift of all, my life back.

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,490
Still, I'm not giving up
finding the perfect gift.

67
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,125
What died?

68
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,080
Half a dozen minks, give or take.

69
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:17,820
Lily asked me to take them
to the furrier for a fluffing.

70
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,760
They're going to the <i>Aquacade</i> tonight
to celebrate Chuck's half birthday.

71
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm so touched!

72
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:24,640
- Aren't you touched, Ned?
- I'm not sure. What's an <i>Aquacade</i>?

73
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:27,698
It's like this travelling water show
and you have divers and swimmers

74
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:29,170
and breathtaking daredevils.

75
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,920
That was I can't tell
on my half birthday

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,074
and we'd always go.

77
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,890
That's it, my perfect gift.

78
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:36,176
I'm gonna buy six tickets
to the <i>Aquacade</i>.

79
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,880
- Call Simone.
- In with the flu.

80
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:40,002
- Olive, call Randy.
- Out with the gout.

81
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:43,760
- So, four tickets to the <i>Aquacade</i>.
- Double date! Double date!

82
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:50,985
Prepare to be amazed.

83
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:53,404
There has not been this much talent
around a body of water

84
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:55,438
since Moses played the Red Sea.

85
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:58,280
But first master of ceremonies
is the son Jimmy Neptune!

86
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,080
And solo sensation Sid Tango!

87
00:04:02,313 --> 00:04:05,425
Shark rider Galveston Gus
and his dorsal finned friend Bubba!

88
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:06,715
And your aunts.

89
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,080
They're the Serena and Venus
of water ballet and no-one's looking?

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,080
No-one's even pretending not to look
when you're actually looking.

91
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:24,231
<i>But someone was.</i>

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,720
The <i>Darling Mermaid Darlings</i>.

93
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:28,051
Look, fans.

94
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,515
No, they are not fans.
They're the <i>Aqua Dolls</i>.

95
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:31,711
<i>The facts were these.</i>

96
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:34,789
<i>Blanche and Coral Ramora
aka the </i>Aqua Dolls,

97
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:38,285
<i>shaped their act into a swimming
celebration of the red, white and blue.</i>

98
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,400
<i>But the </i>Aqua Dolls<i> weren't
the only synchronized sister duo,</i>

99
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,520
<i>the </i>Darling Mermaid Darlings<i> were too,
and thus, grew a bitter rivalry.</i>

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,915
- What has you two chumming the waters?
- I could ask the same, chum.

101
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,565
The Charles sisters.
Still out of the loop.

102
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:52,920
How quaint and refreshing.

103
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,120
We're tonight's headliners,
didn't you know?

104
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:58,225
Yo, dolls.

105
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:01,075
This is our manager,
Blanche's husband.

106
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:03,315
Insatiable husband. Shane Trickle.

107
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:06,505
I found him
when we were performing in Honolulu.

108
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,440
Hawaii.

109
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,525
Shake tail. Curtains in 20.

110
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:11,755
Well, off to do what we do best...

111
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,640
Swim for Christ and country.

112
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,440
You might wanna pick a new flag,
one without horizontal stripes.

113
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:20,617
You know, it's a shame
cutting this short.

114
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:24,920
- Why don't we meet in our dressing...
- Lavish dressing room, after the show.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,974
That's if the shuttle bus isn't
in a hurry to get you back to the home.

116
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,825
This was an unanticipated stress.
I would like to go.

117
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,965
You think I wanted
to drive 25 miles to a...

118
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:46,520
family-friendly venue
with its general admission parking lot?

119
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:48,935
They don't even serve alcohol here!

120
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,345
Oh, my goodness.
You need to sit down at home?

121
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:54,085
No, we are gonna stand up.

122
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,105
Come on,
this is Charlotte's celebration.

123
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:58,795
Her memory comes first.

124
00:05:58,886 --> 00:06:01,286
Get out your ticket.
We're wading in.

125
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:12,155
They look rattled.

126
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,293
This is the worst
that could've happened.

127
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,424
I'm gonna have to sneak closer and see
how they're dealing with everything.

128
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:25,122
The cotton candy vendor's
a very large man with a doubly large...

129
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:27,162
display of spun candy
to hide behind.

130
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:31,307
I have to do something. What can I do
from all the way back up here?

131
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:35,085
I know! Let's lift their spirits
with an aunt chant or the wave.

132
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,325
It's never been more appropriate.
Emerson, you start.

133
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,921
Or something more to the point.

134
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,475
Screw the <i>Aqua Dolls</i>!

135
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,480
I got a smile.

136
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:55,880
Greetings, ladies and gents!

137
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:59,960
Welcome to my Night
of a Thousand Bubbles!

138
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,955
Is this a frothy crowd or what?

139
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:08,375
Bubble the shark thinks so!

140
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,480
More from him later.

141
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:14,255
Thanks for insisting we stay.
Now the task is staying strong.

142
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,900
But right now, let us rise...

143
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,720
for our National Anthem...

144
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,956
as interpreted
by those patriotic paddlers:

145
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:24,400
the <i>Aqua Dolls</i>.

146
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:39,000
<i>Oh say can you see...</i>

147
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:40,920
these ladies swim?

148
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,149
Esther Williams would piss
her cotton panel

149
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:49,752
at the sight of those rocket splits.

150
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:50,942
Lily, behave.

151
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:54,320
Though I will admit
Blanche is looking less than buoyant.

152
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:58,280
Are you kidding?
She's dead in the water.

153
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:16,505
I must pen a sympathy note
to Coral Ramora.

154
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:18,104
Don't sign my name to that

155
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,985
"Sorry a shark ate
your bitch of a sister" letter.

156
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:24,640
- She wouldn't think twice if it was us.
- But to have a sister die.

157
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know how I'd survive
if I lost you.

158
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:30,920
Who the hell is that?

159
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:34,855
Vivian Charles
of the <i>Darling Mermaid Darlings</i>.

160
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:36,495
Tails, scales and all.

161
00:08:37,505 --> 00:08:40,920
I overheard your verbal skirmish
with the <i>Aqua Dolls</i> last night.

162
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:45,013
Hoped to grab you after the show,
but it seemed you were swept away by....

163
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,240
departing crowd.

164
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,783
We small-boned persons
are vulnerable

165
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:52,000
to exoduses of the mass
and panicked variety.

166
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:55,479
We all thought the Charles sisters
had gone the way of legend,

167
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,720
but gee whizz.

168
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,960
- What a time for a comeback.
- Come again?

169
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:04,375
My father owned the <i>Aquacade</i> before me,
his father before him.

170
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:08,035
That's how I know Sam Neptune
gave the <i>Darlings</i> their first break.

171
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:09,025
As a boy,

172
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:11,429
I watched your set
from the water wings every night

173
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,565
and I never forgot the look
of the audience as they soaked it in.

174
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,491
You two have a gift
unlike any I've seen.

175
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,778
- Your swimming brings people joy.
- Our swimming brings...

176
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:21,680
brought us joy too.

177
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,760
I'm in desperate need
of a new opening act.

178
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:26,105
Come back to the pool, <i>Mermaids</i>!

179
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:29,995
After a 24 hour mourning period
for poor Blanche, of course.

180
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:32,215
- The water's nice.
- We're retired.

181
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,635
People come out of retirement
all the time.

182
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,160
For how many performances
would you want us?

183
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
What has gotten into your gills?

184
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:43,280
- We had our time.
- And here it is, back again.

185
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,920
Well, are we swimmin', women?

186
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,705
Save it. We're in training.

187
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,200
- Do I smell a fish-wich?
- Yes.

188
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:04,720
- You mind stowin' it away?
- Yes.

189
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,440
All clear.

190
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:23,187
Sorry to inconvenience, but the scent
of fried flounder takes me back to...

191
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
my recent loss.

192
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:27,985
You come highly recommended, Mr Cod.

193
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,832
- The name's...
- Galveston Gus. I know.

194
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:32,105
I assume your recent loss
is Bubba the shark?

195
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,640
- You heard?
- I was there.

196
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:36,000
I hope you ain't part
of the negligence suit against me.

197
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,160
Their lawyers wanna take
everything I have,

198
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,200
and that's why I need you,
to prove I wasn't asleep in the saddle.

199
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,567
Not much I can do.

200
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:47,205
300 people saw your great white
make fish food out of that water hoofer.

201
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:50,795
I know you can't prove
Bubba didn't eat Miss Ramora, he did,

202
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,480
and what a crap last meal
that must've been.

203
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,828
But you can prove
someone else at the <i>Aquacade</i>

204
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:59,525
let him out of his pen
and caused this horrible accident.

205
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:01,167
What's got you floating that theory?

206
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:04,320
I triple check the gate of his paddock
before every performance.

207
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,960
This here is the only way to open it

208
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,600
and it never leaves my person.

209
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:10,877
No, sir.

210
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:14,720
Someone else opened his pen
and set me and my boy up.

211
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:19,825
Bubba was my best friend
ever since he was a guppy of a pup.

212
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:24,080
And the only happiness I will get from
this mess is knowing his name is clear.

213
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:25,485
So please,

214
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:29,422
help a sentimental cow-boo guy.

215
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:35,365
In third grade,
I did a report on great whites.

216
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:36,736
It's gonna be a like-a-likes,

217
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,920
seeing as how we're both
misunderstood bad asses.

218
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,937
- Well, this may be a long shot, but...
- Let's give the big fish a fair shake.

219
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:58,080
Miss Ramora, I'm sorry to inform you,
you've been eaten by Bubba the shark.

220
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,125
Did everybody cry?
Of course they did. I'm the fan fav'.

221
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:03,765
Did you notice
anything strange before...

222
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,400
My sister asked me
if I was going grey.

223
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:09,480
- How about something pertinent?
- It's strange.

224
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,555
My mother was auburn till the end.

225
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:14,275
Only other thing that can bring
on grey hair is stress

226
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:18,175
and my husband Shane
is the biggest stress reliever I know.

227
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,200
Big-gest.

228
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:23,018
I can see something white in there,
but I don't think it's hair.

229
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:26,195
- It's my hair gel.
- You sure that ain't shark slime?

230
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:27,998
Water ballerinas use
a very thick hair gel.

231
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,837
It's water proof to keep hairstyles
in place. It's kinda like shellac.

232
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:32,845
Shellac with a faint scent of...

233
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,635
lard.

234
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,815
It's used all the time
in pie crusts.

235
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,595
Why would someone
put pig fat in her hair gel?

236
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,400
Sharks can smell a drop of blood
in the water a quarter of a mile away.

237
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:43,896
Lard sure as hell
would've prompted Bubba to strike.

238
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:45,788
All someone would have to do
is open the pen.

239
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:47,920
We've got bonified murder
by great white.

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,750
Wait.

241
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,150
Lily and Vivian Charles.

242
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:55,495
I knew there was a reason they'd come
out of seclusion after all these years.

243
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,800
Shrews. Always after our limelight.

244
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,461
You were the limelight.
You were nothing before the <i>Mermaids</i>.

245
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,600
They put sibling synchro
swim dance on the map.

246
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:04,680
- Who are you?
- Charlotte Charles.

247
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,000
Niece of Vivian, daughter of Lily.

248
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:10,480
You hurt their feelings on a night
they were feeling very fragile, so...

249
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,360
you can just shut up about my family,
Blanche Ramora Trickle,

250
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,890
or you'll end up...

251
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:18,395
Well, I can't think
of anything worse than here, so...

252
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,389
Snap! Now, touch her.
Touch her before she talks back.

253
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:22,950
Touch her! Touch her! Touch her!

254
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:25,805
That felt so good.

255
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:34,520
That hapless shark was just a patsy?

256
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,579
He got a whiff of lard
in Blanche's hair gel

257
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,000
and followed his instincts.

258
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,411
The killer would have needed access
to the <i>Dolls</i>' dressing room

259
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,320
and the remote for the shark gate,
all of which hollers inside job.

260
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:46,308
Suddenly, our <i>Aquacade</i> looks nastier
than a backed-up sink on Thanksgiving.

261
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:49,043
There's no way our bad fish
is gonna nibble with a bunch of PIs

262
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,065
coming trawling for murderers.

263
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,560
What we need now is a cover.

264
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:56,400
- My aunts!
- Lily. Vivian. A booth? Pie?

265
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,435
Pie and booth?

266
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,280
Perhaps a sugar-free
apricot custard to go.

267
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,440
You are all really
co-ordinated today.

268
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:08,000
Olive, we'd like back
the <i>Darling Mermaid Darling</i> costumes

269
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,920
we gave you some time ago.

270
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,745
- Feeling nostalgic?
- No.

271
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:15,720
We're joining the floating cast of Jimmy
Neptune's Night of a Thousand Bubbles.

272
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:18,560
This is our living in sync
practice hour.

273
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:19,975
OMG!

274
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,755
GR8!

275
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:23,705
TTFN. No. BRB.

276
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:26,800
She got a case of the dumbA-S-S.

277
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:30,776
How about you take a seat
far over there where you can...

278
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:32,480
do whatever it is you're doing?

279
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:40,215
Well, ladies,
if it isn't a small sea.

280
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:44,435
It just so happens I have business
at Jimmy Neptune's myself.

281
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:47,175
Would you mind stepping
outside for a little chat?

282
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:48,211
After you.

283
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,680
No stares of disbelief, I beg you.

284
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:02,320
I couldn't pass up an all-access-pass
for the <i>Aquacade</i>.

285
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:05,360
It may be all access, unfortunately,
it's not all inclusive.

286
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,720
I know, I can't go. But I don't care
cause they're back in the water for pay.

287
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,953
But I want you there taking photos

288
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,360
and making notes
and then reporting back to me.

289
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,691
It doesn't seem fair,
like we're on Spring Break

290
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,773
- while you're stuck in detention.
- This detention's easier 'cause...

291
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:20,601
they're surrounded
by people who love them

292
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,718
in this very emotional
and vulnerable time.

293
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,047
You just make sure
that Emerson is a vigilant bodyguard

294
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:26,760
and sticks to them like glue.

295
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:27,845
Paddle out.

296
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,385
Dipping a toe back
in our old lives...

297
00:15:57,735 --> 00:16:00,640
and solving a murder.
The thought brings tingles.

298
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:03,085
All right, everybody.
Here's your assignments.

299
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,000
Itty-Bitty, you're hair and make-up.

300
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,928
I want you
to get into Blanche's dressing room

301
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,415
and find that hair gel.

302
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:11,480
Pie maker, you're the deal maker,
aka the <i>Mermaids</i>' agent.

303
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,375
Stick to Jimmy Neptune.

304
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,401
As team coach, I'll sidle up
to the <i>Aqua Dolls</i>' manager

305
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:19,080
and grieving husband, Shane Trickle.

306
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:22,916
And as team heavy, I'll also make sure
you two have nothing to worry about

307
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:25,706
except scissor kicking ass
and taking names.

308
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:28,600
Aqua Troops, circle round
for an important announcement.

309
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:31,240
As terrible
as these circumstances are,

310
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,070
they've also brought us
something wonderful.

311
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,160
A pair of luminaries.

312
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:38,410
Everyone, put your fins together

313
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,600
for A Night of a Thousand Bubbles'
new headliners...

314
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:44,320
The <i>Darling Mermaid Darlings</i>.

315
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:52,315
That's bogus, Neptune!

316
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,560
We have a signed thing.

317
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,480
Which I will honor by finding
a new act for Coral.

318
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,000
Does anybody even know
who these two are?

319
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:02,755
I met my husband
at a <i>Darling Mermaid Darlings</i> show.

320
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:04,865
They're the reason
we devote our lives to this.

321
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:06,279
I have pens for autographs.

322
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,680
I ought to punch you
in the snot locker!

323
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,775
<i>As Lily and Vivian's stars
began to rise,</i>

324
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:16,495
<i>Olive encountered another star
that was about to fall.</i>

325
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,680
- Are you the new sea horse?
- Heavens to hamstrings.

326
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:29,800
No. I'm Sally Boots. Fly girl
to the <i>Darling Mermaid Darlings</i>.

327
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:32,634
Snap that G-string! I love them.

328
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:33,924
I love you.

329
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:38,345
Mama.

330
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,040
- Who are you?
- Sid Tango.

331
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,920
- I open the second act.
- Why aren't you out there?

332
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
They're relocating me.

333
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:49,455
- Out by the porta-lights.
- Shoot.

334
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:52,228
There's enough room
in this fishbowl for all us fish.

335
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:53,640
You know what? Thank you.

336
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,240
If only more people around here
would be as accepting of who I am.

337
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,040
People aren't accepting here?

338
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,989
Being a man in aqua entertainment...

339
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,120
Which is to say
unappreciated and invisible.

340
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,015
Do you know how many times Jimmy
promised me the headliner spot?

341
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:07,755
Thought I'd get it
after Blanche kicked.

342
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,600
Then I hear they're dragging
the musty mermaids out of retirement.

343
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:13,200
Oh, hell.
Some day it'll be my turn.

344
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,800
Until then, I'll be content
watching others...

345
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:18,000
glimmer and gleam.

346
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:22,011
<i>Ironically, Olive found those same words
staring back at her</i>

347
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,801
<i>from the vicinity
of Coral's dressing table.</i>

348
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:29,773
She'd mind if I borrow this?

349
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:33,040
My girls need a touch-up before
splash-down. Nice to meet you. Bye.

350
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,353
I combed the dressing room
for the weapon.

351
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:38,293
Well, murder weapon trigger.

352
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:42,095
Blanche's beauty area had been broomed,
but I did found Coral's hair gel.

353
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,405
It smells fine.

354
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:45,995
Nice work, Sea-Wee.

355
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:48,955
I got a great big bucket
full of nothing.

356
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,895
Still, your find
does prove our theory.

357
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:52,535
Blanche was definitely the target.

358
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:02,022
Holy Ibiza, Monaco and St Tropez.
That is some banana hammock.

359
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,175
That's Sid Tango. I found him hanging
in Blanche's dressing room.

360
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:07,352
He's sort of fun
and just a teensy bit angry

361
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,925
he was overlooked to lead
the <i>Aquacade</i> due to his...

362
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,192
Well, because of...

363
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:15,240
- what's in his banana hammock.
- I really should look away, but I...

364
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,000
- I can't.
- Wanna go blind?

365
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,930
I wanna catch a killer.
Look at the shark pen.

366
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:22,225
See that?

367
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,960
It happens every time
Sid touches his belt.

368
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,400
Come on.

369
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:36,800
Excuse me. This is where I dive.

370
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
Well, you're about
to belly flop, all right...

371
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:44,760
... right into a little cesspool
I like to call the county pen.

372
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:55,960
- What do you want, Tango?
- You.

373
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:58,960
- To get me out of here.
- Life on the inside rough?

374
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:03,210
I'll call in a favor to the warden.
Maybe he can ease up a little.

375
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,945
What? He's a regular.

376
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:07,834
Sometimes I serve his pecan pie
with an extra scoop of caramel sauce,

377
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:08,946
complimentary like.

378
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:11,840
This was a frame job! I had
nothing to do with killing Blanche.

379
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,480
Why would I keep
the murder weapon in my Speedo?

380
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:17,705
Why don't you say that
and do a dance for the judge, Tango?

381
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:20,181
You had opportunity
and you had motive.

382
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:23,080
You told me that you were jealous
of the <i>Aqua Dolls</i>' headliner spot.

383
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:25,240
My jealousy has nothing
to do with them.

384
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:27,840
It stems from loving an art form
that doesn't love me back.

385
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,045
Why aren't you shining
your spotlight on Coral?

386
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:32,240
- It's what she's wanted all her life.
- Keep splashing.

387
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,765
There may have been two <i>Aqua Dolls</i>,
but it was really The Blanche Show.

388
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:38,655
She always put herself first.
Coral hated her for it.

389
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:42,520
Are you thinking she got tired of living
in big sissy's shadow and engineered it?

390
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,960
Coral launched Blanche
into the direction of that shark.

391
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,739
It's certainly a thing
to make you go...

392
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:50,430
<i>As Emerson Cod
let Sid Tango off the hook,</i>

393
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:54,280
<i>the private detective's suspicions
side-stroked back to the </i>Aquacade.

394
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:57,504
What's the matter with you?

395
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:59,004
I am warning you, ass.

396
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:02,520
Why don't you just take that trident
and stab me in the heart?

397
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,360
Pack your spandex. You're fired!

398
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:07,320
Everybody, chillax.
I can fix this.

399
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,104
Save it, centrabrains.//
You're as useless as teats on a boar.

400
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,178
Teats.

401
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:15,155
Coral, wait!

402
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,674
Can you believe the claws
on that sea monster?

403
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:22,720
Trying to pinch my <i>Aquacade</i>
and turn it into a vehicle for herself!

404
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,377
- Talent. They're like children.
- Do you know what she tried to pitch?

405
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,560
A one-woman tribute
to a chorus line!

406
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,338
- Don't you need a chorus and a line?
- She figured out a way around it!

407
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:32,640
The last thing I need
is another water dancer.

408
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:36,971
With Galveston Gus gone, the audience
is thirsting for a daredevil act.

409
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:38,855
Picture this.

410
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,939
A motorcycle, but it's on fire.

411
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:43,977
And there's a ramp,
20 feet high, on fire too.

412
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:45,640
- A rider appears...
- Also on fire?

413
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,008
Better. In chains.
She guns the engine,

414
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:50,109
soars off the ramp, through a hoop,

415
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:52,369
maybe flaming, maybe not.
I'll have to crunch the numbers.

416
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:54,560
- and then lands on the other side.
- She?

417
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:57,808
Yes, Coral or at least it was supposed
to be her until I canned her.

418
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,960
Still, don't you think that's an act
that will put butts in seats?

419
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,240
Absolutely and I've got another act
that butts absolutely love.

420
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,833
Of course, The <i>Darlings</i>' contract.

421
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:07,863
Some sticking points,
but no tsunami-sized.

422
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:08,998
- Whatever.
- Yes?

423
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:12,040
I came up with stuff they don't need,
to see if we could get away with it.

424
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,134
Charles sisters
are as easy as a lazy river.

425
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:17,040
It'd be my pleasure to have them aboard,
on one condition.

426
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:22,040
Great news.
Jimmy agreed to all of your demands.

427
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,226
The fresh lilacs?
The Egyptian cotton towels?

428
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,800
- The vodka fountain?
- The papers will be ready tomorrow.

429
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,422
But just so you know,
it all hinges on one thing.

430
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:31,860
Jimmy's gonna take the <i>Aquacade</i>
on a European tour,

431
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,120
signing means you'll go.

432
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
No way!
Who would take care of the birds?

433
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:38,347
Place flowers on Charlotte's grave?
And besides...

434
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,355
Lily has indulged me enough.

435
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,655
- So our answer is...
- Yes.

436
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,777
For the first time
since Charlotte died,

437
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:51,008
maybe it's OK
to leave sadness behind.

438
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:53,714
Start putting our happiness first.

439
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:55,920
What do you think?

440
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,481
I think Chuck... Charlotte,

441
00:22:58,658 --> 00:23:02,139
as you described her,
was a wonderful caring woman and she,

442
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:04,560
like me, would want you
to put your happiness first too.

443
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:08,240
I think we're all in agreement
when I say: "Swim on, <i>Mermaids</i>".

444
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:11,720
Oh, my... It's Coral!

445
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,467
Everybody stand back.

446
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:17,800
I was a lifeguard.

447
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:20,200
- Was she attacked?
- We saw the whole thing.

448
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,640
She chained herself up,
hopped on the chopper and rode it

449
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:24,840
like a Hell's Angel in drag
until she fell in.

450
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,059
It would have been funny
if it wasn't so tragic.

451
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,242
What the hell were you doing?

452
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:33,600
Jimmy. Is that you, Jimmy?

453
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:34,960
Yes!

454
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,079
I was just trying to show you
that I could do it.

455
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,920
That daredevil act that you wanted.

456
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,840
I will do anything if it means
getting back into the show.

457
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,989
Is that so wrong?

458
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:45,308
No, but let me tell you what is.

459
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:49,791
Your brother-in-law/manager's hands
all over your perky/heaving boobs.

460
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:52,200
This is a certified
life-saving position!

461
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:53,976
Get off me, you idiot!

462
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,400
I told you we were through!

463
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,307
For shame!

464
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:58,920
You've been doing the skinny-dip
with your sister's husband!

465
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
<i>At that moment, Lily Charles
had something in common</i>

466
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,520
<i>with a lifelong enemy.</i>

467
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:05,240
<i>Both were adulteresses.</i>

468
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,840
<i>Both had stolen men
their sisters loved.</i>

469
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,363
<i>Both were...</i>

470
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:10,508
Disgusting.

471
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,631
You put the Evel in Knievel, lady.

472
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:14,662
I guess the spotlight
wasn't the only thing

473
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:17,356
- you didn't wanna share with Blanche.
- You just wanted Trickle's pickle

474
00:24:17,396 --> 00:24:19,680
to yourself,
so you fed her to the sharks!

475
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,621
All right.

476
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:23,665
I admit that I slept with Shane
to spite my sister,

477
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:25,320
but I didn't kill her.

478
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,640
I loved her.
And now she's gone and...

479
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,094
where do I turn?

480
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:31,903
To us.

481
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:35,400
Coral, you will swim
with our act tonight.

482
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,243
What?

483
00:24:36,283 --> 00:24:39,262
In the past, whenever
I was incapacitated by grief,

484
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,666
getting back in the water
was the best cure.

485
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:44,080
It will heal you.
Isn't that right, Lily?

486
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,640
Really?

487
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,159
Think she's telling the truth, Cod?

488
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:50,078
Yeah. Too bad too,

489
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,263
'cause the jealous, crazy lady
that kills her sister

490
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:55,101
to be with the himbo brother-in-law
is always a welcome rest stop...

491
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,730
on the motive turnpike.

492
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,248
Maybe the rest stop's the same,
just on the other side of the road.

493
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:01,673
As in the himbo did it?

494
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:04,698
Wait. Where's the himbo?

495
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,560
The himbo getting away with murder!

496
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,680
Hasta, biatches!

497
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,120
The police searched Shane's van.
They found lard-laced hair gel

498
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,613
and some really
specific instructions

499
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:20,152
on how to clone
a remote controlled gate opener.

500
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,440
- The APB's already out.
- How are Lily and Vivian feeling?

501
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,532
Very well. Now for the big news.

502
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:29,483
The <i>Darling Mermaid Darlings</i>...
have picked up a third.

503
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:32,120
What?

504
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,150
- That was faked surprise.
- Yeah, it was.

505
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,520
Olive's been keeping me
informed on the Charles sister.

506
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,485
- How are they getting along?
- Vivian's her usual, sweet self.

507
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:42,139
Lily seems cautious,
but still professional.

508
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:43,976
And Coral is thrilled to have a job

509
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:46,200
that doesn't require her
a flame retardant one piece.

510
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,624
That is just great.

511
00:25:47,988 --> 00:25:50,007
Now, please,
please can I open my box?

512
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:51,391
I've been waiting all day!

513
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:54,318
My second attempt half birthday gift
for you to wear tomorrow night.

514
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:56,320
- I got us front row seats.
- Thank you.

515
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,966
Ned! Killers tickets and

516
00:26:00,174 --> 00:26:01,892
a top-notch tam.

517
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:03,440
Thank you.

518
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:07,376
It's the <i>Darling Mermaid Darlings</i>'
first professional appearance in years.

519
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,827
There's no way you can miss it,
especially now.

520
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,330
Here's the really...

521
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,760
juicy secret that not even
Olive Snook the spy knows.

522
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,120
The <i>Aquacade</i> is hitting the road
and Lily and Vivian are going with it.

523
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:20,581
- Road? What do you mean road?
- A bunch of them, really.

524
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,840
Downing Street, the autobahn,

525
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,743
the Champs Elysees.

526
00:26:26,024 --> 00:26:28,240
They're European, as in Europe.

527
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
That's right.

528
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:33,211
Didn't expect fake surprise,

529
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:35,714
but I didn't expect
stunned silence either.

530
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:42,140
- How could you let this happen?
- I did what you told me.

531
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,281
- I thought you'd be happy.
- Ned, they think I'm dead!

532
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:49,088
This has been bearable
because I've been keeping tabs on them.

533
00:26:49,128 --> 00:26:52,363
If they needed something,
I could help them or try and fix it.

534
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,047
While I'm completely removed,
I'm still part of their lives.

535
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:57,690
And how can I be part of their lives
if they're in Europe?

536
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:02,595
- This is a game changer.
- What game?

537
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:05,173
- This is not a game.
- No, it's not a game. It's my life.

538
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:08,040
And now you decided
to modify the rules,

539
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:10,760
I've gotta re-evaluate
which ones actually keep me here.

540
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:19,880
I'll just sit here and try
to concentrate on not throwing up.

541
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,856
Butterflies making you queasy?

542
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:25,104
What say we drown them
with a dip in the vodka fountain?

543
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,008
I never drink and dive.

544
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,320
It's disrespectful to the audience,

545
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,962
more importantly, to Vivian.

546
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:32,992
Where is she?

547
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:34,990
Meeting with the sound tech.

548
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,400
The underwater speaker
sounded muddy in rehearsal.

549
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:41,000
Well, let's hope
they solve it by show time.

550
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:44,173
<i>Coral had slept
with her own sister's husband.</i>

551
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>Lily had done the same
with her sister's fiancé.</i>

552
00:27:47,397 --> 00:27:49,439
<i>The symmetry made her feel
as if she were looking</i>

553
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:51,175
<i>at a reflection of herself.</i>

554
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:54,804
<i>And since herself
was what she hated most, </i>

555
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:56,480
<i>she rejected the mirror.</i>

556
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:59,880
Say, what is our choreography
at measure 120 again?

557
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,840
Are we reverse craning
into a ballet leg thrust?

558
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,919
- Full corkscrew first.
- I thought the corkscrew came last.

559
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,395
Hold it. That's right,
which makes you wrong.

560
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:13,107
The corkscrew comes last.
You're losing it, Lil.

561
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:14,794
I think I'll have
that nip after all.

562
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,440
- Sure?
- Hey, short round.

563
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,303
A little help with my bun.

564
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:25,000
- You've got something poking out.
- Leave it!

565
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,680
Sorry, but when I see a string,
I just...

566
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:32,677
- I have to yank it!
- Hey!

567
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,080
Holy gold lamé!

568
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,880
You're trying
to be a singular sensation!

569
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:42,586
You swam your way back to the <i>Aquacade</i>
by preying on Vivian's sympathy.

570
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:45,186
You tried to break up the <i>Darlings</i>
by stage frightening Lily

571
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:49,033
so you can rule the pool in a one-woman
chorus line. Where's the top hat?

572
00:28:49,073 --> 00:28:50,960
- I'm gonna shove it up your...
- Olive,

573
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:52,560
excuse us.

574
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,103
Did you know my sister
was born with a hole in her heart?

575
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,308
The doctors fixed it, but...

576
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:08,346
sometimes it leaks a bit
and stuff gets through...

577
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:10,725
stuff like you.

578
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,930
Vivian may think that a woman
who sleeps with her sister's husband

579
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,880
deserves a second chance,
but I don't.

580
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:18,551
You'll always be what you are...

581
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,640
a selfish, conniving wretch.

582
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,520
The <i>Darling Mermaid Darlings</i>

583
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:26,063
are a team that puts
each other first,

584
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,008
so get in your show boat...

585
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:30,799
and row it to hell.

586
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:34,732
This putting others first
that you're so proud of,

587
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:37,522
I assume it didn't apply
to your baby.

588
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:41,409
- I never had a baby.
- That's what Vivian said.

589
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:45,091
We were just making small talk
and I casually asked her

590
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,984
if you had a son
or a daughter and she...

591
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:49,280
told me
that neither of you had any children.

592
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,740
Isn't that strange?

593
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,739
The world's full of spinsters.

594
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,800
You know, 30 years ago, you and I

595
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:57,860
changed next to each other
after a show

596
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,904
and the seamstress
had to let out your costume,

597
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,942
the flippers didn't fit your feet
and you had that just...

598
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:06,002
knocked up glow about you.

599
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,591
And then you disappeared
for nine months.

600
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,431
So where's the kid, spinster?

601
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:15,814
And why are you hiding it
from Vivian?

602
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:17,963
Breathe another word
and it'll be your last!

603
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:20,320
- Now get out!
- You'll regret this.

604
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,445
- Coral had to cancel. She's sick.
- Then it's just us...

605
00:30:31,756 --> 00:30:33,786
as it really should be, I suppose.

606
00:30:33,994 --> 00:30:34,800
Ready?

607
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:36,120
I can't.

608
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,800
We've come this far.

609
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:43,357
This time, don't do it for me,

610
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:45,800
do it for you.

611
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:54,960
<i>Meanwhile, the </i>Darling Mermaid Darlings<i>'
one-man security detail</i>

612
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,209
<i>spied a lurking shadow.</i>

613
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,699
Hell, yeah.

614
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:05,520
<i>Which called to mind a murderous surfer
named Shane.</i>

615
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,601
Trickle, down on the ground!

616
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:10,680
Dead girl, don't you know
there's a killer on the loose?

617
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:14,360
Think again, fool!
Now, step out with your hands up!

618
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:26,160
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

619
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,669
- I asked you first.
- The person who's sneaking around

620
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,220
in the dark wearing a damn disguise

621
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,677
is usually the person
with the most explaining to do.

622
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:36,920
That'd be you, dead girl.

623
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:38,402
Well, I came up here...

624
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:40,880
to get a better vantage point
of Lily and Vivian swimming.

625
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,364
That's a lie. From my excellent vantage
point in the shadows,

626
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:45,520
I saw her take their music
out of the CD player.

627
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:47,822
I did not. Look, it's still in here.
Look. See?

628
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:50,960
Cause I put it back in there.
I feel really ashamed now. I'm so sorry.

629
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,866
You're also really lousy
at explaining things

630
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:55,011
cause the more you talk,
the more lost I get.

631
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:57,161
I was really happy
for Lily and Vivian until...

632
00:31:57,286 --> 00:31:58,959
their happiness
threatened my happiness.

633
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,856
So in a moment of weakness and panic,
I snook up here and I...

634
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:04,736
tried to sabotage their show
in the hope that they'd stay.

635
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,187
Despicable.

636
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:08,413
Now you.

637
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:12,126
I guess I must have thought
Chuck would try to do something rash,

638
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:14,260
so I came up here to stop her.

639
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,280
Here's the <i>Pie Hole</i> mellow mix
you asked me to get out of my car.

640
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,434
You know what I realized
on my full tilt run back up here?

641
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,159
First, there's a lot of steps
in this place.

642
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:25,560
The second, Lily never mentioned
a last minute music change.

643
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,218
There wasn't.

644
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:29,996
Pie boy here was gonna torpedo
their performance.

645
00:32:30,621 --> 00:32:32,479
How could you?

646
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:38,634
When Chuck's happiness was threatened
by Lily and Vivian's happiness,

647
00:32:38,674 --> 00:32:41,960
my happiness freaked out, I thought
Chuck would follow them to Europe.

648
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,310
I'm a solo guy by nature,

649
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:48,849
but I choose to affiliate myself
with the both of you.

650
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:50,463
The reason being...

651
00:32:50,848 --> 00:32:53,502
'cause when you spend all your time
chasing bad guys,

652
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,594
you want the best of the good guys
in your corner.

653
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:59,863
You two normally
are as solid as they come

654
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:03,100
because your moral compass
is always pointed due...

655
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,640
the right thing.

656
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,600
But clearly,

657
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:11,040
someone's been screwing
with both your magnetic fields

658
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,118
'cause the both of you seem
really lost right now.

659
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,957
So I'm gonna help you out
by personally escorting and...

660
00:33:15,997 --> 00:33:19,673
them physically ejecting both
of your asses from these premises.

661
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:21,421
Now, what do you think about that?

662
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:29,780
<i>At that moment, Charlotte Charles
walk of shame turned into triumph.</i>

663
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,036
<i>The beat of their happy hearts
and the blare of the underwater speakers</i>

664
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:02,762
<i>drowned out the sound
of impending doom.</i>

665
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:13,880
I did it for you, Coral!

666
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:15,840
Nobody asked you to, Shane.

667
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,520
You know what's great about
everyone's thinking that you're stupid?

668
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:21,720
They assume that you can't get away
with murder, but I did!

669
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:24,902
You also sent a shark
into the water while I was swimming.

670
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:26,641
Did you think about that, Professor?

671
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,920
Yes! It's why I smeared your costume

672
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,639
with protein secretions
of the Red Sea Moses sole.

673
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,560
A little-known shark repellent.

674
00:34:34,192 --> 00:34:36,400
Why don't you just drop
the microphone there, Trickle?

675
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:39,119
I plan to... in the pool!

676
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,437
Because the cord will shoot out
a current through the water

677
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:43,399
and electrocute the <i>Darlings</i>.

678
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:46,840
Once Lily and Vivian Charles are dead,
Jimmy will finally have

679
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,720
to make you the star of the show.
And that's all you ever wanted.

680
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:53,257
- Now I get it.
- Look at me, Coral!

681
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:55,320
It's all for you!

682
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,269
Dang!

683
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,606
<i>With the victory of the previous night
faded in the light of a conversation</i>

684
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,440
<i>- that had to be had.</i>
- Morning.

685
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:32,760
I hope that gift's not for me.
My half birthday is over.

686
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:36,560
The gifts I gave you before
only triggered crisis and misery.

687
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:38,542
Really? I hadn't noticed.

688
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,720
Give this one a shot?

689
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,822
I don't remember this picture.
I remember the day, but

690
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:51,800
not the shot.

691
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:53,800
Because I took it
with my junior instamatic.

692
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:55,702
It was the first time
I met your aunts.

693
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:57,455
They were buzzing through town

694
00:35:57,495 --> 00:35:59,627
on their way
to some far-off and fantastic place.

695
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,904
I had almost forgotten
those aunts, so...

696
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,120
thank you for reminding me.

697
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,490
Chuck, I tried very hard
to be a good boyfriend.

698
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,854
I believe that every day,
even in the smallest ways,

699
00:36:10,894 --> 00:36:12,920
I try to put your happiness
before my own.

700
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:15,040
Yeah, I agree
with that whole-heartedly.

701
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:18,240
I've been lying to you,

702
00:36:19,107 --> 00:36:20,680
not that it's any kind of excuse,

703
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,074
but I think it's because
I've been lying to myself too.

704
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,378
If Lily and Vivian knew
you were still alive

705
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:27,040
the only person
in danger would be me.

706
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,943
The danger itself is a lie.

707
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:32,952
It's irrational fear
in danger's clothing.

708
00:36:32,992 --> 00:36:35,252
It's whispering,
"Chuck loves her mother and aunt

709
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,061
so much she wouldn't want to spend
her life with you if she...

710
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:39,839
could be with them."

711
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,313
And so I put my happiness
first and...

712
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:46,141
told everyone that no-one could know
that you're alive again,

713
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,920
especially Lily and Vivian Charles.

714
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:51,315
- You didn't know what you were doing.
- I do now.

715
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:53,731
And now...

716
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,325
I'm finally putting
your happiness before my own.

717
00:37:08,496 --> 00:37:11,727
<i>At this very moment,
a life event was taking place.</i>

718
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:16,983
<i>Lily Charles had begun to experience
feelings that had become foreign.</i>

719
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:19,535
<i>These pleasant sensations...</i>

720
00:37:19,722 --> 00:37:20,760
<i>were not to last.</i>

721
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,389
Coral and I...

722
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:30,543
just had an illuminating
conversation,

723
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,360
one that helped me put together
the pieces of a 30-year-old mystery.

724
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,838
There was a part of me
that always knew,

725
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,479
but I wouldn't allow myself
to entertain such horrid thoughts

726
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,480
that my beloved sister

727
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:46,040
would go behind my back

728
00:37:46,422 --> 00:37:48,200
with my fiancé

729
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,680
and have a child.

730
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,080
It was Charlotte, wasn't it?

731
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,960
I tried thousands
of times to tell you,

732
00:37:58,403 --> 00:37:59,920
but I couldn't find a way to do it.

733
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:02,056
Why do you think
I hid from the world?

734
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,521
I was so ashamed I couldn't bear
to have anyone look at me.

735
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,360
I understand.
I can't bear to look at you either.

736
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:13,920
I took the liberty
of calling you a cab.

737
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:15,840
Where am I supposed to go?

738
00:38:16,356 --> 00:38:18,115
Anywhere but here.

739
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:24,005
You know, I have spent half a lifetime
trying to make amends.

740
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,614
I gave up the only man
I have ever loved,

741
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:31,611
as well as my beautiful
baby daughter,

742
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:34,914
because I knew the truth
would break your heart.

743
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:38,150
So I broke mine instead.

744
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:42,120
I did what I have done
since the day you were born...

745
00:38:43,676 --> 00:38:45,520
chose your happiness over mine.

746
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:47,800
You don't have to anymore.

747
00:38:50,646 --> 00:38:51,640
All right!

748
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,657
<i>At that very moment, time stopped,
as it is one to do</i>

749
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:06,243
<i>when present,
past and future collide.</i>

750
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:08,564
<i>When one's existence ceases</i>

751
00:39:08,604 --> 00:39:10,640
<i>to be measured in days,
hours and minutes,</i>

752
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,681
<i>but instead in the immeasurable
quantity of life events.</i>

753
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:19,115
<i>For Lily and Vivian Charles,
the reappearance of a daughter and niece</i>

754
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:22,000
<i>was a life event
that would eventually overshadow</i>

755
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,021
<i>a 30-year-old betrayal</i>

756
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,457
<i>and result in a splash of water,</i>

757
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,328
<i>the roar of the crowd
and a whirlwind tour</i>

758
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,555
<i>around the world... twice.</i>

759
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,900
<i>Private investigator Emerson Cod
would experience a life event</i>

760
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,828
<i>when life found him
through the pages of a pop-up book </i>

761
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:41,457
<i>and he was reunited
with his own Little Gum Shoe.</i>

762
00:39:41,497 --> 00:39:43,320
I'm looking for Emerson Cod.

763
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,720
<i>Jockey-cum-waitress-cum
private investigator Olive Snook</i>

764
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,657
<i>would experience
two life events in quick succession.</i>

765
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,440
<i>The first, opening her heart
to a formerly friendless taxidermist</i>

766
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:03,240
<i>and the second, by opening
a culinary palace dedicated</i>

767
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,968
<i> to the art of macaroni and cheese
called</i> The Intrepid Cow.

768
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,760
<i>For the pie maker
and the dead girl named Chuck,</i>

769
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:13,440
<i>their shared life event
began with a touch</i>

770
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,650
<i>and became the promise
of a new family, brought about</i>

771
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,360
<i>- by the words...</i>
- I'm alive.

772
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:24,853
<i>At that moment,
in the town of Coeur d'Coeurs,</i>

773
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:27,444
<i>events occurred that are not,
were not</i>

774
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:30,192
<i>and should never be
considered an ending.</i>

775
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:33,112
<i>For endings, as it is known,
are where we begin.</i>
