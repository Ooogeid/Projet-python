<i>Previously on
"Pushing Daisies"...</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,850
- You only got a minute.
- I know.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,089
- 60 seconds.
- I know.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,887
What if you didn't
have to be dead?

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,485
You touch murder victims,
you ask who killed them.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,612
You touch them again,
they go back to being dead,

7
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,042
- and you collect the reward ?
- Nobody can know.

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,991
- I can't even hug you ?
- You can't touch me.

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,942
- So a kiss is out of the question?
- Who's the funny girl stuck to Ned ?

10
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:28,450
Childhood sweetheart. He digs her in
a way he definitely doesn't dig you.

11
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,206
Thank you for bringing
me back to life.

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,715
People aren't used to
this sort of thing.

13
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:33,797
Issues of morality,
how come she's not dead anymore ?

14
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,822
You understand you can't see your aunts.
It'd be a disaster.

15
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,700
This pie smells delicious.

16
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,340
We recently lost our niece.

17
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:45,333
Your niece, Charlotte Charles, is dead ?
Presently ?

18
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:51,381
<i>Season 1 Episode
04, Pigeon</i>

19
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:59,562
<i>At this very moment, in the town
of North Thrush, young Ned was...</i>

20
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:02,931
<i>lonely.</i>

21
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:06,932
<i>Unable to make friends at the
Longburrow school for boys,</i>

22
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:09,361
<i>he often found himself
playing alone,</i>

23
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:14,282
<i>with nothing but memories of
happier times to keep his company.</i>

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,490
<i>What young Ned did not realize
was that, beyond the meadow</i>

25
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:21,662
<i>and under the
same orange sky,</i>

26
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,712
<i>someone he loved was
remembering him.</i>

27
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:29,381
<i>His dog, Digby.</i>

28
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:33,510
<i>In fact, three days prior,
Digby had made a decision.</i>

29
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:37,260
<i>Wearied by his own loneliness
back in Coeur d'Coeurs</i>

30
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:39,472
<i>and sensing his
master's sorrow,</i>

31
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,681
<i>Digby set out
on a mission.</i>

32
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:48,351
<i>Uncertain as to his
exact destination,</i>

33
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,833
<i>he ventured into
the great unknown,</i>

34
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:53,291
<i>guided only by the
compass of his heart.</i>

35
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:06,790
<i>Despite numerous distractions, Digby
was determined to find young Ned,</i>

36
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:10,212
<i>the boy who had given him
a second chance at life...</i>

37
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,553
<i>and who was his
best friend.</i>

38
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:25,433
<i>Upon doing so, Digby proved that
love can overcome any obstacle.</i>

39
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,101
<i>The reunion was
bittersweet, however,</i>

40
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:34,153
<i>as they instantly remembered the
restrictions of their friendship.</i>

41
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:39,783
<i>They could not touch,
or Digby would die.</i>

42
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,952
<i>Still, it was enough.</i>

43
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:57,971
<i>That day, Digby vowed he would
never again allow himself</i>

44
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>to be separated
from his master.</i>

45
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:07,440
<i>The pie maker did not wish
to be separated from Chuck,</i>

46
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>who, in turn, did not wish to
be separated from her aunts,</i>

47
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:17,652
<i>Lily and Vivian, who continued to
be challenged by social phobias.</i>

48
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,860
<i>Unbeknownst to
the pie maker,</i>

49
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:24,991
<i>Chuck secretly baked homeopathic mood
enhancers into pies for her aunts,</i>

50
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:29,290
<i>hoping that a slice a day would
herbally lift their spirits.</i>

51
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,671
- Oh, you're up early.
- Oh, I couldn't sleep.

52
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:35,132
- Lumpy mattress?
- Lumpy dreams.

53
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,561
Which are a lot more vivid now
than they were before I died.

54
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:39,521
- Isn't that interesting?
- Just one of those...

55
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:42,052
little things. What are those?

56
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:46,141
Oh, I, uh... got bit.

57
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,773
Those are beestings.
How'd you get stung by so many bees?

58
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,910
And what happened to
the bees that stung you?

59
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:54,071
- That's a suicide attack.
- Not in this case.

60
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:57,101
They, uh, sort of stung me,
died, then they flew away again,

61
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,822
and some other bees died.

62
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:05,203
Do you think their honey tastes
different 'cause they died?

63
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:08,831
Wouldn't that be interesting?
Just one of those little things.

64
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:11,213
I want to show you something.

65
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:22,802
What is it?

66
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,223
- Bees!
- Your bees.

67
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:25,840
My bees? You mean...

68
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:27,642
No, not those bees -- new bees.

69
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:31,891
Technically, still your bees, just...
not the bees that you knew.

70
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:34,481
But I'm sure they're
equally nice.

71
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,771
You do realize that beekeeping within
city limits is completely illegal.

72
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:41,363
Yes. And I'm almost
sure I don't care.

73
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,341
Well, I can not care
enough for the both of us.

74
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,083
We can plant wild
flowers on rooftops and

75
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,043
be unorthodox urban
honey pioneers.

76
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,292
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

77
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:58,662
If I could hug you right now --
I know that I can't, but --

78
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:00,422
Just know that I want to.

79
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:02,711
I do.

80
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:12,433
<i>As Chuck considered her future as an
unorthodox urban honey pioneer...</i>

81
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:17,441
<i>Olive Snook considered
how the man she loved</i>

82
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:20,031
<i>seemed to be in love
with someone else.</i>

83
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:27,873
<i>Her affection for the pie
maker had not wavered,</i>

84
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:32,080
<i>despite the romantic threat of
a dead girl who wasn't dead.</i>

85
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,661
I didn't know you
could do that.

86
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:39,212
<i>On the contrary,
Olive's resolve had only increased</i>

87
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,191
<i>since the realization that Chuck,
indeed, was supposed to be dead.</i>

88
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,211
Good morning !

89
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:47,010
Olive assumed Chuck had
faked her own death.

90
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,050
She would keep the
secret for now,

91
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:51,893
as Chuck kept her secret
from the pie maker.

92
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,602
There's a pie in my oven.

93
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,932
Oh, uh, that's mine.
I was practicing.

94
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:58,350
It smells like cheese.
Is it quiche ?

95
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,580
I baked monastery gouda into
the crust -- tart apple filling.

96
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,111
I thought I'd try it.

97
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,782
You know what would
be delicious ?

98
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:09,363
Pear with gruyère crust.
Bet that'd be real good.

99
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:11,333
Yeah, it would.

100
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:13,292
<i>Unbeknownst to Chuck,</i>

101
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:16,832
<i>Olive understood the deliciousness
of pear and gruyère...</i>

102
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:18,120
Thank you.

103
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:22,500
<i>...Because she secretly delivered
that first mood-enhancing pie</i>

104
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:26,423
<i>to aunts Lily and Vivian,
as she would deliver this one...</i>

105
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,721
<i>...But not before a
collision occurred.</i>

106
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:33,600
Oh ! I think she's dead !

107
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,233
Can you feel a heartbeat ?

108
00:06:35,565 --> 00:06:37,980
I don't... do heartbeats.

109
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,522
Well, they feel like this.
Come here.

110
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:47,650
Thump, thump. Thump, thump.
Thump, thump. Thump, thump.

111
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:51,072
Is that a dead bird?

112
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,503
Why are you touching a dead bird?
Throw that away.

113
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:55,593
It's swimming with disease,
and you serve food.

114
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:58,551
Don't be such a drama queen.
Besides, it doesn't look diseased.

115
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:01,333
It's dead, and it's a bird.
It's diseased.

116
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,632
It's a miracle bird!
It's swimming in miracles, not disease!

117
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:11,402
- Maybe I should hold it.
- Oh, no, really, do you have to?

118
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:13,183
She's obviously
been through a lot,

119
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,123
and she seems really
happy to be here.

120
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,873
<i>Having brought a dead
thing back to life,</i>

121
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,602
<i>the pie maker fretted over
which pint-sized animal</i>

122
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:24,611
<i>would pay for that
life with its own.</i>

123
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:28,463
- I wonder how she lost her wing.
- Doesn't seem to be in any pain.

124
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:31,540
She's probably not in pain.
But what do I know ? I'm not a bird.

125
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:32,702
- Pigeon.
- Pigeon.

126
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,383
Uh, pigeon-toed as a child,
but orthopedic shoes solved that.

127
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,241
Yeah.

128
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:40,090
What is the rate of exchange
on the life of a bird ?

129
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:43,261
'Cause if it's equal to or greater than
mine, I need to get back to my car.

130
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,423
I'm more concerned
for that squirrel.

131
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:50,721
Don't you worry.
I know just what to do with you.

132
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,982
I recently made the acquaintance
of a pair of bird lovers.

133
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:55,140
I'll consult them.

134
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:58,030
<i>Olive was referring to
aunts Lily and Vivian.</i>

135
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:00,351
Really? I used to know
a pair of bird lovers.

136
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:03,853
<i>Chuck also referred
aunts Lily and Vivian.</i>

137
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:06,110
Used to ? Did they die ?

138
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:09,690
- A death was involved.
- How unfortunate.

139
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:12,783
<i>They were both so busy
referring and inferring,</i>

140
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,491
<i>they failed to notice that
60 seconds had passed.</i>

141
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:19,910
<i>The pie maker could not
afford such a luxury.</i>

142
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,000
It's raining dead birds !

143
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:30,050
What's going on up there ?

144
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:35,056
<i>What was going on up
there was this --</i>

145
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,565
<i>an out-of-control crop
duster crashed headfirst</i>

146
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:43,697
<i>into the Broadview luxury apartment
complex, killing the
pilot instantly.</i>

147
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,980
<i>His body was catapulted
out of the cockpit</i>

148
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:50,402
<i>and into the living room
of one Conrad Fitch.</i>

149
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:55,032
Does this -- oh --
does this qualify as ambulance-chasing ?

150
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:57,171
I'm asking without
any judgment at all.

151
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:59,923
If you're asking without any judgment,
then, yes, it does.

152
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,152
- Look for body bags.
- That's not our thing.

153
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,373
Your thing is waking
up dead people.

154
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:07,052
My thing is finding dead
people for you to wake up.

155
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,543
Ooh, found one.

156
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,562
Why can't we just be here as
concerned citizens of the world ?

157
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,590
Because big daddy
needs some new yarn.

158
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,862
Just because there's a dead body
doesn't mean you're gonna get paid.

159
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:19,780
Just because there's vodka in my
freezer doesn't mean I have to drink it.

160
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,890
- Wait, yes, it does.
- He's not wrong.

161
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,821
Plane crashes into a building --
could mean a civil suit, criminal suit,

162
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:27,573
negligence, pain and suffering,
negligent pain and suffering.

163
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:30,451
<i>Chuck fostered her love of
the law by volunteering</i>

164
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:33,280
<i>as a stay-at-home juror
for a paraplegic judge.</i>

165
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:36,113
We the jury find the
defendant guilty.

166
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:39,071
Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:42,790
<i>Unable to catch
Chuck when she fell,</i>

168
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:46,293
<i>the pie maker was
forced to step aside,</i>

169
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,542
<i>allowing another
man to catch her.</i>

170
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:55,263
- Thank you.
- Forgive the mess.

171
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:58,893
The maid comes tomorrow.
Guess I should cancel that.

172
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:01,192
- Do you live here?
- Until very recently.

173
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:03,021
Can you put her down, please?

174
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:08,023
At least your collection of
nautical plates survived.

175
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:13,443
Those were franklin mint.

176
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:15,901
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

177
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:19,823
I was feeling like I needed
to simplify my life, anyway.

178
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:23,870
<i>Chuck's heart went out to the man
with the plane in his living room,</i>

179
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>despite the pie maker wanting
her heart for himself.</i>

180
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:31,131
<i>Suddenly, ambulance-chasing
didn't seem like a bad idea.</i>

181
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,302
- The ambulance is leaving.
- Oh, you go ahead.

182
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:36,771
I'm gonna stay here,
see if there's anything I can do.

183
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:39,272
I'm sure he's fine. Statistically
speaking, his day can only improve.

184
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:41,860
Dead pilot, on the other hand,
probably has lots of last wishes.

185
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,231
Yeah, like maybe he wished
he'd have turned left.

186
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:46,362
- You don't need me for that.
- She's got a point.

187
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,242
- But --
- Don't argue with the woman.

188
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:50,150
We got a dead guy to talk to.

189
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:56,943
<i>The facts were these -- one Bradan
Caden, an agricultural aviator,</i>

190
00:10:57,287 --> 00:11:02,280
<i>was 53 years, 21 weeks, 5 days,
6 hours, and 19 minutes old,</i>

191
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:07,080
<i>when his crop duster collided with
the Broadview luxury
apartment complex.</i>

192
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:12,502
<i>It was 17 minutes after the collision
that Mr. Caden's insurance agent</i>

193
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,640
<i>had already rejected the
claim on his life policy</i>

194
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,383
<i>before the claim
was even made.</i>

195
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:21,041
Did you see the way he
just swept in there ?

196
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,362
- Yeah, so ?
- I don't sweep. I'm not a sweeper.

197
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:25,611
- Yeah, it's a little showy.
- It's a lot showy.

198
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:27,781
And what's a rooftop full
of bees compared to someone

199
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,240
who can catch her when she falls ?
I can't catch her, Emerson.

200
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,023
Can't suck on her
toes, neither.

201
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:35,152
Some women like that.

202
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,902
<i>Bradan Caden's wife, Becky, believed
her husband was not suicidal</i>

203
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:43,701
<i>and was, in fact,
a happy man.</i>

204
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:45,533
He was a happy man.

205
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:49,621
These insurance people making
assumptions about a person's
disposition --

206
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,373
one should never assume.

207
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:54,561
An insurance agent can't speak
to the deceased's state of mind.

208
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:57,301
They didn't know the deceased.
You did.

209
00:11:57,595 --> 00:11:59,983
Pardon me. I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

210
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:01,463
I believe I could be helpful.

211
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:03,392
May I have a word with you ?

212
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,850
Why are you bothering
this poor woman ?

213
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,393
You and that white boy got
some kind of shifty going on ?

214
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:15,231
I don't know what,
but you're shifty.

215
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:17,451
I'm here as a concerned
citizen of the world.

216
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,692
You making a dime,
concerned citizen ?

217
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:21,593
Maybe one or two
to rub together.

218
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:25,701
Well, then, flies land on me,
they pay rent.

219
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:34,881
Excuse me. I'm just gonna...

220
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:46,050
Hello.

221
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:48,232
Are you the fellow that
jumped on my plane ?

222
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:49,962
No. A fellow jumped
on your plane?

223
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:51,273
I was hijacked.

224
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,161
Is that why your
plane crashed ?

225
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,773
Oh, yes, sirree.

226
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,482
Mr. Caden.

227
00:12:56,865 --> 00:12:59,152
I was dusting soybeans,
or getting ready to,

228
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:02,090
and Dippy in a prison-orange
jumpsuit climbed aboard.

229
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,250
Dippy was on board when
your plane crashed?

230
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,463
But you were the only dead Dippy --
body -- they found.

231
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:08,332
Then Dippy's not dead.
Lucky him.

232
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,873
- What in the hell ?
- The plane was hijacked.

233
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,623
How'd you come by that ?

234
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:18,090
DNA-ish.

235
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:24,512
<i>Olive Snook came to Coeur
d'Coeurs on a wing and a prayer.</i>

236
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,470
<i>With a gilded cage housing the
monowinged bird in one hand</i>

237
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,022
<i>and a pie box in the other, she set
out to expose Charlotte Charles,</i>

238
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:36,903
<i>also known as "Chuck,"
as a faker of deaths.</i>

239
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:42,283
Mm-hmm. It's a carrier pigeon.

240
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:44,151
Diseases or messages?

241
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:47,033
Both.

242
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,281
A bird with gossip.
How exciting.

243
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:52,041
Do you open other
people's mail ?

244
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,923
Well, who's the people and
how hard is it to open ?

245
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:58,041
I don't know where
that came from.

246
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,981
- What's gotten into you ?
- What's gotten into you ?

247
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:05,553
<i>What had gotten into both of them
was their niece's homeopathic pie.</i>

248
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,892
<i>As with any
mood stabilizer,</i>

249
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,802
<i>moods were a bit
inconsistent at the start.</i>

250
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,560
Do you think you can fix her ?

251
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,783
She'll only go out there
and get hurt again.

252
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:16,661
Coyotes will have
their way with her.

253
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,480
She was meant to fly.

254
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:21,803
She needs to fulfill her destiny
and deliver that message.

255
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,820
A bird that stalks
down his narrow cage

256
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,030
can seldom see through
his bars of rage !

257
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:35,580
- It wouldn't hurt to try.
- That's the spirit.

258
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:38,752
And once we fix pidge,
we can celebrate --

259
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,422
by taking a trip
to the pie hole.

260
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:44,162
It's a nifty spot with
lots of interesting folks.

261
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,473
You never know who
you might run into.

262
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:50,091
<i>With that,
Olive Snook set her plan in motion.</i>

263
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:53,810
Why would we go out for pie
when you just brought us one ?

264
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,600
I'll think of a reason.

265
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:01,943
<i>While Olive Snook considered how to
get Lily and Vivian out of
their rut,</i>

266
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,070
<i>the pie maker was considering
worst-case scenarios,</i>

267
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:09,111
<i>not only for a rogue hijacker,
who he had been hired</i>

268
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,282
<i>to find by Becky Caden,
but for Chuck and the man</i>

269
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,011
<i>who caught her in a way
the pie maker never could.</i>

270
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,543
They're not here. This is bad.

271
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,842
- Maybe they went for a stroll.
- That would not make it better.

272
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,142
Well, what's worse --
the two of them locked up

273
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,971
in the trunk of a hijacker's car or
sipping mimosas in a hotel room ?

274
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,350
I'm not a fan of either scenario,
and what's that smell ?

275
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,130
I thought it might
be your cologne.

276
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,513
- Who wears cologne?
- I wear cologne!

277
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:38,273
Look. They had coffee.

278
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,813
Ohh!

279
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,613
There's something bad in there.

280
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:49,653
Is that the hijacker ?

281
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,361
What kind of fool hijacker hides
himself in a damn coffee table ?

282
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:03,002
Damn gout.

283
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,721
Aah, I'm so cramped,
I feel like I'm stuffed in a trunk.

284
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,102
You are stuffed in a trunk.

285
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,350
Don't contradict an old man.
It's disrespectful.

286
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:11,482
- Did you hijack that plane ?
- What plane?

287
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:14,272
Oh, hell's fire.
That thing flew into my apartment!

288
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,141
- This is your apartment ?
- What'd I just say ?

289
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,770
There I was,
enjoying my daily prunes

290
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,561
and the psyllium powder
and hoping for the best.

291
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,050
And suddenly,
I see that thing flying at me.

292
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,782
If this is your apartment,
then who is Conrad ?

293
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,822
What is this --
the idiot brigade ?

294
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,451
Hello.

295
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,410
Oh.

296
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,412
Do you like pie ?

297
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:41,751
It would be criminal
not to like pie.

298
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:49,463
Everything I am,
everything I was, everything that

299
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:52,170
represented me as a
human being was in there.

300
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:55,302
- I have to start over.
- I lost everything once.

301
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,861
- And you know what ?
- Did a plan into your living room?

302
00:16:57,895 --> 00:16:59,311
- No.
- Well, was it arson ?

303
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:02,361
No, it was something else, but I
felt a queer thrill of opportunity.

304
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,062
To get new stuff ?

305
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:06,411
To let go of everything
about me that I didn't like

306
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,843
and to hold onto everything
about me that I did.

307
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,943
Well, I've just met you,
but I...

308
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:14,381
can't imagine anything about you
that isn't something to like.

309
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:19,200
<i>Chuck's first thought was to
quickly pull her hand away.</i>

310
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:24,923
<i>Her second thought was how nice it
felt to have someone hold her hand.</i>

311
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:27,672
Oh. Sorry.

312
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,841
Was that your
boyfriend back there,

313
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:33,551
the one who took a step
back to let you fall ?

314
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:35,050
He didn't let me fall.

315
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:38,021
It was actually a very
affectionate gesture in context.

316
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,681
<i>If it was only the
pie maker's hand.</i>

317
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:44,022
Can I ask you a small favor ?

318
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,442
Would you hold my hand
just for a moment, but

319
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:51,211
don't say anything?
And I'm gonna close my eyes.

320
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:54,153
All right.

321
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:13,710
<i>In that moment, Chuck was
holding the pie maker's hand...</i>

322
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:18,143
<i>...if only by proxy.</i>

323
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,602
<i>It was the proxy that
concerned the pie maker.</i>

324
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,351
I got to pee.

325
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,901
- How did it go ?
- Where did he go ?

326
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,483
Conrad? He was going
to the bathroom.

327
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,323
He's not Conrad.
He's the hijacker.

328
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:40,913
And he's going to the
bathroom in my kitchen.

329
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:42,902
Boy, you miss one
trip to the morgue...

330
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:07,233
Is this the hand
you were holding ?

331
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:15,422
Well, he's a great big fibber,
then, isn't he ?

332
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:18,832
A great big fibber, whose hand you
were holding. What's that about ?

333
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,411
I was -- if you must know...

334
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,042
I was pretending I
was holding your hand.

335
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,171
Is that supposed to
make me feel better ?

336
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,870
Well... yeah.

337
00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:30,550
Oh, well, on one hand,
it does make me feel better.

338
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,472
On the other hand --
the hand you were holding -- it doesn't.

339
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,040
Ned, he's an escaped convict.

340
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:35,972
You didn't know that
when you held his hand.

341
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,942
And P.S.,
Not only is he an escaped convict --

342
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,101
he's also a hijacker who's
prevented thousands of crops

343
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,800
from being aerially fertilized.

344
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:44,443
And he stuffed a surly
old dead guy in a trunk.

345
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:47,112
I'm not saying thate isn't guilty,
and I'm not saying that I am.

346
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,141
I'm just sayin that
it's not about him.

347
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:51,953
No, it's about our client,
Becky Caden, wife of Bradan Caden,

348
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:55,732
the woman your handyman when he decided
to crop-dust someone's living room.

349
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:59,531
- Did you catch him ?
- That one-armed bitch was speedy.

350
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:02,003
But I checked in with my
people at the prison.

351
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:03,730
You got "people" ?
That's so neat.

352
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,840
- Did you find out anything good ?
- Yes.

353
00:20:05,878 --> 00:20:07,583
And we're gonna need shovels.

354
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:12,622
<i>Emerson Cod had learned
three things --</i>

355
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,632
<i>first, the man they
knew as Conrad Fitch</i>

356
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,800
<i>was actually one
Lemuel Winegard,</i>

357
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:22,932
<i>a low-level employee of a
company called Ornan energy.</i>

358
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:26,432
<i>Second, Ornan was an
energy-based corporation</i>

359
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:32,443
<i>known for several types of trading --
plastics, steel, and insider.</i>

360
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,982
<i>The latter cost lemuel
his right hand.</i>

361
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,690
Aah !

362
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:40,362
Aah !

363
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:42,492
<i>It also cost him
his freedom.</i>

364
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:48,412
<i>Third, during his incarceration,
Lemuel became known as "Lefty Lem,"</i>

365
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,870
<i>a name given to him by his cellmate,
Jackson Lucas,</i>

366
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,420
<i>an infamous diamond thief,
whose final escapade resulted</i>

367
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,501
<i>in a buried treasure that
was never recovered...</i>

368
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,972
<i>...even after he died.</i>

369
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,182
<i>He ended up in a prison
graveyard with his secret.</i>

370
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:15,402
Oh, so Lefty Lem was a
white-collar criminal.

371
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,403
That makes much more sense.

372
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,890
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Gonna get paid once by the pilot's widow

373
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:24,712
when we prove her husband's
death wasn't a suicide --

374
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:27,030
dead bodies always
lead to paydays.

375
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,122
Yeah, yeah,
"vodka in the freezer."

376
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:31,973
Gonna get paid twice by the feds
when they give us the reward

377
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:34,431
for kicking lefty's ass back to
the clink, where he belongs.

378
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:35,713
Looking forward to that.

379
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,082
And gonna get paid thrice by
finding Jackson's buried booty.

380
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:41,710
Hey !

381
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:43,721
Hey.

382
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:47,720
Come to papa.

383
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,642
Wait. You might want
to avert your eyes.

384
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:57,992
There's a good chance
he'll be on the dewy side.

385
00:21:58,027 --> 00:22:00,900
- Damn. I hate dewy.
- Are you mad at me?

386
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:03,690
Why would I be mad ?

387
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:06,321
For holding someone's
hand that wasn't yours.

388
00:22:06,496 --> 00:22:08,700
Seriously, in a
prison graveyard --

389
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,462
that's where y'all are gonna
have this conversation ?

390
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,543
You should, uh,
breathe through your mouths.

391
00:22:22,597 --> 00:22:24,561
I would have preferred
a little more eyeball.

392
00:22:24,596 --> 00:22:25,891
Just touch the damn thing.

393
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:27,891
- No, wait.
- For what ?

394
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,801
A little dignity.

395
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:36,313
Thanks.

396
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:44,573
I can't see anything!
Am I blind ?

397
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,332
The good news is,
you're not blind.

398
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:47,820
Bad news is, you're dead.

399
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,291
Makes blind seem like a walk
in the park, doesn't it ?

400
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,020
Where'd you bury your loot,
Jack ?

401
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,871
Ha ! Why should I tell you ?

402
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:57,522
Good karma.
It's like currency in the afterlife.

403
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,003
In the old windmill
on the Vonroenn farm,

404
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,001
at the bottom of the stairs.

405
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:05,941
- How much that worth ?
- Plenty.

406
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:07,671
Ask him about Lefty.

407
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:09,692
Did you tell him
where you buried it ?

408
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:12,552
Of course I did.
Owed him that much.

409
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:15,972
- What did you owe him for ?
- Keeping the fire alive.

410
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:20,023
All right,
we got a windmill to find.

411
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,862
<i>Chuck's fire may
not be alive,</i>

412
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:26,150
<i>as far as her aunts Lily
and Vivian were concerned,</i>

413
00:23:26,408 --> 00:23:29,201
<i>but Olive was doing her
best to reignite it.</i>

414
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,532
- Brackets.
- Brackets.

415
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,241
- Ribbon.
- Ribbon.

416
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,543
- Bejeweler.
- Bejeweler.

417
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:42,712
- Can I do one ?
- Maybe the last one.

418
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:46,243
If you like, we could bejewel
Pidge's birdhouse when we're done.

419
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:48,130
Pidge's house is
only temporary.

420
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,171
No sense in bejeweling an empty home,
is there, pidge ?

421
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:53,722
There's something so sad
about an empty birdhouse.

422
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:56,611
When one of our birds dies,
we taxiderm it immediately --

423
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:58,320
put it right back on its perch.

424
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:00,651
Vivian does wonders
with sand and thread.

425
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:04,063
And little marble eyes. It's like
our birds never left us at all.

426
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:06,340
You can't put everything
back on its perch.

427
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:11,431
It must have been all kinds of
horrible for you when Charlotte left.

428
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:14,662
She didn't leave. She died.

429
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,620
And no amount of sand or thread

430
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,373
or little marble eyes
will ever bring her back.

431
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:23,172
<i>But Olive didn't
need sand or thread</i>

432
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:25,952
<i>or little marble eyes
to bring Chuck back.</i>

433
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,423
<i>She needed a
confluence of events.</i>

434
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,050
Wing.

435
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,183
<i>And she was about
to get one.</i>

436
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:37,720
Wing.

437
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:41,271
Can I do the last bejewel ?

438
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:43,150
I already did it.

439
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:47,982
Oh !

440
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,283
What do you think, Pidge ?

441
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:55,322
<i>And while Olive,
the aunts, and Pidge</i>

442
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,420
<i>looked forward to the next
step in their journey,</i>

443
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:02,372
<i>another journey had
reached a dead end.</i>

444
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:04,710
Is she dead ?

445
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:08,000
Lefty Lem has officially
taken the lead.

446
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:12,383
Do you think fake
Conrad killed her?

447
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,732
Ockham's Razor --
all things being equal,

448
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:16,733
the simplest solution
tends to be the best one.

449
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,980
I used to believe that until you
brought me back from the dead --

450
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:20,471
kind of screws the theory.

451
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:33,742
Maybe your finger
needs a new battery.

452
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,703
Here, let me try.

453
00:25:35,997 --> 00:25:37,203
Ow !

454
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,990
- He did it.
- He did it.

455
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:43,250
Oh! I must have dozed off again.
Uh, can I help you ?

456
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:46,303
We're looking for a windmill,
a Vonroenn-variety windmill.

457
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,631
Oh, that's funny.

458
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:51,261
A young man was just in here,
asking about the Vonroenn mill.

459
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,632
He didn't happen to have one arm,
did he ?

460
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:56,091
- As a matter of fact, he did.
- Ockham's!

461
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:57,973
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

462
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,821
The windmill -- what happened to it ?
Razed, wrecked, rebuilt, removed ?

463
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:04,642
Retired. No farm, no use.

464
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:08,403
Got shipped off to "narm"
some 20 years ago.

465
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:11,451
Why did they send it to Nam?
Did the vietnamese need windmills ?

466
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:14,191
N.A.R.M. --
National area of retired mills.

467
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:19,280
The Vonroenn mill has been preserved
for an historical landmark.

468
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:21,950
I have a map here.

469
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:29,962
Now, that's narcoleptic.
Necrophiliac's the other one.

470
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,590
Yeah.

471
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,952
<i>Armed with a new plan,
the pie maker and associates</i>

472
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,891
<i>left the narcoleptic
curator to her dreams.</i>

473
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:40,353
<i>Meanwhile, back in
Coeur d'Coeurs,</i>

474
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,350
<i>a tiny friend was
planning her own escape.</i>

475
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,642
<i>Olive's disdain for chuck
was split in two --</i>

476
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:49,400
<i>one for stealing the
pie maker's heart</i>

477
00:26:49,777 --> 00:26:52,022
<i>and the other for
breaking the aunts'.</i>

478
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,121
You know you want to
read Pidge's message.

479
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:56,072
Lily would be so displeased.

480
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:59,362
There was an incident.

481
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,873
I read something that I shouldn't have,
and then life

482
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,200
went horribly awry.

483
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:10,581
Lily never forgave me.
She said she did, but she didn't.

484
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:14,090
Wow. Now I'm more
interested in that story.

485
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,300
Let's put Pidge back
into her house.

486
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,590
Pidge has left the building.
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:23,933
I'm sorry her empty
birdhouse makes you sad.

488
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:27,231
Maybe you could fill it with
all your Charlotte sadness

489
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:30,400
and hang it in a special
place in your soul.

490
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:34,323
That's an awfully sad birdhouse
to have hanging in one's soul.

491
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,280
Hang it someplace you
don't have to see it.

492
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:39,991
It won't always be sad.

493
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:43,132
It'll be the happiest little
birdhouse when you're ready.

494
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,792
Make a little
birdhouse in your soul.

495
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,962
Don't encourage her.

496
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,210
I think she looks divine.

497
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,301
Son of a bitch.

498
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:04,681
Wait ! You forgot your message !
Pidge !

499
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:07,771
Pidge, wait !
You forgot your message !

500
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,901
<i>As the aunts watched
Olive scream for help...</i>

501
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:15,440
Pidge ! Help me ! Pidge !

502
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:17,450
<i>...They considered
their own birdcage</i>

503
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:20,381
<i>and wondered if they were
ready to leave it behind.</i>

504
00:28:20,957 --> 00:28:22,701
<i>A few miles away...</i>

505
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:26,792
<i>looking out across
the fields and hills,</i>

506
00:28:27,086 --> 00:28:29,122
<i>a beautiful woman
named Elsita</i>

507
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:32,752
<i>waited for the man she loved
to make her heart complete.</i>

508
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:38,590
<i>Little did she know Lefty
Lem was already on his way.</i>

509
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:40,720
What the hell do you want ?

510
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:43,841
I'm from the papen county
historical society.

511
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:47,140
We'd like to photograph these
premises for our 87th annual

512
00:28:47,478 --> 00:28:50,170
"mills of the wind" papen
county collector's calendar.

513
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:53,770
- Where's your camera ?
- It's in the car.

514
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:56,021
You're lying.

515
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,112
But I'm bored.

516
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,203
I'm your only friend

517
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:13,462
I'm not your only friend but
I'm a little glowing friend

518
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:17,920
but, really,
I'm not actually your friend but I am

519
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:20,802
blue canary in the outlet
by the light switch

520
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:23,383
who watches over you

521
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:26,641
make a little
birdhouse in your soul

522
00:29:26,936 --> 00:29:28,680
not to put too
fine a point on it

523
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:31,560
say I'm the only
bee in your bonnet

524
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:36,272
make a little birdhouse
in your sou-u-u-u-l

525
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:40,481
Never mind the singing.
Keep your eye on that bird.

526
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:47,161
You know what our problem is.

527
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,342
If you're referring to
the touching thing,

528
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:51,590
I see it as more of an
obstacle than a problem.

529
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,803
- It's a pretty big obstacle.
- Not compared to our other problems.

530
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:56,260
- We've got "other problems" ?
- I'm gonna kill myself.

531
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,243
There's so much I'm
learning about you.

532
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:01,003
- Such as ?
- You're romantic.

533
00:30:01,388 --> 00:30:02,882
When the mood strikes.

534
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:04,852
And you're jealous
when the mood strikes.

535
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,283
Everyone's a little jealous.

536
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:09,202
I mean, if you're not a little jealous,
you're probably...

537
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,602
- Can we not talk about this ?
- The answer to your query is "yes."

538
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:14,891
No, actually,
I want to talk about this.

539
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:17,621
I could let it go,
but like the cat, it will come back,

540
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:19,700
which I wouldn't call annoying,
but there's no really great way

541
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:22,200
of saying "half annoying,"
which it is a little bit.

542
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,690
See ? Isn't this neat ?

543
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,083
Here we were,
thinking all we had was one big problem,

544
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,092
when, in actual fact,
we have hundreds of little problems

545
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,213
that we got to sort out before
we even get to the big problem,

546
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,792
which means we're like
everybody else in the world.

547
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:34,912
Except I still can't catch you.

548
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,880
Yeah, we taking
two cars next time.

549
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:43,550
That's a big ax.

550
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:45,703
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt you.
I promise.

551
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,941
This is, uh,
just a precautionary measure.

552
00:30:48,686 --> 00:30:52,562
Wouldn't it be easier if you put
the ax down, then tied the rope ?

553
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,151
It's funny --
you really are a one-armed bandit.

554
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,621
Your name's not McClapping, is it ?
As in "the sound of one hand"...

555
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:05,740
No.

556
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:08,821
'Cause names are destiny.
If you think "Dwayne Cloggin"

557
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:11,592
ain't gonna grow up to be a plumber,
then you just think again.

558
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:15,411
Oh, no, you didn't use bows
to tie me up, did you ?

559
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:18,002
You take a hostage like
you tie your sneakers.

560
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,631
What is your problem ?

561
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:23,131
Well, I was born into
the life of windmillery.

562
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,391
Are you gonna listen,
or are you gonna keep knocking?

563
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,431
I'm listening. You were born
into the life of windmillery.

564
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:32,771
Always waiting on the wind to show up,
so you can start work,

565
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:35,973
and I'm no good at waiting.
I'm tired of it.

566
00:31:36,318 --> 00:31:39,143
You sure it was the wind that
you were a-waiting for ?

567
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:43,271
Did you just say "a-waiting" ?

568
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,162
'Cause if you are mimicking me,

569
00:31:45,197 --> 00:31:48,041
I will be out of these girly bows
faster than a snake through weeds!

570
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:49,912
I wasn't thinking,
and I apologize.

571
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:53,653
It's just, well, I have a lot on my
mind, and I'm in a bit of a rush.

572
00:31:53,876 --> 00:31:55,661
Oh, where you rushing to ?

573
00:31:57,837 --> 00:31:59,792
Well, I don't really know yet.

574
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,580
Well, maybe you better
figure that out.

575
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,433
Go back to your knocking.

576
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,812
Come on, Pidge !
You can do it !

577
00:32:24,157 --> 00:32:26,480
Not even a breeze
to help poor Pidge,

578
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:30,741
which is kind of ironic, given the
surroundings. Pidge ! Come on !

579
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:35,452
<i>The pigeon, growing fatigued with
each flap of her taxidermied wing,</i>

580
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,833
<i>knew something the
others did not.</i>

581
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:41,831
<i>Her journey was
almost complete.</i>

582
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:44,542
Oh.

583
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:48,801
- What was that ?
- It's my bird !

584
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:57,641
That's my bird.

585
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,702
What are you on about ?
It's my bird.

586
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:01,442
I'll prove it.
I wrote the note.

587
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,233
Where's the note ?

588
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:04,862
Hello ?

589
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,662
Can I get my bird back,
please ?

590
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:07,941
- Your bird?
- Your bird?

591
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,003
Yes, my bird.
She's a carrier pigeon.

592
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:13,180
She has a message, and she has
to carry it. It's what she does.

593
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,870
That's my message.

594
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:19,082
- Elsa ?
- I'm Elsita.

595
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:22,083
- Jackson ?
- I'm Lem.

596
00:33:22,378 --> 00:33:24,002
Elsa was my mama.

597
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:26,000
Jackson was my prison bunkmate.

598
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,293
- Is "bunkmate" a euphemism for --
- Not in this case, ma'am.

599
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:32,610
<i>There was a bitter chill
in the air the night</i>

600
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:35,761
<i>Jackson Lucas found refuge
in the Vonroenn windmill.</i>

601
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:40,023
<i>Already five days on the lam,
he knew the police were closing in.</i>

602
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:44,521
<i>To preserve his dreams of one day
owning an art gallery in Mexico,</i>

603
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:47,443
<i>jackson decided to bury
his stolen treasure</i>

604
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:50,822
<i>in the staircase of the
seemingly abandoned property.</i>

605
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,321
<i>His heart
stopped, however,</i>

606
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:57,830
<i>when he saw an angelic creature
descending the stairs.</i>

607
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:01,701
<i>Her name was Elsa,
and this was her windmill.</i>

608
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,172
My name is Elsa.
This is my windmill.

609
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,712
<i>It was love at
first sight.</i>

610
00:34:08,098 --> 00:34:11,380
<i>Knowing he had very little time left,
he kissed her.</i>

611
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,841
<i>It was a perfect moment.</i>

612
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,930
<i>The next moment was not.</i>

613
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,022
I'll write you !

614
00:34:24,435 --> 00:34:26,651
<i>Elsa kept true
to her word.</i>

615
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:29,481
<i>For the next 20 years,
she and Jackson</i>

616
00:34:29,908 --> 00:34:34,110
<i>continued their love affair by
correspondence, letters sent to
and fro</i>

617
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,950
<i>with the help of her virtually
untraceable carrier pigeon,</i>

618
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:43,543
<i>until the day Jackson knew he would
no longer be able to keep
his promise.</i>

619
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:47,543
<i>Someone else would have
to do it for him.</i>

620
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,673
After Jackson died,
I started to plan my escape.

621
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:56,382
It took me two years. And all that time,
I kept writing to Elsa.

622
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:59,801
First, I was writing out of
loyalty to the man who taught me

623
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:05,483
the ropes in prison, but after a while,
I started to develop...

624
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,520
- A condition ?
- For Elsa --

625
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:10,610
at least,
I thought it was Elsa.

626
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:14,842
And mama made me swear on her deathbed
that I'd never stop writing to Jackson,

627
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:17,580
said it would break his
heart to learn that she died.

628
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,062
But each letter was more
beautiful than the last,

629
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:22,381
and I found myself
looking forward to them.

630
00:35:22,415 --> 00:35:24,360
Well, your letters
were beautiful, too.

631
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:26,042
What's the big whoop ?

632
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,963
Pidge brought them together.

633
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:31,080
How did she lose her wing?

634
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:34,100
I took her with me on the plane
when I busted out of prison.

635
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:37,480
She flew out the window after takeoff
and went right through the propeller.

636
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:38,682
Oh !

637
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:41,801
Pidge crashed the plane.
Oh, Pidge.

638
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,610
What happened to the diamonds ?

639
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,270
"Diamonds" ?

640
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,653
Holy crap !

641
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:56,613
Holy crap !

642
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,251
Now, now, let's not panic.
I'm sure it's just the mailman

643
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:10,671
or a windmill-to-windmill salesman.
Let me handle it.

644
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:20,011
<i>As Olive peeped through the peephole,
it occurred to her that,</i>

645
00:36:20,307 --> 00:36:23,603
<i>while the carrier pigeon was
safe inside the windmill,</i>

646
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:26,591
<i>the same could not be said
for the sitting duck</i>

647
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:29,393
<i>currently waiting
on the doorstep.</i>

648
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:43,071
<i>This was the moment Olive
Snook had been waiting for.</i>

649
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:47,142
<i>She need only open the door to
expose Chuck's deceit to the aunts,</i>

650
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,203
<i>and the pie maker
could be hers.</i>

651
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,003
<i>It was everything Olive wanted,
and yet...</i>

652
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:58,960
<i>She knew that the aunts would be
traumatized by the discovery</i>

653
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:02,350
<i>that the late Charlotte
Charles was late no more.</i>

654
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:06,680
<i>In that moment, Olive felt
the angry fire in her heart</i>

655
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:12,563
<i>extinguished by a light breeze. She
had grown fond of Lily and Vivian</i>

656
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:15,252
<i>and could not bring
herself to hurt them.</i>

657
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:25,490
- Afternoon, gang !
- Olive ?

658
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,463
What the hell are
you doing here ?

659
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:29,622
Pie delivery.
Tart apple, I believe.

660
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:32,621
<i>With those two words,
chuck knew.</i>

661
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:36,253
<i>Her aunts were inside.</i>

662
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,380
Olive...

663
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:41,191
If you know what's good for you,
and I think you do,

664
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,693
- you'll give me two minutes.
- Why ?

665
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:43,762
- What for ?
- Okay.

666
00:37:44,016 --> 00:37:45,392
Goody, then.

667
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,433
Who was it ?

668
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:53,353
Wrong mill.
Must happen a lot around here, huh ?

669
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:57,231
Anyway, I feel just awful that
we've taken up so much of your day.

670
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:01,360
We should really be going.
Do you mind if we use the back door ?

671
00:38:01,618 --> 00:38:03,833
I just wanted to take a peek
at your garden on the way out.

672
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,863
Thanks ! Bye !

673
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,081
- Ned.
- Hmm ?

674
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:13,130
Do you remember before, when I told you
all the things I'd learned about you ?

675
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,331
Jealous, romantic, jealous.
I felt I had to say it twice.

676
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:18,353
Right. Well,
now might be a really good time

677
00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:20,523
for you to write down all the
things you learned about me.

678
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:22,593
- Why ?
- That way, if stuff happens...

679
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:26,261
- just remember the list.
- Time's up.

680
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:30,013
Well, now,
wasn't that a nice outing ?

681
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,772
I could use a drink.

682
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:34,943
Young people depress lily
because she's afraid of dying.

683
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:38,402
<i>As Lily wondered whether
she was afraid of dying</i>

684
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:40,651
<i>or simply missed
feeling alive,</i>

685
00:38:40,948 --> 00:38:44,780
<i>she allowed herself one deep
breath of fresh country air.</i>

686
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:49,872
I don't think we've been out since --
Charlotte ?!

687
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:56,920
No need to yell her name.
I think heaven's closer than we think.

688
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:58,750
I agree.

689
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,093
Hand up !

690
00:39:18,197 --> 00:39:20,403
Lemuel, I'll write you !

691
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:26,200
<i>The pie maker and the
girl he called "Chuck"</i>

692
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:29,663
<i>marveled at love's power to
conquer all obstacles --</i>

693
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,033
<i>Distance and time...</i>

694
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:35,663
<i>Hardship and pain...</i>

695
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:40,790
<i>A lack
of reciprocation...</i>

696
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:44,342
<i>Even death.</i>

697
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,593
Your husband was a great pilot.

698
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:49,470
He didn't kill himself.
A pigeon did, by accident.

699
00:39:51,478 --> 00:39:53,012
With Pidge's help,</i>

700
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:58,062
the long-distance love affair of lefty
and Elsita continued to soar.</i>

701
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:01,061
<i>And the pie
maker realized</i>

702
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:04,483
<i>that while some obstacles
may never disappear...</i>

703
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,491
Care to dance ?

704
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,113
Hmm. Yes, please.

705
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,212
<i>...You can always find a
way to work around them.</i>

706
00:40:37,988 --> 00:40:39,140
You caught me.

707
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:50,700
