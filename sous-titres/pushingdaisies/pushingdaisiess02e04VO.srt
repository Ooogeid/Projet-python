<i>Emerson Cod was 5 months,
3 days, and 4 hours old</i>

00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,060
<i>when his mother planned his death.</i>

3
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:11,690

00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:25,412
<i>... and the easiest way
for private detective Calista Cod</i>

7
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:29,294
<i>to bust a stock clerk claiming
millions in pain and suffering</i>

8
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,685
<i>as the result
of a forklift accident.</i>

9
00:00:32,376 --> 00:00:35,013
<i>The firm of </i>Cod & Cod

10
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:37,882
<i>to the pursuit of truth,
at all costs...</i>

11
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,428
<i>a pursuit
young Emerson found "badass".</i>

12
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:56,260
<i>Faced with scoundrels, cheats,
and the havoc they wreaked,</i>

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,450
<i>mother and son made a vow
to never let lies come between them.</i>

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,031
<i>It was a profitable decision.</i>

15
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:09,120
<i>The truth is the cornerstone
of any successful relationship.</i>

16
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,208
<i>Years later,
private investigator Emerson Cod</i>

17
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,367
<i>was less successful

18
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:16,487
<i>aspiring pop-up book author.</i>

19
00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:20,349
Lil' Gum Shoe<i> was based
on the detective's childhood adventures.</i>

20
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,179
<i>More importantly, it was a map</i>

21
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,791
<i>designed to bring
his missing daughter back to him,</i>

22
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,931
<i>if only he could get it published.</i>

23
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:30,722
"Complex plot, lack of theme,
child endangerment".

24
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:32,102
Man, that's cold.

25
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:35,121
<i>So, at this moment, Emerson Cod,</i>

26
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:39,444
<i>a failure at fatherhood and fiction,
decided to quit.</i>

27
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:44,741
Who is she?

28
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:48,077
I don't know. She's rolled in
like a moody mean thundercloud.

29
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:49,454
Know what you want?

30
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,672
Yeah. Nothin'...

31
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,959
With a side of "buzz off".

32
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,595
Ma'am, sorry to bother...

33
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:00,963
Perhaps you didn't realize
this is an eating establishment,

34
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:04,543
not a park bench, for example,
where one can loiter and smoke, and

35
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,262
not consume food
to one's heart's content.

36
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:09,599
Got a problem?
We can take it outside.

37
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:16,898
Oh, good.
Someone with a gun.

38
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:17,917
Rhubarb.

39
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:20,068
The whole pie will do.

40
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:24,239
And, mama...

41
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:27,826
When are you gonna treat yourself
and spring for a decent stogie?

42
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:31,495
The next time I trail a white-collar
money launderer to Havana.

43
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:39,665
People, I want to introduce you to
the PI who taught me everything I know.

44
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:42,590
She's my best bud and my mama, to boot,
Calista Cod.

45
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:43,678
Hi, I'm Ned.

46
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,342
This is Chuck and Olive.

47
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,804
So, Calista, what brings you
to our neck of the woods?

48
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,874
Fraud case, and I've been missing
my Lil' Gum Shoe.

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,984
Now, can we hit a bar?
I'm starving.

50
00:02:53,014 --> 00:02:54,188
Isn't she comforting...

51
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:58,093
the brutal honesty, the sardonic wit,
and the appetite for hooch?

52
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:00,712
I mean, add an eye patch
and Calista could be Lily.

53
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:02,568
How are you doing with that?

54
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:03,504
What's "that"?

55
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,894
Living with the fact that the woman
you've known your whole life

56
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:09,140
as a tied-for-first-place favorite aunt
is really your mother.

57
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,420
Oh, that "that".

58
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:13,289
I'm happy that I know
I have a mother who's alive and

59
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,298
not so happy that
she can't know I'm alive.

60
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,972
Suddenly, what was comforting
is giving way to sadness.

61
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:19,738
Then I'll be your comforter.

62
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,085
Consider me your king-sized duvet

63
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:25,133
ready to wrap you
in goose-down goodness, tonight.

64
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:27,927
I'd love to,
but I've already made plans with Olive.

65
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,370
You two have been hanging out
every night since she got back.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,932
Not that I've been counting.

67
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,644
Are you new best friends
or something?

68
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:36,034
No. Wait... I guess we are.

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,904
I have a new best friend.
Isn't that superb?

70
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,656
<i>The pie maker did not think so,</i>

71
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,438
<i>for the more time Chuck spent
with her new best friend,</i>

72
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:43,997
<i>the less time she had for him.</i>

73
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:47,916
<i>He felt alone, but he feared
the truth would make him sound needy,</i>

74
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,569
<i>so, instead, he lied.</i>

75
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,535
It sure is superb...
for you...

76
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:54,967
... both.

77
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:56,967
Want to head home, roomie?

78
00:03:56,997 --> 00:04:00,933
<i>Charlotte Charles' and Olive Snook's
decision to cohabitate was sudden,</i>

79
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:04,380
<i>just like Olive's earlier
decision to join a nunnery,</i>

80
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,009
<i>where all her earthly possessions
had been given to the poor.</i>

81
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,323
<i>It was a gesture
she had all but forgotten</i>

82
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:13,723
<i>until she arrived home
with a new pet pig by her side.</i>

83
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,392
Is this my place?

84
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,272
I'm moving out after having moved in,
which came organically from missing you

85
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,272
and watering your plants
like you asked me to.

86
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:24,566
Don't worry.
All this will be gone by tomorrow.

87
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:25,652
Everything?

88
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:27,474
I figured you'd want
to start from scratch.

89
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:29,459
<i>Truthfully, Olive Snook did not.</i>

90
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:32,062
<i>What she wanted
was a furnished apartment.</i>

91
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,951
Scratch that.
Let's be roommates.

92
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,929
Oh, no.
I couldn't impose.

93
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,991
<i>Truthfully, Charlotte Charles could.</i>

94
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,470
<i>Like Olive Snook,
she enjoyed her things</i>

95
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,552
<i>and the feeling of independence
they brought her.</i>

96
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,500
Although, I were to impose,
you should know that

97
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,590
I'm a morning showerer,
a heavy sleeper, and a dish dryer.

98
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,650
And I'm a late-night bath taker,
a snorer, and a dish scrubber.

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,761
Welcome home!

100
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:55,298
Is there anything bigger
we should discuss?

101
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,267
You're referring to the time you made me
an unwitting drug mule for your aunts...

102
00:04:58,327 --> 00:04:59,077
No.

103
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:01,126
Good, 'cause I done roasted
that old chestnut.

104
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:04,756
And I'm also okay that you hid the fact
that one of those aunts were my mother.

105
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:06,784
Right, just like I'm A-okay
with the fact that

106
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:09,678
you didn't explain to me
why you faked your own death.

107
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,949
- My! Look at all those bridges.
- And all that water flowing under them.

108
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,480
Oh, I'm proud of us...

109
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:17,870
We've put all on the table
and dealt with the tough stuff.

110
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,247
And move right off of it.

111
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:22,558
<i>Chuck and Olive had simultaneous
and sneaking suspicions</i>

112
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,210
<i>that they were fooling themselves.</i>

113
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:28,047
<i>But they read each other's anxiety
as giddy excitement,</i>

114
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:30,418
<i>so Olive Snook changed the subject.</i>

115
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:32,552
Who would've thought
they would have ever hit it off?

116
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,132
Which reminds me...

117
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:37,192
Would you mind
if I had the bed by the window?

118
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:38,372
Absolutely...

119
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:39,809
not.

120
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,357
I knew
I should've knitted it larger.

121
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:49,152
- Wool stretches.
- Well, not to China, sweetheart.

122
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:50,987
Have you got a girl somewhere?

123
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:55,409
<i>Emerson Cod had lied to his best friend
and mother about two things.</i>

124
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,474
<i>One, that he did have
a girl somewhere, age 7.</i>

125
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,113
<i>Two, that he had written a book designed
to bring this girl back into his life.</i>

126
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:05,043
Somebody's been feeding you.
What's her name?

127
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,653
- Pie maker.
- Damn!

128
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:10,114
And damn sad me not knowing more
about what's happening in your life.

129
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:12,050
I know we're both busy,
but it ain't right.

130
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,745
<i>Emerson Cod agreed.</i>

131
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:16,206
<i>It was no longer right
to be in his mother's presence</i>

132
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:19,440
<i>without coming clean
and cleaning off their cornerstone.</i>

133
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,602
<i>His decision to share
his secrets was a noble intent.</i>

134
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,166
All right, ma, here's the dilly.

135
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:29,609
Mr. Cod, I am in desperate need
of assistance.

136
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:32,102
What makes you
so desperate, Miss...?

137
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,662
Villanueva.
Veronica Villanueva.

138
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,634
An unsolved murder...

139
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,451
namely that of my best friend, Joe.

140
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:40,328
Office is closed.
Family matter. Scram!

141
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:42,622
Please.
I am opening my heart to you.

142
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,054
Just open that blouse.

143
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:47,835
You got a description of this Joe?

144
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:52,792
They found his body dumped
in an alleyway last night.

145
00:06:52,822 --> 00:06:54,500
He had been missing for two days.

146
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,571
Joe...
He was like a brother.

147
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:58,738
He meant everything to me.

148
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,557
I want <i>yustice</i>
at any price.

149
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:03,434
That's our kind of <i>yustice</i>.

150
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,727
We'll be in touch.

151
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:07,772
I'll be dental damned.

152
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:09,649
With a girl like that,
you certainly should.

153
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,498
I'm talking about a dentist,

154
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,892
by the name of Dr. Eugene Halifax.

155
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:15,832
Just came to see me this morning

156
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,346
about the murder
of his best friend, Joe.

157
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:22,212
With Miss Villanueva,
he's a cosmo-drinking shopaholic.

158
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:24,972
- Queer.
- You bet it's odd.

159
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:28,171
Dr. Eugene has Joe as some tough guy
who's tough on plaque.

160
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:30,492
Seems Joe was a different friend
to different people.

161
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:32,272
Meaning both your clients.

162
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:36,982
Gonna thank mama for getting you
paid twice to solve one murder?

163
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,141
That's Joe, all right.

164
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:47,520
Heya, folks!
What's going on?

165
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,647
You're in the county morgue.
Our condolences.

166
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:51,399
Happen to know
how you happened in here?

167
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,719
Last thing I remember,
I was getting ready to play ball

168
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:56,028
when suddenly there was
a doozy of a pain in my back.

169
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:57,155
Stab wound.

170
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:59,157
Killer stitched it up. Poorly.

171
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:00,267
Let me see.

172
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:06,873
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

173
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:11,127
Is it me, or is that odor strangely
reminiscent of 8th-grade biology?

174
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:13,634
Specifically formaldehyde.

175
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:15,693
The coroner must have started
embalming me already.

176
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:18,205
Coroner don't embalm...
Just looks for the cause of death.

177
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:19,969
Preserving happens after
and elsewhere.

178
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:23,014
- Bless you.
- No. Bless Downy.

179
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:24,432
She was my one-and-only.

180
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:27,148
I never got a chance
to tell her how much I cared.

181
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,312
Now she'll never know.

182
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,111
Any idea who'd want
to pickle your gherkin?

183
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:32,899
None. Wonder if it has anything to do
with my best friend.

184
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,153
- Which one? Veronica or Dr. Eugene?
- You know those two? Small world.

185
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:39,614
- You'll keep an eye on them for me?
- We plan to.

186
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:43,451
Looks like we got to get friendly
with a couple of best friends.

187
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,672
<i>Under normal circumstances,</i>

188
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:50,670
<i>the PI would question
separate clients separately.</i>

189
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,151
<i>However,
the presence of one PI's PI mother</i>

190
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:57,718
<i>allowed him to employ
a time-saving interrogation technique,</i>

191
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,598
<i>known as the "Kalashni-Cod".</i>

192
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,657
<i>Like the Russian machine gun
for which it was named,</i>

193
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:04,437
<i>its operation was simple.</i>

194
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,666
<i>The scope was set, the magazine loaded,
and the trigger pulled.</i>

195
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:10,346
Who's Joe's best friend?

196
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:14,065
I got it on good authority Joe's BFF
made him RIP. Who wants the title now?

197
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,900
Where were you last Friday night,
girly?

198
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,860
- Obsessed?
- Where'd you buy the formaldehyde?

199
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,798
Did giving him the stab-stab
make you feel good?

200
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:22,922
- I'm no suspect. I hired you.
- I think I'd like my money back.

201
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:25,809
I don't give no damn refunds
to people who waste my time.

202
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,761
When you retain my services, I expect
the facts, and I mean all of 'em.

203
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,719
But looking at you two
with your averted eyes...

204
00:09:30,749 --> 00:09:32,326
- Lowered heads...
- And nibed lips,

205
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:34,093
makes me think
you hiding something.

206
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:35,253
What is it?

207
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,338
Fine, I'll tell you the truth...

208
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:40,215
The dirty, humiliating truth.

209
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,218
Joe was a "frescort".

210
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,461
It's short for "friend and escort",

211
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:47,431
Basically a friend for hire.
You pick from the catalog.

212
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,308
They become anyone
you want them to be.

213
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:51,722
What's wrong with picking
somebody the old-fashioned way,

214
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:54,525
walking up to them and saying,
"Hi, my name is blah-dee-blah".

215
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:57,692
"Do you like bloo-dee-blooin'?
Me too. Let's be friends."

216
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:58,740
But I'm shy.

217
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,237
I get why Dr. Bashful
needs a pay-a-pal.

218
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:04,448
But back when I had a rack and
a couple of getaway sticks like yours,

219
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:07,200
I had no trouble
making acquaintances.

220
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:08,111
This...

221
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:11,071
attracts all kinds.

222
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:12,999
But no one wants to know who I am.

223
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:16,627
Men only see me
as a score not yet scored.

224
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:18,168
- And the women?
- This...

225
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:21,196
- Yeah, we got it.
- It promotes instant jealousy.

226
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:22,341
I was all alone,

227
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:24,673
so I called in the professionals.

228
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:26,318
<i>As Emerson Cod read the words,</i>

229
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:29,507
<i>he was reminded
of frescort Joe's final ones...</i>

230
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,655
<i>That his murder
may have had to do with...</i>

231
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,353
<i>My Best Friend, Inc.</i>?

232
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:37,090
All right, everybody
know what their job is?

233
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,763
Olive and I are frescort wannabes.

234
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:41,027
Our mission...
To find Joe's one-and-only Downy.

235
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:42,934
All right, good.
Meanwhile, me and the pie man

236
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:45,382
are gonna have a sit-down chitty-chat
with the CEO of the company,

237
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,742
see who Joe was pretend-friending
the night he died.

238
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:48,952
Any questions?

239
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,579
That was rhetorical.

240
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,118
My query is not. What happened to you
and your mom working together?

241
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:57,339
She's working on her own case, and
I might need a diversion, so, as I said,

242
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:58,540
you with me.

243
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,346
It isn't a question,
more of a suggestion.

244
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:01,719
Merely a tiny change of plan,

245
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:05,937
where Chuck goes undercover
with... me, for instance.

246
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:09,662
<i>The pie maker's intention
wasn't to make waves.</i>

247
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:13,506
<i>He was just trying to spend time
with his beloved Chuck.</i>

248
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,527
Yeah, sure.

249
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:19,023
It's just that Olive and I had kind of
come up with backstories and aliases.

250
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:21,734
And a secret
incognito-partners handshake.

251
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,772
Yeah, that's nice.

252
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:28,115
Plan stays as planned.
Move out.

253
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:35,414
Welcome to <i>My Best Friend</i>,
where everyone's in the in-crowd.

254
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:36,524
I'm a PI.

255
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:40,113
Less interested in the in-crowd
and more in the "out", as in murder.

256
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:42,993
You're here about Joe.
Such a devastating loss.

257
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,924
He was our top performer.

258
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,468
That's what you peddle around here...
Performers?

259
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:49,595
Truthfully, I'd say it's atonement.

260
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:52,306
Back in high school,
I was a colossal creep.

261
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,790
Math geeks, male cheerleaders...

262
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,603
even the...
pitiful team mascot

263
00:11:57,663 --> 00:12:01,995
were just sad, pimply targets
for a varsity quarterback like myself.

264
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,136
Until two blitzing linebackers
destroyed my knee.

265
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,420
Suddenly I was no different
from all those nerds I put through hell.

266
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:12,398
From that point on,

267
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:15,246
I swore I'd use my powers for good,

268
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,975
providing people, for a nominal fee,

269
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:19,792
with what everyone deserves...

270
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:22,232
Friendship.

271
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,464
Well, judging by these digs,
your nominal fees have been adding up.

272
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:27,870
No matter
what the modern world says about

273
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,762
gadgetry bringing us closer together,
it's driven us further apart.

274
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,345
We're isolated, all alone.

275
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:38,853
But once trained, my frescorts function
as the best companions money can buy.

276
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:40,855
Who was Joe companioning
the night he died?

277
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,734
No client appointments.

278
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,951
Mind if I take a gander?

279
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,068
We keep
all of our records confidential.

280
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,579
Ah, the hug machine.

281
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:50,280
Our most valuable teaching tool.

282
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,158
How about a demonstration
on my associate?

283
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:53,617
- No, thank you.
- Divert.

284
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,924
Come on, you!

285
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:59,018
See, proper hugs are a science.

286
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,244
They must be platonic
but not cold,

287
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:05,721
firm, but not painful.

288
00:13:06,273 --> 00:13:08,666
<i>The pie maker didn't want
to be hugged by a machine.</i>

289
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:11,846
<i>He wanted to be hugged
by the one he was lonely for.</i>

290
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,333
<i>But for a fleeting moment,
the pie maker's aloneness abated,</i>

291
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:21,128
<i>so he closed his eyes,</i>

292
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:23,481
<i>thought of Chuck, and hugged back.</i>

293
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,482
I like that.

294
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,418
We'll have the models
in the gift shop for Christmas.

295
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:30,321
I'll make sure there's one
in your stocking. Come on.

296
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:33,282
<i>Emerson Cod
had uncovered Joe's home address</i>

297
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:36,410
<i>as Chuck and Olive
addressed going undercover.</i>

298
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:38,541
Barb? Hi.

299
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:41,570
My name is Kitty Pimms,
and this is Patty Boots.

300
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,252
We're two highly motivated candidates
ready to befriend the sad and lonely.

301
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,086
For pay.

302
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,214
Kitty Pimms, Patty Boots.

303
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:50,355
What wonderfully rhythmic names.

304
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:52,469
They just scream "Good humor"
and "Bonhomie"!

305
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:55,554
Now, can you f-f-f-fake it real?

306
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,348
Wh-wh-wh-what?

307
00:13:57,564 --> 00:13:59,558
W-w-were you making fun
of my stuttering?

308
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:02,073
- No, I was just...
- I don't stutter, but if I did,

309
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:04,749
what you did would subtly
put me at ease by saying,

310
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,870
"Hey, you're okay.
I'm okay. We're okay."

311
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:09,818
M-kay?

312
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:11,695
Now, back to "fake it real".

313
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,654
On any given day,
clients are gonna depend on you

314
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:18,994
to summon up every feeling in the book,
even if you're not feeling it.

315
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,371
Show me happy.

316
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:22,203
Sad.

317
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,258
Surprise.

318
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:24,454
Consternation.

319
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:25,501
Constipation.

320
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:27,378
You know what I'm showing you?

321
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:30,339
Heck, yeah!
We are getting you into training asap!

322
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:35,140
Except I heard this job
can be kind of dangerous.

323
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,512
You are referring to Joe.

324
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,222
It's so horrible.

325
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:39,632
Did you know him?

326
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:43,143
Just by name.
Frescorts are forbidden to fraternize.

327
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:46,730
You two are friends, aren't you?
Don't answer. I can tell.

328
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,215
Thing is, you're awesome,

329
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:51,846
and I only want to bring the best people
into this organization, so...

330
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:55,781
We'll just keep things
on the QT, okay?

331
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,283
We won't even carpool.

332
00:14:57,469 --> 00:15:00,282
<i>At that moment,
another carpool had landed</i>

333
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:02,360
<i>at the apartment
of a murder victim.</i>

334
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,366
Frescorts ain't nothing but a bunch
of cons hiding behind good intentions.

335
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,751
My experience:

336
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,429
people don't appreciate
being conned,

337
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,970
even when they're pathetic losers
who signed up for it in the first place.

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,230
We're gonna go in Joe's place
and find that list,

339
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,387
see which one of his clients
did him in.

340
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,676
Why are they pathetic losers?
'Cause they're alone?

341
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:24,059
Because they're paying
for something that's free.

342
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:26,640
There's nothing wrong
with needing a little extra help.

343
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,481
No one thinks twice if a person with
a wobbly backhand hires a tennis coach.

344
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,192
And I'm guessing you have no clue
how to bake a rhubarb custard pie.

345
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:34,320
But do I call you pathetic
for paying me to do it?

346
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,126
You've had
a best friend since birth.

347
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,740
Not all of us have been that lucky.

348
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,743
Yeah, well.
Don't be too jealous of my luck.

349
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,995
Ain't but one sorry leaf
hanging off that clover.

350
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:45,986
You know, mom and me ain't supposed
to have no lies between us.

351
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:47,642
Well, technically, I never lied,

352
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:49,501
but I also never told her
I have a daughter.

353
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,545
Most mothers would consider that
splitting hairs.

354
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:55,007
She spent her whole life
teaching me how to collar cons.

355
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,595
I guess I'm just embarrassed
to have her know that my ex conned me.

356
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,439
But you know what?

357
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:03,719
I'm chucking my chagrin overboard.

358
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,309
I'm letting loose the truth.

359
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:06,711
Yep!

360
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,853
I'm gonna sit mama down...

361
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:14,818
take a deep breath,
and look her straight in the...

362
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,951
What's the matter?
Cat got your eye?

363
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,551
Sorry.
It's just glass.

364
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:28,082
Yeah, it's for a sculpture
that I'm working on.

365
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:30,417
We're private investigators
looking into a murder.

366
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,034
Joe was my roommate.

367
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,778
What's your name, roommate?

368
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:38,184
Randy Mann.

369
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,928
I got some knee-slappers about that.
You want to hear?

370
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:44,723
In the face of tragedy,
I try to keep things light.

371
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:47,831
It's just weird,
not having him around anymore.

372
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,145
Joe had such a big personality.

373
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:52,022
It's tough.
You share your life with someone,

374
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,525
and suddenly there's an abyss
where a person always was before.

375
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:57,069
- You lost a roommate, too?
- And girlfriend. Same person.

376
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:59,988
- Your roommate/girlfriend died?
- Yeah.

377
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,011
I mean, no.
She moved out.

378
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,160
Sorry. Doesn't compare.
Not even remotely.

379
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,720
You're not completely alone, though.

380
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:11,125
- A golden retriever, right?
- Yeah...

381
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,253
Digby, who would be a source
of comfort if he didn't prefer living

382
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:17,589
with my girlfriend,
her new besty, and their pig.

383
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,845
You aware that Joe worked
as a friend-for-hire, Mann?

384
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:26,329
Well, I thought he was a tutor
to special folks or some like that.

385
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,647
Know who he was with
the night he died?

386
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,265
Sure don't, pal.

387
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:33,271
Wait.
Where do you think you're going?

388
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:35,274
Bedrooms are back here?
I just want to see Joe's.

389
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,385
Wish you could, but you can't.
See, I'm late for something.

390
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:40,279
But seriously, come back anytime.

391
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,002
Randy's a nutjob's name.

392
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:57,629
Randy's also a fun guy's name.
You can grab a beer with Randy,

393
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,203
grill a brat with Randy,
pick up chicks with Randy.

394
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,468
And help stuff them into
Randy's freezer with Randy.

395
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,470
Can you be a little nice?
His roommate died.

396
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,832
Did you see how nice and crazy
behind the eyes he got

397
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:09,051
when I tried to get into that back room?
What's he hiding?

398
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:10,768
I've never seen your back room.

399
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:13,433
- I've never seen your front room.
- I've never seen your front door.

400
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:14,497
Where do you live?

401
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,065
- Your son's very secretive.
- Well, he didn't get it from me.

402
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,901
My heezy
ain't none of y'all's beezy.

403
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:20,160
Randy Mann is shady,

404
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,723
and I'm gonna get back into his house
as soon as I get him to take that bait.

405
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:26,108
- Meanwhile, what do you got?
- Still no news on Downy,

406
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,302
and since company policy
dictates that frescorts can't date,

407
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:30,621
it may even be a dead end.

408
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,581
- Hiya, Ned!
- Hiya, bait.

409
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:35,834
I found your free cooking-class coupon,
so I brought along offal.

410
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:37,872
- "Awful"?
- Offal. O-f-f-a-l.

411
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:40,121
Animal organs and innards
for meat pie.

412
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:42,697
Yeah, so "awful", like this idea.

413
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:44,843
I'm not leaving Ned alone
with back-room Randy.

414
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,971
This place is full of freezers,
perfect for body-stuffing.

415
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:51,182
It's also full of customers.
Hey, come on in, Randy!

416
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,727
All right, girls number 1 and 2,
get to frescorting.

417
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:57,147
- All right, ma, let's go.
- My target's on the move.

418
00:18:58,213 --> 00:18:59,663
Well, can't it wait?

419
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:01,859
I thought we were gonna get a chance
to catch up and talk

420
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:03,668
while we were tossing
that apartment.

421
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:06,573
Darling, you know what it is
to be married to the job.

422
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:09,586
We'll have time
for talking tomorrow.

423
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:13,332
<i>The weight of the untruths about
his missing daughter grew heavier.</i>

424
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,502
<i>So heavy, that he felt he'd soon
be crushed beneath them.</i>

425
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:21,046
<i>And so he entered the apartment
of a suspected killer</i>

426
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:23,252
<i>with a different death
on his mind.</i>

427
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:25,732
<i>That of his
and his mother's friendship.</i>

428
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:29,128
"Tutor of some sort", my glue stick.

429
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:39,355
Freeze!

430
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,246
Holy Noah's
nutty-as-a-fruitcake ark.

431
00:20:03,224 --> 00:20:05,667
<i>But the menagerie
of taxidermied animals</i>

432
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:09,069
<i>would not be the nuttiest thing
Emerson Cod would find.</i>

433
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:21,940
- Aren't you gonna chow down?
- I'm a vegetarian.

434
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,525
This stuff will make you strong.

435
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:26,069
Gobbling gizzards makes muscles.

436
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:29,323
At least,
that's what my ma used to say.

437
00:20:30,581 --> 00:20:32,686
- Why?
- I had loose ligaments as a kid...

438
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:36,198
Always falling, bruising my tailbone,
bumping my head.

439
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:38,582
A total disaster,
especially at sports.

440
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,979
All the kids at school made fun,
but I didn't care.

441
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,974
I just played with my pets,

442
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:45,746
'cause pets are cool with you,
no matter what...

443
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,884
Like your dog.
Digby, right?

444
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:53,570
He digs you just the way you are.
Forever will, too!

445
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:56,115
I got to stop going on
about stuff like this.

446
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:58,178
It makes me seem like a weirdo.

447
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,521
<i>However, the pie maker
did not see a weirdo.</i>

448
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:03,395
I didn't have any friends
at school, either.

449
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:06,280
Talk about a disaster at sports,
they wouldn't even give me gym clothes.

450
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,235
Instead, I'd sneak off
on my own and bake pies.

451
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:10,113
That's how I got started
in my hobby, too.

452
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,034
I don't usually share it with people but
the minute we met, I knew you'd be okay.

453
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,968
So I brought it alone
and hid it out back.

454
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:19,122
- You want to see?
- Sure.

455
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:24,257
Digby!

456
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:28,462
Listen.

457
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:31,426
- He's singing "American pie" for you.
- You killed my dog?

458
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:33,679
No, no, no.
That's Butterscotch, my dog.

459
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,347
You said your golden retriever was

460
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:37,619
staying with someone else,
so I thought I'd lend you mine.

461
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:39,317
He's been my best friend
since I was 5.

462
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:40,743
This is how you repay him?

463
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:43,939
If you had the chance to hold on to
someone you loved after he or she died,

464
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,525
- wouldn't you?
<i>- In fact, the pie maker had... twice.</i>

465
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:48,902
<i>But instead he said...</i>

466
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:49,987
Please leave.

467
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:55,184
I thought
we had something in common.

468
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:56,975
You're a sick man, Randy Mann.

469
00:21:57,005 --> 00:22:00,122
Stuffing all them critters
and then posing them in twisted ways.

470
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,987
Well, that's... That's why I don't
ever tell people about it.

471
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:04,319
They don't understand.

472
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:05,943
You don't think
it's twisted, do you?

473
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,876
'Course he does.
He was here babysitting while

474
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:09,923
I was gathering evidence
against your murdering ass.

475
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:12,009
- Liar. Liar!
- Your pants on fire.

476
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,510
You weren't Joe's roommate.
You were his client.

477
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:15,971
Why'd I tell you about that?

478
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:18,608
It's embarrassing, having
to pay someone to hang out with you.

479
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:21,370
Even more humiliating
to have your frescort repo'ed.

480
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,773
That must've been the final straw
before you offered Joe.

481
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,311
I offered him a deal...

482
00:22:25,497 --> 00:22:27,371
To be my roommate rent-free.

483
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:30,810
He agreed.
He said it'd be like a real friendship.

484
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,957
Is that why you kept a piece of him?

485
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,832
Joe's appendix,
floating in formaldehyde.

486
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:36,612
Oh, god.

487
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:38,034
Except you found out real quick

488
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:39,857
preserving a human's
tougher than chipmunks,

489
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:42,937
- so you had to dump the body.
- That appendix is mine, formerly Joe's.

490
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,628
He gave it to me as a joke

491
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:47,716
and to thank me for taking him
to the hospital when it burst.

492
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:50,662
Check his medical records
or ask his girlfriend.

493
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:52,758
- He must've told her about it.
- What's her name?

494
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:54,675
I don't know,
but it was someone at work.

495
00:22:54,736 --> 00:22:56,297
Must've been serious, though.

496
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:58,597
Joe was even gonna quit
so they could be together.

497
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:07,248
So, Ned just paged me
at the welcome desk,

498
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:09,563
and he said there is no doubt
there is a Downy among us.

499
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:11,318
Okay, I'll nose through my

500
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:14,029
"How to flatter and reassure
the profoundly ugly" symposium.

501
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,752
I've got
a "CD mixes that matter" lab

502
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:17,656
in 5 minutes, so maybe
someone there will know.

503
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:18,533
"Kinship".

504
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,226
Anyone know another word for it?
I'm afraid there's a Q involved.

505
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,247
- Propinquity.
- Nice.

506
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:25,411
Okay.

507
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,754
Give me another.

508
00:23:27,762 --> 00:23:29,564
4-across is "Gelding".

509
00:23:29,594 --> 00:23:30,828
Thanks, but...

510
00:23:31,446 --> 00:23:32,938
I don't do the acrosses.

511
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,320
- I only do the...
- Downs.

512
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:37,052
Barb, you're Downy.

513
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:38,937
- No, I'm not.
- You sure aren't...

514
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,764
f-f-faking anything to the contrary.

515
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:43,517
Okay.

516
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:45,701
Okay.

517
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:47,094
It's okay.

518
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,009
We're just trying to help.

519
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,274
Is Downy
a nickname that Joe gave you?

520
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:52,503
- Tissue.
- What?

521
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,817
- Tissue!
- Tissue.

522
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,971
I can't reach that.
I just...

523
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:01,582
Barb, don't!

524
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:03,323
Fake that, bitches!

525
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:09,296
Crap.

526
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:25,842
Hell, no.

527
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:28,436
- Mama.
- Yes, dear?

528
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:30,230
- I can't breathe.
- Yeah?

529
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:33,632
I gave you breath.
And this is the thanks I get?

530
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:35,635
<i>The facts were these...</i>

531
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:40,624
<i>Missy Scrivner,
editorial assistant at </i>Book'em Books,

532
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:43,288
<i>oversaw
all rejected manuscript letters.</i>

533
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:47,630
<i>Underbite surgery had left
the girl shackled to a liquid diet,</i>

534
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,565
<i>which found its way onto
the rejection letter of one Emerson Cod.</i>

535
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,749
<i>Unable to decipher anything
but the words "E"</i>

536
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:57,554
<i>and "Cod", Missy phoned
directory assistance.</i>

537
00:24:57,584 --> 00:25:00,360
<i>Mistaking her garbled "E" for a "C",</i>

538
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,788
<i>the operator gave
the address of Calista,</i>

539
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:06,777
<i>who read the critiques
and assumed her son's secret book was...</i>

540
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:10,687
A thinly disguised tell-all to show the
world what kind of horrible mother I am!

541
00:25:10,748 --> 00:25:12,257
No. Did you even read it?

542
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,942
Didn't have to.
The cover screams "Smear campaign".

543
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:18,021
And what's with the main character being
a girl? You saying I turned you gay?

544
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,192
I ain't gay and
this ain't about you!

545
00:25:20,222 --> 00:25:21,406
It's about my daughter!

546
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:23,038
What daughter?

547
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,335
She's 7.

548
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:27,100
Her mama ran off with her
when she was a baby.

549
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:29,915
I've been looking for her ever since,
with no luck.

550
00:25:30,478 --> 00:25:33,258
And that's why I finally
wrote <i>Lil' Gum Shoe</i>.

551
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:35,288
To help her have a way to find me.

552
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,390
Why didn't you tell me?

553
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,093
I didn't even tell my friends.

554
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,179
Well, I'm not your friend.
I'm your mother.

555
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,590
Oh, now you're my mum.

556
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,226
- What's that mumbles?
- I said...

557
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:51,694
You only say stuff like that when you
want me to feel guilty about something.

558
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:54,866
Well, since you switched back to
mama mode, I guess I can roll with that.

559
00:25:54,896 --> 00:25:56,445
So, tell me, mama...

560
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:58,451
What kind of mother
spies on her own son?

561
00:25:58,481 --> 00:26:00,194
It's not like I wanted to.

562
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:01,619
Damn.

563
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,152
That's shrewd, woman.

564
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,428
You faked a fraud case.

565
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,687
You set off your own beeper.

566
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:12,755
You even made sure I took two clients
at once so I'd be doubly busy.

567
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:16,044
All so you could poke
around in my personal life.

568
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:18,922
You know
what the sad thing is, mama?

569
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:21,293
I was gonna tell you everything.

570
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,345
What kind of fool
do you take me for?

571
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,432
Are you saying you don't believe me?

572
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:35,389
Well, I guess there's nothing else
for you and me to talk about, then.

573
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:39,067
Chuck and Olive
haven't checked in yet.

574
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:43,762
It's like we're trapped in a sachet
in a panty drawer of a dead shut-in

575
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,556
who was shut in her bedroom
by her cat,

576
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:48,121
so that it wouldn't have
to smell the stench of freesia.

577
00:26:49,518 --> 00:26:51,456
- Can't you smell it?
- Yep.

578
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:54,207
That would be
my freesia hair detangler

579
00:26:54,268 --> 00:26:56,960
that you said
smells amazing yesterday.

580
00:26:57,172 --> 00:26:58,239
Wish I hadn't, now!

581
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:00,432
Wish I hadn't told you those
capris made you look taller!

582
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:01,240
Liar!

583
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:04,603
No, I'm a truth-ar,
because I came clean unprompted,

584
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,095
whereas you only admitted
to lying because you got caught.

585
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:09,055
Here comes
the center of the universe

586
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:11,575
pulling us all
into her gravitational orbit of blame.

587
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,696
Oh, well, F.Y.I....

588
00:27:14,003 --> 00:27:16,468
There is no center of the universe,
because our universe

589
00:27:16,622 --> 00:27:17,884
is forever expanding.

590
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:19,761
Like your neediness.

591
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,567
"Wah, respect my feelings."

592
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:23,180
"Wah, don't fence me in."

593
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,049
"Wah, don't treat me like I'm dead."

594
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,179
Well, if you're so dead,
how can you be so needy?

595
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:30,082
Oh, right... You're selfish!

596
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,723
I am selfish?

597
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:34,476
I've just shared with you
every single thing that I own.

598
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:36,213
Big whoop!
Secondhand stuff.

599
00:27:36,243 --> 00:27:39,814
Oh, so that's what you're angry about,
the one thing I won't share... Ned.

600
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:41,241
I can't believe you said that.

601
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:44,324
Don't shrug at me in the dark,
Charlotte Charles. That was a low blow!

602
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:47,510
What do you expect me to do?
I'm in a no-win situation here.

603
00:27:47,711 --> 00:27:50,341
I can't talk to you
about it because that'd be insensitive.

604
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:53,301
I can't talk to Ned about it
because he's done nothing wrong.

605
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:54,235
I mean,

606
00:27:54,265 --> 00:27:57,351
if I were to have a nickel for every
single time the three of us are together

607
00:27:57,381 --> 00:28:00,606
and unexpectedly, accidentally,
I catch you looking at him...

608
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,983
No. Stop talking. Stop talking.
Help! Help us!

609
00:28:03,044 --> 00:28:05,010
- Anyone, help!
- And you have this little, sad,

610
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,779
pining look on your face of...

611
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,433
"Oh, Ned. Why can't you love me?"

612
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:13,083
And then I feel like a complete jerk
for being in love with my own boyfriend.

613
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:16,039
Yeah, a boyfriend you don't touch.

614
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:19,709
- I told you... We can't!
- That doesn't make any sense!

615
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:22,295
I'm going home!

616
00:28:22,837 --> 00:28:24,079
To my home!

617
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:25,681
What happened?

618
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:26,788
Roommate squabble,

619
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:29,815
brought on by the suspicious actions
of Barb, a.k.a. Downy,

620
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,523
who is definitely
a person of interest.

621
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:32,912
Got a name and address on her?

622
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:36,013
No, but I know where I can get one...
Buddy's office.

623
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:38,836
Oh, no! Barb!

624
00:28:43,878 --> 00:28:46,183
Oh, good,
Kitty, you got out of the locker.

625
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:47,936
Sorry. I thought
you're gonna tell on me.

626
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:50,055
- For what, killing Joe?
- No, for dating him.

627
00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:53,731
See, I didn't want to get fired.
This job's the only pl...

628
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:56,121
Her lungs are crushed.

629
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,539
Who knows CPR?

630
00:28:57,746 --> 00:28:58,596
I do.

631
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,710
Oh, good idea.

632
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,963
Okay, breathe, breathe...

633
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,408
The only place
my relentless positivity

634
00:29:09,438 --> 00:29:11,684
and encyclopedic knowledge
of hair braiding meant something.

635
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:14,747
I couldn't hurt Joe. When he was around,
I could be my true self.

636
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:17,625
Only now I'll never know if it was
just our mutual passion for crosswords

637
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:20,168
that brought us together
or if he felt the same way.

638
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:23,183
You were his one-and-only. He was about
to leave the company for you.

639
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,604
He said he had something
important to tell me.

640
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:27,960
The night he died,
I waited for his call, but

641
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,983
he never made it back
from his frescorting gig.

642
00:29:30,013 --> 00:29:31,755
Wait a minute.
Joe didn't work that night.

643
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:33,408
He was moonlighting
a sports date.

644
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:34,291
Who with?

645
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:36,536
Joe never said,
but the guy sounded tragic.

646
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:38,872
Two years of playing ball,
and he was still a spaz.

647
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,107
Some clients simply lack
the jock gene.

648
00:29:41,137 --> 00:29:42,833
Buddy calls them bleacher leechers.

649
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:45,107
Yeah, skip to the part
where you become the main squeeze.

650
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:49,232
I was having a meltdown, came in for
a hug, pretended those arms were Joe's.

651
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:52,469
That's when the dial
got turned to 11 by the Spartan.

652
00:29:52,949 --> 00:29:55,009
I tried to fight...
grabbed this from his helmet.

653
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,497
You did good, Barb.

654
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:01,168
There's no Spartan running around,
killing the popular kids.

655
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:02,670
This ain't <i>Thermopylae High</i>.

656
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,998
Right. It's <i>Spartanburg West</i>
and Buddy's team mascot.

657
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:08,109
Great. How are we gonna find out
who that was?

658
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,193
I'm having
the most unfortunate of hunches.

659
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:13,581
Randy was an uncoordinated
bleacher leecher.

660
00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:16,241
He told me the kids at school
teased him mercilessly for it.

661
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:19,108
Yeah, and maybe one of those kids
was varsity quarterback

662
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:22,206
and self-proclaimed
dork menacer Buddy Amicus.

663
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,006
Detective Cod,
what are you doing here?

664
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:26,043
We're one step closer
to finding Joe's killer.

665
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:27,629
- With Kitty?
- Kitty's with me.

666
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,631
- What's wrong with Barb?
- Oh, she's dead...

667
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:32,390
- Thanks to your happy-hug machine.
- Not Barb.

668
00:30:32,984 --> 00:30:36,136
Sweet, adorable, conciliatory Barb?

669
00:30:36,198 --> 00:30:38,109
Who could do something so horrible?

670
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:40,558
Does the name
Randy Mann ring a bell?

671
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:43,421
- Should it?
- We think he's your old school mascot.

672
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,359
The Spartan you tangled with
back in the day...

673
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:46,855
He's back, and he's pissed.

674
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,317
Do you happen to have
a high-school yearbook?

675
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:52,612
- Thank you.
- I have to evacuate the building.

676
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,683
Someone call the police,
tell them there's a vindictive person

677
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:57,491
with low self-esteem on the loose.

678
00:30:57,552 --> 00:30:59,159
There's no Randy Mann listed.

679
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,827
Maybe he's using an alias.

680
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:02,789
- The phone's dead.
- Help!

681
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,461
He got Buddy. Let's move.

682
00:31:05,837 --> 00:31:07,080
Oh! Watch out!

683
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:13,487
- That was close.
- Yeah.

684
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:16,927
Last thing we need
is another dead body on our hands.

685
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:20,807
Too late for that.

686
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,070
Well, hello!

687
00:31:23,338 --> 00:31:25,448
This is a surprise.
For you, too, I'm sure.

688
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:27,438
We're having a little trouble
getting a good look,

689
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,144
there's a mannequin face over yours.

690
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:31,150
Maybe if you took off your helmet?

691
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:34,153
Helmet on!

692
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:37,615
Sorry about that. We weren't expecting
such a leathery, mummy-like...

693
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:40,745
Can you speak? We would
really like to know who you are.

694
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:43,944
You're <i>Spartanburg West</i> quarterback.

695
00:31:43,974 --> 00:31:45,456
Can you show us?

696
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:48,042
Ares Kostopolous.

697
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,865
You were a hottie.

698
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:51,486
But Buddy was the quarterback.

699
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,692
Buddy...
Buddy was the Spartan mascot.

700
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:57,885
Buddy killed you, too!

701
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:01,347
So, the Buddy Amicus legend of being

702
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:03,215
a high-school golden boy
is a complete lie.

703
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:06,818
And a total horror show. What kind
of person holds on to a dead body?

704
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:09,188
The kind that wants
to preserve a friendship.

705
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:12,445
<i>The facts were these...</i>

706
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:18,593
<i>As a teen, Buddy Amicus
was unknown and invisible.</i>

707
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:20,555
<i>As varsity quarterback,</i>

708
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:23,828
<i>Ares Kostopolous was admired by all.</i>

709
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:27,541
<i>In his fragile and obsessed mind,</i>

710
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,001
<i>Buddy was best friends
with the big man on campus,</i>

711
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,671
<i>and he had to get closer,
no matter what.</i>

712
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,090
Spartans!

713
00:32:36,734 --> 00:32:38,859
<i>The nameless, faceless mascot</i>

714
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:41,553
<i>strove to make
his pigskin god proud,</i>

715
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:44,929
<i>but no one noticed him
until the State championships,</i>

716
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,507
<i>when everyone did.</i>

717
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:48,728
Spartans!

718
00:32:57,398 --> 00:32:59,574
<i>The Spartan felt
the agony of defeat.</i>

719
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,616
<i>But there was more agony to come.</i>

720
00:33:05,956 --> 00:33:06,835
<i>Guys, guys!</i>

721
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:16,233
<i>Buddy thought Ares,
his hero, would save him.</i>

722
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:20,760
<i>The realization
that their friendship was a lie was</i>

723
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,594
<i>so painful, it drove Buddy mad...</i>

724
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:26,465
<i>and murderous.</i>

725
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:34,473
<i>Years of dermatology,
orthodontics, and steroid abuse </i>

726
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:38,486
<i>transformed Buddy Amicus into the man
he'd always wanted to be.</i>

727
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:42,671
<i>He founded </i>My Best Friend, Inc.<i>,
and found, among his frescorts,</i>

728
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:47,365
<i>Joe, who triggered in him a new,
albeit familiar, obsession.</i>

729
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:50,468
<i>This time, Buddy knew
things would be different.</i>

730
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:52,699
<i>Now he was the big man on campus,</i>

731
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:55,169
<i>able to befriend anyone he chose...</i>

732
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:58,631
<i>until the day Joe
brought it all to an end.</i>

733
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:02,937
<i>He was quitting
to be with fellow frescort Barb,</i>

734
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,693
<i>which meant he was also quitting Buddy,
no matter how much the desperate, </i>

735
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:09,225
<i>delusional man offered
to pay him to stay.</i>

736
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:13,855
<i>The realization that another friendship
had been another lie</i>

737
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,946
<i>drove Buddy mad
and murderous yet again.</i>

738
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:22,690
<i>And so, he convinced Joe
to meet him for one last game.</i>

739
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,743
Why'd you heave-ho the body?

740
00:34:26,905 --> 00:34:29,810
I tried to preserve him
like I preserved Ares.

741
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,428
Sadly, the formaldehyde
triggered my asthma.

742
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:36,252
And Barb, she took Joe,
so you took her life.

743
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:38,361
Wanna know
the most senseless thing?

744
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,533
I started
this company to help people,

745
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:42,924
so that the friendless
wouldn't suffer as I did.

746
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:44,853
Of course they suffer.
I've seen it up close.

747
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,278
At first the bogus friendships
you sell seem good, but deep down,

748
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:49,765
those clients never stop feeling
like weirdos who need to be fixed.

749
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:52,442
And so they keep paying,
hoping that someday

750
00:34:52,472 --> 00:34:55,438
those feelings will go away,
but those feelings never go away.

751
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,451
I'm killing you first.

752
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,406
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, friend.

753
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:05,591
<i>With the frescort killer
behind bars,</i>

754
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:09,191
<i>the pie maker was free to revisit
a former frescort client.</i>

755
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:10,467
Your meat pies.

756
00:35:10,497 --> 00:35:12,009
I can't eat them, so...

757
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:15,247
This is Digby, by the way.

758
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:16,626
Digby, say hi to Randy.

759
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:19,377
Aren't you a nice boy?

760
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:21,518
So unlike your owner.

761
00:35:21,548 --> 00:35:23,691
I deserve that,
like you deserve an apology.

762
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,510
Apology accepted.
Goodbye.

763
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:28,980
Wait. You don't have to pay for it...
friendship.

764
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:32,565
The truth is, there are
a lot of people like you... us...

765
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:36,293
with strange hobbies
or talents or gifts that

766
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:39,499
we try to hide because we're afraid it
makes us seem weird or turns people off.

767
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:42,206
But that's a mistake.

768
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,520
What makes me unique has brought
every person I love into my life,

769
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:50,356
and it could be the same for you.

770
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:52,941
Well, there's nothing wrong
with being alone, you know.

771
00:35:52,971 --> 00:35:54,206
Joe taught me that...

772
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,058
Called it the "first step".

773
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,210
You're no good to somebody else unless
you're good with being with just you.

774
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:06,098
<i>Advice an alone pie maker
could use, as well.</i>

775
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:10,888
<i>The pie maker obtained
Buddy Amicus' client list</i>

776
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:15,175
<i>and invited those listed to bring
their true selves to a low-key mixer.</i>

777
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:17,611
<i>And while the intention was good,</i>

778
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:20,438
<i>the evening
was an unmitigated disaster...</i>

779
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:22,622
<i>until the second hour,</i>

780
00:36:22,652 --> 00:36:25,689
<i>when everyone finally
started to come out of their shells.</i>

781
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:29,964
In another 10 minutes,
I was gonna pull out the tequila shots,

782
00:36:29,994 --> 00:36:32,770
and if that didn't work,
pull the fire alarm and call it a day.

783
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,163
Can you give Digby another hug?

784
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:37,707
Yeah, of course I will.

785
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:39,513
Do you want a hug?

786
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,585
Come on.

787
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:43,611
Tighter. And give his belly
a rubba-rubba-rubba.

788
00:36:43,689 --> 00:36:45,291
You know, if you want,

789
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:48,185
I can hug him all night long
when I sleep over at your place...

790
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:49,468
permanently.

791
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:52,774
Did I forget to tell you
that I'm moving back in?

792
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:56,193
That squabble with you and
Olive is clearly more than a squabble.

793
00:36:56,223 --> 00:36:58,627
We let loose with everything
we were feeling, thinking, flogged

794
00:36:58,657 --> 00:37:00,724
our friendship to death
with a great big truth club.

795
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:03,427
Does that mean when it comes to us,

796
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:05,568
I should keep my truths to myself?

797
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,194
No, of course not.

798
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,487
Hang on. Am I setting myself up
for something here?

799
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:12,256
I was setting myself up to tell you
that ever since you moved in with Olive,

800
00:37:12,286 --> 00:37:13,990
I feel like I never see you anymore.

801
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,926
And please don't take
that any other way than...

802
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:18,039
I miss you.

803
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:21,289
That was really sweet.
I miss you, too.

804
00:37:21,855 --> 00:37:23,669
All the more reason
for me moving back in.

805
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:25,099
Sorry.

806
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:27,965
- You can't.
- But you promised me comforting.

807
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,698
You're my king-sized duvet
of goose-down goodness.

808
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:33,910
I know. Selfishly,
I want to duvet you right this second,

809
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,072
but I've got to work on being okay
with being alone,

810
00:37:36,102 --> 00:37:38,726
and you've got to work on
your friendship with Olive.

811
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:42,063
We might not like it,
but it's the truth.

812
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:47,664
Well, I'm gonna need a pie.

813
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:51,238
I'm a sucker for shoofly!

814
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:54,463
What do you think?
Are we gonna be able to fix this?

815
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,404
We should assess.

816
00:37:56,604 --> 00:38:00,251
I'm working on the "having
feelings for your boyfriend" thing.

817
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:03,642
I just wish there was a switch
I could turn to "Off".

818
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:05,762
- But there just isn't.
- I know.

819
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,829
And while you do that, I'm gonna work
on the "center of the universe" thing.

820
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:10,949
In fact, I'm ready to ditch
that role for a new one...

821
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:13,111
"selflessly centered roommate".

822
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:14,919
You're staying?

823
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,264
Is that a good or incredulous question
mark at the end of that question?

824
00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:20,303
Very good. Besides,

825
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,808
the heavy lifting is behind us.

826
00:38:22,985 --> 00:38:24,828
We've laid
that cornerstone of truth.

827
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:26,681
Pounded that sucker into place.

828
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,389
Besides, it'd be such a waste
of time and effort if you left.

829
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:30,507
Agreed.

830
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:36,142
<i>As Chuck and Olive
celebrated their reunion...</i>

831
00:38:37,134 --> 00:38:40,404
<i>... Emerson Cod had
a reunion of his own.</i>

832
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:41,669
Well, finally.

833
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:44,316
A decent stogie.

834
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:47,995
I needed some comfort tobacco.

835
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:49,691
I was just about to ring you up

836
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:52,133
to tell you how much I regretted
our previous words.

837
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,943
I was about to get on a plane,

838
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:56,595
and that same regret had me
turning around, running back here.

839
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,241
You were right.

840
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:01,141
Our relationship is done.

841
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:04,359
Meaning, how our relationship was,

842
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,854
being best friends.

843
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:10,467
I'm your mama, Emmy,
and I got to start acting like it.

844
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,763
That means I can't expect you
to be as strong as me

845
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:16,157
or as grown-up.

846
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:19,168
Got to feel you can be vulnerable,

847
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:21,866
make mistakes,
and still tell me about them.

848
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,986
- Deal?
- Yeah.

849
00:39:26,734 --> 00:39:28,922
- Do I get an allowance?
- No.

850
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,828
But you do get notes...

851
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,206
on this from me.

852
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:37,601
The publisher's right.
That book is stupid.

853
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:40,367
Book ain't stupid.

854
00:39:40,736 --> 00:39:41,736
Story is.

855
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:43,904
This is about...

856
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:46,702
your childhood
with your crazy mother.

857
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:49,581
You tell that to a kid at bedtime,
he'll piss the box springs.

858
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:52,387
You got to write about
the grown-up Emerson Cod,

859
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:54,235
how great he'd be as a daddy.

860
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,655
Do that, and your little girl
will come running back in no time.

861
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:03,037
Later, Lil' Gum Shoe.

862
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:07,256
<i>As Emerson Cod enjoyed
a sense of familial peace,</i>

863
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:10,521
<i>the pie maker had a peace
of a different sort...</i>

864
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:13,038
<i>The quiet, solitary,
bachelor kind...</i>

865
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:14,966
<i>until...</i>

866
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:20,762
Oh, no.
Disaster with Olive?

867
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:22,287
It went really well...

868
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:26,511
So well, in fact, I wanted to wrap you
in goose-down goodness as a thank-you.

869
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:29,523
But, you know,
my duvet was metaphorical.

870
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:30,677
Yeah?

871
00:40:30,907 --> 00:40:32,108
Well, so was mine.

872
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,571
I've really missed you.

00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:39,767
