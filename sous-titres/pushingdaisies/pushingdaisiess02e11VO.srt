3
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,845
<i>At this very moment,</i>

4
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:14,855
<i>young Olive Snook
was 9 years, 39 weeks,</i>

5
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:17,142
<i>19 hours, 59 minutes old</i>

6
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:19,086
<i>and dressed to the nines.</i>

7
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:21,752
<i>Though she looked
the picture of perfection,</i>

8
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:24,742
<i>young Olive felt
the very picture of neglection.</i>

9
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,265
<i>The party, in full swing,</i>

10
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:30,405
<i>was the cause
of her parents' current distraction.</i>

11
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:32,640
<i>But young Olive
learned a lesson long ago.</i>

12
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:36,256
<i>She learned her mother and father
did not need a diversion</i>

13
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:38,696
<i>to be distracted
from their daughter.</i>

14
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:42,185
<i>Young Olive dreamed of a life
where she was actively loved</i>

15
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:44,225
<i>and only occasionally ignored.</i>

16
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,600
<i>As happens often with Olive Snook,</i>

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,555
<i>her dreams came true.</i>

18
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:51,520
<i>Just not quite how she intended.</i>

19
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:54,263
<i>According to her parents' testimony,</i>

20
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:57,472
<i>young Olive Snook had been stolen away
in a stolen vehicle</i>

21
00:00:57,512 --> 00:00:59,714
<i>by dangerous car thieves
and kidnappers</i>

22
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:02,923
<i>Jerry Holmes
and Roy "Buster" Bustamante.</i>

23
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:06,730
<i>Their daughter was held
for one day, one hour and 11 minutes</i>

24
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,970
<i>before Jerry and Buster
made their first ransom call.</i>

25
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,875
<i>Distraught and heartbroken,</i>

26
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:14,915
<i>Olive's parents agreed
to pay the undisclosed sum</i>

27
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,005
<i>and contacted the police.</i>

28
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:19,640
<i>The police then...</i>

29
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:21,365
<i>set a trap.</i>

30
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:26,446
<i>The little girl / future jockey /
pie-waitress-to-be</i>

31
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:29,405
<i>watched
as her abductors walked into the trap.</i>

32
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:32,055
<i>Jerry Holmes and Buster Bustamante</i>

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,840
<i>were sentenced to 25 years to life.</i>

34
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:40,450
<i>8,264 hash marks on a wall later...</i>

35
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:48,715
<i>Jerry Holmes and Buster Bustamante
busted out of the big house</i>

36
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,126
<i>with only one person on their mind.</i>

37
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:52,485
<i>Olive Snook.</i>

38
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:57,555
<i>Who was, at this very moment,
hanging from the pie maker she loved,</i>

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,040
<i>who could never love her,
or so she thought.</i>

40
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:03,720
I'm sorry you never looked at me
the same way you look at Chuck.

41
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:05,200
I wouldn't say never.

42
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:09,395
<i>Confused, not by the particulars
but by this particular usage,</i>

43
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:13,925
<i>Olive read about sentence structure
and the use of the double negative.</i>

44
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:16,695
<i>And with passive-aggressive panache,</i>

45
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:19,240
<i>broached the subject
with the pie maker.</i>

46
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,395
Try this one again.

47
00:02:24,045 --> 00:02:26,920
- I definitely don't hate it.
- What does that mean?

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,631
- Just what I said.
- You like it?

49
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:29,520
You tell me.

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,781
It wasn't less tasty
than the "kick in the kumquat"

51
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:33,965
but more unfulfilling
than the "rock me amade quince".

52
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:36,120
I don't like giving
funny names to the pies.

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,235
- Does it not seem disrespectful?
- There you go. You did it again.

54
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,680
What did I do again?

55
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:43,385
Are you okay? You've been acting
a little unusual all day.

56
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:45,781
I think I've got post-traumatic stress
from the cliff dive

57
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:47,470
that almost turned us
in handy baggies.

58
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,798
We're safe now, Olive.

59
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,360
I know but the whole thing keeps
repeating on me, over and over,

60
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,200
like a broken record
or Mexican food.

61
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,465
You know, they say
the more you face the trauma,

62
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:00,555
the less power it has over you.

63
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:03,967
Okay, so there we were,
about to die...

64
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:06,475
Get down, Olive.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

65
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:07,760
That's right, Ned.

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,080
Oh, no, I'm slipping.
I can't hold on much longer.

67
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:12,392
If you'd like to say anything,
now would be the time,

68
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:14,325
and if you could speak
in the declarative only

69
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:16,321
using affirmative
or comparative modifiers...

70
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,961
People are eating pie.

71
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,875
Ding-dong, daddy.

72
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,560
Ding-dong!

73
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:27,085
- That is heaven.
- Pearway to heaven. It's new.

74
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,998
Now that I'm out of dead-waking,

75
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:32,255
we can get back to just pie-baking
and no longer touching dead fruit,

76
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,400
I can eat my own pie.

77
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,043
I'm gonna get fat, aren't I?

78
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,560
While you're busy getting fat,

79
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,295
there's a dead lady getting fished out
in the Papen County fountain.

80
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:40,935
And I got a good feeling about it.

81
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:43,665
Ambulance sirens blaring
and I've got my chasing shoes on.

82
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:45,868
Are you sure you don't want
to untie those apron strings

83
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,635
and lace up those chasin' laces?

84
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,275
My apron is staying on

85
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:50,939
with its strings securely tied

86
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,798
in a double figure-eight
follow through knot.

87
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:56,320
I, for one, and you should be for two,
am very supportive of your decision.

88
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:59,735
Because that's what friends do.
They support each other.

89
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:00,875
Lookee here.

90
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:04,230
Yes, the zapety-zap nearly
turned everything to crapety-crap

91
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,925
on account of dead girl
and her digging-up-dead-daddy ways.

92
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:08,200
I apologized for that.

93
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:11,395
I wanna lead a normal life of a guy
who just makes pies.

94
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,635
Who wants to be Superman?
Not me.

95
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:15,840
I say no to "Super"
and yes to "Man".

96
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm Clark Kent.

97
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:21,359
Well, that's just
downright craptastic, Clark.

98
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:24,258
I now have
an abnormally large amount of work to do

99
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,550
on account of no-one here
wants to touch a dead lady

100
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:28,240
so I can ask who killed her.

101
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:31,960
Emerson! Emerson! What about me?

102
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,015
No conversation I ever want to have
begins with those three words.

103
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:37,400
- I got work to do.
- Work that you don't have to do alone.

104
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:41,072
I mean, I may not be Superman
but I'm smart and I'm helpful.

105
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:42,285
I mean...

106
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:43,983
Maybe I could be your sidekick.

107
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:46,434
I'd be the alive-again avenger
who came back from the dead

108
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:48,566
to solve her own murder
and stayed back from the dead

109
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,203
to bring justice to murder victims,

110
00:04:50,243 --> 00:04:52,800
with the help of a crusty unflappable
streetwise gumshoe.

111
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:55,480
- That'd make me the sidekick.
- I'm good either way.

112
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,025
All right, then, sidekick avenger,

113
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,915
since we no longer have Superman
and his super finger,

114
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,880
let me let you know
this is an entirely different ballgame.

115
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:08,105
- This game is all about the hustle.
- I love the hustle.

116
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:20,202
Body's been identified
off an employee ID

117
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:22,560
from <i>Dicker's Department Store</i>
as Erin Embry.

118
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:26,324
What is that smell?
It smells like Aunt Lily on a Sunday.

119
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:27,945
I mean, my mom, on a Sunday.

120
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:30,960
Single malt scotch. Something
I could use a shot of right now.

121
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,315
Cops think this was an accident.

122
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,217
A woman still in the holiday spirit,
guzzles too many spirits,

123
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:37,920
does a Gene Kelly round the rosy,

124
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:40,645
slips, bonks her noggin,
ends up in the fountain.

125
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:42,815
Which froze when the temperatures
dipped overnight.

126
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:46,005
This is just a great big waste
of my time. There ain't no case here.

127
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,765
I'm not done with the hustle.

128
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,226
Well, you're gonna be dancing
by yourself.

129
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,696
<i>But instead of dancing by herself,</i>

130
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,379
<i>Chuck found another partner
to hold her hand</i>

131
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:58,115
<i>in the only way he could.</i>

132
00:05:58,155 --> 00:05:59,756
Winter is my new best friend.

133
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,605
We should move to the South Pole.

134
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,615
Although I don't know if they have
a need for pie in the South Pole, which

135
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,926
puts a wrinkle
in my freshly-starched...

136
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:10,108
life as a normal guy who makes pies,

137
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:12,251
but I'd give it up
if I could hold your hand every day.

138
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,920
- The pie or the normal?
- Either.

139
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:17,000
But I'd prefer to have my pie
and be normal too.

140
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,685
- Where are we going?
- <i>Dicker's Department Store</i>.

141
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:21,916
That poor girl Erin Embry
was murdered

142
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,442
and she used to work in <i>Dicker's</i>.

143
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,441
Murdered?
I thought it was an accident.

144
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:28,662
No, they dismissed it as an accident
but they do that every day.

145
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:30,458
They could have dismissed my murder.

146
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,780
They could have said
that I slipped and fell overboard

147
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,464
as opposed to what really happened.

148
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:36,860
I was strangled
and thrown overboard.

149
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:39,735
Is this <i>Dicker's Department Store</i>?

150
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:42,760
That is just like the fountain
where Erin died.

151
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,939
That cocktail-swilling mannequin
is wearing the exact same dress

152
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,840
Erin was wearing,
and the same shoes!

153
00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:51,872
- This is the scene of the crime.
- Yeah! The alive-again avenger!

154
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,045
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

155
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,524
Let's go find Emerson and tell him
that Erin Embry's murder

156
00:06:55,564 --> 00:06:57,564
is displayed
in <i>Dicker's Department Store</i>.

157
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm not an avenger. I'm a pie maker.

158
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm not gonna pretend to be
something I'm not. It's stressful.

159
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:05,765
So I'm gonna go to the <i>Pie Hole</i>
and make my moniker proud.

160
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,160
Well, I'm gonna go and avenge
and make my moniker proud.

161
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,125
Who needs a Superman?

162
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
You're my hero.

163
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:17,040
<i>While the pie maker lingered
on his alive-again avenger,</i>

164
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:21,091
<i>Randy Mann, a taxidermist
who once paid for friends,</i>

165
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:23,645
<i>came to the</i> Pie Hole<i>,
bearing a gift.</i>

166
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:27,185
<i>But said gift
wasn't the first priority of his visit.</i>

167
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:29,320
- Hi-ho, pie bro!
- Who are you calling "ho"?

168
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:32,080
Randy Mann.

169
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:36,605
Miss Olive, I meant
no offense by that "ho".

170
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:39,745
The intent was to be jolly,
not derogatory.

171
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,070
Is the pie maker present?

172
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:44,365
No? I'll wait.

173
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:47,720
- Can I get you a slice of pie?
- One slice of everything, please.

174
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,280
Starting with your favourite
of the day.

175
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:52,585
I don't think eating
that much fruit is wise.

176
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:55,265
Are those the birds
Ned had you stuff?

177
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:57,640
Yeah. A birthday present
for his magician brothers.

178
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:01,879
Wow's good, right?
Wow means you like it.

179
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:03,628
Yeah.

180
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,680
You sure do turn
those birds around fast.

181
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:08,271
When starting
a new business venture,

182
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,280
it's important not to keep
the customer waiting.

183
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,856
<i>More important to Randy Mann
was keeping himself</i>

184
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:16,296
<i>from waiting to see Olive Snook.</i>

185
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:20,705
<i>And he wasn't the only person
who couldn't wait to see Olive Snook.</i>

186
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:24,445
Jiminy Kornflakes! Those are the guys
that kidnapped me when I was little!

187
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:27,351
Snook.

188
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,835
<i>Olive Snook had closed early.</i>

189
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,674
<i>But not due to a lackadaisical
work ethic or lack of patrons.</i>

190
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,600
Oh, my God! Randy!
Olive, did you hit him?

191
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,360
- Did she hit you?
- No. He hit me.

192
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,875
I got a low platelet count
and zero percent body fat.

193
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,665
That's a 1-2 punch for bruising.

194
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,360
That'd be funny if I hadn't been
the one who got punched.

195
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,475
I told you not to do it.
I told him not to do it.

196
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,239
Sucker punch. You're a sucker punch.

197
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,985
Take it easy, tough guy.
Could have been a whole lot worse.

198
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:00,825
Olive, who are these guys?

199
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,095
Who are any of us, really?

200
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:05,120
They're her childhood kidnappers.

201
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,740
They weren't exactly kidnappers.

202
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:11,381
<i>What they were, exactly, was this.</i>

203
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:15,435
<i>Jerry and Buster were petty thieves
but they were not kidnappers.</i>

204
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,326
<i>They were in the wrong car
at the wrong time</i>

205
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,816
<i>and were not alone.</i>

206
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:24,085
<i>Young Olive Snook had stowed away
in their recently stolen car,</i>

207
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,201
<i>hoping the old adage,
"absence makes the heart grow fonder"</i>

208
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,520
<i>would teach her neglectful parents
a lesson.</i>

209
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:32,536
<i>Jerry and Buster wanted
to return the little girl</i>

210
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>to her parents right away.</i>

211
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,260
What's your name, Pickle?

212
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,100
<i>But despite their attempts,
she refused to tell them her name.</i>

213
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:43,498
<i>Their argument was hushed,
so young Olive would not hear</i>

214
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:46,788
<i>that repeated calls to her parents
had gone unanswered</i>

215
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:50,655
<i>and so as not to disturb
Olive's love of cartoons.</i>

216
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:57,433
<i>The 2 days, 12 hours and 19 minutes</i>

217
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:01,240
<i>young Olive Snook spent
with Jerry Holmes and Buster Bustamante</i>

218
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:06,400
<i>were the best 2 days, 12 hours
and 19 minutes of her young life.</i>

219
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:09,925
<i>It was also the best of theirs.</i>

220
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:13,175
<i>After explaining the situation,</i>

221
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:17,415
<i>the 2 men realized young Olive's parents
hadn't even known she was gone.</i>

222
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:21,705
<i>They confronted the Snooks
on their derelict parenting skills.</i>

223
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:25,265
<i>Mum and Dad Snook took umbrage
and called the authorities.</i>

224
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:28,805
<i>As it was their word
against the word of two petty thieves,</i>

225
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,066
<i>the now accused kidnappers
were sent away</i>

226
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:33,406
<i>for the maximum the law would allow.</i>

227
00:10:33,605 --> 00:10:36,400
<i>Knowing what she'd lost
the minute they were gone,</i>

228
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:39,105
<i>young Olive vowed to keep in touch.</i>

229
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:42,325
<i>She wrote them every week
and never forgot.</i>

230
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,860
<i>And they, in turn, never forgot her.</i>

231
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,439
Did you guys just get out?

232
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,725
- Just.
- Escaped.

233
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:52,400
The word that's supposed
to follow that "just" is "escaped".

234
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:55,945
Hey, it's only a grudge over the shiner.
A grudge-holder, huh?

235
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:57,902
It's so wonderful
that you came to see me.

236
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:00,737
It won't be wonderful when the police
show up looking for ex-cons,

237
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:03,245
and find some other ex-people
we'd rather they didn't happen upon.

238
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:07,078
Which is why we need our Snook here
to help get us across the border.

239
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:08,640
It's the least I can do.

240
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,402
You never should've gone to jail

241
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,067
but no one believed that I ran away.

242
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,000
What do we always say
about the past?

243
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,395
It makes an ass out of you and me.

244
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:19,480
Can we go back to "escaped" or am I
the only one who finds that troubling?

245
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,745
- Who's the worrywart?
- That's Ned. He owns the place.

246
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:23,800
The pie maker?

247
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:27,565
- Boys...
- Budge off that stool, cranky-pants,

248
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,776
so I get a good look at the baker man
who's gonna marry our little girl.

249
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:36,705
- I thought you were...
- Actually...

250
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:44,035
Me and Olive...

251
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:47,165
<i>The pie maker considered
how the truth would humiliate Olive</i>

252
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:50,703
<i>and devastate the two sweet men
whose only happiness came</i>

253
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,053
<i>from knowing the little girl
they loved most</i>

254
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,293
<i>was loved most by the pie maker.</i>

255
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:56,495
<i>So he said:</i>

256
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:57,623
Me and Olive...

257
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,935
love each other very much.

258
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:06,485
<i>And once again,
Olive's dream came true.</i>

259
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,080
<i>Just, not quite how she intended.</i>

260
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:16,508
Olive told me all about Jerry and Buster
during one of her late-night girl talks.

261
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:20,224
We usually talk about Olive because
I'm an all-or-nothing kind of girl

262
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,264
and seeing
as I can't tell her the truth...

263
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:27,342
Little peewee bothered to mention
that she told poppa No.1 and poppa No.2

264
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:29,665
that your man ain't your man.
He's hers.

265
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:30,955
No, she didn't.

266
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,740
Loaning pie boyfriend to your bestie
who's in love with him

267
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,856
in order to pull the wool
over fake poppa's peepers

268
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:38,155
is the kind of idea that gives
a bad idea the will to live.

269
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,360
That's why I'm peeved.
I can't avenge when I'm peeved.

270
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,401
You are no good to me focusing on
your lady peeves. You need to focus...

271
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:46,363
Now Ned and Olive
are on a romantic run to the border.

272
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:48,000
Actually, I don't know
why I'm upset.

273
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:50,280
It's just for one day.
I'm being ridiculous.

274
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:51,920
A lot can happen in a day.

275
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:55,520
- So, is this the final repose of Erin?
- That's my theory.

276
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,735
Nice hustle, sidekick avenger.

277
00:12:58,265 --> 00:13:00,692
Seems to me, Erin Embry she was more
than just a spritzer girl

278
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:02,245
annoying folks with her perfume.

279
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:03,736
Erin wasn't annoying people.

280
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:05,976
She was dazzling them
with fantastic worlds

281
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:08,320
created within the facility
of the <i>Dicker's</i> window frame.

282
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,659
- Erin Embry dressed this window?
- Along with her partner, Coco Juniper,

283
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,229
although it was common knowledge

284
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,200
that Erin was the one
with the true talent.

285
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:19,085
Erin could do things with a mannequin
Coco could never do.

286
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,945
- Who in hell are you people?
- We're devotees.

287
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,785
Fans of Erin and,
to a lesser extent, Coco's.

288
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,905
But we prefer the term "devotees".

289
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,755
Any of these "devotees"
seem a little overly devoted?

290
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,760
Appropriately devoted
but overly devastated by Erin's death

291
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,320
which is soon to be avenged.

292
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,335
Now, if the alive-again avenger hustles
this case to fruition,

293
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,455
- am I still the sidekick?
- Yes.

294
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:46,000
And if the alive-again avenger really
wanted to hustle, she'd get me paid.

295
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,414
- Is it true? Erin was murdered?
- Murdered?

296
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:55,805
That's what he said. Isn't
that private investigator Emerson Cod?

297
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:58,220
Why would he be here
if there was no foul play?

298
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,175
Why would he be here
if there was no foul play?

299
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,172
I'd give my last nickel to that man
to find out what really happened to Erin

300
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,819
- and bring the killer to justice.
- So would I!

301
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,359
- Me too!
- Me too!

302
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:08,720
We all would!

303
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:17,955
Welcome to <i>Dicker's</i>. I'm Dick Dicker,
owner and proprietor.

304
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,995
What can I help you
fine folks find today?

305
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,625
A new fairy frock for the Mrs.?

306
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:24,440
A bespoke pinstripe
from the B&T section for you, sir?

307
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,275
Pocket square, mayhaps?

308
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,388
My name's Emerson Cod.
I'm a private investigator.

309
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:31,840
My associate and I were hired
to look into Erin Embry's death.

310
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:36,896
I'm confused. Why would you be hired
to look into something

311
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:39,000
that the police already decided
was an accident?

312
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:40,665
A tragic one, at that.

313
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:44,040
That still very well may be, Mr Dicker,
but that's what we intend to find out.

314
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,485
Was Erin doing well here
at <i>Dicker's</i>?

315
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,815
Erin was doing very well here
at <i>Dicker's</i>

316
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,515
and <i>Dicker's</i> was doing very well
because of Erin.

317
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:53,840
And, to a lesser extent, Coco.

318
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:56,215
- Coco Juniper?
- Yes.

319
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,066
Erin and Coco's perfectly
dressed windows

320
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,706
created congestion
in pedestrian traffic,

321
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:05,305
which created a looky-loo gridlock zone
at our front door,

322
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:09,723
which created an overflow of potential
purchasers funneling through that door,

323
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:11,735
which created retail sales.

324
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,615
Their work here meant everything
to <i>Dicker's</i>.

325
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:17,295
Any idea if that collaboration
was copacetic?

326
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,185
<i>Dicker's</i> is a family store.

327
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,325
Erin was a part of that family.

328
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:24,520
This store, its employees
and those people outside

329
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,115
are in mourning.

330
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,000
No one more so...

331
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,160
than Coco Juniper.

332
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,000
Well,

333
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:38,725
it's so... so...

334
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:41,105
wrong.

335
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:44,200
No, wrong would be relative,
as if you had, in some way,

336
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,787
got within the realm
of what would be considered right.

337
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:48,658
- Are you wincing?
- No.

338
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:51,560
- Coco, about Erin?
- Erin Embry was my partner.

339
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,280
I didn't know until she was gone
that she was my inspiration, my light.

340
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:58,525
Because without Erin Embry,
I'm left with...

341
00:15:58,565 --> 00:15:59,504
And yourself.

342
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:02,160
So what if Erin could do things
with a mannequin you could never do?

343
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:05,959
Who said Erin could do things
with a mannequin that I could never do?

344
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,890
I've never said that. Ever.

345
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,205
Well, despite what you may have heard,
I carried Erin.

346
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,520
I was just being gracious before.

347
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,311
You are aware that Erin died
in a scenario exactly like

348
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,591
the one depicted in your window?
The Papen fountain.

349
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,625
You realize that makes you
a suspect?

350
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:24,365
Yes, along with everybody else
in this room.

351
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:26,560
- Denny, did you kill Erin?
- No, Coco.

352
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:27,995
Neither did I.

353
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:29,920
What's this?

354
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:33,240
It's for the memorial window.
I think it's chic as hell.

355
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:34,680
Or it's going to be.

356
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,840
Denny, if this is what you think
is chic as hell, then go back to pairing

357
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,320
bobby-socks and training bras
in the junior's department?

358
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:44,840
We are unveiling the Erin Embry
memorial window tonight.

359
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,915
It's my unveiling too.

360
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:50,105
Everyone will see once and for all
who can do what.

361
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:51,855
Excuse us.

362
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:57,215
Maybe Coco's gone loco and killed Erin
so she could have her first solo window.

363
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,056
We need to be
at that unveiling tonight

364
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:02,600
just in case Coco did go loco
for show... co.

365
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,737
<i>What Emerson and Chuck did not know</i>

366
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:08,677
<i>was as they took a long, hard look
at the main suspect they had,</i>

367
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:13,335
<i>the killer was taking
a long, hard look at them.</i>

368
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:19,665
<i>At this very moment,
Randy Mann was confused.</i>

369
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,580
I'm confused.

370
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,680
- I thought you and Chuck...
- Not a good time.

371
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:26,799
Sorry about the cramped quarters.
I just got a new account at the zoo.

372
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:30,200
There is a very lucrative after-market
for exotic animals.

373
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,590
Aloyisius back there is going
to a major retail outlet

374
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,280
to promote big savings.

375
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,695
Hop up on your guy's lap there,
okay?

376
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:40,385
My jingle's gotta have
some room to jangle.

377
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,300
- I... I...
- Oh... come on.

378
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:47,985
Say, grudgy,

379
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,148
were you around to taxidermy
any of those fish

380
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:52,240
swimming in the <i>Pie Hole</i>
when the river backed up?

381
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,680
You told them about that too?

382
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:56,909
Fish are the only animals
I won't work on.

383
00:17:57,735 --> 00:18:00,935
When fish die, they lose
all the color in their skin

384
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,160
and an animal's color
is like their personality.

385
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:04,320
That's sweet.

386
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:07,525
What else did you tell them
about that?

387
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:09,820
She told us
when the water started rushing in

388
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,110
you got to grabbing pies
like you birthed them.

389
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,800
I think you grabbed
something else too.

390
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:18,144
They say in a time of crisis, you grab
the thing most important to you.

391
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,760
That's what I grabbed.

392
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,325
Road trip interruptus.

393
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:27,000
What do we do now?

394
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:32,680
We haven't had this many visitors
since the most recent home invasion.

395
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,480
- We could really use your help.
- And your taxidermy kit.

396
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,200
I had to take mine out of the van
to make room for the passengers.

397
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,671
- Who's dead?
- Nobody's dead.

398
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:41,280
What a silly thing to suggest.

399
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,643
We were thinking more along
the lines of disguise

400
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:45,320
so we could get past
the road blocks.

401
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:49,159
I'm gonna fashion these all-purpose
pelts into muttonchops and such.

402
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,880
And they could really
use a change of wardrobe.

403
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,318
There's a trunk full
of Charles Charles's old clothes

404
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,807
upstairs in the cheese room.

405
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,480
The only thing that smokes
in this house is the Gouda.

406
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,160
You want a cancer stick,
you stick it outside on the porch.

407
00:19:03,616 --> 00:19:06,480
This ain't quite the engagement party
we had in mind for them.

408
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:07,680
Engagement?

409
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,040
Ned?

410
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:10,280
And Olive?

411
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:16,866
What the hell do you mean, engaged?

412
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,600
- Since when?
- Since...

413
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:21,280
we love each other so much.

414
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:24,838
Yeah. What he said.

415
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,720
You know just what you're doing?

416
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:40,741
Not really.

417
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:43,998
I asked myself, what would Olive want me
to do? And this seemed like the answer.

418
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:46,803
You did exactly
what I would want you to do.

419
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:49,882
Only I'd also want you to mean it
when you say you love me.

420
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:52,197
- Not that I'm ungrateful.
- I do mean it.

421
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:53,632
In a friend way.

422
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,999
And I'm kinda having fun.

423
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,746
I get to help you in a way
that doesn't require being super,

424
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:01,108
it just requires being normal
and a little dishonest.

425
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,318
And I know you have
your reasons for writing

426
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:06,782
what you wrote in those letters
to Buster and Jerry...

427
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:09,704
and I support them
because I support you.

428
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,198
That's what friends do.

429
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:18,418
<i>The private investigator
and the alive-again avenger</i>

430
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,868
<i>returned
to </i>Dicker's Department Store

431
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,307
<i> for the unveiling
of the Erin Embry memorial window</i>

432
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:28,011
<i> in hopes her killer
would soon be unveiled as well.</i>

433
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,598
The craft and beauty
of <i>Dicker's</i> signature window displays

434
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:34,075
have long been attributed
to two women,

435
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:37,798
one of whom, due to a tragic accident,
is no longer with us.

436
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:40,506
But both we celebrate tonight

437
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:44,131
as we unveil
the Erin Embry memorial window,

438
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:47,918
designed by her long-time dressing
companion, Coco Juniper.

439
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,302
Coco!

440
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,374
Coco?

441
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:54,899
Coco wants
to greet her guests and admirers

442
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:56,958
at the cocktail memorial
after the unveiling.

443
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,918
Well, then, without further ado...

444
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:12,498
It's an essay on the afterlife.

445
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:15,118
Erin Embry's endless ascent
into a spiritual maze!

446
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,798
Look at it!
It's...

447
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:19,078
a bath. It's just a warm bath.

448
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,258
Oh, my God!

449
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,078
It's Coco!

450
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:30,068
Well, say goodbye
to suspect <i>numero uno</i>.

451
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,881
And hello victim <i>numero dos</i>.

452
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:43,685
How long you think she's been dead?

453
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:45,271
I'd say about 50 dollars.

454
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:52,158
She's cold but she ain't stiff.
No more than 30 minutes.

455
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:54,423
The exact time will take me
a little conducting.

456
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:55,638
And another $20.

457
00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:57,844
30 minutes will do. Thank you.

458
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,791
That's how it is. Well, then,
I'll make a...

459
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:01,998
mental note on that.

460
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:03,778
Don't be making
no mental notes on me.

461
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,758
At a crime scene, I make mental notes
of whatever I feel needs note-making.

462
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:09,258
Mentally.

463
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:15,598
It was my dream to work with Erin
and to a lesser extent, Coco.

464
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:17,538
Now they're both gone.

465
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,089
And my dream to mine
the creative minds

466
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:23,678
that fed my creative soul
will forever remain a fantasy.

467
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:26,238
The windows fed your creative soul?

468
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:28,398
I am so sorry, Denny.

469
00:23:28,688 --> 00:23:31,638
I mean, first Erin and now Coco.
I can't imagine how you must feel.

470
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:34,007
Like a weight has been lifted.

471
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:42,748
His honesty tilts toward
"I don't care that they died" territory.

472
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:43,833
Tilts?

473
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,291
His honesty falls right into

474
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:47,118
the "I killed both of them"
 side of things.

475
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,594
The store was closed
while Coco finished dressing that window

476
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:53,004
which means she was dead
before the public saw it.

477
00:23:53,046 --> 00:23:54,387
Not before Denny saw it.

478
00:23:54,678 --> 00:23:57,638
He knew that Coco was gonna be inside,
waiting to be greeted at the memorial.

479
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,963
Because inside
is where he killed her.

480
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,724
Time to take another visit
to Erin and Coco's workspace.

481
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:06,778
See what old Denny's been up to.

482
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,065
You?

483
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,360
Yeah.

484
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:15,646
I can't believe you saved
all of Charles Charles's old clothes.

485
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,859
I was gonna use the fabric to make
a quilt for Charlotte

486
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:19,536
but Lily said that was morbid.

487
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:21,358
I couldn't bring myself
to throw them away.

488
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,426
I'm a pack-rat of sorts myself.

489
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:26,638
Of emotions,
not so much with actual things.

490
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:29,438
Is that why you previously denied
your relationship with Ned?

491
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,244
About that. I should pro...

492
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:35,878
It's the veil I was to wear when Charles
and I got married, the son of a bitch.

493
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:37,896
Holy matrimony.

494
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:40,188
I had hoped
Charlotte might wear it some day.

495
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:43,487
The news of your engagement
has restored in me a faith

496
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:46,078
that true love exists
for people who deserve it.

497
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:48,680
That's so depressing.

498
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,127
You've given me
something to believe in.

499
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:52,842
Like the likeness of the Virgin Mary

500
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:55,520
found ingrained
in the center of a potato or tortilla.

501
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:57,078
Right now,

502
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,958
you and Ned are my tortilla.

503
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:04,638
<i>Olive couldn't bring herself
to disavow Vivienne's restored belief</i>

504
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:07,994
<i>in vows so, instead,
she simply said:</i>

505
00:25:08,385 --> 00:25:09,228
Thanks.

506
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:24,063
Look at that.

507
00:25:24,187 --> 00:25:27,651
Not a pen, not a paperclip,
not a no thing.

508
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:30,278
These people didn't do
a damn thing for themselves.

509
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,638
They didn't have to when they had
someone doing everything for them.

510
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:36,480
I wonder what Olive's doing
with Ned right now.

511
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:40,318
Think you can pour a saucer of milk
and see if kitty will splash?

512
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,878
This ain't my milk
and I ain't dipping my paw in it.

513
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:45,239
I'm not being catty,
I'm being concerned.

514
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:47,419
You said a lot can happen
in one day.

515
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:50,139
You know what you're doing
when you said that.

516
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:51,898
Yeah, I know. Dipping my paw.

517
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:55,255
I mean, what if Olive holds his hand
without gloves or...

518
00:25:55,984 --> 00:25:58,252
kisses him
without using plastic food wrap?

519
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:00,649
He'll know
what he was missing with me.

520
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,958
The only thing pie man
is gonna be missing is you.

521
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:05,626
He's always fretting
that you're gonna get up and go

522
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:07,610
and you're worried
that he got up and went.

523
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,827
I'm telling you,
ain't nobody going nowhere.

524
00:26:12,008 --> 00:26:12,758
Bouya!

525
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:14,242
Denny's book!

526
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:18,500
And all the artistic renderings

527
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,798
of Coco and Erin's windows
here at <i>Dicker's</i>.

528
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:23,358
Hang on.

529
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:26,358
Coco and Erin
didn't design any of these windows.

530
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,638
Chic-as-hell Denny did.

531
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:30,457
People who need people
to do every damn thing for 'em

532
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:32,432
aren't always
the luckiest people in the world.

533
00:26:32,472 --> 00:26:34,159
Sometimes those peeps get pissed off

534
00:26:34,241 --> 00:26:36,076
and start resenting
their lazy-ass bosses.

535
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:38,816
Erin and Coco's peep done gone
and killed both of 'em.

536
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,218
- Peep this, playa.
- Don't do that.

537
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,101
Sorry. That looks an awful lot
like Dick Dicker.

538
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:47,358
We'd better find Dick before
this pissed-off peep pops him next.

539
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:48,446
Come on.

540
00:26:53,552 --> 00:26:55,125
I never thought I'd say this...

541
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:57,440
but we need to back off
on the PDA cause Vivienne's Ps

542
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,569
and Qs have gone AWOL
and I can't take much

543
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:01,290
more of what I just took
before I'm DOA.

544
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,149
Use your words.

545
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:06,511
Or your veil.
Use your veil. Your... wedding veil.

546
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:09,488
You've a wedding veil, why do you have
a veil? We're still just playing, right?

547
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,441
Vivienne's jumped the bridal shark

548
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:14,075
and unless you're actually planning
on saying "I do" at some point,

549
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,518
we're gonna have enough explaining
to do before we call it off.

550
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,448
I really appreciate
you going along with all of this.

551
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,867
You don't have to thank me.

552
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:23,370
I've been curious about having
a normal relationship.

553
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:25,678
This one's been really interesting
to try on.

554
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:27,928
Try on?

555
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:31,638
You try on a sweater at the mall.
You try on your best friend's bra

556
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,142
and you smile on the inside
'cause yours are bigger and better.

557
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:35,638
You don't "try on" a person.

558
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,588
- Clearly not the right choice of words.
- Is that what...

559
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:41,367
"Well I wouldn't say never"
was all about?

560
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,279
Were you trying me on in your head?

561
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:48,320
- I don't know what words to choose now.
- I do!

562
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:52,358
Listen up!
'Cause I'm only gonna say this once.

563
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:55,328
First and foremost, I'm sorry,

564
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:58,214
both for what I'm about to tell you
and the hysteria with which

565
00:27:58,254 --> 00:28:00,249
I'm about to tell it which is no way

566
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:03,718
directed at any of you, nor is related
to a female issue of any kind.

567
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:08,159
Ned is not my fiancé.

568
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,030
He does not love me.

569
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:12,216
We are not a couple,
never have been.

570
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:13,843
I love him but...

571
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,031
he never had feelings for me.

572
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,318
Well, I wouldn't say never.

573
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:20,879
I'm so sorry.

574
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:23,760
I ain't mad at you.

575
00:28:25,012 --> 00:28:25,798
Take mad

576
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:28,118
and multiply that by a power
of pissed.

577
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:31,190
Don't be mad. And certainly
not to a power of that degree.

578
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:32,577
I love Olive,

579
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:34,212
as a friend.

580
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:37,434
I think you probably should just go.

581
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:38,518
I didn't mean...

582
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:41,281
Olive, I just wanted to help.

583
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,969
I know but I don't want
that kind of help.

584
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:45,798
Try-on time's over, Ned.

585
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:50,258
I'm sorry.

586
00:28:59,036 --> 00:28:59,887
I can't go.

587
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,238
<i>Jerry Holmes and Buster Bustamante,</i>

588
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:05,264
<i>we have you surrounded.</i>

589
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:07,836
<i>Surrender and come out
with your hands up.</i>

590
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,158
<i>Release the hostages
and surrender now.</i>

591
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:15,416
The news man on the radio lauded
the concerned neighbour who reported

592
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:17,270
the 2 gentlemen
who matched the description

593
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,393
of the recently escape prisoners
after seeing...

594
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,190
them on a porch smoking cigarettes.

595
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:23,807
Well, it's a filthy habit.

596
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,758
We can't go back, Snook.

597
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,198
You're not going back. I promise.

598
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:30,739
Fine mess we've gotten into, huh?

599
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,208
I do my fair share
of making messes too.

600
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,363
You're
the same nine-year-old little girl

601
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:37,551
who climbed into the back
seat of our getaway car

602
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:40,202
doing ass-over-tea-kettle
crazy things

603
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:42,278
just to get people
to pay attention to you.

604
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:46,078
<i>While Olive pondered
how everything had gone so wrong,</i>

605
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:49,156
<i>the pie maker tried to figure out
how he could make it right.</i>

606
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:51,498
I only did what I thought
she'd want me to do.

607
00:29:52,008 --> 00:29:54,940
I thought I'd be helpful by pretending
to be normal and not super.

608
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:58,078
Clark Kent never had
this much trouble with relationships.

609
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,405
That's because he didn't have any.

610
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:01,861
- Sure he did.
- No, he didn't.

611
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,299
I mean, Superman did.

612
00:30:03,446 --> 00:30:05,246
Nobody gave a crap about Clark Kent.

613
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:07,464
He could disappear off the face
of the Daily Planet

614
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:09,019
and nobody would even notice.

615
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:12,040
But I bet he'd spit spandex
to find someone special enough

616
00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:14,045
who cared about the man
and not the cape.

617
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,838
<i>The pie maker looked at Olive,</i>

618
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:19,368
<i>the person who cared for the man
and knew nothing of the cape.</i>

619
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:22,632
<i>And silently wished
for spandex saliva.</i>

620
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,833
But if Lois or Mr White

621
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:27,921
or Jimmy Olsen found out that Clark
and Superman were one and the same,

622
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:30,038
then Clark would be
more studly and cool

623
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:33,078
but on his own,
he's just a super-tall clumsy guy

624
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:34,831
cramming himself into a phone booth.

625
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:37,718
If you were Clark Kent,
what would you do right now?

626
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,961
I would rip off my shirt
and become Superman.

627
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:42,732
I mean, come on.

628
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:46,151
People that have superpowers
don't not want to use them.

629
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,200
Where are you going?

630
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:53,443
To put on my cape.

631
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:58,798
<i>Emerson Cod and his sidekick, Chuck,</i>

632
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:02,558
<i>found Dick Dicker to forewarn him
Denny Downs had gone demented.</i>

633
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,126
We believe Denny Downs
has gone demented.

634
00:31:05,168 --> 00:31:06,756
Denny designed the windows?

635
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,567
- What were Erin and Coco doing?
- Taking the credit.

636
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:12,320
He got fed up of doing all of the work
and getting none of the glory.

637
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,879
You're another boss he blames.

638
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:16,894
Looks like you're meant to be
his window-whacking finale.

639
00:31:17,431 --> 00:31:19,576
Denny's been part of
the <i>Dicker's</i> family for years.

640
00:31:19,618 --> 00:31:21,614
I can't believe
what you're telling me.

641
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:22,919
I need a drink.

642
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:24,759
Would you like a drink?

643
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,855
Well, I wouldn't say no to a snort.

644
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,124
A scotch, please.

645
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,045
I'm out of scotch

646
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:33,538
but I make the most divine <i>pomegranatini</i>
that'll ever passed your lips.

647
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,478
Now, we've notified the authorities
but they still can't locate Denny.

648
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:40,001
He's on the loose?

649
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,729
I'll need a proper bodyguard.

650
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,990
Samson, my driver, would use me
as a human shield in a heartbeat

651
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,998
if there was even
the vaguest notion of threat.

652
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:48,279
What do I do?

653
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:49,799
Get thee to a police station.

654
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:52,710
We'll get we to the morgue
to get the coroner's report

655
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:55,518
and see if the science of the dead
matches the theory in my head.

656
00:31:55,687 --> 00:31:57,718
<i>While the private investigator
and avenger</i>

657
00:31:57,801 --> 00:32:00,480
<i>advised Dick Dicker
to seek the police,</i>

658
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:04,115
<i>the pie maker was trying

659
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:31,479
Rhino!

660
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:37,531
Hey, Rhino!

661
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:38,960
I thought he was dead.

662
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:45,878
Faster than a speeding bullet.

663
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,341
I'm going to bed.

664
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:07,900
<i>The pie maker helped
his friends in need,</i>

665
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:10,442
<i>not by pretending he was
something he was not,</i>

666
00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:14,259
<i>but by embracing
the very thing he always was.</i>

667
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,529
<i>It gave him a feeling of joy
he would later liken to...</i>

668
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:20,384
<i>leaping tall buildings
in a single bound.</i>

669
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:28,896
The indentation of the dent in Erin's
dome looks a hell of a lot like

670
00:33:28,936 --> 00:33:30,908
the crystallic decanters
in Dick's limo.

671
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,415
Do you think that Denny
was trying to frame Dick Dicker?

672
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:34,794
Denny ain't the killer.

673
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:38,794
I'm Superman. I've got a finger faster
than a speeding bullet.

674
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,358
Come on, who can I touch?

675
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:42,117
Ned, you're touching
dead things again?

676
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:43,730
No more pretending to be normal.

677
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,598
The best way I can help anyone
is by being a pie-making dead-waker.

678
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,822
Pretending to be something
I'm not is a recipe for disaster.

679
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:52,879
So, I say yes to "super"
and no to "normal".

680
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:55,501
If Caped Crusader really
is back in the super saddle,

681
00:33:55,543 --> 00:33:57,435
touch these Dicker dames
and prove me right.

682
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:01,678
Hello.
Hello.

683
00:34:01,762 --> 00:34:04,249
Very happy to tell you that me being
a dead-waker gives you exactly

684
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:06,927
one minute to help you help us
by confirming my partner's theory.

685
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:08,560
Did Dicker do you in

686
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,005
when he brained you with the crystal
stopper of his decanter?

687
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:12,880
Yes! He poured me a scotch,

688
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:15,358
said my work was an inspiration
and started beating me to death.

689
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:18,644
He said that the store going under
was the only way to get out of

690
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:20,883
the family business
and still stay in the family.

691
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,518
Being the true talent
behind the windows, he said I had to die

692
00:34:23,602 --> 00:34:25,290
because I brought in
all the customers.

693
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,100
You?

694
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,878
If I had legs,
I would kick your ass.

695
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:29,701
Where are your legs?

696
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,318
Dick fed me to the escalator, after
ranting like a size 10 at a sample sale.

697
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,199
He said he was wrong about you

698
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,362
and it was my work
that brought in the customers.

699
00:34:37,614 --> 00:34:39,918
Without both of your windows
bringing business in,

700
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:42,110
- <i>Dicker's</i> would have hit the skids.
- Time's up.

701
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:44,278
No, I...

702
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,454
If he was willing to kill his designers
to make sure the store would go down,

703
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,784
and now he knows that Denny
is the real designer...

704
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,038
Denny's about to be damned
with praise.

705
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:59,101
<i>The facts were these.</i>

706
00:35:00,205 --> 00:35:03,243
<i>Dick Dicker had a desperate desire
to be rid of the family</i>

707
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:04,984
<i> that owned the family store.</i>

708
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,776
<i>But he did not want to be disowned.</i>

709
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:11,522
<i>The fantastical windows created
by Erin Embry and Coco Juniper</i>

710
00:35:11,564 --> 00:35:13,072
<i>brought customers in,</i>

711
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:15,558
<i>so Dick decided to eliminate</i>

712
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,638
<i>who he believed
to be the talented member of the team.</i>

713
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,446
<i>Only to discover,
once the deed was done,</i>

714
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:25,049
<i>that Erin wasn't
the one with talent.</i>

715
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:27,541
<i>Dick penned a suicide note,</i>

716
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,268
<i>claiming credit for the murders
of Erin Embry and Coco Juniper,</i>

717
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,398
<i>signed it Denny Downs
and prepared to strike.</i>

718
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,415
<i>Debbie Dicker became the proprietress
of </i>Dicker's Department Store<i>.</i>

719
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,756
<i>She promoted Denny Downs
to head window designer</i>

720
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:48,292
<i>who, in turn, appointed Wendell
Featherstone as his new apprentice.</i>

721
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,401
Ned doesn't love me.

722
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:54,684
He's with someone else
he loves very much.

723
00:35:55,342 --> 00:35:57,038
Hear me, and hear me good,
little girl.

724
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:00,352
The guy who loves you

725
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:02,358
really loves you.

726
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:05,225
You will never have to wonder
how he feels about you.

727
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:09,305
You will feel it with every inch
of the 59 you've got.

728
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:13,779
The grouch up there has been stuck
in our sorry situation

729
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:17,318
without a peep of what-for
or how-come,

730
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,767
and he ain't doing it
for his health.

731
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:30,277
Hiya.

732
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:32,732
I'm really sorry
about your rhinoceros.

733
00:36:32,864 --> 00:36:35,114
Can't go crying over
a spilt rhinoceros...

734
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,491
es.

735
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:40,878
Although I am mortified
that Aloyisius was still alive.

736
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:43,666
That is not the kind of thing
a taxidermist...

737
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,320
should ever overlook.

738
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:47,838
I've been doing
some overlooking myself.

739
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:50,190
I wanted to thank you, Randy Mann.

740
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:53,318
Don't mention it, Miss Olive.
I'd aid and abet you any time.

741
00:36:55,722 --> 00:36:58,816
But just so I don't get confused again,
you and the pie bro

742
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:00,358
are or are not engaged?

743
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:03,217
The only thing
we were engaged in was shenanigans.

744
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,998
Shenanigans that could put
Buster and Jerry back in the big house

745
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:08,826
unless we get them across
the border.

746
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:10,560
But I don't know how.

747
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:12,814
I am not above prayer.

748
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:17,666
When I was in the nunnery,
Mother Superior said prayer was just...

749
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,359
reaching out your hands,
knowing the Good Lord was...

750
00:37:20,957 --> 00:37:21,889
reaching back.

751
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:24,518
Who would Mother Superior tell you
to reach out to now?

752
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,158
I'm reaching out to you.

753
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,761
Buster and Jerry served their time,
well,

754
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:34,838
most of it, anyway.
But they should have served none of this

755
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,636
since they were wrongfully accused.

756
00:37:36,678 --> 00:37:40,281
The wrongfully accused are not guilty
in the eyes of the Lord.

757
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,278
Praise be.

758
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,958
Good morning, sisters.

759
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,718
What may I serve thee
while you serve the on high?

760
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,217
We're not here for earthly delights.

761
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:51,786
The sisters are here for salvation
from their burdened bladders.

762
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:56,398
I'd hoped they might use your rest room
in this, their time of need.

763
00:37:56,654 --> 00:38:00,039
I love the god-loving but our rest rooms
are for our customers only.

764
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:02,778
Go on, girls.

765
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:05,562
The sisters
of the Divine Magnatum and I

766
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:07,520
are spreading
the good word in the community.

767
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:10,942
I pray the good word gets spread
to the very edges of our country

768
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,923
and spills over into countries that may
not be looking for the good word.

769
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:15,958
Or recognize it when they see it.

770
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:18,853
- Or hear it.
- Or hear it, indeed.

771
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,140
You inspire me, big momma.

772
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,792
The pie and the pee-break's on me.

773
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:25,806
In the name of charity, of course.

774
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:27,600
Peace be with you.

775
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:29,918
And also with you, my child.

776
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:34,198
<i>With the aid of Mother Superior,
who'd become a superior mother figure,</i>

777
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:37,430
<i>Olive Snook had arranged
for her father figures</i>

778
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:39,718
<i>to cross the border after all.</i>

779
00:38:43,062 --> 00:38:45,227
<i>While the pie maker
and the girl named Chuck</i>

780
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:47,266
<i>rearranged the storage room</i>

781
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:50,638
<i>to accommodate the ingredients
a super pie maker needs.</i>

782
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:53,527
You'd think that stocking dead fruit for
baking while we waited for fresh fruit

783
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:56,575
to rot would be depressing
but I find it sort of cathartic.

784
00:38:57,507 --> 00:39:00,115
There is a satisfaction in putting
things back where they belong.

785
00:39:00,157 --> 00:39:02,559
And return to normal.
At least, normal for us.

786
00:39:04,402 --> 00:39:07,646
I missed you
on our bachelor party border run.

787
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:09,438
Well, it's better that I didn't go.

788
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,333
I was peeved just thinking about it.

789
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:12,272
Peeved?

790
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:14,747
About you and Olive out
celebrating your relationship

791
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,120
when all we do is hide ours.

792
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,398
So. Yeah, I was peeved.

793
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:22,446
I was celebrating a fake relationship
and there were circumstances,

794
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:24,299
and drama. I was evading the law.

795
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:28,398
Are you jealous of Olive?

796
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:30,450
Of course I am.

797
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:32,799
I mean, she's alive
and everybody knows it, for one.

798
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:34,208
And...

799
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:37,427
you get to share romantic anecdotes
and there's no plot holes.

800
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:40,758
You don't have to wait
till winter to hold her hand.

801
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:43,817
The only hand I want
to hold is yours and I...

802
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:47,593
will wear winter gloves year-round
to do it. So don't be jealous.

803
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:50,712
Besides, Olive is finally over me.

804
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:53,394
Even when I thought I was doing
everything she wanted me to do,

805
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:56,108
I still ended up hurting her.

806
00:39:58,427 --> 00:40:01,868
<i>The guilt the pie maker felt over
the hurt he'd caused...</i>

807
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,951
<i>was mixed with a tinge of...</i>

808
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:05,156
<i>something.</i>

809
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:07,616
<i>But he did not know what.</i>

810
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:23,453
<i>The pie maker watched Randy
take Olive's hand and hold it in his.</i>

811
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:27,318
<i>Then, without warning,
he knew what that something was.</i>

812
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:31,522
<i>The tinge he hadn't been able
to identify just moments ago.</i>

813
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,596
<i>Jealousy.</i>
