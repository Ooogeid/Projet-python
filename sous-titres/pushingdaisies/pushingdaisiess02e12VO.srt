3
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:10,680
<i>Young Emerson Cod is 11 years,</i>

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,600
<i>2 months, 8 days and 3 hours old.</i>

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,400
<i>He is in big trouble.</i>

6
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:21,240
<i>For this was his sixth visit
in ten days to the principal's office.</i>

7
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:25,610
<i>The previous Tuesday had seen
young Emerson punch future frat boy</i>

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>and current lunch money extorter,
Guy Baxter.</i>

9
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:32,955
<i>Wednesday saw the return
of young Emerson to the big couch</i>

10
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:36,649
<i>for the crime of inappropriate
intentional double</i> entendre

11
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,000
<i>during the science fair.</i>

12
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:42,805
<i>He returned the following Monday
after a second encounter with Baxter.</i>

13
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:47,281
<i>Young Emerson assured everyone
that he would leave Guy alone now,</i>

14
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,520
<i>as the bully had no more eyes.</i>

15
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:51,212
<i>Specialists were summoned,</i>

16
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,680
<i>tests given, therapies administered.</i>

17
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:55,964
<i>A boy of above-average intelligence</i>

18
00:00:56,004 --> 00:01:00,004
<i>who previously had nothing
but respect for rules and regulation,</i>

19
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:03,615
<i>young Emerson's mischief
remained an utter mystery.</i>

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,478
<i>Because what troubled him</i>

21
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:08,960
<i>was not parental alienation
or sublimated anger.</i>

22
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:10,425
<i>It was a heart.</i>

23
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:14,200
<i>He was in love
with Principal Eleanor Swindle.</i>

24
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:17,993
<i>That year, young Emerson
learned his most important lesson,</i>

25
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:20,333
<i>love makes you stupid.</i>

26
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:31,126
Randy Mann, what brings you in
out of the cold?

27
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,240
I think we're in
for a mid-winter thaw.

28
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:36,710
Normally, in the mornings, I can see
my breath from under the sheets,

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,040
which is kind of daunting
because I sleep in the nude.

30
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,816
But as long as I cocoon myself
in my comforter and...

31
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,040
Can I help you with that?

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
I'll be okay if there's a satisfying
and unexpected point to this story.

33
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,360
I couldn't see my breath
this morning.

34
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:52,955
And I'm looking for Olive.

35
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:55,875
- Now we're talking. Olive?
- Yeah?

36
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,240
You have a gentleman caller
coming out of the thaw.

37
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,671
What he did what what?

38
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:01,445
Randy, hi.

39
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:04,720
- I need to...
- Go!

40
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,918
- Randy's back.
- To see Olive in an awkward

41
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,480
"I was nowhere near your neighborhood
but I thought I'd stop by" kinda way.

42
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:13,400
Look, it's so sweet.

43
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:14,729
Yeah, I'm happy.

44
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:17,013
She's been through a tough patch
I've made tougher,

45
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,835
and by that, I mean definitely did.
I want this to work out with Randy.

46
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,855
What better place
to nurture romance than the <i>Pie Hole</i>?

47
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:26,295
Warmth, pie, snuggly booths.

48
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:29,002
All the right ingredients.

49
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,800
Love doesn't need the right ingredients,
it's heartier than that.

50
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:34,960
- What?
- You said love was heartier.

51
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:37,475
Well, it is heartier.
I mean, we're like those...

52
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:40,466
blind fish that live in volcanoes
at the bottom of the ocean.

53
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:42,935
Only we're two fish
that can't even touch.

54
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:45,280
Cause normally fish
are all over each other.

55
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,360
Our love has grown and survived in spite
of everything we've been through.

56
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:50,880
We've been through a lot.

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,610
Here is to us
for successfully navigating

58
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:57,120
some extremely rough
and very complicated seas.

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,935
And here's to Randy and Olive.

60
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,800
May they have smooth sailing ahead.

61
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:02,765
Cheers.

62
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,083
- What are we toasting to?
- You and...

63
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:06,673
Why is... Randy leaving?

64
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:09,395
Just decided to call it quits.
Too much, too soon.

65
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:11,335
Actually, it was just me. Singular.

66
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,395
So, more accurately, I would say
it was me who decided to call it quits.

67
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:16,680
I'll be in the kitchen
rationalizing my panic attack.

68
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:19,455
Man overboard.

69
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:23,089
Randy, you know
when people are nervous sometimes,

70
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,575
it's really easy to misunderstand
what they mean.

71
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:28,315
Yeah, I mean, everything
was going fine and then,

72
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:31,455
suddenly she said "goodbye",
and "Thanks for coming".

73
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:34,055
Then she shook my hand,
which was weird.

74
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,947
It's been hard for Olive. She's been
through a sticky swamp of emotions.

75
00:03:36,987 --> 00:03:39,480
She just...
She doesn't wanna get stuck again.

76
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,545
Well, I know all about her
getting stuck on Ned,

77
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:45,455
- but she said she was over it.
- It's scary starting something new.

78
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:47,286
It's about exposing your heart to...

79
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:49,974
a stranger and putting your faith
in the idea of someone

80
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:53,635
before you even have a chance to get
to know the truth about who they are.

81
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:57,275
You know what it's like?
It's like driving a car blindfolded.

82
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,320
You just have to relax.

83
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,480
Relax.

84
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:03,016
Relax?

85
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:05,520
Maybe bull fighting
is the wrong comparison,

86
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,100
but it's hard making
these things work.

87
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,360
You're telling me these things
are hard to make work?

88
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,395
I know that because you taught me.

89
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:14,239
Maybe that's why Randy's scary
to you.

90
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:17,278
Because you're not used to something
being easy and maybe really great.

91
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:18,615
Oh, my God,

92
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:20,395
I'm that girl.

93
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,124
I'm that girl in high school
who's afraid of real relationships

94
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,305
so she's always attracted
to guys in college,

95
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:26,345
or Canada.

96
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
Or you.

97
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:31,360
I just want you to be happy, Olive.

98
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,320
So what you're saying is
I shouldn't run away from Randy?

99
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,160
That Randy might be just
what I need right now.

100
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:37,992
Yes.

101
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:40,997
A quick fling to heal the scars
and rub ointment on the burns from us

102
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:43,495
and then rip off and toss away
like a used square of gauze.

103
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:44,285
Not yes.

104
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,725
- He's Randy Rebound.
- No, he's not.

105
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:51,295
<i>As the pie maker began to doubt his plan
to reunite the would be lovers,</i>

106
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:55,280
<i>a mile to the west,
another reunion was taking place.</i>

107
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
<i>Simone Hundin,
breeder of well-heeled dogs...</i>

108
00:04:58,615 --> 00:04:59,415
Stay.

109
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:03,670
<i>Recently returned from the Merryweather
Multi City Canine Cavalcade</i>

110
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,410
<i>with her dog, Bubblegum.</i>

111
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:10,680
Without constant reinforcement,
even the best training gets forgotten.

112
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:12,978
You take off like that again

113
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:15,968
and I may just forget
we got something going on.

114
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,255
No such luck.

115
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:20,555
You should know neither Bubblegum
nor I are prone to bolting.

116
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:21,695
That's good.

117
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:23,760
That's very good.

118
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:27,075
- Sounds like there's a story.
- <i>There was a story.</i>

119
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:30,450
<i>Emerson had once fallen
for a woman who had bolted</i>

120
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,801
<i>and taken their baby daughter
to boot.</i>

121
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:34,330
Does it have to do with this book?

122
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,572
<i>Emerson had written a pop-up book
about his missing daughter,</i>

123
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:40,640
<i>in hopes that one day
he would get it published</i>

124
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,315
<i>and she would read it
and come find him.</i>

125
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:44,240
It's nothing.

126
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:49,080
I realize what we have
is in the paper trailing phase,

127
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,960
but we did agree to be honest.

128
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,390
- I am being honest...
- I like you.

129
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:55,973
I'm intensely optimistic
about our prospects

130
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,406
but you need to know that,
like any animal in a new situation,

131
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:00,546
the thing I hate most
is being surprised.

132
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,600
Forgive me but your door was ajar.

133
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:07,066
Just being ajar
doesn't change the fact

134
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:08,599
it was a door before it was ajar,

135
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,480
which would indicate to most people
to a-knock before a-entering.

136
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:13,615
How are you, Emerson?

137
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:19,000
Simone, this is
Miss Amelia Stingwell,

138
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,760
sister of Roland Rollie Stingwell,
owner of Papen County Dam.

139
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:25,791
I'd tell you more about it except for,
due to various reasons,

140
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:28,325
we haven't spoken in nine years.

141
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:30,320
Those various reasons are dead now.

142
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:33,245
Rollie was killed last night.

143
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,085
I'm sorry about your loss.

144
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,046
He'd pop a vein if he knew I were here
asking you to solve his murder but...

145
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,520
you've always been the best in town.

146
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,525
Whoever killed Rollie must have
also taken the dam ruby.

147
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,565
- It's gone.
- The damn ruby?

148
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,002
The D-A-M drop-the-N ruby,

149
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:53,600
as in a very valuable precious stone
dug up when they built the dam.

150
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:57,000
He always had it with him,
never took it off.

151
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:59,325
You find that ruby...

152
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,720
and you'll find Rollie's killer.

153
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:06,345
After everything that happened
all those years ago, Emerson,

154
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:09,240
I'd say it was the least
that you could do.

155
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:11,065
Good day.

156
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:15,955
What happened
between you and Rollie?

157
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,600
Nothin'.

158
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,085
<i>The facts were these.</i>

159
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:23,066
<i>Roland Rollie Stingwell, millionaire
builder of the Papen County Dam,</i>

160
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:26,524
<i>sole director of the</i> Papen County
Water and Power <i>Department,</i>

161
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:30,514
<i>was last seen getting ready to leave
after a busy day at the office.</i>

162
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:33,680
<i>His assistant said nothing
seemed unusual as she said...</i>

163
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,925
Good night.

164
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:37,715
<i>And headed out early
for a dinner engagement.</i>

165
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:41,391
<i>What engagements engaged
Rollie Stingwell in the following hours</i>

166
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:43,360
<i>were not known
until the next morning</i>

167
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:46,670
<i>when his body was discovered
in a dry river bed</i>

168
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,910
<i>one half mile from the dam.</i>

169
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:55,109
Thanks for coming down.

170
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:01,605
The poor man and his poor head!

171
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:04,840
Think of him like an owl.

172
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:09,840
That was funny.
He said "Hoo" like an owl.

173
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:12,405
And how's it going, Rollie?

174
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:16,080
Of all people, I did not expect
to see you here, Emerson Cod.

175
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:18,117
- You know each other?
- We're affiliates,

176
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:19,880
affiliated
with a common third party.

177
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:22,600
There was nothing common
about her and you know it.

178
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:24,481
He stole away the love of my life,

179
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:27,671
and the dopey thing about it
is I paid him to do it.

180
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,480
- I trusted you, Cod.
- Hey, you got your money back.

181
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,600
And it ain't stealing if the thing
you're stealing wants to be stolen.

182
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,286
I have questions,
which I will wait to ask.

183
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:37,326
Strange.

184
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:39,953
I spent my life
being angry about this,

185
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:41,606
but now,

186
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:43,215
here in...

187
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:45,680
A limbo with non-denominational
way station.

188
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,135
The anger has gone...

189
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:50,565
and I can see I spent my life

190
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:53,040
living in a haze of a broken heart.

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,120
I don't mean to step on toes
but shouldn't someone ask who did it?

192
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:58,465
I have tamed nature,

193
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:00,360
I have stopped rivers from flowing.

194
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:04,360
But there is one thing I could never do
and that was make that woman love me.

195
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,119
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, Stingwell,

196
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,600
neither could I.

197
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,640
It does make me feel better.

198
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,840
- Who killed you, Stingwell?
- You really wanna know?

199
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,400
It was Lila Robinson herself.

200
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:19,440
I assume she came back
to steal the ruby.

201
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,800
Man, I wish you'd have said
anyone else.

202
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,180
Thank you for your time.

203
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,440
Who the heck is Lila Robinson?

204
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,815
She's the baby momma
that took my daughter.

205
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:38,123
How can you not tell me
that you had a daughter?

206
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:40,045
We have buried bodies together.

207
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,872
I mean, you have a daughter,
a daughter.

208
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,996
Have you known all this time
and didn't tell me?

209
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,911
You know you ain't
foolin' nobody, right?

210
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:51,368
I know that every secret I tell you
spends about 20 seconds being a secret

211
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:54,585
before it spills out of your mouth
and into dead girl's ears.

212
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,320
- Now, that is not true.
- It is.

213
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,760
It's true. But I still can't believe
you didn't tell me.

214
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,832
What about Simone?
Does she know?

215
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:03,400
I'll take that as a no.

216
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,268
As much as I'd love to sit ruminating
about my pain for past over a pie,

217
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:09,558
can we please find something else
to chatter about?

218
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,395
Emerson shouldn't feel any pressure
to divulge the details of his past.

219
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:16,635
It's not like we've ever shared
big secrets with him.

220
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:18,745
It's complicated.

221
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,850
What is so complicated about finding
your baby-stealing baby momma

222
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,280
and getting your daughter back?

223
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:27,535
If Lila killed Roland Stingwell
and stole that dam ruby,

224
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:30,525
we've just been hired to track her down
and find your daughter.

225
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,825
Chuck's right. We should trace
Mr Stingwell's last steps.

226
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,640
Maybe Lila left a trail behind.

227
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:38,265
I've spent the last seven years
tracking down her and my kid.

228
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:42,305
Lila is a wily genius,
a man-eating, shape-shifting grifter

229
00:10:42,515 --> 00:10:45,840
who knows how to get in and get out
and vanish like heat off a blacktop.

230
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,600
At least we could try.

231
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,440
We need to try.

232
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,480
Maybe I could give it one more shot.

233
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:02,255
I don't know your daughter's name.

234
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:05,165
Penny.

235
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,040
My daughter's name is Penny.

236
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,505
<i>The facts were these.</i>

237
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:16,045
<i>9 years, 2 months, 14 days
and 9 minutes earlier,</i>

238
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:19,480
<i>Rollie Stingwell hired the PI
to tail his fiancée,</i>

239
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,600
<i>Miss Emily von Alistair,</i>

240
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,160
<i>who Rollie suspected
was having an affair.</i>

241
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:26,898
<i>The affair, however,
was with a dead man,</i>

242
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:29,255
<i>one Henry David Thuroe.</i>

243
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,880
<i>And her furtive trips away
seemed to show only her desire</i>

244
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,477
<i>for a moment of solitude
and ornithology</i>

245
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:38,067
<i>to avoid the hubbub
of wedding planning.</i>

246
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:42,795
<i>But hiding from a bird watcher
in a Lincoln Continental is not easy.</i>

247
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:45,000
<i>And so...</i>

248
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,690
<i>Emily von Alistair
began sharing her daily solitude,</i>

249
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,830
<i>as well as her sandwich
and thermos of tomato soup.</i>

250
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:53,404
<i>While unconventional,</i>

251
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,639
<i>Emerson reasoned he was still</i>

252
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:58,307
<i>very much keeping an eye on Emily.</i>

253
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:00,215
<i>With each passing thermos,</i>

254
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:03,247
<i>the private investigator
grew more blind to the fact</i>

255
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:06,023
<i>that he was fast approaching
the thin line</i>

256
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>between stakeout and make out.</i>

257
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,852
<i>Emerson hesitated,
knowing it was wrong,</i>

258
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,041
<i>but Emily had a solution,
and that was to tell the truth.</i>

259
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,440
There's something I need to tell you
that I should probably keep to myself.

260
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:25,575
<i>Emerson Cod would discover
that Emily was Lila Robinson,</i>

261
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:29,685
<i>a grifter come to town
to steal Stingwell's dam ruby.</i>

262
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,960
<i>She did not love
the millionaire at all.</i>

263
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:36,945
<i>22 days later, the PI returned the money
Stingwell had paid him.</i>

264
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:40,635
<i>What he could not return
was his client's fiancée,</i>

265
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:43,975
<i>or the new life growing inside her.</i>

266
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,840
<i>Furious, Stingwell swore
if the grifter ever grifted again,</i>

267
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,560
<i>he'd made sure
she got put away for good.</i>

268
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,160
<i>Lila promised to keep
on the straight and narrow</i>

269
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,080
<i>while Stingwell went on to build</i>

270
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,760
Papen County Water and Power
<i>into a juggernaut.</i>

271
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:10,320
If we're gonna find Lila,
we need to retrace Stingwell's steps,

272
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:12,965
figure out how he ended up
half a mile away from here.

273
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:16,505
Welcome to the Papen County Dam, source
of Papen County's water and power.

274
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,000
My name is Taylor Philbean,

275
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,485
and should you choose to take a tour
of this landmark and working utility,

276
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:22,880
I'll be your dam guide.

277
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,560
When there's a bigger group, this is
where I wait for the laugh to die down.

278
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,275
Actually, we're invited guests
of the Stingwell family,

279
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:32,640
here on account of
Roland Stingwell's untimely death.

280
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,560
Damn sad is what it is.

281
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:38,880
If you wait here, I'll get you passes
and take you up to his private office.

282
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,935
You said Lila
chose to leave behind her life of crime.

283
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:43,040
What happened?

284
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:47,065
People's nature is like a river. You can
only keep it dammed up for so long.

285
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,506
One day, Lila packed up bags

286
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:51,120
and broke back into Stingwell's house
looking for the dam ruby.

287
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,500
When she couldn't find that,
she stole 50 grand in cash.

288
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:56,912
Knowing Stingwell'd track her down
to the ends of the earth,

289
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:59,281
she took Penny
and they just disappeared.

290
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,973
If you'll follow me.

291
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,325
But you knew who Lila was.
Did you really not see it coming?

292
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,295
I guess I was just blinded.

293
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,385
Say cheese!

294
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,558
Does this camera take pictures
of every visitor?

295
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,135
Yes, for security reasons.

296
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,940
Should you be planning to blow up
the dam and flood the valley,

297
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,223
one copy is kept on file
and another is available

298
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:23,600
for purchase as a keepsake
in our gift shop on the way out.

299
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,075
This way.

300
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,560
Have you seen this woman before?

301
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,347
Name's Lila Robinson. That picture was
taken as she was entering the building

302
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,175
the same day your boss was killed.

303
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,125
I remember the woman.

304
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:40,165
She did have a private meeting
with Mr Stingwell,

305
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,655
but I believe she said
her name was Mary Beth Acres.

306
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,755
The police have already been
here asking questions.

307
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:48,760
- They ask you about Mary Beth?
- No.

308
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:52,455
They were asking about
the multi-million dollar contracts

309
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,654
that Mr Stingwell was negotiating

310
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:58,080
to replace all the old pipes
that bring water into the city.

311
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,320
Yeah, I'd say the police
are on the wrong track.

312
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,523
I agree.

313
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:03,619
I tried to tell them my theory

314
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,520
but they weren't interested.

315
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
I'm interested.

316
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,575
I caught a local factory

317
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:13,955
dumping toxic chemicals
into the dam reservoir.

318
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:16,039
And you blew the whistle?
You go, girl.

319
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,840
It's my duty as a citizen
to watch the reservoir.

320
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:23,355
You know, one drop
of certain mind altering drugs

321
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:28,200
and we'll be zombies under the control
of those secret signals on FM radio.

322
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:29,525
Oh, brother.

323
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,360
It's a public health issue.

324
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,320
Yeah, yeah. What's this door?

325
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,440
Well, that's Mr Stingwell's
private exit.

326
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:39,200
It leads back through the inside
of the dam to a private stairwell.

327
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:44,080
Do you care that I have
important information?

328
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,760
Oh, we do. We wanna hear
all about your theory.

329
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:50,655
Come on, woman, give me something.

330
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,695
Who are you talking to, Cod?

331
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:54,055
Detective Puget.

332
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:55,685
Been a while.

333
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:58,695
Figured the Stingwells would hire
a private peep around this one.

334
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,565
They never did like a cop
they couldn't buy.

335
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:04,255
You know, being cocky in a cheap suit
is less effective than you think, Puget.

336
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:06,545
What about Papen County's finest?
They got any leads?

337
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:08,895
Who didn't wanna
knock off Stingwell?

338
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,160
He got valuable re-piping
contracts up for grabs,

339
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:14,429
he got 100 angry farmers
who had to cough up bill for water

340
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:15,920
because he dammed up their river.

341
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:17,679
Not to mention that ruby

342
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:20,440
that he flaunted like a trophy wife
at a high school reunion.

343
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:23,935
Well, maybe I got a lead for you.

344
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,715
Maybe the only lead
you need to follow.

345
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,995
Name's Lila Robinson.

346
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,560
Last known address was local
but she's been on the fly for a while.

347
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:36,065
Never known you to share, Cod.

348
00:16:36,385 --> 00:16:37,520
What's your angle?

349
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,779
Maybe I wouldn't mind help bringing down
the hammer of justice on who did this.

350
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:44,240
Doesn't matter to me if the hammer's
public or private. You catch my drift?

351
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:46,795
I do not.

352
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,400
Catch the bitch.

353
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,384
And use everything you got
and move quickly,

354
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:55,932
cause I guaran-damn-tee you,
she's moving fast

355
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,175
and the trail's getting cold.

356
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,920
- How did you get in?
- There's something I have to tell you.

357
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:10,345
There's something I gotta tell you too,
and I really hate to tell you now

358
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:12,975
because now it looks like
I'm just telling you cause I have to,

359
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:15,605
not cause I want to.
That book on my desk...

360
00:17:15,645 --> 00:17:17,279
Emerson, may I go first?

361
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:19,680
- Sure.
- I'm sorry.

362
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:21,615
What are you sorry about?

363
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,400
Long time, no see, honey.

364
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:27,585
Lila.

365
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,695
- Lila.
- Lila?

366
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:39,127
She told me her name
was Priscilla Saltpeter.

367
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,991
Said she'd shoot me
if I let on she was here.

368
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,605
She's told a lot of people
a lot of things.

369
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:45,360
You here to see a dead man
about a ruby?

370
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,125
I'm in town to see you.

371
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:51,000
You really should lock your office door.
No telling what riffraff will blow in.

372
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:53,400
Where's Penny?

373
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:57,040
Penny is somewhere you can't find her.
But I'll make you a deal.

374
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,720
I didn't kill Stingwell
or steal his dam ruby.

375
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,661
As soon as the cops find out
I was there when he was killed,

376
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,667
they'll be all over me
like weevils on rice.

377
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:05,920
Maybe they know already.

378
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:08,560
Then your job just got
significantly harder.

379
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,415
Find the real killer,

380
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,760
put me in the clear
and I'll let you see Penny.

381
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:17,495
Hang a red lantern in your office window
and I'll arrange for a reunion.

382
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:21,145
But the moment I get a whiff
that the cops are closing in on me,

383
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,440
you won't see me
or your Penny again.

384
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:24,915
Who's Penny?

385
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:27,840
Penny's the price I paid for thinking
with my heart and not my head.

386
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:29,965
Penny's my daughter.

387
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,805
That's what I was
just about to tell you.

388
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,360
Surprise.

389
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,720
- I'll give you 48 hours.
- She's lying.

390
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:38,125
It's in her eyes.

391
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:40,285
She's lied so damn much in her life,

392
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,295
eyes look like that permanently.

393
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:44,778
What's to stop me
from taking that toy gun of yours

394
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:47,000
and pushing your delicate frame
through my wall?

395
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:48,615
Xylazine.

396
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,075
Come again?

397
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:01,240
- Wait. It was what?
- It was horse tranquillizer.

398
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:04,175
When we woke up, Emerson made sure
I was okay and then left.

399
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:07,285
He was gonna start with all the farmers
and find out who the real killer was.

400
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:10,284
But we know who the killer is,
the dead man told us so.

401
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:12,947
In so far as a dead man
can tell anything

402
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:16,765
by way of some very strong leads
acquired in a straightforward way.

403
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:19,415
If Lila has Penny,
then she holds all the cards.

404
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:22,030
We don't even know for sure
if Lila has his daughter.

405
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,720
She could be lying about that, too.

406
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:25,120
She's playing him,

407
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:28,320
dominating his will until he's no longer
listening to his instincts.

408
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,755
You don't dominate Emerson.

409
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,495
You really think he's  interviewing
suspects he knows innocent,

410
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:34,280
following leads
he knows lead nowhere?

411
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,785
He wouldn't do that.

412
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:36,975
That's not who he is.

413
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:39,280
But what if who he is
isn't who he is right now?

414
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,875
Instead of analyzing him,
we should be there helping him.

415
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,458
Doesn't matter how crazy it seems.

416
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:46,480
Forgive me, but if helping Emerson
means we blind ourselves to truth,

417
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,081
then I won't be part of it.

418
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:51,160
When someone backs you into a corner,
you don't get obedient, you bite back.

419
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:53,606
Simone, wait.

420
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:57,429
All I ask from him is that we start out
with honesty and no surprises.

421
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:00,575
I would say this qualifies
as a surprise.

422
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:10,440
- Thank you for coming back, Randy.
- Sure.

423
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,389
First, I wanna say
I'm sorry if it feels like

424
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:14,920
I'm sending you mixed signals
by asking you to come back.

425
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,280
I guess I was a little surprised.

426
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:20,385
Well, signals are like nuts,
mixed is better.

427
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,585
No one's all the same kind, right?

428
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,840
And what's important is
that we have a fresh start.

429
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:27,115
Right...

430
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:28,825
Can I ask you a question?

431
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:32,440
You're not just planning on using me
to get over Ned, are you?

432
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:37,172
Sometimes things are so absurd
that I can't even hear them.

433
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:39,920
Like, you just blew a dog whistle
full of crazy and I'm not a dog.

434
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:41,505
Well, I get that.

435
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,145
If you're not ready, I get that.

436
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:45,954
But, you know,
I've been through this before...

437
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,480
And I don't wanna be
your rebound guy.

438
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:52,475
Wait, there it is again.

439
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:56,135
Nothing.

440
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:01,760
Is this a bad time to talk?

441
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,020
I just wanted to say
I think Randy's gonna do the trick.

442
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,071
You know, wiping
the emotional slate clean.

443
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,475
- He's picking me up tonight after work.
- That's great, Olive.

444
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:11,167
See, soon I'll be the one lost
in some distracted thought,

445
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:14,185
not caring while you prattle on
about your relationship problems.

446
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:16,725
I'm sorry, I do care
and I am distracty.

447
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:18,440
I have a question.

448
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:21,985
Can love make you do
something absolutely crazy?

449
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:24,495
I went...

450
00:21:25,215 --> 00:21:26,365
to a nunnery.

451
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:29,106
- Have a great time tonight.
- Yeah.

452
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,322
You're right. If Emerson's desperate
enough not to see the truth,

453
00:21:34,362 --> 00:21:36,645
- he's desperate enough to do anything.
- He needs us.

454
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:37,635
Let's go.

455
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:41,245
<i>It was the end of a long day,</i>

456
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,803
<i>and Emerson, Chuck and the Pie Maker</i>

457
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:46,575
<i>had interviewed
28 disgruntled farmers,</i>

458
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:50,615
<i>concluding that none were guilty
of the murder of Roland Stingwell.</i>

459
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,745
<i>But as Lila had told Emerson,</i>

460
00:21:52,785 --> 00:21:56,885
<i>if he proved her innocence,
he could see his daughter again.</i>

461
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,815
<i>They moved on to farmer number 29.</i>

462
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,839
Mr Brunch, you had about
200 acres of river front farmland

463
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,451
before they build the dam, right?

464
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,305
My farm used to be
the most prosperous in the county.

465
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:09,115
Now with what I pay
to truck in water,

466
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:12,040
I can barely pay the rent,
same as everybody else.

467
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,080
But what else would I do?

468
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,560
- Now, when is your birthday, precious?
- December.

469
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:19,105
Funny, I would have bet
on an autumn birthday.

470
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:20,958
The deep orange of orchid embers

471
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,555
and asiatic lilies
makes your skin tone glow.

472
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:27,055
Well, actually, I have two birthdays
and my second one's in the fall, so...

473
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,745
actually, you're right.

474
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:32,440
Your gibberish is sweet, honey.
Keep the flowers.

475
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,035
- Oh, no, I'm telling the truth.
- So am I.

476
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:38,085
If I killed Stingwell, I supposed
I would have done it years ago

477
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:41,535
when my anger was fresh cut,
but nothing's gonna change.

478
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:43,640
Whoever has the water has the power.

479
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:48,615
What about the contracts
to re-pipe the county water supply?

480
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:50,326
Might be some bad blood there.

481
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:52,212
Stingwell would have been
behind the plan

482
00:22:52,252 --> 00:22:55,035
but the mayor would have been
in charge of bidding out  construction.

483
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:56,825
There's no motive.
We got nothin'.

484
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:58,840
What about the big business
polluter angle?

485
00:22:59,135 --> 00:23:00,315
Don't humour me.

486
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:02,039
If you didn't think
we were out of leads

487
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,979
and I wasn't high
on Lila berry juice,

488
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:06,514
then what would you call
the big business polluter angle?

489
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:10,762
I may call it that crazy conspiracy
theory by Stingwell's crazy assistant.

490
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:13,080
Or the last ditch crackpot angle.
But it's something.

491
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,040
It's all we've got left.

492
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:17,880
And we're running out of time.

493
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:22,120
We appreciate you coming out
to talk to us on short notice.

494
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,578
We're investigating
the death of Roland Stingwell.

495
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,450
His assistant said there was a heated
legal dispute between Mr. Stingwell

496
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,242
and your clients,
the <i>Fits And Giggles Novelty</i> company.

497
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,690
And we know that Mr. Stingwell was about
to make public that

498
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,080
one of your clients' factories
was illegally disposing

499
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,840
dangerous chemicals
into the Papen County Dam reservoir.

500
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,317
These are baseless allegations.

501
00:23:39,357 --> 00:23:42,563
Our client did not, nor would ever,
dispose chemicals in a reservoir.

502
00:23:42,603 --> 00:23:44,481
This is a categorical denial.

503
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,057
- Maybe once.
- And one time only.

504
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,520
Once we may have
inadvertently allowed

505
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,839
a small amount

506
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:52,520
of chemicals into the reservoir,
but it was a long time ago.

507
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:54,590
- It was Tuesday.
- Very, very early Tuesday.

508
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,040
- Nearly Monday.
- What kind of lawyers are you?

509
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,280
We are Mennonites,

510
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,595
which would not normally be
a liability were it not for our

511
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,040
own commitment not to lie.

512
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,053
But to be clear,
in regards to the chemicals

513
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:05,712
- that were or weren't...
- Were.

514
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:07,640
Dumped  at an indeterminate time.

515
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,276
- Last Tuesday.
- 2:00 am-ish.

516
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,695
- 2:39 in the morning.
- There was a spill.

517
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:12,843
And that's the truth.

518
00:24:12,883 --> 00:24:14,874
Plastics division had an overflow

519
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:18,320
but it was only the chemicals we use
to make things glow in the dark,

520
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:20,467
which are near identical
to pure drinking water.

521
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,562
Pure drinking water
with chemicals in it.

522
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:26,960
We will pay the fine
to the appropriate authorities.

523
00:24:32,744 --> 00:24:34,561
They're polluters
but they're no killers.

524
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,613
- Every road's a dead end.
- Except one road

525
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:38,239
but we can't go down that road.

526
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,880
No, we can't.

527
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,159
The police are gonna
go down that road.

528
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,669
Let's say they find Lila.

529
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:47,640
What's to say they don't also find Penny
and put an end to this?

530
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,520
Yeah, and what if you're wrong?

531
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,080
Penny's the only leverage Lila has.

532
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:53,775
What if Lila has it already set up

533
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:56,419
that the minute she sees those flashing
red and blue lights on the wall.

534
00:24:56,459 --> 00:25:00,200
She's on the phone to some accomplice
who puts Penny on a bus to Mexico?

535
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:05,880
Yeah, maybe my love for my daughter
has made me stupid,

536
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,240
but Lila doesn't seem
to have that problem,

537
00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:11,023
so I'm gonna continue to jump
through any hoop I have to...

538
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:13,552
to get face to face
to my little girl!

539
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:16,284
What if Lila's lying to you?

540
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:18,711
What if she doesn't have Penny?

541
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,208
Well, then, I guess I'm a chump.

542
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:24,562
But at least I'm not a chump
just sitting here and doing nothing.

543
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,891
Poor Emerson. We can't just sit here.
We've got to do something.

544
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,640
Quick gawking at each other
and let's go.

545
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:40,145
<i>Across town, a signal was set.</i>

546
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:43,474
<i>As Olive came in from the cold...</i>

547
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:44,814
Are you in here?

548
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,276
I heard about what's happened.

549
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,720
Who are you? Did you hang
the lantern in the window?

550
00:25:56,397 --> 00:25:57,280
Who are you?

551
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,543
I hung the lantern, bitch.

552
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,720
We need to talk.

553
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:04,560
Sit tight, sister.
You're in the jam now.

554
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:07,295
I should have skedaddled
when I had the chance.

555
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,760
Emerson always was a sucker
for a tricky dame.

556
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,121
Your tricks work on Emerson

557
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,158
because he thinks
you have him by the collar.

558
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:24,501
I was ready to leave him
for not showing me all his cards.

559
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,750
Now I know the card he was stakeholding
was the Lying Queen Of Empty Hearts,

560
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:29,600
I'm back to deal again.

561
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,280
Then deal. You've got the gun.

562
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:32,914
Penny's a bluff.

563
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:35,895
A two bit grifter like you
wouldn't get saddled with a child.

564
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:38,665
My guess is you ditched her
a long time ago.

565
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:40,903
Then when you ran out of money,
you came back to try again

566
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:43,480
- for the ruby and rubbed Stingwell out.
- Witch!

567
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,722
I'm sorry. Am I playing, too?

568
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,560
No, I'm not. Continue.

569
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:51,392
I did come back to see Stingwell,

570
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:53,332
and he thought
I was there to kill him

571
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,897
but we talked it out
and I gave him back all his money,

572
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:58,480
every dime I stole when I ran away.

573
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:02,920
So we're to believe that somehow, along
the way, you suddenly grew a conscience?

574
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,673
I did grow a conscience,

575
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:07,920
and she's sitting in a hotel room
watching television...

576
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:10,906
and eating string cheese.

577
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:14,280
She has my eyes
and Emerson's big heart.

578
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,360
That's so sweet.

579
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:18,720
And evil, right?

580
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:22,297
The gun!
Watch it!

581
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:27,400
I got it!
I got the gun!

582
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:29,400
Aw, shoot!

583
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:32,080
Looking for this?

584
00:27:32,623 --> 00:27:34,102
I suppose you're right,

585
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:36,800
Emerson is still a sucker
for a tricky dame.

586
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,280
Get her!

587
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,487
Nice job, well played.

588
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:44,482
Thank you.

589
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:47,280
- Did you get her?
- She was in a big rush.

590
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:50,400
See if you can follow them in the van.
I need to find Emerson.

591
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:52,438
This is so much more fun
than dinner and a movie.

592
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:54,720
- It's so exciting!
- Yeah, I know.

593
00:27:55,739 --> 00:28:00,184
<i>Lila Robinson had often found herself
on the run from a tricky situation.</i>

594
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:02,734
<i>In her rush to disappear, however,</i>

595
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:04,406
<i>the player failed to realize</i>

596
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:07,617
<i>she herself was being played
by Chuck and the pie maker.</i>

597
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,622
<i>Across town,
the desperate investigator returned</i>

598
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:16,320
<i>one last time in search
of some dam evidence.</i>

599
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:19,560
Looking for more pictures
of your girlfriend, Cod?

600
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,040
I think I've found your angle.

601
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:25,882
Lila Robinson,

602
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,840
a.k.a. Emily von Alistair.

603
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:32,000
This wasn't the first time she'd tried
to steal the dam ruby from Stingwell.

604
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:34,240
She's been on the run
from him for years.

605
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:36,296
You got it all wrong, Puget.

606
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:37,830
What I got wrong was you.

607
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:40,115
Thought you were wild goosing me
with the bogus tip

608
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:43,000
- to throw us monkey suits off.
- Maybe that's exactly what I did.

609
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,334
Maybe I got you hook,
line and sinker

610
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:47,815
wasting time chasing Lila,
while I pop the real perp.

611
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,210
Come on, Puge.

612
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,857
All you've got is proof she entered
the building three hours before

613
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,193
Stingwell disappeared.

614
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:55,876
Here she is on her way out,

615
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:58,470
a half hour after Stingwell's assistant
saw our victim

616
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,904
for the last time.
That's motive and opportunity.

617
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:02,849
How she got the body
where she got it.

618
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:05,080
I'll just let
the jury use their imaginations.

619
00:29:05,441 --> 00:29:06,640
Thanks for the tip, Cod.

620
00:29:07,822 --> 00:29:08,849
And don't worry,

621
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,602
if she's still within 100 miles,

622
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:13,522
we'll have her in custody
by morning.

623
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:18,140
<i>At that moment, Emerson Cod
was overcome with 100% certainty</i>

624
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,440
<i>that he would never see
his daughter again.</i>

625
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:23,426
<i>And then he was un-overcome</i>

626
00:29:23,605 --> 00:29:27,892
<i>by an idea that had a 1% chance
of being correct.</i>

627
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:30,027
Wait a minute.

628
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:37,720
I knew you'd come back
to the scene of the crime.

629
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:41,307
I'm sorry I bolted on you.

630
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:43,614
That's OK, you're here now.

631
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:46,960
Come on.

632
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:51,679
<i>As the private eye set off
to test his new theory for leaks,</i>

633
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:54,937
<i>the tall drink of water driving
into the darkness</i>

634
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,959
<i>remained unaware
of her hidden cargo.</i>

635
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,339
If love does make you stupid,
then we must really love Emerson.

636
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:04,433
It'll all be worth
it if we find Penny.

637
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:06,478
- Ned?
- Yeah.

638
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:10,196
When I said
that our love was hearty...

639
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:13,440
it was just another way
of saying it's hard.

640
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,176
More than for other people?

641
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:19,838
OK, maybe more
than for other people.

642
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:23,883
If Emerson wasn't blinded by love,
there would never have been a Penny

643
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:27,240
and he wouldn't have had anything
to lose, which would be so much easier.

644
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:29,301
Do you want us to be easier?

645
00:30:30,813 --> 00:30:31,606
I dunno.

646
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:33,600
Maybe it's the exhaust fumes.

647
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,473
But why do we love something
if loving just makes us stupid and...

648
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:42,195
just have more to lose?

649
00:30:42,844 --> 00:30:43,961
Why love something?

650
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:47,030
Because we can.

651
00:30:57,765 --> 00:31:00,605
In my experience, when you're hiding
in the trunk of a car,

652
00:31:01,107 --> 00:31:02,240
it's best not to chat.

653
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:09,996
- How did you lose them?
- Well, they were 3 blocks away.

654
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,077
I wasn't comfortable
jumping the kerb.

655
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:13,667
They're OK, right? They have to be.

656
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,624
Yeah, after you disarmed
that crazy-ass she wolf.

657
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,112
Is it insensitive of me
to say this is fun?

658
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:22,417
Only if they're dead.
But they're not, right? They're fine.

659
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,543
Yeah, OK.

660
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:27,040
Can I be honest with you?

661
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:31,969
If you could read my mind
and I'm really glad you can't.

662
00:31:32,794 --> 00:31:35,153
But it doesn't matter cause
I'm gonna tell you anyway.

663
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,278
When?

664
00:31:36,318 --> 00:31:37,444
Now, now.

665
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:41,000
You were right.

666
00:31:41,787 --> 00:31:43,167
I did wanna use you

667
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:45,704
to squeeze the feelings
I had for Ned out of my head.

668
00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:48,233
But I don't think
that I can do that now.

669
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:51,869
Well, I like you, Olive.

670
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:55,000
- I like spending time with you.
- Oh, that's the problem.

671
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:59,320
I don't want this to make you muddle
headed so you make a bad decision.

672
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:02,024
I've been through a lot, Randy.

673
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:04,689
I'm gonna be difficult.

674
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:08,220
I know it's stupid for me to...

675
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:10,326
be the rebound guy.

676
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,786
But I also think, with time...

677
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:16,200
you might forget you ever bounced.

678
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:19,936
At least I'm willing
to take that chance.

679
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:24,480
Well, if we're careful and...

680
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:27,386
there might be a way to do it smart,
we could do it without...

681
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:34,600
How was that?

682
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,998
That was brilliant. Brilliant.

683
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:40,294
I... I...

684
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:42,848
For the first time in...

685
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:46,561
a very, very long time, the thoughts
I have for Ned just...

686
00:32:46,754 --> 00:32:48,852
went right out of my head...

687
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:51,244
and are standing right
outside the door.

688
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,852
- Clearing.
- Crossing.

689
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,846
What happened?

690
00:32:57,886 --> 00:33:00,506
Lila caught us, took our clothes
and she left us at the side of the road.

691
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,801
We must find Emerson.
Who knows what's she gonna do.

692
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:05,958
Can you bring your car round?
We'll get dressed and meet you out.

693
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,360
Let's go!

694
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:14,132
Why are these flowers
glowing in the dark.

695
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:23,520
Yeah, I knew it.

696
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,620
These flowers
are from Michael Brunt's farm.

697
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:30,529
Delivered the same day
that Stingwell was murdered.

698
00:33:32,152 --> 00:33:33,681
Are they meant to do that?

699
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,238
Where's Brunt's flower farm?

700
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,651
Here.

701
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:43,460
We know Stingwell was about to approve
a multi-million dollar renovation

702
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,025
for the water pipes
from the dam reservoir to the city.

703
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,712
Help me with this.

704
00:33:50,477 --> 00:33:52,432
Now, maybe I'm crazy...

705
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:56,320
- but if pipes need renovating...
- Probably means they're leaky.

706
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:59,080
- Leaky pipes means...
- Water.

707
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:01,629
Or in this case,
glow-in-the-dark water

708
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:03,920
on account of a toy company
dumping their chemicals.

709
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,997
Brunt's farm's right over the biggest,
leakiest water pipe in Papen County.

710
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:11,628
Now say Brunt gets wind
Stingwell's about to replace  the pipes

711
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:13,999
and he's gonna lose his free water
and everything else.

712
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,144
So he decides to deliver the flowers
himself as he wants to talk to the man.

713
00:34:17,184 --> 00:34:19,081
Lila said
she and Stingwell had it out.

714
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:21,320
She said he thought she came
to kill him for the ruby.

715
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:25,196
And now he overhears this
and he has the perfect plan to solve...

716
00:34:25,236 --> 00:34:27,960
all his problems
and steal the dam ruby for himself.

717
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,990
But if Brunt did it, what about
the pictures of Lila leaving the dam

718
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,698
just after Stingwell was murdered?

719
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:34,781
Follow me.

720
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,907
So, end of the day,
Stingwell takes the dam ruby,

721
00:34:40,947 --> 00:34:43,397
says goodbye to his assistant,
leaves out of the side door.

722
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,542
He's walking up the pipe
and he hears a noise...

723
00:34:47,282 --> 00:34:48,987
so he decides to investigate.

724
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,520
Be careful.

725
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:54,909
All right, now...

726
00:34:56,325 --> 00:34:59,306
Brunt had three whole hours
to get ready for this moment.

727
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:03,180
He would have been waiting...

728
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:07,010
in order to pull off
the perfect crime.

729
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,200
He would...

730
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,333
Yeah. No, this...

731
00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:13,709
this it nuts, I'm fooling myself.

732
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:15,822
It's Lila.

733
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,305
I know it is.

734
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:20,431
She did it, she killed Stingwell.
This is a crazy idea.

735
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:22,305
No, it's Lila.

736
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:26,236
No, it ain't.

737
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,639
Hey, I knew it was you.

738
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:35,000
Good guess.
Too bad no-one will ever know.

739
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,280
Why did you come back?

740
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,502
Stingwell hid the dam ruby
somewhere in here before I did him in.

741
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:43,760
One more visit as murderous fugitive,
Lila Robinson, should do the trick.

742
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:48,054
See you later, suckers!

743
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,560
Looks like he went the wrong way.

744
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:04,880
I disagree.

745
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,114
Oh God!

746
00:36:31,986 --> 00:36:36,472
I think I just figured out how Stingwell
ended up half a mile away from here.

747
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:40,219
He didn't have you!

748
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,840
<i>The facts were these.</i>

749
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:46,730
<i>Cornered by Brunt
but thinking it was Lila,</i>

750
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,400
<i>Roland Stingwell
decided his precious ruby should remain</i>

751
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,556
<i> at the Papen County dam
where he'd found it.</i>

752
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:53,599
<i>As he considered</i>

753
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:56,969
<i>the power of the hydro-electric plant
he had designed...</i>

754
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,206
<i>Stingwell was struck by the irony,
then by the water.</i>

755
00:37:08,978 --> 00:37:12,197
<i>After flushing Stingwell,
still disguised as Lila,</i>

756
00:37:12,237 --> 00:37:16,040
<i>Brunt would allow the photo booth
to document his exit and,</i>

757
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:19,700
<i>after attempting
to flush Emerson and Simone,</i>

758
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,840
<i>Brunt left the same way.</i>

759
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:26,549
<i>This time,
it was Brunt who was flushed out.</i>

760
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:29,280
<i>Murder solved and ruby recovered,</i>

761
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:33,000
<i>Amelia Stingwell informed the PI
that his previous sins</i>

762
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,002
<i>were now washed away.</i>

763
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,949
<i>Emerson Cod would profit
from the trickle down.</i>

764
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,700
<i>The terms of the meeting
in the woods were simple,</i>

765
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,401
<i>come alone,
no police and no surprises.</i>

766
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:49,897
<i>While Emerson and Lila had complied
easily with terms A and B,</i>

767
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:52,977
<i>there were still
two surprises yet to come.</i>

768
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,648
A deal is a deal, Emerson.

769
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:57,640
Penny's waiting in the car.

770
00:37:58,283 --> 00:37:59,880
I guess you two can catch up.

771
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,640
And thank you.

772
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:03,941
No-one else could have done
what you did.

773
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,456
No-one else would have been
stupid enough to even try.

774
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:08,985
You know, this is a crazy life
you got go on here, Lila.

775
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,680
The kid deserves some normalcy.

776
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:13,000
You'd be shocked
how normal her life is.

777
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,385
School, homework...

778
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,139
braces.

779
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:18,920
She has braces?

780
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:23,235
My life may not always be
on the straight and narrow,

781
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,680
but Penny's is.

782
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:28,878
<i>Emerson Cod looked into the eyes
that had lied</i>

783
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,960
<i>to him so many times before,</i>

784
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,614
<i>and decided they were lying
to him again.</i>

785
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:36,880
I don't just wanna see Penny
for ten minutes. I'm taking her.

786
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,760
My turn to be her parent now.

787
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,097
<i>Surprise.</i>

788
00:38:41,728 --> 00:38:43,834
You leave us be
and I'll do what I can to get the cops

789
00:38:43,874 --> 00:38:46,035
to drop the kidnapping charge.
Otherwise...

790
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:48,320
Shoot, ain't no otherwise.

791
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:52,280
I thought you may want
something like this.

792
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:55,400
Well, don't worry.
I'll take good care of her.

793
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:56,760
I know.

794
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:00,240
I just don't know how
I'm gonna take care of myself anymore.

795
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,760
I'm broke now,
car's on its last legs.

796
00:39:08,884 --> 00:39:10,360
Well, take mine.

797
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,758
- No.
- Go ahead, take it.

798
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,200
Take it. I'll find something else.

799
00:39:22,598 --> 00:39:25,029
I always could count
on your big heart.

800
00:39:27,213 --> 00:39:29,308
Maybe I was a fool to leave you.

801
00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:34,531
People do stupid things
when they're in love.

802
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:50,495
<i>Surprise.</i>

803
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,280
<i>His car disabled
and Lila getting away,</i>

804
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:57,484
<i>Emerson realized
he'd been tricked again.</i>

805
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,960
<i>But Penny was alive.</i>

806
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:06,134
<i>And perhaps, judging
from her wide smile, full of braces,</i>

807
00:40:06,315 --> 00:40:10,280
<i>she was with a mother who maybe
even loved her as much as he did.</i>

808
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:12,365
<i>One way or another,</i>

809
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:14,436
<i>he would find Penny.</i>

810
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:20,080
<i>Dear Mr Cod, congratulations.</i>

811
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:23,430
<i>And now, with the news
that his pop-up book,</i>

812
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,888
Lil'Gum Shoe,<i> had been accepted
by a publisher and was going to press,</i>

813
00:40:28,138 --> 00:40:30,614
<i>maybe it was only a matter of time</i>

814
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,331
