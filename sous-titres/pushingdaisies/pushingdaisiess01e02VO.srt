<i>Previously on Pushing Daisies.</i>

2
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:07,344
Who are you?

3
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:09,887
You were my first kiss.

4
00:00:09,972 --> 00:00:11,533
You were my first kiss, too.

5
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:14,095
You touch murder victims,
you ask who killed them.

6
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:16,135
<i>You touch them again,
they go back to being dead,</i>

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,832
- You collect the reward?
- That's it in a nutshell.

8
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:21,099
- Are you the business partner?
- Yes, ma'am.

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,010
Doesn't she look a lot
like that dead girl?

10
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:25,266
She looks exactly like that dead girl.

11
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:27,889
Do you... touch anything?

12
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:29,395
I t-touch lots of things.

13
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,234
Does he touch you?

14
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,419
I'd kiss you if it wouldn't kill me.

15
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:35,916
Are you in love with her?
'Cause it's that level of stupid.

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,997
I kind of killed her dad
when I was 10. She doesn't know.

17
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,500
I just thought, my world would be
a better place if you were in it.

18
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:44,470
Is there anything else I should know?

19
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:45,434
No.

22
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:57,627
<i>At this very moment
in the town of North Thrush,</i>

23
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,153
<i>young Ned was 9 years, 33 weeks,</i>

24
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:03,337
<i>6 days, 20 hours,
and 34 minutes old.</i>

25
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:08,091
<i>He stood on the exact spot where,
4 weeks and 2 days previously,</i>

26
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:12,139
<i>his father had deposited him,
at the Longburrow school for boys.</i>

27
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:19,355
<i>As young Ned's mother
had died recently,</i>

28
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:22,917
<i>there was reassuring
physical contact and parting words.</i>

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,246
I'll be back.

30
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:26,524
<i>He lied.</i>

31
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:30,496
<i>The sadness and dread which the boy felt</i>

32
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,201
<i>were not so much a product
of the Longburrow school.</i>

33
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:36,832
<i>Young Ned's acute discomfort
came from the knowledge,</i>

34
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:40,315
<i>that when he touched a dead thing,
it came back to life.</i>

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,762
<i>The other boys assumed
his introverted nature</i>

36
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,087
<i>was a product
of weakness and coddling.</i>

37
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:48,320
<i>Thinking of revenge
and also not thinking at all,</i>

38
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:52,054
<i>young Ned volunteered to assist
with that day's science project.</i>

39
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:58,937
<i>Young Ned's secret gift,
was governed by three simple rules.</i>

40
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,869
<i>Touch a dead thing once, alive.</i>

41
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,653
<i>Touch a dead thing again...</i>

42
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:26,894
<i>dead forever.</i>

43
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,814
<i>Keep a dead thing alive
for more than a minute...</i>

44
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:42,342
<i>and something else has to die.</i>

45
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:47,568
<i>His gift had, once again, brought him
great distress in place of great joy.</i>

46
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,636
<i>He vowed to keep the strange
details of his strange,</i>

47
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,061
<i>life secret from the world forever.</i>

48
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:55,072
Are you responsible for this?

49
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,286
<i>So, young Ned did what his father
had done to him only 31 days before.</i>

50
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:02,155
No.

51
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,579
<i>He lied.</i>

52
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:07,978
<i>For the next 19 years,
29 weeks, and 2 days,</i>

53
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:10,533
<i>keeping secrets worked beautifully.</i>

54
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:22,856
<i>The boy became the pie maker,
and the pie maker deceived with ease...</i>

55
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:24,580
<i>Until Chuck.</i>

56
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:25,824
This is strange.

57
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:30,832
<i>Charlotte Charles had been alive
for 28 years, 24 weeks,3 days,</i>

58
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:34,357
<i> 11 hours and 51 minutes,
before she was murdered.</i>

59
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,254
- Is this strange?
- This is not strange.

60
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:41,034
Unusual, maybe eccentric,
in a quaint way, like dessert spoons.

61
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:44,393
<i>Revived by the pie maker,
and given a second chance at life,</i>

62
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,770
<i>she had many questions.</i>

63
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:48,620
I have so many questions,
my mind wanders.

64
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,957
You need to feed it warm milk
and a turkey sandwich.

65
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:53,371
Let it curl up in a sunny
spot and take a nap.

66
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:54,959
I miss my aunts.

67
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,129
Of course.

68
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:58,756
Do you miss them a lot?

69
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:00,544
A little.

70
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:04,677
All the time?

71
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:07,481
Now and then.

72
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:11,478
<i>As Chuck spoke, she realized
her secrets were "really a lot,"</i>

73
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,367
<i>and "every minute,"</i>

74
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:14,569
<i>in that order.</i>

75
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:18,315
- How many people have you touched?
- People or animals?

76
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:20,146
- Crossing.
- Digby doesn't count.

77
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,449
Digby does count, no one's been
through as much with me as Digby.

78
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,473
How many people have
you brought back to life?

79
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:28,964
It's not like I walk around reviving
childhood sweethearts willy-nilly.

80
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:31,326
Well, what about Emerson?
Coming through!

81
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,918
- You touch lots of people with Emerson.
- For work.

82
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,375
Just because you kill them again
as soon as you get what you

83
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:38,580
- want doesn't make it any different.
- Yes, it does.

84
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:40,664
Coming through.

85
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:50,057
And can we not say "kill"? I touch them
again is all, and they snap right back

86
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:52,957
- to the way they're supposed to be.
- Am I the rubber band that broke?

87
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,187
You're the only human being
I've ever made alive again to stay.

88
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:58,894
<i>He lied.</i>

89
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:00,957
<i>In fact, the pie maker had kept</i>

90
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:03,836
<i>one other person alive
for longer than a minute.</i>

91
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:07,227
<i>Using the gift to temporarily
revive his own mother,</i>

92
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,758
<i>the unintended effect on Chuck's father
had been more permanent.</i>

93
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,089
<i>The pie maker often asked himself</i>

94
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:18,876
<i>if he would ever be able
to tell Chuck this secret.</i>

95
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,138
- Your eye's twitching.
- Is it?

96
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:27,425
This is such a small cheese box.

97
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,871
<i>The aunts who had raised Chuck,</i>

98
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:33,258
<i>had taught her to believe that the large
white appliance in the kitchen,</i>

99
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:35,322
<i>had a fairly narrow purpose.</i>

100
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,699
Aunt Lily, is it okay to freeze
the Camembert?

101
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:40,022
I'd rather not wedge it between
the Edam and the Paneer!

102
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,363
Or I could air out the Gouda!

103
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:44,438
<i>In fact, young Chuck
did not refer to a refrigerator</i>

104
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:48,031
<i>as anything but a cheese
box until she was 17.</i>

105
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:53,899
<i>As Chuck considered the life
she could never go back to,</i>

106
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,233
<i>Olive Snook considered
the changes in her own life.</i>

107
00:05:58,368 --> 00:05:59,370
<i>Foremost,</i>

108
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:03,644
<i>the mysterious brunette encroaching
on the man she herself loved.</i>

109
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,834
<i>From her perch,
the jealous yet agile neighbour</i>

110
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,196
<i>was able to confirm only one
pleasing detail.</i>

111
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,537
There's a surprising lack
of physical contact.

112
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:14,326
Oh, crap.

113
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:19,919
<i>One mile to the west,
Emerson Cod was also not thrilled.</i>

114
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,305
<i>During times of stress or anxiety,
he liked to knit.</i>

115
00:06:23,588 --> 00:06:26,221
<i>Since the arrival of the dead girl,
who was not dead.</i>

116
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:30,007
<i>He found the stockinette stitch
to be especially relaxing.</i>

117
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:31,365
Emerson Cod.

118
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:35,006
<i>But no stitch was a substitute
for a good murder case.</i>

119
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,186
Thanks. Got it.

120
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:44,319
Meet me at the morgue
in 15 minutes.

121
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,416
<i>As he finished purling the row,
he wished aloud...</i>

122
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:49,742
She'd better not come.

123
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:56,342
Hi, Emerson.

124
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,664
Isn't this exciting?

125
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:06,859
Hey!

126
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,762
What’s she doing here?

127
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:11,428
Said she didn't climb out of a
coffin for me to keep her in a box.

128
00:07:11,443 --> 00:07:13,249
- She the boss of you?
- I'm the boss of me.

129
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,599
- Dead girl's got to go.
- Dead girl's not going anywhere.

130
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:18,435
Don't know nothing about her except
she had soft lips when she was 10.

131
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,447
- That should be enough.
- Well, I don't like it.

132
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:29,631
Hey!

133
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,488
- What did you guys talk about?
- I'd like to get out of this car.

134
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:37,763
Is he upset you brought
me back to life?

135
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,494
He barely knows you're here.

136
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:45,197
<i>In fact, Emerson Cod had
finished knitting a sweater vest,</i>

137
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:48,672
<i>and two handgun cozies
in the week since Chuck's return.</i>

138
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:50,367
Sweet.

139
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,498
Do I really have to sit in back
from now on?

140
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:55,819
- It's for your own safety.
- You sound like my dad.

141
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:58,199
If my hand brushes yours, you'd be dead.

142
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:00,172
He didn't say that.

143
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:06,466
So probably better
if you stay in the car

144
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,669
for these morgue visits.
Someone might recognize you.

145
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,521
You really can't come in.

146
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,162
Did I say "can"? Because I swallow
my consonants sometimes.

147
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,816
"N't. N't."

148
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,361
Can't come in.

149
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,165
Got that hit-and-run?

150
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,515
We're from the government safety place?

151
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:22,716
Is that a question?

152
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:24,285
Government safety place.

153
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:29,085
<i>The facts were these.</i>

154
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:32,975
<i>One Bernard Slaybeck, an unmarried
automotive safety specialist.</i>

155
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:36,447
<i>35 years, 10 weeks, 7 hours,
and 3 minutes old.</i>

156
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:38,878
<i>Was found dead by the side of the road.</i>

157
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:47,345
<i>The apparent victim
of a hit-and-run driver.</i>

158
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:52,069
<i>As there were no witnesses,
the police are offering a reward,</i>

159
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:54,982
<i>for information leading
to the arrest of the killer.</i>

160
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,850
- I'm gonna wait back here.
- You don't like dead bodies, do you?

161
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:59,722
Not when they sit up and talk.

162
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:01,328
- Poor man.
- Just touch it.

163
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:02,757
I'm starting the watch.

164
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,623
- Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:08,286
Why is everything so blurry?

166
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:10,108
Probably because your eyeballs are flat.

167
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:12,042
- Ask the question.
- Mr. Slaybeck, do you...

168
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:14,668
Do you have any last requests,
unfinished business from this life

169
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,501
- we can help you with?
- Don't let her.

170
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:17,517
Is this heaven?

171
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,379
- Could be.
- No, it's not.

172
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:21,111
- Is that God?
- No, it's not.

173
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,197
- I'm confused, because I'm a Buddhist.
- Buddhism is fascinating, isn't it?

174
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,866
Did it help you
in your final moments?

175
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,176
She's wasting my minute.

176
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,656
What's with this minute?
And when did it become your minute?

177
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:30,736
Sure the hell ain't yours.

178
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,431
Hey, it's everyone's minute,
or... 22 seconds.

179
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:34,685
Can you get a message to earth?

180
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:37,118
Can you tell Jeannine
in promotions that I loved her?

181
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:38,022
Of course.

182
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,037
If you could remember anything about
whoever was driving the hit-and-run

183
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,247
vehicle that killed you,
we can get you some justice.

184
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,871
What hit-and-run?
I was killed by a crash-test dummy.

185
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:02,739
I'm not God, but if I was,
I’d be an angry God.

186
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,474
We gave it our best shot.

187
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,843
So, a crash-test dummy killed Bernard.

188
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:08,348
Bernard was delusional.

189
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,546
- It's still a clue.
- It's a dead end.

190
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:13,547
And not the kind of dead end you
can undead and then redead again,

191
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:15,896
- like you're supposed to.
- It's my fault?

192
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,992
When you get all
jabberwocky in my minute,

193
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:20,172
it's hard to follow up on
"the dummy did it."

194
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:21,580
Got to get some real leads now.

195
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:24,565
Isn't what a P.I.’s supposed to do?
Investigate? Isn't that the fun part?

196
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,087
The fun part's counting my money
in the bubble bath.

197
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:31,715
Nice image.

198
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,567
So.

199
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:39,299
What's the poop?

200
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:41,492
- "The poop"?
- The poop.

201
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,001
Scoop, skinny, the haps,
the dillyo, the 411. P.I. Lingo.

202
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:47,161
Rhubarb.

203
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,344
What's that mean?

204
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:51,316
P.I. secret code for "get me a damn
slice of rhubarb."

205
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:55,334
This isn't Pies 'R' us, pie city,
or thousands of pies in one place.

206
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:59,865
This is a bells-on-the-door,
pies-baking, mom-and-pop place.

207
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,321
We chitchat here.

208
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:05,264
Chit!

209
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:08,868
Chat.

210
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:10,602
You got it.

211
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,383
So, who's the funny girl stuck to Ned?

212
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:14,680
Childhood sweetheart.

213
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:17,683
Still sweet.
His heart?

214
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,878
You want the truth?

215
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,183
<i>Olive Snook did not want the truth,</i>

216
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:26,646
<i>but her heart was so full,
that it reached up and nodded her head.</i>

217
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:29,960
He digs her in a way
he definitely doesn't dig you.

218
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,053
I'll just go get your pie.

219
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:43,074
- Do they touch much?
- Wish they would.

220
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,840
- Emerson thinks I'm useless.
- You're not useless.

221
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:50,731
Here, let me. You sift.

222
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:53,346
Useless is an empty soap
dispenser in a restroom,

223
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:55,650
standing around reminding
people what you could be doing,

224
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,050
but doing nothing at all.

225
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:58,356
Uh, more flour.

226
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:01,346
I can't be alive again for no reason.
I suppose I could be, but...

227
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,469
- Where's the fun in that?
- We'll find the killer.

228
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,442
- Emerson's good at what he does.
- All Emerson cares about is the reward.

229
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:08,110
- Maybe that's enough.
- It's not enough.

230
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:09,154
Enough flour.

231
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:13,228
What about Jeannine? She needs
to know that Bernard loved her.

232
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:14,760
It was his dying wish.

233
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,752
- It's so sad.
- We'll cushion the blow.

234
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,722
- Not a big fan of the blow.
- We'll bring pie.

235
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:20,759
Someone dies, you bring food.
It's what you do.

236
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,229
<i>As the pie maker secretly
thought how much better</i>

237
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:27,873
<i>his life had become
since Chuck had returned...</i>

238
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:39,714
<i>Olive secretly felt the distance
between her and the pie maker,</i>

239
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:42,755
<i>grow more and more vast
until it seemed,</i>

240
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:46,072
<i>she might as well be
on the other side of the universe.</i>

241
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:52,001
<i>The earth is our only home.</i>

242
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,322
<i>If we don't take care of it, who will?</i>

243
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:58,493
<i>Imagine a vehicle so revolutionary,
it runs on an extraordinary new fuel</i>

244
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:00,785
<i>derived from a renewable plant
found everywhere.</i>

245
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:05,178
<i>The dandelion.
Introducing the Dandy Lion SX.</i>

246
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,021
<i>It'll blow you away.</i>

247
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:11,817
<i>While some came to dandy lion industries
to see the car of the future,</i>

248
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:15,560
<i>Chuck and the pie maker came
with a wish from the past.</i>

249
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,590
A car that runs on dandelions?
That's so neat!

250
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,965
- How are we gonna find Jeannine?
- This way, people.

251
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,049
Over here.

252
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:00,430
Jeannine from promotions?
It's a personal matter.

253
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,449
The flower on the turntable.

254
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,658
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

255
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:08,667
Please, don't touch!
No smudges!

256
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:14,889
Now, who wants to see all the colors
available for the dandy lion SX?

257
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:20,339
- You speak Japanese?
- Hai.

258
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:23,519
You take care of shut-ins your whole
life, you have plenty of time to read.

259
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:26,161
Don't you have
any hidden talents or hobbies?

260
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:29,195
I mean regular ones.

261
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:34,214
<i>Chuck's love of language had begun
upon the discovery of a portable</i>

262
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:38,183
<i>cassette-tape player and several
boxes of language courses.</i>

263
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:57,690
Hi!

264
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,412
Flex your flower power!

265
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,425
Would you like a factsheet on the dandy
lion SX, the "spores" car of tomorrow?

266
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:04,989
Get it? “Spores” car?

267
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,244
- Well, I think it's cute.
- Are you Jeannine?

268
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,409
Am in trouble for making up slogans?
Cause I'll say the blow you away thing,

269
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:13,334
but it seemed kind of redundant with
the commercial playing all the time.

270
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:16,412
We're here on a more tragic
matter about Bernard Slaybeck.

271
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,886
Maybe you got the wrong flower,
but I didn't know any Bernard.

272
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:20,896
<i>She lied.</i>

273
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:23,177
- Are you sure?
- I know what I know. Is that pie?

274
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,995
It was baked specifically for the
recipient of Bernard’s message.

275
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:28,722
Well, it's a shame to waste
a perfectly good pie.

276
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:31,110
Man, that smells good.

277
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,133
You're drooling.

278
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,692
- Bernard said...
- He's dead, right?

279
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,303
<i>The flower had a secret.</i>

280
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:40,442
Yeah, he's dead.
Enjoy your pie.

281
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,642
<i>But her training as a display model
allowed her to conceal any trace.</i>

282
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:48,724
Time to move on to the next stop,
people. The crash-test facility!

283
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,167
- "Crash-test facility"?
- Dummies.

284
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:54,970
Feel like taking a tour?

285
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,372
<i>Safely out of sight,
the flower began to weep.</i>

286
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:02,598
<i>Like the rich,
sugary dessert she binged on.</i>

287
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:06,604
<i>Her tears would remain with her
for only the next 10 to 15 minutes,</i>

288
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:08,814
<i>before they would be purged
from her body,</i>

289
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:10,841
<i>like they had never existed.</i>

290
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,751
Ladies and gentlemen,

291
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:17,387
welcome to the dandy lion
worldwide crash-test facility.

292
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,522
Science guys, I’d like you to meet
our newest dandy lion dealers

293
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:32,953
from a little territory
I like to call Asia.

294
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:35,810
Banzai!

295
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:38,675
Science guy,
tell them what happens in here.

296
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:43,734
This is where we use,
electronic anthropomorphic units...

297
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:45,005
Dummy des!

298
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:48,711
To test the dandy lion SX
for structural integrity,

299
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,856
as well as the viability
of all the restraint.

300
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,458
And impact-initiated
safety systems.

301
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:55,995
We crash things in here.

302
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:57,089
Boom des ka!

303
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:02,771
Now,
who wants to pull the lever?

304
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:27,972
<i>As the group thrilled
to the sight of twisted metal,</i>

305
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,393
<i>and simulated loss of life and limb.</i>

306
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:34,373
<i>Chuck came upon an
equally chilling sight of her own.</i>

307
00:17:48,754 --> 00:17:50,683
One of these dummies
is not like the others.

308
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,976
Where did his clothes go?

309
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:54,806
Where did his face go.

310
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,199
Maybe Bernard wasn’t crazy.

311
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:03,772
The dummy did it.

312
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:06,996
Or at least someone in dummy mask
and an orange jumpsuit.

313
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:08,917
- Chuck found the clue.
- I found the clue.

314
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,307
"Clue" is a board game.

315
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:13,636
The professor did it in the parlor
with a rubber mallet. That's a clue.

316
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:14,696
We find evidence.

317
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,361
You got to admit,
this means something.

318
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,365
It could be a lead.
Who would have access?

319
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,373
Loopy dandy lion models,
angry technicians could be anybody.

320
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:23,121
I did some checking
on that car company.

321
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,159
They got a lot riding
on this dandy lion.

322
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,595
Lot of angry competitors, too.

323
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:29,376
- We got to get back in there tonight.
- That's not how we do.

324
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,030
We got to get
back in there tonight.

325
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:33,730
See if whoever took
that dummy mask left any evidence.

326
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,312
Olive?

327
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:37,292
Hiya!

328
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,395
We're going out late tonight, a
privilege thing hardly worth explaining.

329
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:41,478
Can you close up?

330
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:43,214
I think I just did.

331
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,823
What?

332
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:46,479
See you in the morning.

333
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:49,586
- Bye, Olive.
- Bye, Digby.

334
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,847
<i>Olive often imagined
there was an orchestra in her heart,</i>

335
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:58,007
<i>music heard only by her,</i>

336
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:02,431
<i>except when her heart broke open
and it spilled out into the world.</i>

337
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:08,270
<i>Guess mine is not the first,</i>

338
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,689
<i>heart broken,</i>

339
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:14,487
<i>my eyes are not the first,</i>

340
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:17,429
<i>to cry.</i>

341
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,227
I'm not the first to love,

342
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:26,121
there's just no gettin' over you.

343
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,122
I'm hopelessly devoted...

344
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:33,731
Excuse me.

345
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,399
We're closed.

346
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:48,262
<i>You know I'm just
a fool who's willing...</i>

347
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:53,851
<i>... to sit around and wait for you.</i>

348
00:19:55,043 --> 00:20:02,978
<i>Baby, can't you see?
There's nothing there for me to do?</i>

349
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:08,745
<i>I'm hopelessly devoted...</i>

350
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,579
- Hi, Olive!
- Hi, Manuel.

351
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,952
- Can do the floors?
- Yeah, okay.

352
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:21,630
<i>But now, there's nowhere I hide</i>

353
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:24,885
<i>since you push my love aside.</i>

354
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:28,526
<i>And not in my hand...</i>

355
00:20:28,953 --> 00:20:32,404
<i>hopelessly devoted...</i>

356
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,763
<i>to you...</i>

357
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:38,985
<i>Hopelessly devoted...</i>

358
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:43,617
<i>to you...</i>

359
00:20:43,935 --> 00:20:45,910
- Did you say something?
- No.

360
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,316
<i>Hopelessly devoted...</i>

361
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,927
<i>to you...</i>

362
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,955
<i>While Olive considered
how much she loved Digby</i>

363
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:16,933
<i>for paying attention to her
when the pie maker would not,</i>

364
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:20,247
<i>and Digby considered
how much he liked salt...</i>

365
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:27,292
<i>The pie maker considered
what the sentence would be</i>

366
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:30,357
<i>for breaking and entering
with no prior convictions.</i>

367
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,163
Where'd you get that?

368
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,944
Contacted the company that makes
these doors under false pretenses.

369
00:21:49,993 --> 00:21:52,407
They gave me a sample I.D. Badge,
which I digitally altered

370
00:21:52,468 --> 00:21:55,363
using the magnetic code that matches
the serial number of this machine.

371
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,397
Is that cheating?

372
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:57,962
I don't know. Is this?

373
00:21:58,102 --> 00:21:59,766
I gave the security guard a hug goodbye.

374
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,218
My upper body distracted him

375
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:03,840
while these things I call hands
took this off his belt.

376
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:17,838
<i>At that moment, the pie maker felt
a mixture of happiness and trepidation.</i>

377
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,442
Why is it always a mixture?

378
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:27,005
What do you know about Emerson
besides he privately investigates?

379
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,261
What is so great about knowing?

380
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:30,357
When you lift up a rock,
do you find whipped cream?

381
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:31,680
No, you find worms.

382
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:33,314
I say no to knowing.

383
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:35,278
We haven't seen
each other in like 20 years.

384
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:38,115
Don't you want to know about me?
I want to know everything about you.

385
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:41,358
Look, we've all done things
we're not proud of. We all have secrets.

386
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:42,602
What secrets?

387
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:44,309
Skeletons in the closet.

388
00:22:44,382 --> 00:22:46,518
Exactly.
How long have you been listening?

389
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:50,567
There are skeletons in the closet.

390
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,650
Those aren't skeletons.

391
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,102
Those are dead bodies.

392
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:08,523
Hey! Rick!

393
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:09,843
- Rick Page.
- Hey, Rick.

394
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:11,464
Do you know what's happening right now?

395
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:14,254
Last thing I remember, I was reading
sales forecasts in the back.

396
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,654
Geez, those things are dull.

397
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:17,886
Have you ever heard of
the "Dandy Lion" car company?

398
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:18,716
Nope.

399
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,224
You want to open the kimono

400
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:22,748
on why I'm wearing a silver leotard
and hanging from a hook?

401
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:24,924
Do you have
any last requests or thoughts?

402
00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:28,695
If I wanted to mingle
with a bunch of geeks wearing leotards,

403
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,227
I'd have stayed in art school.

404
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:31,463
You went to art school?

405
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,239
Didn't know that, did you?

406
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,075
Stop it!

407
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:44,015
I was just riding
the ferris wheel at the state fair,

408
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,152
and the teenager running it
said I could ride an extra... turn.

409
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:49,798
Did you ever heard of
the "Dandy Lion" car company?

410
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,720
- Moving on.
- Wait a sec.

411
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:54,830
I did check a box that said I could be
used to test automobile safety.

412
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,328
Sounds scary,
but when you're dead, you're dead.

413
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:58,437
Am I dead?

414
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,974
There's nothing illegal
about any of that?

415
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:06,587
And why would "Dandy Lion" replace
all their crash-test dummies

416
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:07,602
with dead bodies?

417
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,470
And what happened
to all the real dummies?

418
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:12,124
<i>Before Emerson Cod could reply</i>

419
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,650
<i>with a clever
if slighy insulting remark...</i>

420
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:18,006
See that?

421
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:33,918
Jeannine?

422
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:40,399
What?

423
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,802
I couldn't tell you anything before
because they were watching me.

424
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:50,278
I hid at work to make sure
no one would follow me home.

425
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,064
The truth is Bernie
and I were so in love.

426
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:55,542
It all started when he came
to see this sales training thing

427
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:57,435
on his break,
and it was love at first sight.

428
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,061
I couldn't take my eyes off him.
He just like mesmerized me.

429
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:03,362
My heart leapt out of my chest,
and I just couldn't look away.

430
00:25:03,447 --> 00:25:06,262
I don't know what it was.
I got all misty-eyed, you know?

431
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:09,512
<i>And as Jeannine continued
to eat her triple-berry pie,</i>

432
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:13,063
<i>she told them the story of
her love affair with Bernard Slaybeck.</i>

433
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:17,525
Present, present, present,
present, present, present,

434
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,832
and giggle, giggle,
giggle, giggle, good girls.

435
00:25:21,134 --> 00:25:23,505
<i>They had met
when the scientist had come to watch</i>

436
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:25,514
<i>sales traing on a long lunch.</i>

437
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:27,931
<i>The attraction was instantaneous,</i>

438
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:31,550
<i>and they would both confess
to replaying this first encounter</i>

439
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:34,381
<i>as they fell asleep
in their beds that night.</i>

440
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,755
<i>He would rember her hair
as being slightly redder,</i>

441
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,657
<i>her sweater slightly tighter,</i>

442
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:44,816
<i>but the smile...
he would get just right.</i>

443
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,201
<i>She would remember
his look as shy but flirtatious.</i>

444
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:52,811
<i>His tie as red but very thin,</i>

445
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:56,086
<i>and that his sandwich was an angus
beef patty with butterhead lettuce,</i>

446
00:25:56,367 --> 00:26:00,789
<i>roma tomatoes, on a sesame-seed
whole-wheat bun, and a glass of 2% milk.</i>

447
00:26:03,536 --> 00:26:07,048
<i>As they talked, these were
the things she came to know first.</i>

448
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:08,841
<i>The scientist was kind.</i>

449
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:10,768
<i>The scientist was lonely.</i>

450
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:12,539
<i>The scientist came alive</i>

451
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,710
<i>when he told her
about his hobby of catching butterflies.</i>

452
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:19,112
<i>When he admitted
that he always set them free,</i>

453
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:22,241
<i>she felt dizzy
and giggled for no reason.</i>

454
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,199
<i>The waif and the scientist
fell deeply in love,</i>

455
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:39,455
<i>hiding their affair
from the world like a trade secret.</i>

456
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:52,681
<i>But Jeannine from promotions
felt a chasm growing between them.</i>

457
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:58,685
<i>As the launch
of the flower car grew closer,</i>

458
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:00,636
<i>Bernard's hours grew longer.</i>

459
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:10,848
<i>He became distant and hard to reach.</i>

460
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:18,189
<i>Suspecting her safety scientist
of stepping out on her,</i>

461
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:19,856
<i>she began to spy.</i>

462
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,421
<i>But there was no other flower,
only mysterious trips into the darkness.</i>

463
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:34,680
Where did she go?

464
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,241
Sorry. Restroom.

465
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:37,656
Mint, anyone?

466
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,829
No, thanks.

467
00:27:38,844 --> 00:27:40,732
Where was Slaybeck
going on these night drives?

468
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,750
I could never see.

469
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:44,360
And when I confronted him about it,
he wouldn't tell me anything.

470
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:47,225
I thought he was being paranoid
'till he turned up dead.

471
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:49,103
- You gonna finish that?
- Yes.

472
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:51,261
I wish we knew what he was doing.

473
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:52,944
I figured it out.

474
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:27,173
It's easier if I show you. Follow me.

475
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:28,490
- Shotgun!
- Chuck!

476
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,722
I hate the back.

477
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,636
Dead, again, forever.

478
00:28:32,864 --> 00:28:33,714
Fine.

479
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:36,486
Dead.

480
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:46,148
- She's not going very fast.
- That car can't have a very big engine.

481
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,672
Maybe she ate it.

482
00:28:48,087 --> 00:28:49,282
That's not funny.

483
00:28:49,368 --> 00:28:51,261
She obviously has
a very serious disorder.

484
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,073
- What do you mean?
- Seriously?

485
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:55,589
The girl's got
a whole secret life in the bathroom.

486
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:58,154
- And I know exactly how she feels.
- So do I.

487
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,088
I hate having secrets. Now I am one.

488
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:02,734
All these disguises,
hiding in your apartment all the time.

489
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:03,836
I hate secrets, too.

490
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,948
What? You love secrets.

491
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:06,021
You want to marry secrets

492
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,582
and have little half-secret,
half-human babies.

493
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,233
I have a secret, too.
I do miss my aunts.

494
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:13,759
If I can't have them back,
then all I have is you.

495
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,353
Which is great but...

496
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:17,808
I don't know anything
about you since you were 9.

497
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,747
It's pretty much
I bake pies and wake the dead.

498
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:20,934
I live a very sheltered life.

499
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,000
I already lived
a sheltered life once.

500
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:26,106
But it wasn't
as sheltered as you think.

501
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:27,992
Aunt Lily had
a very extensive collection

502
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:29,969
of historic erotica
hidden in the milk cellar.

503
00:29:30,093 --> 00:29:31,255
The milk cellar.

504
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:33,813
The cheese floor, the spooky place
under the house, whatever.

505
00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:36,613
I will pay both of you not to have
this conversation in front of me.

506
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:39,331
It's not in front of you.
It's to the side and behind you.

507
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,294
You can't ride in the front, Chuck.

508
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:44,793
<i>Tragically for Jeannine,
it didn't matter where she sat.</i>

509
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:06,171
There you go.
Good as new.

510
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:08,299
- Do I look okay?
- Runway ready.

511
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:09,233
Really?

512
00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:11,292
You don't think
these bandages make me look fat?

513
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:12,300
No, not at all.

514
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:13,945
That's so sweet.

515
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,918
 - Is he always this sweet?
- I wouldn't know.

516
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:19,475
Look, some crazy car bomber
just went through a lot of trouble

517
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,149
to keep you from showing us
whatever it is you wanted to show us.

518
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:23,934
- The bodies.
- What bodies?

519
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:26,154
The dead bodies?
We already found the dead bodies.

520
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,308
The ones in the big hole.

521
00:30:39,535 --> 00:30:40,682
How sad.

522
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:42,005
Why would somebody do this?

523
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:45,035
One way to find out.

524
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:50,864
What is all that?

525
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,612
Each one of these guys is fitted
with a computer hard drive

526
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,967
to record any of the crash-test data.

527
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,674
You bury the dummies,
you bury the data.

528
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:59,095
Couldn't they just erase it?

529
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:01,091
You never can completely erase anything.

530
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:04,319
Why are dead people on hooks
and plastic dummies in a grave?

531
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:06,216
The company
must have switched to cadavers

532
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:08,958
so that there'd be no permanent record
of the crash-test results,

533
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:10,628
'cause dead people don't talk...

534
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:11,561
Usually.

535
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:34,334
<i>As the pie-maker's brain crackled
with 10,000 volts of electricity</i>

536
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:38,102
<i>and then lost consciousness,
Olive would have no such luck.</i>

537
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:39,627
Digby, you awake?

538
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:43,606
I can't sleep, either.

539
00:31:43,681 --> 00:31:47,440
<i>Closing her eyes only made her visions
of the pie maker's late-night date</i>

540
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:51,335
<i>with the perky brunette
from nowhere more vivid and uncensored.</i>

541
00:31:59,555 --> 00:32:00,405
Yuck.

542
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:03,688
<i>Olive decided
she was done lying down about this.</i>

543
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,590
We are up.

544
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:08,228
We are walking.

545
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Look.

546
00:32:45,748 --> 00:32:48,358
Automobile manufacturing's
a dirty business.

547
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:51,016
<i>Murder was not new for Mark Chase.</i>

548
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:54,044
Luckily, body bags
keep things nice and neat.

549
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,482
<i>The facts were these.</i>

550
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,110
<i>Through a series
of crash-test experiments,</i>

551
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:03,782
<i>Bernard Slaybeck had learned
that the "Dandy Lion" was a deadly dud.</i>

552
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:17,862
<i>Bernard begged the president
to cancel the car's launch,</i>

553
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:20,362
<i>but Mark Chase had other plans.</i>

554
00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:26,989
<i>Like a smoking gun,</i>

555
00:33:27,013 --> 00:33:29,415
<i>the smoking dummies
would have to be buried.</i>

556
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:32,870
<i>The company had invested millions
in the "Dandy Lion",</i>

557
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,327
<i>and he knew
that keeping this terrible secret</i>

558
00:33:35,342 --> 00:33:38,360
<i>would still be cheaper
than halting production of the car.</i>

559
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:46,205
<i>A decision was made,
a cover-up undertaken.</i>

560
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:50,461
<i>If the dummies had to go,
so would any dummy who got in the way.</i>

561
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:12,934
<i>As he regained consciousness
and hurtled toward the crash-test wall,</i>

562
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,339
<i>Bernard's only thoughts were of Jeannine</i>

563
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:18,469
<i>and how he wished
he'd told her he loved her.</i>

564
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,010
<i>Mark Chase's attention
to detail and gift for planning</i>

565
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,126
<i>for planning
had served him well as a C.E.O.,</i>

566
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,325
<i>and now again as a murderer.</i>

567
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:35,812
<i>His cover-up complete,</i>

568
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:40,128
<i>his only thoughts were that
the "Dandy Lion" SX would bloom on time</i>

569
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,782
<i>and no one would stop him.</i>

570
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,254
The "Dandy Lion" car is
the culmination of my life's work.

571
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:52,158
It is a flower-powered phenomenon born
of a thousand sleepless nights,

572
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,370
intense ritalin abuse, and
a long-sublimated interest in botany.

573
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,383
So what if in the unlikely but...

574
00:34:57,676 --> 00:35:00,882
not impossible event that the car
gets up to a speed of 70 miles an hour,

575
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:02,946
with the headlights on
and the seat warmer on low,

576
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:05,761
a short-circuit in the radio causes
a cataclysmic chain reaction

577
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,909
that blows the car and his precious
human cargo to smithereens?!

578
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:11,513
<i>As Mark Chase continued his monologue,</i>

579
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,868
<i>unaware that it was completely inaudible</i>

580
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:16,911
<i>from within the sealed body bags
within the car,</i>

581
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:21,035
<i>Chuck pondered
why it was she always seemed to die</i>

582
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,665
<i>just as things were starting
to get good.</i>

583
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:26,421
Son of a bitch.

584
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:27,566
What?

585
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:29,020
<i>And though he couldn't hear her,</i>

586
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:31,825
<i>Ned suddenly wanted
to tell her everything.</i>

587
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:34,170
<i>Pet Peeves and favorite foods,</i>

588
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:36,146
<i>his fears, his dreams,</i>

589
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,446
<i>and all the pure joy
she had brought into his life.</i>

590
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:42,801
Sayonara.

591
00:35:43,545 --> 00:35:44,923
<i>This was the end.</i>

592
00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:46,813
<i>All over again.</i>

593
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:48,911
Goodbye.

594
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,401
<i>Emerson Cod
did not like to knit in public,</i>

595
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:19,216
<i>but he often left the house
with the needles in his pocket,</i>

596
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:22,907
<i>should the opportunity
to rib-stitch a skcap present itself.</i>

597
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:31,715
Drive!

598
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,406
<i>If only the pie-maker had heard</i>

599
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,699
<i>the killer exclaim
that the "Dandy Lion" SX</i>

600
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:01,794
<i>was much more
than an eco-friendly car of the future.</i>

601
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:04,880
<i>If only he'd heard
it was also a deathtrap,</i>

602
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,295
<i>a dandelion-fueled time bomb.</i>

603
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:15,695
Come on.
Just a little faster.

604
00:37:25,812 --> 00:37:28,628
- Can't this car go any faster?
- Some car of the future this is!

605
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:30,779
I thought the car of the future
was supposed to fly.

606
00:37:30,794 --> 00:37:32,507
What the hell happened to flying cars?

607
00:38:00,975 --> 00:38:03,151
<i>In the unlikely
but not impossible event</i>

608
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,602
<i>to reaching the speed
of 70 miles an hour</i>

609
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,531
<i>with the headlights on
and the seat warmer set to low,</i>

610
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:13,390
<i>A short-circuit in the radio would
set off a cataclysmic chain reaction</i>

611
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:17,821
<i>that would blow the car and its precious
human cargo to smithereens.</i>

612
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,467
<i>Jeannine had been
the first unfortunate victim, and now...</i>

613
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:22,603
Watch out!

614
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:37,780
<i>The pie maker
had never been so happy to see Olive.</i>

615
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:41,475
<i>Olive had never been
so happy to see the pie maker.</i>

616
00:38:41,765 --> 00:38:42,765
You okay?

617
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:44,637
I am now.

618
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:48,513
<i>Whatever the pie maker
had been doing that night</i>

619
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:50,897
<i>did not seem especially romantic.</i>

620
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,986
Can you help us get out
of these body bags?

621
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:54,994
Sure.

622
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:00,160
<i>Mark Chase's chase
had come to an end.</i>

623
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:02,803
<i>His plan foiled
and the police now closing in,</i>

624
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:07,022
<i>the car maker tried to flee,
only to discover he was out of gas.</i>

625
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:11,816
<i>Unlike the pie maker and his friends,
the "Dandy Lion" car company</i>

626
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:15,044
<i>did not survive
once its dark secrets were revealed.</i>

627
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:21,604
<i>Those responsible were punished
for their wicked ways.</i>

628
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:31,858
<i>Others, strengthened by the news that
their loved ones had not died in vain,</i>

629
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:34,874
<i>reached out for the help
and round-the-clock surveillance</i>

630
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,371
<i>by a nutrition professional
that they needed.</i>

631
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:47,909
<i>And Emerson Cod realized he would not
be not knitting anytime soon,</i>

632
00:39:47,924 --> 00:39:52,873
<i>as the dead girl, who was not dead,
appeared to be staying put...</i>

633
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:56,041
Sweet.

634
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,884
<i>A fact the pie maker celebrated.</i>

635
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,424
Not giving up, Digby.

636
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:06,623
Get in.

637
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,305
The front?

638
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:10,165
You did this?

639
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,141
You can drive now, too,
if you want...

640
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,077
But I kind of love driving.

641
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,662
Really?
I didn't know that about you.

642
00:40:18,112 --> 00:40:19,295
What is that?

643
00:40:19,734 --> 00:40:20,981
It's for...

644
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,710
Steering emergencies.

645
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:24,832
<i>He lied.</i>

646
00:40:25,942 --> 00:40:26,942
Perfect.

647
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,917
That's what I thought.

648
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:31,215
