2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,960
At this moment, young ned is 9 years,9
months,15 days, 10 hours,and 2 minutes old.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,470
Awakened by
loneliness-induced insomnia,

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,030
He found himself in
desperate need of comfort.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,550
And comfort for ned meant pie.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,060
The risks were great,

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,930
but young ned rationalized his rogue
impulse-baking as sheep-counting.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,650
What harm could come of a
single pie, in the dark of night,

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,400
with all the evidence ingested?

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,610
He was caught in flagrante
delicto by one eugene mulchandani,

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,450
Who immediately joined him in the act.

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,350
Ned and eugene were unprepared
for what happened next.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,850
The aroma of freshly baked pie
wafting through boarding-school halls

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,750
awakened an entire class Who
had but one thing in common --

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,340
They were all far from
home and need comfort.

16
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:10,000
The longing and homesickness which
filled the school like a plague

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,840
was magically lifted with every bite.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,540
And the party began.

19
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,880
Until the party stopped,

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,340
and young ned learned That even a
forkful of immediate gratification

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,760
can lead to a world of
grave consequences --

22
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:53,600
A lesson to be learned again years later at
the grave of currently dead father of chuck,

23
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,840
the woman he loved.

24
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,930
Ready?

25
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,230
I'm ready,i think.

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,090
- Wait.
- What?

27
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,010
If we both have half a
minute, then you go first.

28
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,730
No,no,you go first. If you spill over
the first 30 seconds,then no biggie.

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,460
As opposed to spilling over the
second 30 seconds, which is yes biggie.

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,540
I budgeted every second. I won't spill.

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,070
That's not enough seconds.
You should have all 60.

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,790
We don't need to fact-find about
dwight. I don't know what i was thinking.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,470
You were thinking that you were trying to protect
us from a mysterious, Potentially dangerous man.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,070
You go first.

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,160
No,you go. This is awkward.

36
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,800
- Go first,or i'm gonna hit you with the shovel.
- Okay.

37
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,150
Hello.

38
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,480
Hi,mr. Charles. Or should i call
you charles? It doesn't matter.

39
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,520
It's me -- ned. I lived across
the street when i was a little boy.

40
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,180
It's me -- charlotte. Um,you've
been dead for 20 years.

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,020
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,510
Can you put them on hold for
just a second and tell us --

43
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,140
- is dwight dixon a dangerous man?
- Oh,yeah.

44
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,520
Oh,no.He stole
chuck's --

45
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,870
- i still call your daughter "chuck" still, like when i was 9.
- 15

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,320
- No,i was 9.
- Seconds.

47
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,560
Uh,dwight stole your pocket watch and left a
veiled threat about exposing a very big secret

48
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,040
Which he knows that we
probably don't want exposed

49
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,570
Oh,if he's got the watch, you
got nothing to worry about.

50
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,700
The threat's his insurance policy.

51
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,140
Now,you don't say nothing,
he'll return the favor.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,130
Good to know. You're up.

53
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,730
The pie maker's gift of life
lasted for one precious minute only,

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,210
A minute he eagerly shared
with the chuck of his life,

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,170
To give her but half a minute to catch
up on a lifetime with a father long lost.

56
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,960
30 seconds were all he could
give, and not a second more.

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,610
Ned? Ned.

58
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,810
Are you awake?

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,880
As chuck soundlessly broke the
bonds of her plastic-wrap embrace

60
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,190
And snuck away to see to business
unattended, vian waited for dwight dixon,

61
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,430
Gentleman caller, unaware her sister lily
chased him off their front porch hours earlier.

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,410
At the come and sleep hotel, sister
lily would make certain dwight dixon,

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,770
Gentleman caller, wouldnevercall again.

64
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,600
Way i see this, we both
got something you want.

65
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,480
What would that be, my spicy cocktail?

66
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,170
I got my daughter's watch and you
got your insides where you want 'em.

67
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,660
You're gonna dig up charlotte's grave and you're
gonna put this watch back where you found it --

68
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,050
After you tell me your real story.

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,930
Well. It all began when i was conceived in
the sweat and sawdust of a traveling carnival.

70
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,820
My mother was an
acrobat named --

73
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,510
<i>I GOT......</i>

74
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,940
and chuck seemed to be waiting
for something else altogether.

75
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,270
I'm declaring it an emotional snow day.

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,910
But you love that cook-off. And you
and olive didn't get to go last year.

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,860
Ichosenot to go last year. I was busy.

78
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,310
Yeah,b-because ofme.

79
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,800
I love being busy because of you,
and i'm looking forward to being busy

80
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,430
Because of you for the rest of the day.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,140
You can't do what you did last night
and not be a little... Erwhelmed.

82
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,760
Well,believe me, i feel plenty
whelmed, but,um,not overly.

83
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,480
Overly is on its way, probably
looking in the window right now.

84
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,120
You had to say "hello,again" and
"goodbye,again" to your dad in 30 seconds.

85
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,080
I guess i just chose to look at it like it was
30 more seconds than i was supposed to have.

86
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,620
How did that go?

87
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,800
It was still hard, no matter
w much i budgeted my seconds.

88
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,570
The hello-againing
was wonderful, and...

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,290
The goodbye-aining wasn't.

90
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,780
Oh,ned,look... You shld
just go to the cook-off.

91
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,040
You're trying to get rid of me.

92
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,750
No,i'm not trying to
get rid of you. I just...

93
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,400
Maybeineed an emotional snow day,too.

94
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,970
You need an emotional snow day from me?

95
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,750
Is this weird now? Are we weird now
because i did "it" with your dad?

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,440
No,we're not weird. I've
never been so in love with you.

97
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,590
But i'm also feeling a
lot of other things --

98
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,850
So many things that i want to
tell you and i can't tell you

99
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,870
and i'm afraid to tell you And
i don't know how to tell you.

100
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,250
You don't have to tell me if
you don't want to. I mean...

101
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,800
- You do eventually.
- And i will tonight. I promise.

102
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,040
For the meantime, olive
is depending on you.

103
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,570
She said two years ago, she could
taste that first-prize blue ribbon,

104
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,460
And then that taste was replaced
with the bitter tang of defeat.

105
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,470
Bitter tang,bitter olive. It's a story.

106
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,310
And today it's gonna be a happy ending.

107
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,470
Come on. Go to the cook-off.

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,230
Olive will love you for it.

109
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,490
Isn't it good to be back again?

110
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,280
Just you and me,
shoulder-to-shoulder, eye-to-eye.

111
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,310
Decorative hats fixed
squarely on sweaty brows,

112
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,140
Bonding in the fiery kiln of
competion that forges men's souls.

113
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,210
We're baking pie,olive.

114
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,450
Not just pie --
damn great pie.

115
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,810
This is our year. We're in such a
better place than we were two years ago.

116
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,010
I,for one, am no longer encumbered of
the tension of a sexual nature toward you.

117
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,190
I'm focused. We should
have won last time.

118
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,400
Wouldhave won... Had we not
gotten screwed by... The buffalo.

119
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,190
Sweet lord in heaven,
how i hate the buffalo.

120
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,420
When you say "buffalo," do you mean the noble
breed of bison lost forever to settlers' greed

121
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,550
Or the upstate new york hamlet
still thirsting for super bowl glory?

122
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,460
I mean that big phony whipping
up those crap muffins over there.

123
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,000
Marianne marie beetle. They
call her the pastry slayer.

124
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,820
Leo burns,the new comfort food cook-off
coordinator, lover of all things foody.

125
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,110
Oh,and i just love that all foods are
welcome at this year's comfort food cook-off.

126
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,990
It's like best in show,
only "best in belly."

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,110
Which means buffalo muffin will be
locking those horns with colonel likkin.

128
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,100
He and the buffalo
are the teams to beat.

129
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,370
The colonel's been "best in belly"
blue-ribbon winner 15 years running.

130
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,350
But there's an empty winner's
plate waiting to be loaded.

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,000
With damn great pie.

132
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,290
Well, you're the pie holers!

133
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,100
- I'm a very,very, very big fan.
- Stop.

134
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,850
As event coordinator, i'm not allowed
to say this, but i'm rooting for you.

135
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,390
Oh,thank you.

136
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,730
Aw,he's a dreamboat.

137
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,280
Well,tugboat, but still.
Let's set up,partner.

138
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,480
Ted!

139
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,650
It's so nice to see that you came back
after taking a year off to lick your wounds

140
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,930
And hide in the dank shadows of
humiliating defeat. And you were so close.

141
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,640
Yeah,mysterious.

142
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,060
It's as if someone deliberately
sabotaged our oven, cheater mcgee.

143
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,460
It's a poor workman
who blames his tools.

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,420
Just keep your oven mitts to yourself.

145
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,150
I intend to,as i present more
award-winning muffins to the judges.

146
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,610
And you remember,now -- losing
doesn't make you a loser.

147
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,650
Oh,wait
-- it does.

148
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,850
Better get stuffing your pieholes.

149
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,970
But despite the freshly stoked
heat of the competition...

150
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,960
That buffalo is going down!

151
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,860
The pie maker's thoughts strayed away from
pastries to be made and toward chuck...

152
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,170
Wondering what she could
possibly be afraid to tell him.

153
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,390
Hi,dad.

154
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,660
The secret chuck was keeping from the
pie maker was born the night before.

155
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,510
Hello,again.

156
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,910
I know i don't look like the
charlotte that you remember,but --

157
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,760
Oh,u're the charlotte
i remember,all right.

158
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,200
Button-button. Cute as a button.

159
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,170
I miss you,daddy.

160
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,660
- Isn't this nice?
- Yes.

161
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,560
Son of a bitch. Now i'm eating
into my "i love you" time.

162
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,570
Um,look,i... I love you,and,um...

163
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,870
Happy birthday.

164
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,410
Oh,it's -- it's
my birthday?

165
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,630
- Not today, but it was gonna be.
- Then i died.

166
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,990
Yeah. I never got a chance to
give it to you, but now i can.

167
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,470
So i guess it kind ofisyour birthday.

168
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,010
At that very moment,a change
of plan occurred to her.

169
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,860
Torn between the pie maker she loved and
the father she lost, chuck acted on impulse.

170
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,270
You're gonna put on my glove.

171
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,940
When ned touches you, you play dead.

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,260
The pie maker gave every
second he could give...

173
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm gonna be back to
dig you up in an hour.

174
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,700
And not a second more.

175
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,230
You okay?

176
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,750
It didn't feel like 20 years.

177
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,280
Whatdidit feel like if it
didn't feel like 20 years?

178
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,820
Gliding.

179
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,430
Holding your breath and...

180
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,270
Being able to breathe and just...

181
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,980
Gliding.

182
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,040
I didn't glide.

183
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,840
What business would you have gliding?

184
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,330
I died.

185
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,220
And then ned... Ned touched me.

186
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,330
But there was no
gliding -- just ned.

187
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,320
He never touched you again?

188
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,600
- No,he can't -- not
without -- - good.

189
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,770
How is this even possible?

190
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,550
You,me,here again in the here-and-now
when we belong in the hereafter?

191
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,530
Since when did death get a loophole?

192
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,150
Since ned. Your dreams,
they're gonna be so vid now.

193
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,800
It's so neat.And
my bees --

194
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,880
- you have bees?
- Since you died.

195
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,960
And thentheydied, and
then... Ned touched them,too.

196
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,020
Oh,god, and their honey -- you have
never tasted honey like this before.

197
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,930
I hate to look in the gift horse's mouth, but
i'm not gonna start craving human flesh,am i?

198
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,750
No. Although everything
does taste better.

199
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,990
What's the catch, button?

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,920
Hiding me away like every stray t,dog,and
goose that met your acquaintance.

201
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,680
You don't want nedly-deadly to
know that my bucket's still kicking.

202
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,840
Why? Is there a catch?

203
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,380
- Not that you're aware of.
- What?

204
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,370
Not that i'm aware of. There's a catch.

205
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,810
And i'm gonna catch
it before i get caught.

206
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,150
You gonna tell me what
that catch is,button?

207
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,580
I will tonight. I promise.

208
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,350
As chuck's plan was percolating,

209
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,470
private investigator emerson cod
gently extracted the delicate flavors

210
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,850
of bolivia wara coffee grounds

211
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,910
for a smooth,clean coffee
experience on a morning

212
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,610
That would soon prove to be
anything but smooth or clean.

213
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,090
Emerson,i
--

214
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,420
i need your help.

215
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,780
Friend help or pay help?

216
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,980
See that? That's the kind of body
language you never hear with pay help.

217
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,080
Ned brought my dad back to
life, but only for a minute,

218
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,310
And when the minute was up,we
retouched him, as we always do.

219
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,110
No biggie,but yes biggie,
because in the heat of the moment,

220
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,350
My thinking wasn't so much
as "thinking" but "feeling."

221
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,460
And i tricked ned with my glove,
and now my dad's still alive,

222
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,930
And ned doesn't know, and...

223
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,210
Please help me.

224
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,690
What's the part about your gloves,again?

225
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,140
I've used ned.

226
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,210
Now my dad'slive because of my
impulse-control issues, and...

227
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,180
Now somebody else is dead.

228
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,300
First of all,blow.

229
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,360
Second... Just relax.

230
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,340
You're not mad at me?

231
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,460
Hell yeah,i'm mad! I'm
steamed,furious,red-hot!

232
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,800
And don't think i ain't
gonna yell at you later!

233
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,120
But for now,we should just put our heads
together and try to figure out what to do.

234
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,950
Oh,you're slowing the
roll,chief. I'm in the zone.

235
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,180
Working awful hard for
disappointment over there.

236
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,470
I'm going to win that blue ribbon, wrap it
around her neck, and strangle her with it.

237
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,570
Olive, you're baking with hate.

238
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,930
Rich,buttery,
high-in-carbohydrate hate.

239
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,170
You know what no one tells you
about cooking with the dark side?

240
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,750
The food is really good.

241
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,160
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

242
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,050
We're baking pie -- warm,
delicious,happy-making pie.

243
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,510
Okay,help cook or get out
of the kitchen,short-pants.

244
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,780
Fine.

245
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,170
Ah,the sweet smell of victory!

246
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,410
Not this year, turd-muffin.

247
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,810
I'll shut your piehole good.

248
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,390
Bring it,stale-cakes! We're gonna win!

249
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,810
Who's "we," sucka? I'mgonna win.

250
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,300
My husband, the
colonel -- He's dead!

251
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,110
He's not just dead.

252
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,850
He's extra-crispy.

253
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,240
<i>"BEST IN BELLY""COMFORT FOOD COOK-OFF"</i>

254
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,750
My husband,the colonel
-- gone forever.

255
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm afraid it looks like he collapsed
and fell into his own boiling oil.

256
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,360
I always knew one of his many
massive heart attacks would do him in.

257
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,720
At least the colonel
left this world fryin'.

258
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,700
Should be somecomfort.

259
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,890
There's no comfort in knowing that the
secret recipe will die along with him.

260
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,300
It was his greatest and only legacy.

261
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,630
Surely he wrote it down.

262
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,080
Surely he didn't.

263
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,110
My husband was a fat-frying savt.

264
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,380
He kept that recipe stored in his head.

265
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,750
If only i could have
him back for one minute

266
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,240
to preserve his lasting,loving memory.

267
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,180
Olive,uh...

268
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,120
I need your help. Help
me to,uh, help the widow.

269
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,090
How? Her husband's
dead.What are you gonna do --

270
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,950
haul him back to life and
say,"colonel, what's your recipe?"

271
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,260
Maybe he left something behind.

272
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,240
Distract the paramedics
long enough for me to,uh...

273
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,780
- Examine the workstation.
- Ned...

274
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,220
My eyes are -- they're
bleeding! Help! I can't see!

275
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,410
I finally know what my birds felt like.

276
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,080
Guess i'm dead,eh?

277
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,530
Heart attack. Not a lot of time.

278
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,900
And the widow likkin wants to
preserve your secret recipe.

279
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,820
Good woman,my bride. Let's do it.

280
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,730
I got all 500 herbs and
spices right up here.

281
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,810
Better pull up a chair
and grab yourself a pen.

282
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,380
That sounds like a long trip down
a lazy river we don't have time for.

283
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,300
Now, you can't rush goodness.

284
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,980
Did you say "heart attack"?

285
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,850
I did. Now,should we start
with the herbs or the spices?

286
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,980
Bushwah!

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,790
Some carpetbagging coward snuck up
behind, battered me in my own batter,

288
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,280
And shoved me into boiling oil.

289
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,090
That was murder,son.

290
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,000
Really? And you didn't see who did it?

291
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,740
Attacked from behind.

292
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,340
They were stealthy, like
a snake... Or a yankee.

293
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,620
Okay.Uh,let's hit the
headlines of the recipe,

294
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,490
and with the time left over,we
can circle back to the murder.

295
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,580
Oh,this is silly. Are you
sure you didn't write it down?

296
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,510
I got one handwritten copy.

297
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,200
I keep it right here in my
-- Here in my -- tarnation.

298
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,400
This fat-frying process seems
to have robbed me of mobility.

299
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,080
- There's nothing in there.
- Impossible.

300
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,470
I've kept my recipe right
there -- same spot for 30 years.

301
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,040
What scoundrel stole my secret recipe?

302
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,220
I'll find out,and i'll
find out who killed you,too.

303
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,790
But now i'm afraid time is up.

304
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,840
I hate to go,but at
least i'm going delicious.

305
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,550
And as the colonel
went back to being dead,

306
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,590
chuck faced the consequences
of her impulsive decision.

307
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,000
The "bring dad back"
part, i don't regret.

308
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,750
I mean, how can anyone regret
being reunited with someone

309
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,540
That they love and they
thought they'd never see again?

310
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,680
Point taken.

311
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,770
But the big problem -- maybe
thebiggestproblem, in an objective sense --

312
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,690
Is the dishonesty with ned.

313
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,190
That and the "making someone
else less alive" part.

314
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,300
"less alive."

315
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,190
Nice euphemism... Killer.

316
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,900
We were at the cemetery
in the dead of night.

317
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,420
Maybe there was no one else
there. Maybe no one else died.

318
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,560
You think this is a "sometimes" rule?

319
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,730
Ned lets somebody live longer than a minute
and somebody else has to die sometimes?

320
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,770
No! It's an "every time" rule!

321
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
There's some sucker out
there dead in the leaves.

322
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,910
Oh,my god.Then maybe some
sweet old lady with insomnia

323
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,020
who was bringing flowers
to her husband's grave...

324
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,500
I mean, it could have been anyone.I
could have just killed any innocent --

325
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,340
all right,either way,we got
another dead body to find --

326
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,760
A body that was deaded by ned, only he don't
know about it on account of you never told him,

327
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,270
Which is the wrong i'm correcting.

328
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,660
I know. I know what i did was wrong.

329
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,610
But i was spurred to action
in the spur of the moment,

330
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,260
Which leaves me living in the
deep,dark world of consequence.

331
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,400
But if you help me clean this up, then ned
won't have to live anywhere but the bright,

332
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,640
Happy world of pie, and all we'll
have to deal with is each other.

333
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,900
And your daddy. You
can't keep that from him.

334
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,560
Okay. We'll find the body first.

335
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,270
But i'm telling you, right after
that,you go straight to pie boy.

336
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,410
Don't be pecking me, woman!

337
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,900
That's the peck of cahoots,
which we are definitely not in.

338
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,450
Well, thank you anyway.

339
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,850
The cook-off will continue.

340
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,090
The colonel would have
wanted it that way.

341
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:10,680
His tragic heart attack must be honored by
us -- his sacred community of fellow chefs.

342
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,660
Who now all stand a much
better chance of winning.

343
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,900
Proceed.

344
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,460
I know it's a tragedy, obviously,
but you know what they say --

345
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,570
When god closes a
door, he opens an oven.

346
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,540
They don't say that, and if they do, they
don't have much compassion for a dead colonel.

347
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,420
Oh,i am not gonna let you bait
me to get all soft and compassiony

348
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,860
When we're this close to
nailing this competition.

349
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,000
What would you say if i told you
i think the colonel was murdered?

350
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,400
Boo-hoo. More room at the top.

351
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,940
Oh,my god, you're not kidding.

352
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,850
I think the colonel had a copy of his
secret recipe and someone killed him for it.

353
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,190
How could you possibly know that
by just looking at his dead body?

354
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,880
I -- i'm an
investigator.

355
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,230
Working with emerson cod
has taught me things --

356
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,030
Deductive and inductive
reasoning,evidence-gathering.

357
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:58,870
A dead body can say a lot...
To the... Trained professional.

358
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,840
Anyway, my educated hunch tells
me that there's a murder to solve.

359
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,270
You've never solved a
murder mystery alone before.

360
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,040
I'm not alone.

361
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,780
Me? Oh, i just got all tingly.

362
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,620
A
- and not just in the nether regions.

363
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,190
Okay,how do we go about
this -- this whole p.i.thing?

364
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,280
Do we just jam the gun in the
suspect's mouth and say "sing,canary,

365
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,280
Or i'm gonna decorate this
wallpaper with your guts"?

366
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,920
Neither.

367
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,290
Technically, i don't believe you can
blow someone's guts out their mouth.

368
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,330
Wuss. Holy smokes. Our oven's smoking.

369
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,730
Ned.

370
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,010
Sabotaged! I bet it was the beetle.

371
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,550
I bet it was the colonel's killer.

372
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,900
I know this doesn't take the sting out of
the responsibility, but i brought some cash.

373
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,370
I thought when we find the body, we'll
take it to the nearest funeral home,

374
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,940
With the cash and a note that says "every human
body deserves dignity. Please bury this one."

375
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,420
It'll be just like leaving
a baby on a doorstep, only...

376
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,480
The tail end of things.

377
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,560
- And the point of this would be,say,what?
- Closure.

378
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,070
Well,i got a feeling the body we find
is gonna give you anything but closure.

379
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,400
And where do you get that idea?

380
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,720
Oh,i didn't just get
it. It wasgivento me.

381
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,300
By dwight dixon.

382
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,900
What was dwight dixon doing here?

383
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Let me show you something.

384
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,300
- A rifle?
- Yep.

385
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,040
Looks like sweet old dwight
already had himself a shot lined up.

386
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,420
Your weighty conscience might nofeel
so weighty after you look through here.

387
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,060
Why would he have a gun?

388
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,210
That's my father's grave.
He was trying to kill us?

389
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,250
Not if you killed him first.

390
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,630
Why would he want us dead?

391
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,940
As is traditional,
the "why" in this case

392
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,330
was met with an equal
and opposite "because."

393
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,870
upon discovering that the pocket watch he
had stolen from chuck had been stolen back,

394
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,560
Dwight set out to reclaim the
mysterious timepiece one last time.

395
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,040
Following chuck to the graveyard,
dwight assumed her intent

396
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,370
Was to return the watch to the
grave from which it had been stolen.

397
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,540
Ready to pull the trigger and
reclaim his prize, dwight paused,

398
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,230
Unbelieving the
unbelievable sight he saw.

399
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,690
Dwight's mind reeled at
the sight of the pie maker

400
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,050
And chuck desecrating
charles charles' grave.

401
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:43,000
And,as is traditional, he decided to put
an end to the thing he did not understand.

402
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:49,260
But,as all his reeling and unbelieving
had taken exactly 61 seconds...

403
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,240
No shot was ever fired.

404
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,280
If i hadn't have kept my dad
alive, i'd have been murdered twice.

405
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,760
Yeah, once was enough.

406
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,520
And ned -- he
would be gone, too.

407
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,250
My accidentally killing dwight lights up three
points on our side of the cosmic scoreboard.

408
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,910
Plus, you save that bundle you would
have blown on burying mr. Boom-boom.

409
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,490
Better we bury him right here.

410
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,000
I got a couple shovels in the car.

411
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,940
We'll get him under the dirt before the
"pay your respects at lunch" crowd shows up.

412
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,360
By the time the grass
grows back over this plot,

413
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,640
It'll be like none
of this ever happened.

414
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,180
And i can't wait till it's
like none of this ever happened.

415
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,040
But it did happen.

416
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,430
Someone sabotaged our oven.
The flame won't shut off.

417
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,680
Let it burn -- maybe
it'll destroy this building

418
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,690
And all its memories of almost winning
with the cleansing power of flame.

419
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,420
Olive,we're staying in the contest.

420
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,050
We are?

421
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,950
We need to keep competing as cover so we
can investigate colonel likkin's murder.

422
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,030
Winning would make an excellent cover.

423
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,220
Whoever killed the colonel is a
risk-taker,desperate -- Same as our saboteur.

424
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,000
So find e saboteur, find the killer.

425
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,400
Maybe we find our ingredients. They
took everything we need to bake pies.

426
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,740
- I'm on it.
- Olive?

427
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,420
- Vian?
- Vian?

428
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,020
Vian, what are you doing here?
Oh,honey, have you been crying?

429
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,010
I stopped by the pie
hole, but it was closed.

430
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,560
And,yes, i was crying.

431
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,540
Why is the pie hole closed?

432
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,610
It's man trouble. I can tell.

433
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,020
I knew that dwight dixon was
heartbreak waiting to pop.

434
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,550
This is lily's fault.

435
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,630
She aimed a shotgun at his privates
and told him to stay away from us.

436
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,420
But half of us is me,
and i don't want him away.

437
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,740
I want him close.

438
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,050
- Give us a minute.
- Vian, it's,uh,good to see you.

439
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,340
Come on.

440
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:28,860
Forgive me. I
- i'm so wrapped up in my man, i'm thoughtlessly keeping you from yours.

441
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,440
Who? Ned? No.

442
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,990
No,we're partners in a contest -- unromantic
partners, like a brother and a sister,

443
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,200
Like an asexual,androgynous
brother and a sister.

444
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,070
Myman? No,that's a laugh.

445
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,940
When dwight didn't show up for
our date, i tried to laugh,too,

446
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,130
Tried to tell myself my
feelings for him were silly.

447
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,650
But lying to yourself
about love never works.

448
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,110
- Damn.
- I know.

449
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,050
But still,i keep lying
and looking all the same.

450
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,650
If you see dwight at the pie hole, will
you tell him about the "looking" part?

451
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,350
I'd like to see him.

452
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,990
I understand.

453
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,060
Boy,do i understand.

454
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,330
I found something.

455
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,130
The saboteur who sabotaged our
oven left behind one sticky mistake.

456
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,720
Ooh,what is it? Toxic
soot with a dash of dna?

457
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,910
It's,uh,sweet,woodsy, like a berkshire
forest on a crisp autumn morning.

458
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,730
- Caramelized sugar.
- Maple syrup.

459
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,330
Only one chef here
uses pure maple syrup.

460
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,910
- The waffle nazi.
- The waffle nazi.

461
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,180
Good,ja? Ja.

462
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,600
Chuck had seen dead bodies talk
before, but this was different.

463
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,850
This was just her guilty mind
giving rise to her guilty feelings.

464
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,230
You're just my guilty mind
giving rise to my guilty feelings.

465
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,140
Doesn't change the fact that
you have royally screwed up.

466
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,040
Fine. You talk,i'll shovel.

467
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,980
Was it worth it?
Sure,fine,i'm a bad man.

468
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,680
You saved three good
people by putting me down --

469
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,050
A three-for-one sale
on the grandest scale.

470
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,830
Anytime with those shovels!

471
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,600
What would you have done?

472
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,890
Same thing,probably.
I'd have killed you,too.

473
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,390
- But here's the difference.
- Emerson!

474
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,750
I would have told ned by now.

475
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,200
Shut up!

476
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,550
- Who you talking to?
- Shut up!

477
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,950
Nothing. No one.

478
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,350
I don't need to talk to anyone about
anything, 'cause my conscience is clear.

479
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,330
Good. Then grab a shovel.

480
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,020
Ned will never forgive you.

481
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,760
This is an incredible
violation of the p.c.f.c.o.rule

482
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,060
That says no chef is allowed
in another chef's kitchen.

483
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,560
It's immediate disqualification.

484
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,170
Concentrate on the killer.

485
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,290
That waffle nazi is likely our saboteur.

486
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,150
Find the saboteur, find the killer.

487
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,050
Go,go,go,go.

488
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,010
- Me?
- Go.

489
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,810
attention,contestants.

490
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,710
This is your 20-minute warning.

491
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,550
Any evidence linking waffle nazi to colonel
likkin would wrap this case up in brown paper

492
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,220
And tie it up with a
strong,sturdy twine.

493
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,100
Yeah. Oh,yeah.

494
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,350
Hey,you know what i love about vivian?

495
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,130
Her imagination. She thought
you and i were a couple now.

496
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,880
It's crazy. It's like
imaging us as hobbits...

497
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,280
Or on jet packs...

498
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,210
Or hobbits onjet packs.

499
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,780
Isn't the idea of us romantically
entwined a panic,a scream,

500
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,250
A four-hour heart attack
of complete impossibility?

501
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,830
It all makes sense.

502
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,140
It does?

503
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,580
This batter's better than batter.

504
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,070
- It's the evidence we need to wrap up this case.
- Hurray.

505
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,120
What is it?

506
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,680
Mm delicious!

507
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,260
Savory,not sweet.

508
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,660
Bursting with what's got to be like...

509
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,260
500 herbs and spices.

510
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,970
It's the colonel's secret recipe.

511
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,720
And the killer on a plate.

512
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,860
- Sir, i accuse you
of -- - sabotage!

513
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,240
You have sabotaged mein irons!

514
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,090
W
- we didn't do that.

515
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,630
Don't cry, mein herr.

516
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,180
Look -- it's justice
o'clock. I'm telling.

517
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,940
well,pie holers,

518
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,110
It looks as if you are soon to
be eliminated from ze competition.

519
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:30,110
We're kicking you t before
you baked yourself out.

520
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,250
When leo burns tootles up on his scooter
and sees how many rules you have broken,

521
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,020
Your dreams of comfort-food
glory are kaput.

522
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,670
You saw our oven. We were sabotaged,too.

523
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,110
Liars roast in hell.

524
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,040
Just sayin'.

525
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,990
We're not the saboteurs.

526
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,870
Mein waffle cord leaped into your arms like a
puppy wanting love and then cut itself in two.

527
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,380
When we present the evidence we got, you
can kiss the cook-off auf wiedersehen.

528
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,420
It's "goodbye" in german.

529
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,410
I do not speak a word of german.

530
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,970
I speak english mit a german accent.

531
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,140
Pageantry.

532
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,130
We found this batch of the colonel's
secret recipe in your kitchen.

533
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,990
That's a big bowl of motive,fritz.

534
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,970
Are you suggesting murder?

535
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,190
Ridiculous.

536
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,090
Herr likkin and i were soon
to become business partners.

537
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,300
Chicken and waffles?

538
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,940
Would have caught popeyes
with their pants down.

539
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,420
What in the name of julia
child are you people doing?

540
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,400
I can't count the number of rules
violations going on. I'm so disappointed.

541
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,750
There may be the appearance of rules
being bent or broken completely,

542
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,110
But there's a bigger
picture you need to see.

543
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,970
I just haven't finished painting it yet.

544
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,470
Yeah, we're not the saboteurs.

545
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,330
Poppycock. The pie hole is disqualified.

546
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,410
All right, that ought to do
it. Let's get out of here.

547
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,450
No,wait. We need a priest or a
rabbi or somebody to say something.

548
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,190
What?

549
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,110
Dwight might not have been the nicest man,
but everybody deserves a burial with dignity.

550
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,450
Fine. I got buttloads of dignity
to sprinkle on the ground.

551
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,080
- Come on. Get holy.
- Thank you.

552
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:11,440
Here lies dwight. Here lies his gun.
He was bad. Now he's done. Let's go.

553
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,500
All this and i still have
to deal with my mother?

554
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,230
Don't you mean "father"?

555
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,340
Lily.

556
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,250
Delighted.

557
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,190
Can the crap and sell
it to the tourists.

558
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,440
What areyoudoing here, cod?

559
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,870
What in the hell areyoudoing here?

560
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,030
Waiting for dwight dixon.

561
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,840
Well,uh, he may,uh,disappoint.

562
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,530
Men do that.

563
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,480
What's with the shotgun?

564
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,560
- Military salute.
- For dwight dixon?

565
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,010
For charles.

566
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:47,580
But if i happen to miss and blow
dwight's head off, purely by accident,

567
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,210
Well,that's something my lawyers
can pretty much sort out later.

568
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,520
Well,uh, so lovely catching up.

569
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,760
Well, that's everything.

570
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,170
But there's no trunk big enough to carry
home my busted dreams of blue-ribbon victory.

571
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,860
Back to the pie hole.

572
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,670
Which is empty, which is strange,
because chuck should be there.

573
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,110
The colonel's chicken booth.

574
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,990
An empty nest chock-full of clues.

575
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,200
A really bold detective team would
sneak over for one last bit of recon

576
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,470
before packing up their
pots and pans for good.

577
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,730
remember, bakers' hats and
hairnets must be worn at all times.

578
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,750
Memorize the scene
-- every detail --

579
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,470
The prints in the batter, the
footprints, the gurney tracks.

580
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,890
What's that?

581
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,940
Oh,sprinkles. I love sprinkles.

582
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,280
You love clues.

583
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,950
Two great tastes that
taste great together.

584
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,060
Painted plastic
-- cheap jewelry.

585
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,030
Left here before the colonel was killed.

586
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,060
Which means they belong to the killer.

587
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,820
Attention,contestants, this
is your 10-minute warning.

588
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,190
The most important thing is to keep
our wits about us and our nerves steady.

589
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,820
There's no good in freaking out, so don't
go crazy and start -- i don't know --

590
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,850
Kissing me or something
ridiculous like that.

591
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,470
Just because we're locked in a
trunk, we could die at any minute...

592
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,870
What are
you --

593
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,570
clean thoughts,chum.

594
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,590
Don't make me whip up
another batch of beat-down.

595
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,320
Look -- cheap
plastic earrings.

596
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,480
You're the killer!

597
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,540
You'rethe killer.

598
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,230
You deep-fat-fried
the colonel.

599
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,320
Suppose you were gonna
bake me in my own oven.

600
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,920
Nobody's baking anybody.

601
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,070
If you weren't here to kill the colonel, wh
were you doing here right before he got killed?

602
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,470
I thought the colonel
died of a heart attack.

603
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,680
I only snuck in here to try to...

604
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,690
- You're the saboteur.
- But not the killer.

605
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,640
Sabotage is a disqualifying offense.

606
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,750
In the good lord's
good name, have mercy.

607
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,380
I need that blue-ribbon prize if
muffin buffalo is to roam again.

608
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:17,070
You see before you a
desperate woman, not a killer.

609
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,250
Marianne marie btle!

610
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,230
You can't be in here. Disqualified.

611
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,380
Pie holers,you can't be in
here at all -- banned for life.

612
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,710
Which reminds me -- i forgot to report
your disqualification to the judges,

613
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,330
- Which i'm going to do right now.
- You're the killer.

614
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,060
Me? Look at me?

615
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,690
I ride a scooter. What kind
of killer could i possibly be?

616
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,450
The kind that leaves tracks.

617
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,550
Those are gurney tracks from where the
paramedics wheeled away colonel likkin.

618
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,350
Those flattened treads that go from the batter
back to the deep fryer are killer tracks --

619
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,720
Yours.

620
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,000
Those are hot-oil burns on your hands.

621
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,800
Did the colonel spatter when you
deep-fat-fried him, you sick son of a bitch?

622
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,560
Pixie dust and lemonade!

623
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,190
You have no proof.

624
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,210
That story will never hold up in court.

625
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,520
Thiswill.

626
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,270
Oh,the colonel's secret recipe.

627
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,260
You're busted, tubby.

628
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,880
The facts
were these --

629
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:23,400
one year ago,leo burns was a slender
and happy but slightly lonely man.

630
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:29,700
One day,he chose to drown his sorrows in a bucket
of colonel likkin's southern-fried chicken...

631
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,130
Which led to another... And another.

632
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,810
And soon, the colonel's
unique blend of 500 herbs

633
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,340
and spices were all leo could eat.

634
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,280
Diabetes,obesity, and night blindness were all
quick to follow the coated volumes of wings,

635
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,410
Breasts,and thighs leo ate.

636
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,850
Having lost himself to likkin,

637
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,190
leo vowed to destroy the
colonel andhis precious recipe.

638
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,910
Leo volunteered as this year's
comfort-food coordinator,

639
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,740
Waiting for the colonel to
make his annual appearance,

640
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,480
which would become hisfinalappearance.

641
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:12,360
But leo could not bring himself to destroy
the secret recipe that robbed him of his life.

642
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,570
And that was his undoing.

643
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,190
attention, cook-off contestants.

644
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,470
All entries must be on the
judges' table in 30 seconds --

645
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,000
30 seconds.

646
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,050
Leo never reported our disqualification.

647
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,780
What can we do in 30 seconds? We
have nothing, and our oven is broken.

648
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,010
Revengeisa dish best served cold.

649
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,680
Which is why i brought one of
your killer icebox lemon pies,

650
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,230
Stored it in our fridge,
and called it "plan 'b.'"

651
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,520
Don't mean squat if it isn't
on the judges' table in...

652
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,740
20 seconds
-- 20 seconds.

653
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,990
The colonel would be so proud.

654
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,540
Now that i have the recipe, that nice doughnut
man and i are gonna go into business together.

655
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,640
"finger likkin doughnut holes."

656
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,480
Sounds delicious... And filthy.

657
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,190
America's favorite --
You'll make a fortune.

658
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:59,700
The blue-ribbon first prize in this

659
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,750
goes to...

660
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,700
The pie hole!

661
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:39,980
* Close your eyes give
me your hand,darling *

662
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,640
* do you feel my heart beating?*

663
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,220
* Do you understand?*

664
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,670
* Do you feel the same?*

665
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,080
* Or am i only dreaming?*

666
00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:00,940
* Or is this burning an eternal flame?*

667
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,430
* Say my name...*

668
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,460
- it's chuck.
- It's... Olive.

669
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,030
No,it's chuck. I don't
know where she is.

670
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,800
She said she'd be at
the pie hole all day,

671
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,350
and if she was there all day,She
would have answered her phone.

672
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,130
Maybe she's stepping
out -- steppedout.

673
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,020
I don't know where she is. Vian
doesn't know where dwight is.

674
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:20,180
What if dwight leaving chuck's obituary
was more than an insurance policy?

675
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,670
Do you mind if i go look for her?

676
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,760
No,i don't mind.

677
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,960
Sorry to leave you with the mess.

678
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,570
I'm used to the mess.

679
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,790
* Sun shines through
the rain a whole life *

680
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,020
* so lonely and then you
come And ease the pain *

681
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:48,500
* i don't want to lose this feeling *

682
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,570

683
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,450

687
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,430
* Do you understand?*

688
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,790
* Do you feel the same?*

689
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:15,240
* Or am i only dreaming?*

690
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:21,390
* Or is this burning an eternal...*

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,710
*
Fla-a-me?*

692
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,040
Ned.

693
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,500
Hello,vivian. Lily.

694
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,510
I was in the
neighborhood --

695
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,020
Passing by,really, when i wondered
if you might like some pie...

696
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,240
Which i forgot to bring.

697
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,060
But while i'm here, i was also wondering
if you knew where i might find dwight dixon.

698
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,470
Ninth circle of hell,
if there's any justice.

699
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,490
Lily,stop.

700
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,250
We don't know where dwight is.

701
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,850
And how could you forget a thing
like pie? I find that curious.

702
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,560
It comes in a box,you know.

703
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,430
Say,you got a squatter in
your old digs over there?

704
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,330
I'll find out.

705
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:18,010
The pie maker braced himself to find chuck held
hostage by the deadly,desperate dwight dixon.

706
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,000
Chuck?

707
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,410
- I was worried.I
thought -- - charlotte.

708
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,550
It's okay,dad.

709
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,860
"dad"?

710
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,300
I was gonna tell you.
