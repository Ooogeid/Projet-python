--> 00:39:26,071
Thanks.

814
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:30,000
<i>Though some were more
unique than others.</i>

815
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,162
You're the only one for me.

816
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:37,731
I know you feel
that now, but...

817
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:40,983
There are things you want.

818
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:45,191
There are things we both want.

819
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:46,813
So? Everyone wants stuff.

820
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,481
We wake up every day
with a list of wishes

821
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:50,202
a mile long,
and maybe we spend our lives

822
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:52,452
trying to make those
wishes come true.

823
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:54,803
But... just because
we want them

824
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:56,951
doesn't mean we need
them to be happy.

825
00:39:58,035 --> 00:39:59,482
What do you need to be happy?

826
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:07,710
You.

827
00:40:08,015 --> 00:40:12,333
