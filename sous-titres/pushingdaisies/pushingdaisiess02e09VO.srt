3
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:10,352
<i>At this moment, a father and daughter
were on a camel trip</i>

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:12,023
<i>across the</i> Rub' al Khali,

5
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:14,957
<i>the 600-mile-long body of sand</i>

6
00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:18,764
<i>in the vast, harsh wilderness
known as the Arabian desert.</i>

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,291
<i>In truth, young Chuck should have been
floating on a sea of dreams,</i>

8
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:27,155
<i>but at 8 years,
8 months, 21 days old,</i>

9
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:30,520
<i>she was kept awake
by the varicella-zoster virus,</i>

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,798
<i>also known as chickenpox.</i>

11
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:35,964
<i>Her father, Charles Charles, hoped</i>

12
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:39,676
<i>this magical journey was the antidote
to his daughter's discomfort.</i>

13
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,467
<i>Indeed, it eased the girl's itch</i>

14
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:45,473
<i>and replaced it
with a burning desire for adventure.</i>

15
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:49,602
<i>Adventures her father promised
to take her on someday.</i>

16
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:53,532
<i>Sadly, someday's adventures
would never come,</i>

17
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:57,182
<i>for, in a month,
Charles Charles would die,</i>

18
00:00:57,212 --> 00:01:01,532
<i>and young Chuck would learn
the sad lesson that, try as one might,</i>

19
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:04,477
<i>one can never recapture
what once was.</i>

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,747
<i>Until Charlotte Charles
would again have her father.</i>

21
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:09,664
Hello.

22
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:13,416
<i>Only having him back
meant lying to the pie maker she loved.</i>

23
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:15,581
When Ned touches you, you play dead.

24
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:19,257
Say, you got a squatter
in your old digs over there?

25
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,681
- I was worried. I thought...
- Charlotte.

26
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,850
It's okay, dad.

27
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:30,663
"Dad"?

28
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:37,192
You kept your father alive.

29
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:38,652
This looks bad.

30
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,572
- It is bad. It's horribly bad.
- It can't be that bad.

31
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:45,301
Not like I'm the first ghost
he's ever seen.

32
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,881
Please say something.

33
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,116
He's up here.

34
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:49,396
Lily?

35
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:52,040
- Quick!
- No! Get out!

36
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:54,459
Lily, Vivian, is that you?!

37
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,643
You know good and well who we are!

38
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:57,523
Damn it!

39
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:02,275
And we are spittin' pissed at being
served up a steaming plate of door!

40
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:03,639
I don't get pissed.

41
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:05,637
A gypsy once told me
it brings on hemorrhoids.

42
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:08,202
- Why can't I go out and talk to her?
- No!

43
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:12,335
After you were gone, Lily and Vivian
moved into our house to look after me.

44
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,480
- They can't know that we're alive...
- But they're your aunts, Button-Button.

45
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:18,197
Except for the one that's my mother.

46
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:22,603
So you know.

47
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,042
And you're okay?

48
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:32,539
Can we get back
to your rude reception?

49
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,542
- I thought you were home invaders.
- Then why did you say my name?

50
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:36,793
- I didn't.
- I heard.

51
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:39,478
- It must have been your eye... ears.
- When you came over here

52
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:41,727
to check for squatters and
didn't immediately resurface,

53
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:44,300
- Lily assumed the worst.
- And brought two barrels of backup.

54
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:47,150
Hey, no squatters. No anyone.
Let's all go home.

55
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,097
- What was that?
- That was me.

56
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,105
Get it away!

57
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:06,239
It's all right.

58
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:08,428
Lily's been petrified of clowns

59
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,536
ever since our grand-papa chased her
around the house with one of those.

60
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:15,707
<i>It was Charlotte Charles
whose strategic placement of the toy</i>

61
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,834
<i>prevented her strong-willed mother</i>

62
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:20,795
<i>from strong-arming her way
further into the closet.</i>

63
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,725
We need to talk.

64
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:34,601
You don't want to hear
what I have to say.

65
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:39,714
<i>A low-pressure system
moving in from the coast</i>

66
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,693
<i>threatened Papen County
with its first winter storm.</i>

67
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,884
<i>But for the pie maker and Chuck,</i>

68
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:47,608
<i>it was as if the tempest
had already hit.</i>

69
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,184
If I were thinking clearer, I'd...

70
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:52,717
give you space
to process everything,

71
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:55,175
but I haven't slept
since all this happened.

72
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,055
Since...

73
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:57,952
I made it happen.

74
00:03:57,982 --> 00:04:00,732
If your dad's alive,
someone else had to die.

75
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,820
- Who was it?
- Dwight Dixon.

76
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:06,049
We found him with a sniper rifle
in the cemetery.

77
00:04:06,398 --> 00:04:07,198
What?

78
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:10,761
Emerson thinks that he was planning
on killing both you and me

79
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:13,681
- the night we re-alived my dad.
- Emerson knows?

80
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:19,321
He helped me bury Dwight
in my dad's empty grave.

81
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:22,230
He wanted me
to tell you right away, but I...

82
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,410
I begged him: "please, just wait until
I know what to say". And then...

83
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:27,293
You...

84
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:29,405
You found me first.

85
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:31,649
What would have happened
if I didn't?

86
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:35,161
I'd have brought you here and told you
that I was reckless and selfish.

87
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,329
Yes, you were.

88
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,620
And I can say
that I'm sorry for deceiving you,

89
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,887
and I will say that forever,
but I can't say

90
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,691
that I'm sorry my dad's alive,
because I'm not.

91
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:49,133
It's so overwhelming, I'm so grateful,
I don't know how to explain it.

92
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:53,658
You acted on an impulse
so poignant and deep.

93
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:56,538
I know what it feels like.
I felt it with you.

94
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,103
And I'll never be sorry
I did it either.

95
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,532
I'll let you breathe in a minute.
I promise.

96
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,512
I'm good.

97
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,369
So, what's next?

98
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,202
The reality is, your dad's back...

99
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,582
in swaddling bandages,
but he's back.

100
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:26,309
And if we're gonna be one big,
happy, albeit unconventional...

101
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,289
family...

102
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:31,158
- There are things we need to discuss.
- I've already covered a lot of ground.

103
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:33,562
First touch, life, second touch, death,
and that Digby and I are

104
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:36,347
the only other alive-agains
to be alive longer than a minute.

105
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,208
Then that leaves figuring out
what to do with your dad.

106
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:42,979
The only way
we can do that is together.

107
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,883
Are we together?

108
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:50,372
We're so "gethered",
electrons couldn't get between us.

109
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:51,946
You're beaming.

110
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:57,946
I'm not the only one.

111
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:00,121
What is that?

112
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:04,968
<i>The body of Nora McQuoddy
was what that was.</i>

113
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:10,933
<i>Mere moments earlier, the meticulous
Papen Harbor lighthouse keeper,</i>

114
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:15,451
<i>obsessing over a stubborn smudge,
would make a fatal mistake,</i>

115
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:18,620
<i>because what Nora didn't notice
was her killer...</i>

116
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,186
<i>who wanted everyone to notice her.</i>

117
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:33,617
<i>... County coroner's office.
At this time, the prime suspect,</i>

118
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:36,663
<i>seen fleeing from the scene
in a yellow fisherman's jacket,</i>

119
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:40,578
<i>has been identified as the lighthouse
keeper's husband, Merle McQuoddy.</i>

120
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:43,039
That's some shady shadow puppet.

121
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,017
Merle McQuoddy!

122
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,523
Out of all the enigmatic, esoteric local
ghost stories, this is my absolute fave.

123
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:54,209
Merle McQuoddy was a salty sailor

124
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:58,161
who left his lighthouse-keeper wife
and young child on a fishing voyage

125
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,889
10 years ago, only to vanish...

126
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:02,268
... without a trace.

127
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:08,564
Mariners swear his ghost haunts
the sea caves by the harbor.

128
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:10,953
And when the lighthouse shines,

129
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:13,569
you can hear his ghoulish moans

130
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,340
as he cries out for someone...
anyone...

131
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:18,324
to guide him home and...

132
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:22,595
Booed ya!

133
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:25,591
<i>In actual fact,
the facts were these.</i>

134
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:30,160
<i>Merle McQuoddy did, indeed,
leave his wife and child</i>

135
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,120
<i>on a voyage 10 years ago.</i>

136
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:38,084
<i>His boat, the</i> Knockout Nora<i>,
was loaded down with dungeness,</i>

137
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:42,473
<i>when it was knocked out
by the category 5 typhoon</i> Tyrone.

138
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:47,161
<i>For 9 years, 11 months, and 5 days,</i>

139
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:49,510
<i>the presumed ghost, Merle McQuoddy,</i>

140
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,716
<i>was very much alive
and alone on a deserted island.</i>

141
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:56,398
<i>All the while, Nora kept watch,</i>

142
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:59,521
<i>praying that one day
her husband would come home</i>

143
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:02,555
<i>and life would return
to the way it once was.</i>

144
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:06,822
<i>After a near decade of waiting,
her prayers were answered</i>

145
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:10,960
<i>when Merle was rescued by
a gay family cruise ship.</i>

146
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,760
But Merle McQuoddy
was not the man he used to be.

147
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,258
He'd roam the beaches at midnight,

148
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,978
flew into rages,
shunned indoor plumbing!

149
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,347
And now
he's a murderer at large, and...

150
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:33,567
Mr. Cod?

151
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,527
I was told I could find you here.
My name is Elliot McQuoddy.

152
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,211
Elliot McQuoddy?

153
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,781
Son of urban legend Merle McQuoddy.

154
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,910
Please, you have to clear
my father of my mother's murder.

155
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,030
My entire life savings...

156
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:54,128
everything I ever found combing
the shore with my metal detector.

157
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:58,605
By all means, bring me up
to tempo on what happened tonight.

158
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:02,845
Mom dropped me off at the movies
with a batch of homemade peanut brittle.

159
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,973
Afterwards, when I didn't see
the minivan, I walked home.

160
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,059
Cops were everywhere.

161
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,054
They told me she was dead.

162
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,188
And dad was nowhere to be found.

163
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,312
You want it <i>a la mode</i>?

164
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:17,276
The power's out and the ice cream
won't be so much ice as cream soon.

165
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,123
Lots and lots, please.

166
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,073
Who knows when I'll get another meal,
without mom to make it?

167
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,699
You poor boy.

168
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:26,744
There, there.

169
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:29,450
Not here, here.

170
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:31,336
Sorry, kid.

171
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:34,335
Eyewitnesses say they saw Merle
McQuoddy running away from the scene.

172
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:38,643
All they saw was a yellow raincoat.
There's no way he'd hurt my mother.

173
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:42,468
After 10 years of waiting,
our family was finally reunited.

174
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:46,077
I don't know where my dad is
and even if I find him...

175
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,255
they'll take him away.

176
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,023
Excuse me.

177
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:55,731
Hate to be a bitch, but ain't no way
in the world I'm taking this case.

178
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:57,775
You think Merle McQuoddy
murdered Nora.

179
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,675
Merle McQuoddy's ship
returned minus a few oars,

180
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:03,196
making it a very easy leap
from captain to killer.

181
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,643
Nothing this kid had to say
makes me think otherwise.

182
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:07,693
Plus, I don't work in the rain.

183
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:09,452
You don't hate being a bitch
that much.

184
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:11,408
I'll kick you back
my third of the cut.

185
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:13,928
And if you're doing
my third of the work, then...

186
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,128
I'm gonna take a personal day
to deal with personal...

187
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:19,671
persons.

188
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,522
Well...

189
00:10:24,913 --> 00:10:27,430
Look like papa's gonna
need a new raincoat.

190
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,340
And leather conditioner.

191
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:34,395
You see this water damage?
These wing tips were custom-cobbled.

192
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,395
Can we hurry?
I'm supposed to see Chuck's father.

193
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:38,566
I want to get him
a "welcome back to life" gift.

194
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,717
Oh, I get the perfect gift...

195
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:42,550
tap dad back to the grave.

196
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,137
- Why would you say that?
- Because you are in over your head.

197
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,575
You can put a leash on a dog.
You know why? 'Cause it's a dog.

198
00:10:47,786 --> 00:10:51,427
But you can't put one on a war veteran
that was cut down in his prime.

199
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:53,274
Before long, he's gonna break free.

200
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:57,078
Then he'll just be running the streets,
telling the world what you can do.

201
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:58,058
Tap that.

202
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:02,786
This is Chuck's chance at having
a family again. I can't...

203
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,258
tap that.

204
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,592
So make it look like an accident.

205
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,721
Trip over an ottoman
and Dick Van Dyke that ass.

206
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,308
Fine. I said my piece.

207
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,727
Let's get face-to-face
with lighthouse lady.

208
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:18,814
- What happened to her face?
- She's been effaced!

209
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,016
Mrs. McQuoddy?

210
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:26,781
Present conditions are cold, rainy,
with a 100% chance of "you're dead".

211
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,067
We're hoping that
you can tell us who killed you.

212
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:32,870
Oh, hell.
We got a melty mouth.

213
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:36,374
- "Yes" or "no" questions.
- She can't nod. How can she nod?

214
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:38,739
What is that tapping?

215
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:42,838
I don't think she's tapping.
I think she's talking in morse code.

216
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:46,850
- How do you know morse code?
- Charles Charles taught it to us

217
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,637
when we were kids so we communicated
from our windows with flashlights.

218
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,140
Mrs. McQuoddy?
Who committed your murder?

219
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,890
P... C... H... S.

220
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:00,677
Is that all?

221
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:02,739
Time's up.

222
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,861
P-C-H-S.

223
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:07,745
"Pic-hiss."

224
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,226
Pic-hiss!

225
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,680
Peaches!

226
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,038
It's an acronym, fool.

227
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:18,591
"Papen County Historical Society."

228
00:12:19,247 --> 00:12:21,585
An old lighthouse like Nora's
is bound to have interest.

229
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,280
"Peaches."

230
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:29,332
- What are you doing?
- Looking and finding you,

231
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:32,722
which is a cinch, natch, 'cause
I'm such an ace junior PI in training.

232
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:36,475
Look what mama got papa.

233
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:39,512
I bought one for you, too, Ned.

234
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:42,371
And one for me, too, of course.

235
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,151
'cause together,
we're a crime-fighting team.

236
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:46,977
What do you say, papa?

237
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:50,740
I think you and papa are gonna have
a grand old time while I...

238
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:53,419
take care of a... thing.

239
00:12:57,304 --> 00:13:00,511
- But...
- Hey, mood-swing Sally, anchors aweigh!

240
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:08,131
- You sure you don't want some pie?
- Thanks, Button, but I'll have cake.

241
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:10,926
Since when do you eat pie?
You hate pie.

242
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:14,570
Well, this is the one
that won me over.

243
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,016
So, no cake? At all?

244
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:18,478
Oh, well.

245
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,788
Well, let's not worry about pie.

246
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,946
This family has bigger things
to discuss.

247
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,318
To that end...

248
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:32,678
"Move Mr. Charles from Ned's childhood
home to Ned's apartment."

249
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,558
You killed a tree for this?

250
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,380
I'm happy as a clam right here.

251
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,420
The problem is,
Lily and Vivian are right here too,

252
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,625
and for a couple of agoraphobes,
they get around.

253
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,940
We can't risk them coming back
and discovering you,

254
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,148
thereby discovering the truth
about all of us.

255
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:47,600
From there, it's a hop,
skip and a jump

256
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,334
to angry mobs
with pitchforks and torches.

257
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,594
If I bunk with you, you'd kill me again
just by passing the pepper.

258
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,188
There are many safeguards
already in place.

259
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,026
Truth be told, you touching me dead
doesn't scare me nearly as much

260
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:01,406
as the thought of you
doing that to my daughter.

261
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,540
- Sir, I could never hurt Chuck.
- Oh, sure you could, deadly Nedly.

262
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,212
You could forget she's behind you

263
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:09,794
and stop to tie your shoe
or trip over a forgotten newspaper.

264
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:11,802
No number of redundant precautions

265
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:14,713
can assure that you won't inadvertently
kill her for good and forever,

266
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:17,535
unless you're not in the same vicinity,
which is why we're gonna make a deal.

267
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:20,621
I go quietly
and play by your rules...

268
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,313
and you never see Charlotte again.

269
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:31,215
The first family of Papen County.

270
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:34,112
Bunch of blond-over-blue children
of the corn.

271
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:36,192
Which one we gonna grill first?

272
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,521
Gus...
the "Rosemary Kennedy" of the clan.

273
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:43,164
While brothers one through four run the
family's commercial-real-estate empire

274
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:47,456
and south asian call centers,
all he got was the historical society.

275
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,257
Olive Snook?

276
00:14:54,757 --> 00:14:55,707
Mr. Papen.

277
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,575
Welcome to the <i>Pie Hole</i>.

278
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,257
Did you get my application
to declare our wonderful establishment

279
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:03,911
- a historical monument?
- That application was denied

280
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:06,769
the moment you people destroyed
an exemplary specimen

281
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,749
of turn-of-the-century
<i>beaux-arts</i> architecture

282
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:11,171
with the addition
of a stucco-crust overhang.

283
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:14,008
Told you.
Well, since you're already here,

284
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,427
you mind answering a few questions
about Nora McQuoddy?

285
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:18,554
Have they found
the bloodthirsty husband?

286
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,306
Merle? No.

287
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,392
What is Nora's connection
to the PCHS?

288
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:25,534
With her husband lost at sea,

289
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,551
Nora couldn't afford
the lighthouse upkeep.

290
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:31,150
I used my family influence to declare it
a protected historic monument.

291
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,319
I appointed Nora the lighthouse steward
and the McQuoddys its guardian

292
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,035
until the family line dies out

293
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:38,532
or the sun swallows the Earth
in a solar flare, killing us all.

294
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,640
Well, that means Elliot's
in charge of the lighthouse now.

295
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,533
Other than that,
I didn't really know Nora.

296
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,906
If you want to learn more,
talk to Annabelle Vandersloop.

297
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:49,919
They volunteered together
in the diorama exhibit.

298
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:52,922
Such a depressing word, "diorama".

299
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:56,126
It has "die" in it.

300
00:15:58,163 --> 00:15:59,313
I like "rama".

301
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,930
Okay, so, this...

302
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:07,442
is so we can keep in constant contact
in the present, and this...

303
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,807
is so you can regain contact
with your past.

304
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,176
Well, I'll be.

305
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:20,441
Thank you, Button.

306
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:25,746
Right. Well...
I'll leave you to settle in.

307
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:30,513
Digby, come on.

308
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:50,187
- There's milk to go with the cake.
- You didn't have to go to that trouble.

309
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:53,816
I wanted to.
It's a huge adjustment.

310
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:55,408
That's big of you, kid.

311
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:57,444
We won't get anywhere without
a little teamwork.

312
00:16:57,504 --> 00:17:01,365
That's a perfect segue way
to our playbook.

313
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,318
This is everything that pertains
to the alive-again lifestyle with

314
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:10,457
- your particular alive-again situation.
- You mean my corpse face?

315
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:11,984
Corpse face...

316
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:13,961
taken into consideration.

317
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,465
In short, stay inside with the doors
locked and the curtains drawn.

318
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:21,638
Food deliveries are <i>verboten</i>.
However, telephone use is unrestricted,

319
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:24,563
as long as you choose from the list
of cleared aliases on page 13

320
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,342
when communicating
with the outside world.

321
00:17:26,372 --> 00:17:29,775
For the first month,
I would recommend wearing latex gloves.

322
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:33,455
- I already got gloves on.
- No harm in double-bagging it, eh?

323
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,890
Sir, I'm really trying here.

324
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,283
Instead of buttering me up...

325
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,046
why don't we deal
with the elephant in the room?

326
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:45,362
You killed me.

327
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,204
I knew your parents, Ned. You were
raised right. How about an apology?

328
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:50,809
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:53,177
"All is forgiven" is gonna be
a long time coming.

330
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:54,855
You need to respect that.

331
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,298
All right?

332
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:59,298
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a bunch of reading to do.

333
00:18:02,286 --> 00:18:04,438
<i>While Charles Charles was reading,</i>

334
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:07,317
<i>Olive Snook and the private
investigator were listening</i>

335
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,892
<i>to one Annabelle Vandersloop.</i>

336
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:12,023
Nora and I were best friends.

337
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:14,563
We met through the notable widows
of Papen County.

338
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:17,733
We paid tribute
to our notable husbands' notable deaths

339
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:21,032
through
the miniature medium of diorama.

340
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,238
I love dioramas.
How can I get involved?

341
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:24,490
Are you a widow?

342
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:26,158
- No.
- Oh...

343
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:27,998
Unfortunately, I'm single.

344
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:30,856
But I do have a beloved horse
who bought the farm.

345
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:32,125
I could "dioram" that.

346
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:34,983
Sorry.
Expired spouses only.

347
00:18:35,219 --> 00:18:38,751
For example, my late husband,

348
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:41,610
munitions manufacturer
Adolph Vandersloop,

349
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,960
went out with a bang.

350
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,854
An errant 4th of July rocket
flew into an open window

351
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:48,874
while he was taking inventory.

352
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:59,059
One can never add enough glitter
to a husband's memory.

353
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,245
Miss Snook,
do you see how your pony death

354
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,530
might make a mockery
of our legitimate efforts?

355
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:07,972
Do you see how you have
cotton balls stuck to your ass?

356
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:10,281
I was looking for those!

357
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:12,871
Yeah, well, I'm looking for something...
information...

358
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,375
on whether Nora McQuoddy's husband
made himself a notable widower.

359
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:17,655
I was with sweet Nora

360
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,754
when she heard the news
that homosexual boat had rescued Merle.

361
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:25,434
Can you imagine the joy of starting over
with a husband you thought you'd lost?

362
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,262
No. You can't.

363
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:32,894
Anyway, Nora was the first to admit
that she was an overprotective mother,

364
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:36,703
but with Merle home and Elliot
so desperate to bond with him,

365
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,480
it quickly became two against one.

366
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:41,066
- She finally had to put her foot down.
- On what?

367
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:45,602
Crazy things, like, you know, father/son
sailing trips around the world.

368
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,916
She absolutely forbade it.

369
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:50,442
And I guess that was the final straw

370
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:53,370
before Merle snapped, killed her,
and went AWOL.

371
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:58,638
Sometimes I just think to myself,
"life... you can't make this crap up".

372
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:00,669
Well, thanks for your time.

373
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,808
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

374
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:06,601
Good luck.

375
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:11,965
Speaking of crap,
Elliot seems to be full of it.

376
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:15,402
We met a heartbroken mama's boy
who never mentioned feuds with mama.

377
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,582
- What gives?
- That's just what we're gonna ask him.

378
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:24,499
Don't bother signing in.

379
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,194
The open house is off.

380
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:28,163
- Who are you?
- Willie Gherkin.

381
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:29,531
<i>Smiley Realty</i>.

382
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,643
You lost your smile, pickle.

383
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,785
I thought
it was too good to be true.

384
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:36,718
This lighthouse lands in my lap,
and now

385
00:20:36,941 --> 00:20:40,667
I find out I can't sell it because
it's a protected historical monument!

386
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:44,254
This is so not the way
the secret is supposed to work.

387
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:46,907
- Where's the owner?
- Elliot?

388
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,525
That little bowl-cut split.

389
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:51,355
But not before I advanced him
10 grand against the sale.

390
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,514
Said he and his father were going out
of town and need cash quick.

391
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:55,719
Is that legal?

392
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,853
How should I know?
I just got my license.

393
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,577
Screw it.

394
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:01,949
I'm going back
to personal training...

395
00:21:02,248 --> 00:21:03,464
Where there's respect.

396
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:04,686
Excuse me.

397
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,487
Try this on for size.

398
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:13,033
So, Merle kills Nora, and then...

399
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,648
Elliot hires me...

400
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:17,020
to take the suspicion off Merle.

401
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:20,215
And then Elliot goes
and gets the funds

402
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,447
so they can take
their little father-and-son trip.

403
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:24,939
But if they did score a sloop,

404
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:28,066
there's no way they're taking it out
in this weather. They must be hiding.

405
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,174
Let's smoke 'em out.

406
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:33,804
I can't believe you got me working
in this downpour.

407
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:36,217
Yeah, what's up with that,
anyway, rain-hater?

408
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:39,768
I mean, I'd get it
if you were a cat or had hair.

409
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,018
Or got dumped.

410
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,271
Back in the rainy day,

411
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:50,620
my ex and I used to hole up with
a bottle of brandy and some tomato soup,

412
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,453
and we wouldn't come out
until the sun did.

413
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:55,193
Now...

414
00:21:56,993 --> 00:21:59,395
Whenever the drops fall,
it reminds me of everything I lost

415
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:01,456
and ain't gonna get back. Happy?

416
00:22:02,742 --> 00:22:04,084
Let's wait it out here a bit.

417
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,456
I've always wanted
to see this place.

418
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:11,383
But you can't get much of a feel for it
when you're trying to peek inside.

419
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:16,342
Are you trying to give me
the heebie-jeebies or something?

420
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,974
Or a theory as to where
the murderous McQuoddys are holed up.

421
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:23,645
Remember the sea caves Merle's ghost
supposedly haunted with his howls?

422
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:25,219
There's nothing haunted about them.

423
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:29,165
The sound is created when the wind
rushes in off the water, kind of like...

424
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,336
Elliot knows those caves
like the back of his hand!

425
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:37,052
If he's in there,
he's gonna get the back of mine.

426
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,165
Yeah! Let's go.

427
00:22:41,996 --> 00:22:44,879
All right, sugars have been re-sugared,
creamers have been re-creamed.

428
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:47,956
Anything else you want me to do before
I head to the store? Dad gave me a list.

429
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,467
"Slippers, mouthwash,
and the last 20 years of my life back".

430
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:56,053
- He's... so funny.
- Hilarious.

431
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,930
It's bad enough we can't touch.
Now I'm not allowed to see you?

432
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:00,416
How is that possible?

433
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:03,107
We don't have to stop seeing each other.
It's just when dad's around...

434
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:06,730
Which is limited to your apartment.
He can't go anywhere else.

435
00:23:06,997 --> 00:23:09,413
I'm not embarrassed to say
that I'm scared of your father...

436
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:10,737
Petrified, actually...

437
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:11,819
and...

438
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,942
stop smiling.

439
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:15,864
I can't help it. Something's happening
I never thought would happen.

440
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:18,716
My dad's torturing
my first boyfriend.

441
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:19,724
Yeah.

442
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:23,164
Exactly. We get to be the teenagers
we never thought we'd get to be.

443
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:25,631
You because you were locked up
in some boarding school

444
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:27,978
and me because I was shut up
with my shut-in aunts.

445
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:30,643
And now you get to be
the studly varsity quarterback,

446
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:32,464
and I get to be
the flirty head cheerleader.

447
00:23:34,477 --> 00:23:38,970
Which means we can break curfews
and mislead our parents

448
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,981
and generally...

449
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,256
sneak around.

450
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:56,196
I may need some more convincing.

451
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,932
I'll meet you later
behind the bleachers.

452
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:05,357
Bring your pom-poms.

453
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:18,580
Hello, Nedly.

454
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:26,518
Looked to me like you were necking
with my daughter.

455
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:28,399
The one you promised
to keep a distance from.

456
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,042
You can't be here.
Go upstairs.

457
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:31,231
I'm not going anywhere.

458
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,620
Everybody out!

459
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,555
We have a gas leak caused by...

460
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:38,196
a radon emission chock
full of asbestos!

461
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:39,990
Safety first!

462
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,032
Cover your eyes!

463
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,701
Everybody out!

464
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,879
Seriously... no cake at all?

465
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:56,006
- I made you a cake.
- I'm not one for chocolate.

466
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:58,910
Who's not for chocolate?
Everyone at least tolerates it!

467
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:01,609
Mr. Charles,
you can't be in public like this.

468
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:03,901
- If someone sees you...
- I'll say I'm a burn victim.

469
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:05,555
If I need to say anything at all.

470
00:25:05,774 --> 00:25:08,894
I've been walking around for an hour,
and no one's looked at me twice.

471
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:12,370
I wonder if I can get myself one of
those "handicapped parking" placards.

472
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,774
There's no driving!
That's rule number 17!

473
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:17,748
Why am I supposed to play by your rules
when you don't, Romeo?

474
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:18,578
I...

475
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,822
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

476
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,740
Look, kiddo,

477
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,117
you may be able to scare
Charlotte with stories of mobs

478
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,289
and pitchforks and torches,
but I know the truth.

479
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,251
If the villagers show,
they aren't coming for me.

480
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:30,551
No, they're coming
for the guy with the magic finger.

481
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:35,015
Hate to break it to you, Charles,
but no one cared about Dr. Frankenstein.

482
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,420
They were after his monster.

483
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,868
Regardless of what you think, my
priority is your daughter's well-being.

484
00:25:40,015 --> 00:25:42,426
If you walk out that door,
you put her life in jeopardy.

485
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:44,596
As her father,
I'll be the judge of that.

486
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:46,822
You're not leaving.

487
00:26:08,477 --> 00:26:10,228
Not bad for a dead guy, huh?

488
00:26:10,258 --> 00:26:12,344
Don't... touch... me.

489
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:24,135
<i>As the tide turned
for the pie maker,</i>

490
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,440
<i>a turn of the tide
allowed Emerson Cod and Olive Snook</i>

491
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,685
<i>to turn their investigation
toward a sea cave.</i>

492
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:35,625
If the McQuoddys are barnacled up
in here, we'll have them cornered.

493
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,390
If McQuoddy is here, I'll just die!

494
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,575
Not because he's a killer,
but because he's a...

495
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:44,060
Easy there, friend!

496
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:45,699
Not foe.

497
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:47,457
Yeah, well, we foe, fo'sho'.

498
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:48,660
Emerson Cod, PI,

499
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:51,705
here to trawl your ass downtown.
Where's Elliot?

500
00:26:52,082 --> 00:26:53,386
Gathering supplies.

501
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:57,043
We know all about
the McQuoddy family killers cruise.

502
00:26:57,104 --> 00:26:58,490
You two murdered Nora!

503
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,168
You're mistaken, matey!

504
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:02,632
When she died, I was here.

505
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:04,759
Why are you bunked up <i>al grotto</i>?

506
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:07,496
For the past month, Nora and I...

507
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,709
had been trying to put
our marriage back on its old course,

508
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:13,186
but 10 years apart...

509
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,061
leaves you different people.

510
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,783
The other night,
while Elliot was at the movies,

511
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:23,961
Nora confessed to me that she'd found
her bearings with another man.

512
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:28,867
Bewildered, I sought shelter here.

513
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:31,085
Why not clear things up
with the authorities?

514
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:34,744
Because I'm a ghost with an alibi

515
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:37,106
as thin as fishing line!

516
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:41,197
It was Elliot's idea
to set sail from here.

517
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:44,424
Said he'd garner the funds
and I would prep the vessel.

518
00:27:44,523 --> 00:27:46,092
Just one hole in your story.

519
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:48,887
Elliot never mentioned
Nora's new squeeze.

520
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,663
Nora never told him.

521
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:53,641
Yeah, well, you better cough up a name,
or we're hauling your buoy in.

522
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,226
She didn't tell me his name.

523
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:57,687
But I found this...

524
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:00,366
in her personal effects.

525
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,448
A dutch love spoon.
Men used to give it to their women

526
00:28:03,478 --> 00:28:05,873
as a symbol of the sweetness
that they'd feed each other forever.

527
00:28:07,006 --> 00:28:08,970
I've read
the entire Harlequin library.

528
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,215
I didn't give my wife this spoon.

529
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:12,521
No.

530
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,337
A lover did.

531
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:17,009
A lover who murdered her
in a jealous rage

532
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,899
before she had a chance to tell him
that she was leaving her husband.

533
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:23,713
See? Engraving says:
"A.P. 'hearts' N.M."

534
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,744
N.M. is Nora McQuoddy,
but who in the hell is A.P.?

535
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,068
Papen is a dutch name.

536
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:31,475
Scurvy! There's 50 Papens
in this county alone.

537
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:34,515
But only one Augustus.

538
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:36,955
- Gus Papen!
- Gus Papen!

539
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:39,952
I think I was first.

540
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:46,864
What happened?

541
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,447
Your dad came down
and we had a little... tussle.

542
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:52,244
- What do you mean "a tussle"?
- Well, more like a scuffle.

543
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:53,243
Charlotte?

544
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:55,342
- Oh, my god.
- No, wait...

545
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:56,837
let me explain.

546
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:58,998
Oh, my god.

547
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:00,624
Ned. Oh, my god.

548
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:02,316
Come here.

549
00:29:02,346 --> 00:29:03,542
The light...

550
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:05,007
so bright.

551
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:07,028
Are you okay?

552
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:08,741
- My wrist.
- What?

553
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:10,306
I think I need to ice it.

554
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,600
Now, you go upstairs
and I'll be right there.

555
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:20,562
- That was an act!
- An act of foolishness.

556
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,826
Why would you bring him
to the <i>Pie Hole</i>?

557
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,895
I didn't. He left my apartment
of his own accord,

558
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:27,658
wandered around for an hour,
and then grabbed a seat at the counter.

559
00:29:27,688 --> 00:29:29,362
He wouldn't do that.
He knows the rules.

560
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:32,206
Didn't you hear? Your dad's not
one for chocolate or rules.

561
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:34,418
So from this point on,
he's gonna be doing his own thing.

562
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:37,787
All right, I will go upstairs
and I will talk to him.

563
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,479
We said we'd handle this together.

564
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:41,855
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

565
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,231
You're far too upset.
I'm not having you fighting again.

566
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,254
He's a big boy. He can handle it.

567
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:47,881
Yeah, well, maybe I can't.

568
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:52,866
I get it. My dad is strong-willed
and he's stubborn.

569
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:55,555
But it's just a normal...

570
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,765
father/daughter/daughter's boyfriend
dynamic.

571
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:58,814
No, it's not.

572
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:01,150
Why not? Because he's been dead
for 20 years? Just...

573
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:03,772
pretend he's been in a coma.

574
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:06,208
I don't have the luxury
of pretending that he's in a coma

575
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,369
or you're the head cheerleader
or any of this is normal,

576
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,483
because Charles Charles
has no problem exposing our secret

577
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:14,282
to the rest of the world!
We need to put a stop to this.

578
00:30:14,342 --> 00:30:16,297
How? 'cause re-deading him
is not an option.

579
00:30:16,327 --> 00:30:19,204
I never said that. Look,
I've tried everything to make this work.

580
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:22,320
You don't want to work
together anymore... fine.

581
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:24,333
You take care of it.

582
00:30:38,658 --> 00:30:40,071
- Hi.
- Hi.

583
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:41,915
Come here, Button.

584
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:44,576
What I have here is a cookbook...

585
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:46,689
of culinary treasures
from around the world.

586
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:50,527
Close your eyes, tap the page,
and where the spoon lands...

587
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,232
is where you and I
are gonna go tonight.

588
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,366
No, dad, it was just a misunderstanding
that went out of control.

589
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:58,377
Leaving is not the answer.

590
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:00,243
Well, is this better?

591
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:03,635
Let's see. Rule 21...
"When crossing rooms simultaneously,

592
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:07,128
party A shall announce "Coming"
at which point party B shall pause,

593
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:09,838
then commence movement
with the response "Going."

594
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:12,124
This is how you live?

595
00:31:14,353 --> 00:31:16,256
You may have grown up without me,
but I am back,

596
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:18,555
and I am never gonna stop
trying to keep you safe.

597
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,688
The little girl I left behind
would have never settled

598
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:22,173
for a lock-and-key existence.

599
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:24,445
No, she was destined for adventure.

600
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:25,275
But...

601
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:26,674
my life is here.

602
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:28,338
This isn't a life.

603
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,082
This is a freak show.

604
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:33,068
We're only freaks in Ned's world.

605
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:36,391
Away from Ned,
we could do anything, be anything.

606
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:42,359
Dad, I just want things
to be how they used to be.

607
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:45,898
Come with me, Button.

608
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:47,787
Pie is...

609
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:49,383
simple.

610
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:50,631
It's limited. Just...

611
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,870
a bit of... pastry and filling.

612
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:55,930
Cake is complex,

613
00:31:57,066 --> 00:32:00,305
layered with treasures
waiting to be discovered.

614
00:32:03,163 --> 00:32:04,574
Which one do you choose?

615
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,694
Gus and Nora were an item?

616
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:18,105
Could he have had
something to do with her murder?

617
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:20,477
- You didn't hear it from me.
- Oh, my god!

618
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,823
Miss Snook, I almost forgot...

619
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:25,802
I told
the notable widows your story,

620
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:28,536
and it made us realize
how very blessed we are.

621
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:32,587
It is better to have loved
and lost than to be you.

622
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:35,545
Well, you'll have to excuse me.

623
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:37,502
I have an appointment to get to.

624
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:41,095
Ta, sad Miss Snook.

625
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:43,100
See you at Tuesday's potluck.

626
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,864
Not on
the Savile Row glen plaid cashmere.

627
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:48,491
It's just paper-<i>maché</i> paste.

628
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:49,756
It'll come right out.

629
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,241
See you at the potluck on Tuesday!

630
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:53,021
Ta.

631
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:55,428
You get anything from Vandersloop?

632
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:56,523
Just a good riling.

633
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,270
'cause I found something,
snooping around in Gus Papen's office.

634
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:04,702
A proposal to redevelop
Papen Harbor lighthouse.

635
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,275
Check the next page.

636
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,625
- A water slide!
- He got a green light.

637
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,886
The runt of the Papen Litter
found a way to prove

638
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:15,380
that he can go toe-to-capitalistic-toe
with all his brothers.

639
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:18,709
Merle's sudden return
gave him a McQuoddy twofer.

640
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:22,512
Kill Nora and then frame
the crazy captain with the crime.

641
00:33:22,573 --> 00:33:24,053
With both of them out of the way,

642
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,391
he's free to redevelop
to his bank account's content,

643
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:29,309
- provided he could get rid of...
- Elliot McQuoddy!

644
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:33,027
Confirming a meeting with Gus
at the lighthouse tonight.

645
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,904
Help!

646
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:44,742
- Oh, hell no!
- Oh, hell no!

647
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:52,917
All right, Papen!
Step away from the boy!

648
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:53,960
Help!

649
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:55,573
If I do, he'll die!

650
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:58,351
Is that reverse psychology?
That's exactly what you want!

651
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:01,577
What I want is to save him!

652
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,385
Is that reverse reverse psychology?

653
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:04,637
He didn't do this!

654
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:06,302
Well, then who the hell did?

655
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:09,840
<i>"Who the hell did?"
was Elliot McQuoddy himself.</i>

656
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:13,468
<i>Realizing the severity
of the impending nor'easter,</i>

657
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:16,646
<i>Nora's son struggled
to do his dead mother proud</i>

658
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:18,943
<i>by raising the signal flags...</i>

659
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,323
Mommy!

660
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:22,655
<i>... And failed.</i>

661
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:24,223
Thank you.

662
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:25,491
It's okay, Elliot.

663
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,283
So, wait a minute.

664
00:34:27,346 --> 00:34:29,430
You weren't trying
to wipe out the McQuoddy line

665
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,866
and take over this lighthouse?

666
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:32,832
Of course not!
Not when I want to save it!

667
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,084
I don't like the looks of this.

668
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:37,849
I don't like the looks of him!

669
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,090
"Welcome to
the Papen lighthouse resort & day spa"?

670
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:52,602
<i>I'll be your candle on the water</i>

671
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:58,247
<i>- my love for you will always burn,
- Always burn,</i>

672
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:00,067
<i> I know you're lost</i>

673
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,988
<i>and drifting,
but the clouds are lifting</i>

674
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:06,749
<i>don't give up,
you'll have somewhere to...</i>

675
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:08,376
Shut the <i>a cappella</i> up.

676
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,936
And that's how
our cocktail hour begins...

677
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,205
with a bang and a song!

678
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:15,542
Followed by a gourmet meal
and dancing here in the lamp room.

679
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:18,419
That's why I called Elliot...
to pitch him!

680
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,911
This feels really, really wrong.

681
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:23,530
How can a symbol of love be wrong?

682
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:25,154
So, you...

683
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:27,186
and my mom?

684
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:28,882
She wanted to tell you.

685
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,473
Then your father returned.

686
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:32,556
We tried to put our feelings aside,

687
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:34,798
to give them
a shot at recapturing the past...

688
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:36,088
But they couldn't.

689
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:39,294
Let's have something good
come out of this tragedy.

690
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:42,872
If that's the plan,
please nix the glitter.

691
00:35:43,406 --> 00:35:46,318
Who'd you get to decorate the place...
Annabelle Vandersloop?

692
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,283
Wait a minute.
What if crazy craft lady was up here,

693
00:35:49,916 --> 00:35:53,037
but instead of a hot-glue gun,
she brought a stone-cold harpoon?

694
00:35:53,337 --> 00:35:56,541
Mrs. Vandersloop was my mother's best
friend. Why would she kill her?

695
00:35:56,843 --> 00:36:00,490
Because Nora wasn't the only squeeze
Papen here was squeezin'.

696
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:03,589
Turn around there, shortstop.

697
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:06,509
Paper-<i>maché</i>?

698
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,521
You were getting down
with the diorama dame.

699
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:12,128
I damned that dame every time
she made an advance...

700
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:15,268
Like tonight, in my office,
and a dozen nights before.

701
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:16,408
Come on, Papen.

702
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:18,106
You two must have been swapping

703
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:20,064
something other
than historical factoids.

704
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:21,704
Once...

705
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:23,309
years ago...

706
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,940
at the historical society
Christmas party.

707
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,132
So, spurned lover spears
her best friend,

708
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:30,594
then frames ghost husband
to take the fall.

709
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,248
Let's rubber-cement
her ass to a prison bed.

710
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:39,941
Tell me you guys
are missing a baritone.

711
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,046
A full house!

712
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:47,300
So much for keeping
the innocent-victim count down.

713
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,537
Seriously, does she toot glitter?

714
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:51,464
That ain't glitter.

715
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,322
- That's gunpowder.
- She's going to blow us up.

716
00:36:54,441 --> 00:36:57,810
You remember my husband,
Adolph, the munitions manufacturer?

717
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,062
I inherited
the remaining inventory.

718
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,289
Said I'd save it for a rainy day.

719
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,134
And look... it's here!

720
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:07,028
Annabelle, why?

721
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:09,697
You tossed our love aside
like it never happened!

722
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:10,948
It was one night!

723
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:14,202
What we had was so much more special
than anything you had with Nora.

724
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,188
When Merle returned,
it was the answer to my prayers.

725
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,073
But even then, you couldn't let go!

726
00:37:19,562 --> 00:37:20,875
So I had to eliminate her.

727
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:23,461
- I still love Nora.
- Shut up.

728
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:27,845
That's why you've left me no choice.

729
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:30,989
I don't understand how killing us
is gonna solve anything!

730
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:32,163
I do! I do!

731
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:36,682
When you called me "sad Miss Snook",
it really honked me off,

732
00:37:36,946 --> 00:37:41,394
but now I realize that you recognized
sadness in me because you had it in you.

733
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,148
The rest of you don't know
what it's like

734
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,433
to know in your heart
that you belong with somebody,

735
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:50,245
if you could only eliminate everybody
else so that maybe he'd finally,

736
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:52,781
finally grasp
what you've been trying to show him...

737
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,077
that feeling
that you've been dying to recapture.

738
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:56,494
If only for a moment.

739
00:37:56,554 --> 00:37:59,163
But that moment never comes, so what
do you do? Decide not to love Ned?

740
00:37:59,497 --> 00:38:00,806
- Gus.
- Gus! Gus!

741
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:02,547
- See? I've tried that.
- Me too!

742
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:03,422
Did it work?

743
00:38:03,452 --> 00:38:04,707
- Heck no.
- Heck no!

744
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:05,954
So you know what I say?

745
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:11,037
<i>Annabelle Vandersloop did move on.</i>

746
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:14,509
<i>She was no longer sad
about losing Gus' love,</i>

747
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:19,225
<i>since a 30-year prison sentence gave
her something to be truly sad about.</i>

748
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:22,869
<i>Merle and Elliot McQuoddy
moved on, as well,</i>

749
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:26,447
<i>becoming partners
in Gus Papen's lighthouse hotel.</i>

750
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:29,551
<i>They used the profits
for a trip around the world</i>

751
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,510
<i>and found, on the high seas,</i>

752
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,341
<i>the route back
to their father/son bond.</i>

753
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:35,518
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

754
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:39,480
<i>private detective Emerson Cod
was afloat in a sea of reward money,</i>

755
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:42,859
<i>given by the Papen County
Historical Society,</i>

756
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:46,507
<i>which he shared
with the junior PI in training.</i>

757
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:47,720
Nice work, Snook.

758
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,825
Thanks, Cod.

759
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:50,266
I learned from the best.

760
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:51,799
Wait. Hold on, now. We ain't done.

761
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:56,836
You remember when you said
you were still in love with Ned?

762
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:01,017
That wasn't just
for wicked widow's benefit, was it?

763
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:02,466
No.

764
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:05,838
I thought
I'd stomped out that flame,

765
00:39:05,868 --> 00:39:08,449
or at least brought it down
to a smolder, but no.

766
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:12,028
I still burn and yearn for him
now more than ever.

767
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,782
Do I need to be concerned that any of my
<i>Pie Hole</i> peeps are gonna be eliminated?

768
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:20,619
Meaning, am I gonna harpoon
Chuck so Ned will finally love me?

769
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,240
No.

770
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:24,561
Well...

771
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:27,491
If the day finally comes that

772
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:31,279
being around pie boy and his pie girl
make your suffering insufferable,

773
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:35,725
I just want you to know
that there's a place for you,

774
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:38,387
right here
in this professional establishment.

775
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,409
All you have to do is ask.

776
00:39:41,878 --> 00:39:42,979
Emerson Cod.

777
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:45,603
I think I may be winning you over.

778
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,733
Itty-bitty...

779
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:50,996
You made me love a rainy day again.

780
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:58,461
You've got to understand.

781
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:00,633
When I was a little girl,

782
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:03,048
I used to compare my dad to...

783
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:05,892
all the other dads on our street.

784
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:07,859
I probably wasn't
very objective, because

785
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:11,051
I was convinced that he was
the strongest and bravest and most...

786
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,735
fun man in the neighborhood.

787
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:15,347
I can say, objectively,
he was all those things.

788
00:40:15,377 --> 00:40:18,556
And when he was gone, that's how
I remembered him. I put him on a...

789
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,238
paternal pedestal.

790
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:21,986
And now...

791
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:25,238
Now he wants me to leave.

792
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:27,186
Leave? Where?

793
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:29,269
Anywhere the spoon lands.

794
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:31,183
He promised me an adventure like

795
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:33,156
the ones he told me about
when I was a kid.

796
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:34,842
All I have to do is...

797
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:37,558
choose cake over pie.

798
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:43,160
He's trying to be the dad
that I always dreamed of, someone who...

799
00:40:43,563 --> 00:40:45,987
could keep his little girl
safe and happy.

800
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,528
Except I'm...

801
00:40:49,943 --> 00:40:51,158
I'm not a little girl.

802
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,423
Which is why I told him
the spoon lands here.

803
00:40:57,628 --> 00:40:59,975
I already feel safe
and happy, and...

804
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:02,471
and, besides,
we have adventures every day.

805
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,005
What did he think of your decision?

806
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:08,144
He's waiting for you upstairs.

807
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:09,145
With a gun?

808
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:11,424
With an apology.

809
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,499
He wants us all to start afresh.

810
00:41:14,862 --> 00:41:16,097
Then he's a good dad.

811
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:20,030
And you're a good man.

812
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:24,302
Come on.

813
00:41:26,912 --> 00:41:27,759
Dad?

814
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:29,228
Come on! Grab your hat!

815
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:31,909
We're taking hot toddies
up to the roof to watch the snow!

816
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:39,927
No!

817
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:41,608
Dad!
