00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,878
<i>Previously on
"Pushing Daisies"...</i>

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,172
<i>Young Ned had a
special gift.</i>

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,709
<i>He could touch dead things
and bring them back to life.</i>

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,273
<i>But he could only bring
the dead back to life</i>

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,003
<i>for one minute.
Any longer,</i>

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,846
<i>and someone else
had to die.</i>

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,904
<i>And there was one more
thing he had to learn --</i>

8
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,185
<i>first touch, life.</i>

9
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,438
<i>Second touch,
dead again forever.</i>

10
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:23,860
<i>But as young Ned grew
into the pie maker,</i>

11
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,996
<i>this gift proved to be most
useful in the untimely death</i>

12
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,295
<i>of his childhood sweetheart,
Charlotte Charles.</i>

13
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:31,007
Are you in love with her?

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,373
- You only got a minute.
- I know.

15
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,520
- 60 seconds.
- I know.

16
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,362
What if you didn't
have to be dead?

17
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,322
You can't touch me.

18
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,221
So a kiss is out
of the question?

19
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,073
You touch murder victims,
you ask who killed them,

20
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:42,091
you touch them again,
they go back to being dead,

21
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:45,120
- and then you collect the reward?
- That's it in a nutshell.

22
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:48,711
- Might I make an observation?
- Compliment or criticism?

23
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,353
A neutral thought, I would say.

24
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,063
It's neither complimentary
nor critical.

25
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,883
Neutral thought gives me pause.

26
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:56,271
- You seem decidedly unhappy.
- What are you beating at?

27
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,352
An offer to repair
your espresso machine.

00:01:07,738 --> 00:01:10,733
<i>The motto of the Longborough
School for boys was</i>

30
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:16,450
<i>"institutum superior omnibus,"
or "tradition over all."</i>

31
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:19,803
<i>But on this morning,
whether it was the topic of flight</i>

32
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:22,243
<i>or the brandy the
teachers parlor,</i>

33
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:24,830
<i>Mr. Gault threw
tradition to the wind</i>

34
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:28,250
<i>and let the students chose
their own lab partners.</i>

35
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:32,803
<i>young Ned,
however found his chosen for him.</i>

36
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:36,471
<i>Eugene Mulchandani was
an exchange student</i>

37
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,763
<i>from Gorakhpur, India.</i>

38
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:42,563
<i>Young Ned felt a gnawing pity
growing in his stomach,</i>

39
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,560
<i>as was tradition.</i>

40
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:48,733
<i>But beneath
Eugene's headgear</i>

41
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,861
<i>thrived an
active imagination</i>

42
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:54,572
<i>and a useful gift for
aeronautical model building,</i>

43
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:58,573
<i>as well as the hope that
someone might not dislike him</i>

44
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:01,833
<i>for the simple fact
that he was different.</i>

45
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:12,090
<i>Young Ned found himself breaking
with his own tradition</i>

46
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:14,093
<i>and, in a moment
of passion...</i>

47
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,592
<i>he fought back.</i>

48
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:21,261
<i>For the first time since
his father dropped him off,</i>

49
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,890
<i>young Ned made a friend.</i>

50
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,230
<i>In the surge of emotion,</i>

51
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:28,133
<i>he forgot his
mother had died,</i>

52
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:29,701
<i>his father had left him,</i>

53
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:32,100
<i>and that he missed
the girl named Chuck.</i>

54
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:33,522
<i>He also forgot</i>

55
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:36,001
<i>he was jumping into a
pile of dead leaves</i>

56
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:38,492
<i>that were once alive.</i>

57
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:48,371
<i>Eugene Mulchandani fled in a
flurry of saliva and fear.</i>

58
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:52,460
<i>Eugene would eventually
forget young Ned's mistake</i>

59
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:55,630
<i>and chalk it up
to magic leaves.</i>

60
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:58,173
<i>But young Ned
would never forget</i>

61
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:02,300
<i>that happiness born of passion
is always short-lived.</i>

62
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,472
<i>Yet, for no fought
of his own,</i>

63
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:07,430
<i>he had once again stumbled
into happiness...</i>

64
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:10,391
- Good morning.
<i>- Which terrified him.</i>

65
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:11,981
Morning.

66
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:15,400
- Guess what day it is today.
- World hello day.

67
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:19,032
You finally put up my
calendar of obscure holidays.

68
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:22,570
Yes. And hola! That's española.

69
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:26,203
Merhaba, selamat pagi, o si yo.

70
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:28,470
That's turkish,
indonesian, and cherokee.

71
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,120
Although the indonesian
really says "good day,"

72
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:31,901
which I think is much
better than "hello,"

73
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:33,742
'cause what does that say?
That says, "I'm here.

74
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:35,632
Your turn to talk."
Kind of selfish.

75
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,051
- What?
- Nothing.

76
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:42,602
<i>The pie maker wished
to express to Chuck</i>

77
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:45,640
<i>exactly how intense
his fer her.</i>

78
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,853
Am I your boyfriend?

79
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,113
And I realize "boyfriend"
and "girlfriend"

80
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,803
are familiar, trite labels.

81
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,412
If convention were
something you soaked in,

82
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:55,282
"boyfriend" would be
dripping with it.

83
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:56,960
But we've never
actually said it,

84
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,950
and I think we need to define
the relationship. But,

85
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:01,821
it may be helpful in a familiar,
trite way --

86
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,202
The way on a holiday
created to sell

87
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,060
greeting cards it's still
kind of nice to get a card.

88
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,760
And are you gonna cut me off
with a "yes" anytime soon?

89
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:10,751
Yes.

90
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,842
You never said what today is.

91
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:21,133
Thank you.

92
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,590
Today is my daddy's birthday.

93
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:29,851
You know he would have been 60
today if he were still alive?

94
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:31,821
<i>The mention of
Chuck's father</i>

95
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,281
<i>sent the pie maker's
thoughts spinning.</i>

96
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,863
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

97
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:41,071
<i>The meaning of
"nothing" was</i>

98
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,281
<i>"I never told you that I
inadvertently killed your father."</i>

99
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,663
<i>Olive Snook had
told the pie maker</i>

100
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:51,980
<i>she was happy for his happiness
with the girl named Chuck,</i>

101
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,252
<i>but upon hearing the
word "boyfriend,"</i>

102
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:58,173
<i>she unexpectedly found her
sadness spinning into anger.</i>

103
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,671
<i>It was a truth she could
not yet stare in the face.</i>

104
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:04,343
Olive.

105
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:10,183
- Where are all the customers?
- You got me.

106
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,020
I am a customer.

107
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,101
<i>Her dizzy heart missed another
truth staring her in the face.</i>

108
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,400
Fredo.

109
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,822
Alfredo, when did you come in?

110
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,671
Before, when you
opened the door for me

111
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,690
and I asked how you were,
then you said you were fine.

112
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:27,813
Then I asked for a macchiato,

113
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,780
and you said,
"coming right up."

114
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,832
So, I guess you'll
still want that.

115
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:33,081
Yes, please.

116
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:43,133
- This case is easy money.
- You told me that already.

117
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,231
It's my fault Chuck's
father's dead.

118
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:47,861
- You told me that already.
- I should just tell her.

119
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:49,791
Well, that idea might
make a stupid idea

120
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:51,400
feel better about itself.

121
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,932
- I can't keep lying to her.
- You ain't lying.

122
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:55,642
The only way you're lying

123
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:57,292
is if she asks the question,

124
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:00,163
"Hey, did you kill my father when
you brought your mother back,

125
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:02,293
which I didn't know about,
because you never told me?"

126
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:03,532
Don't tell her.

127
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,861
Have you guys heard?

128
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:10,672
The most amazing new candy store
is opening up across the street.

129
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,281
It's amazing.

130
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,410
Who are you?

131
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,221
I'm just some guy who's
telling everybody about it

132
00:06:16,258 --> 00:06:17,402
'cause it's so amazing.

133
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:19,342
Seriously, everybody,
you got to check this out.

134
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,970
Do you work for
the candy store?

135
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,462
No. I'm just some guy.

136
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,961
"Some guy"?

137
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:26,012
Yeah. Some guy who
sure loves candy.

138
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,472
Be sure to tell everne you know.
See ya.

139
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:31,543
Oh, no. See?
This is how it all ends.

140
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,273
Some weird guy comes in saying
stuff that don't make no sense.

141
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:36,053
And by the time
your head realizes,

142
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:37,703
"Hey, this weird guy
don't make no sense,"

143
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:39,040
your guts are all
over the window.

144
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:39,836
Here.

145
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,505
So, did Ned tell you
he's my boyfriend?

146
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,947
You two are gonna
love this case.

147
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,633
<i>The facts were these --</i>

148
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,243
<i>one Tony Dinapoli --</i>

149
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:53,781
<i>26 years, 9 weeks, 2 hours,
and 10 minutes old --</i>

150
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,170
<i>was found strangled to death
in his friend's apartment.</i>

151
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:59,332
<i>His girlfriend,
Tina Arongino,</i>

152
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:01,180
<i>was arrested
at the scene</i>

153
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:02,970
<i>for the murder the
police described</i>

154
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,002
<i>as a typical
crime of passion.</i>

155
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,803
I freakin' loved Tony.

156
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:09,492
You got to help me, Emerson Cod.
I didn't do it.

157
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,490
<i>With the evidence
stacked against her,</i>

158
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:17,350
<i>Tina Arongino
hired Emerson Cod.</i>

159
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,320
How you doin'?

160
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,361
Do you know how you're doing?

161
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:28,900
I'm dead, right?

162
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:30,383
Your girlfriend murder you?

163
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,573
Hell, no.
Me and Tina were mad for each other.

164
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:34,162
She friggin' loved me.

165
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:36,702
It was burly Bruce
Carter who strangled me.

166
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,290
This burly Bruce,

167
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,331
did he have congenitally
dainty hands?

168
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:42,021
'Cause those strangle
marks were made by

169
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,711
a petite female with rounded,
crimson, french-tipped nails.

170
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:47,211
He used his girlfriend
hands to kill me.

171
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,792
I don't know what
to do with that.

172
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:52,513
His girlfriend's a doll --
not like you're a doll.

173
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,551
She's a doll doll,
like life-sized and plastic.

174
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:58,311
- You mean she's not real?
- Don't tell Bruce that.

175
00:07:58,465 --> 00:07:59,683
That was my mistake.

176
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,511
Bruce invited me and Tina
over for a double date.

177
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,940
I got to Bruce's
place before Tina did.

178
00:08:05,157 --> 00:08:06,452
When he showed me the doll

179
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:08,970
and said it was his girlfriend,
I let him have it.

180
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,693
Then he kind of flipped out.

181
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,373
So you're saying the murder weapon
was a life-size-human doll?

182
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:19,952
That's what I'm sayin'.

183
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:22,202
- Got a phone number, sweetie?
- Do you mind?

184
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,602
- What about friggin' Tina?
- I'm dead, ain't I?

185
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:25,883
No.

186
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:28,802
- Now you're dead.
- Oh, my gosh.

187
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,843
Well, that was a
crime of passion.

188
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:33,881
What? It was a minute.
I'm having a hard day.

189
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:42,520
<i>Olive found herself in a cloud
of steamed milk and self-pity,</i>

190
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:45,061
<i>unaware of the warm
breath blowing out</i>

191
00:08:45,237 --> 00:08:47,281
<i>of the mouth of
Alfredo Aldarisio.</i>

192
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,583
...is compromised,
because a traveling salesman

193
00:08:49,618 --> 00:08:51,662
isn't such a thing if
he does not travel.

194
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,943
As any nontraditional-remedy
salesman knows,

195
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,001
resistance to the novel
and the unconventional

196
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,923
is marbled through this
country like gristle.

197
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,651
If I'm not cutting that gristle,
I'm not doing my job.

198
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,873
Were you talking?

199
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,081
I have to go back
on the road soon.

200
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,321
It may be a long time
before I return.

201
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:09,673
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

202
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,632
- If you loved me...
- Yes.

203
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:16,931
...And we could never,
ever, ever touch,

204
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:18,773
wouldn't you eventually
get over it and move on,

205
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,733
letting someone else
have the slightest hope

206
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,201
that you might move on to them?

207
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:24,350
- If I loved you?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:29,612
Then I would love you
in any way I could.

209
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:32,690
And if we could not touch, then

210
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:34,861
I would draw strength
from your beauty.

211
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:36,913
And if I went blind,

212
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:40,163
then I would fill my soul
with the sound of your voice

213
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:41,980
and the contents
of your thoughts

214
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:45,041
until the last spark
of my love for you

215
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:47,883
lit the shabby darkness
of my dying mind.

216
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,551
Forget it.

217
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,381
Mr. Carter?

218
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:58,972
Mr. Bruce Carter?

219
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:00,903
What if he does
actually believe

220
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:02,443
that his doll is a real person?

221
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,900
Maybe that is his truth.
It's just different from our truth.

222
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,231
The truth ain't like puppies --

223
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:08,573
a bunch of them running around,
you pick your favorite.

224
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,023
One truth,
and it has come a-knockin'.

225
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:13,412
But let's just say he's
got his own truth,

226
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,552
and he's grown attached to it.

227
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,710
Marry that with a short
fuse and a violent temper,

228
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,360
and what you get is --

229
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,492
What do you want?

230
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,542
That crazy broad Tina
tryin' to pin this on me?

231
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,333
'Cause she came in screamin',

232
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,802
said Tony had been
foolin' around on her.

233
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:29,682
Then she leapt on
him like a cat.

234
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:31,073
It was over before it started.

235
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:32,350
The evidence backs me up.

236
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,091
Yeah. On that subject--

237
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,731
Mr. Carter,
you are a big, tough guy,

238
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,111
and I have no doubt you could
make mincemeat out of all of us

239
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:40,491
if what you needed was more mincemeat.
But the shoes by the door

240
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:43,023
and the daffodils on the table
and the smell of garlic pasta

241
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:45,803
- coming from the kitchen...
- Maybe I got a girlfriend.

242
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,641
That so hard to believe?

243
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,913
And Sheila's got
nothin' to do with this.

244
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:51,811
Yeah. Uh,
when you say "Sheila" --

245
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,403
Did Sheila witness the
murder of Tony Dinapoli?

246
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm done talkin'.

247
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:57,993
You need to leave now.

248
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:00,173
But if she saw something or
did something, we understand.

249
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,900
You're just trying to protect
her 'cause you love her.

250
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,583
It wasn't Sheila's fault, okay?

251
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,543
It was mine. Take me.

252
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,923
I never should have put
her in that situation.

253
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:16,761
It's okay. Okay.

254
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:21,593
Sheila! Sheila, baby!
You can come out.

255
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,561
- The g's up.
- It's okay.

256
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:28,601
She's probably too scared.

257
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:32,352
<i>The information Emerson
Cod gave the police</i>

258
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:36,323
<i>led to further investigation of
Tony Dinapoli's real murder</i>

259
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:39,492
<i>due to
unreal circumstances.</i>

260
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,740
<i>Tina Arongino
was released.</i>

261
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:45,581
<i>Burly Bruce Carter was detained
by local authorities,</i>

262
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,620
<i>awaiting his trial.</i>

263
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:50,793
Sheila! I love you!

264
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,881
<i>Sheila the doll
was also detained.</i>

265
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,213
<i>Olive, having been detained
by her own angry thoughts</i>

266
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,303
<i>for long enough,
had escaped</i>

267
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,011
<i>to sample
something sweeter.</i>

268
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,693
Welcome. Bitter much?

269
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:15,753
I'm sorry?

270
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:18,031
Sweets taste sweeter with
a bite of the bitter.

271
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,911
Welcome to Balsam's Bittersweets
Taffy & Sweets Emporium.

272
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:22,651
- Bitter much?
- Yes.

273
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:24,743
Actually, bitter very much.

274
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,833
Aren't you "some guy"?

275
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:30,290
You're a pie holer.
Billy Balsam, co-owner.

276
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,122
Hi.

277
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,443
I-I thought we should bring pie.
That's what new neighbors do.

278
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:37,341
So sweet. You are so sweet.

279
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:40,313
A girl could get the diabetes
just standing next to you.

280
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:42,442
Dilly, there's some other
small-business owners

281
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:45,050
- from across the street.
- Who's Dilly?

282
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:48,933
Bitter much?

283
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,292
Pie holers,
I'd like you to meet my sister

284
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,171
and the queen of candy,
Dilly Balsam.

285
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:55,030
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Dilly Balsam.

286
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,982
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Ned.

287
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,980
He's the lord of the pies.

288
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,032
Oh, of course!

289
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:05,111
That little pie place with
the quaint crust roof.

290
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:08,331
I do hope Billy apologized
for all this commotion today.

291
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,443
If by "apologized," you mean

292
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:11,813
he pretended to be
somebody he's not

293
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:13,440
so he could lure us into
your sugar shack...

294
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:14,730
Actually, I think
it's really nice

295
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:16,762
to have a bit of excitement
in the neighborhood.

296
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,390
I'm so glad you
see it that way.

297
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:21,963
Do you like excitement,
pie man?

298
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:24,510
<i>The pie maker did
not like excitement,</i>

299
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:27,340
<i>but he knew to be polite
to a new neighbor.</i>

300
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:29,940
I feel excitement is so much
better than a lot of things.

301
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:31,620
Do you know what
I find exciting?

302
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,600
Com...pe...ti...tion.

303
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:39,363
I hope you're not afraid
of a little competition.

304
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:42,113
I don't really see
us as competitors.

305
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:45,260
Is what's in that box the
amazing smell I'm smelling?

306
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:47,580
Oh, is what you're smelling
georgia peach cobbler?

307
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,143
- That's exactly it.
- Then I'm the guilty georgia peach.

308
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:52,093
It's from the pie hole,
across the street,

309
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,073
as in "shut your,"
but one sweet whiff,

310
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:56,121
and people usually
want to "open their."

311
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:57,792
That sounds delicious.
Let's go.

312
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,290
Bye.

313
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:07,592
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,800
This is for you.
Happy grand opening.

315
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,272
That was interesting.

316
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:16,231
I admire
your s-s-s-s-s-s-strategy.

317
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:17,731
Strategy?

318
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,980
Sorry. My sister stutters
when she's upset.

319
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:22,072
Why is she upset?
Why are you upset?

320
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,580
Pretty nervy bringing your
p-p-pie up in all my business,

321
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,202
stealing my c-c-c-customers.

322
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,250
Oh, I-I think this is
a misunderstanding.

323
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,340
If you want a w-w-war,
then that's what you'll get.

324
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:31,580
A war? No.

325
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,473
A war's what we don't want.
We just came by to say h-h-hello.

326
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,411
Are you making f-f-f-fun of me?

327
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:38,711
- She's eaking out-fray.
- What?

328
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:40,333
Freaking out.

329
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:44,052
You haven't seen anything.
Ame on-g-g-g-gay.

330
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:45,423
What?

331
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:46,880
- Game on.
- Game on.

332
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,130
- Game on?
- Game on! Now get out!

333
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:52,550
Out.

334
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:01,901
That should shake them up.

335
00:15:02,157 --> 00:15:05,033
I liked the stuttering.
It was off-putting and odd.

336
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,892
Amateurs.

337
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:09,021
We'll have them out of
business in a week.

338
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,173
You still think
it's a coincidence?

339
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,252
I don't think someone
purposely damaged

340
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,430
our sign to read..."pie ho."

341
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:36,470
Hello. That crazy candy
lady threatened us.

342
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,720
They're trying to steal
all of our business.

343
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:40,453
We've only had one
customer today.

344
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,202
We can't just sit
here and do nothing.

345
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:43,111
Yes, we can.

346
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:44,430
Candy might be sweet,

347
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:46,410
but it's a traveling carnival
blowing through town.

348
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,401
Pie is home.

349
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:49,070
People always come home.

350
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:51,130
Come on, Digby.
Let's bake some pies.

351
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:59,041
Why won't he do
anything about this?

352
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,433
I don't know. He's been acting
strange since yesterday.

353
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:03,333
Does he seem distant to you?

354
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:06,250
Would you like to discuss
his fear of intimacy,

355
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,772
his dark moods,
that thing he does when he's lying?

356
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:11,090
I can be a very good
resource for you on Ned,

357
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,612
if you don't mind me clawing
out your eyeballs while we talk.

358
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:14,802
Really?

359
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,862
- Why do you want me to care?
- Because you really like him.

360
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,200
Wouldn't it just rock 'n' roll

361
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:21,572
if liking someone meant
they had to like you back?

362
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,170
Of course,
that'd be a different universe,

363
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:25,310
and something else
would probably suck.

364
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:28,903
Refill?

365
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,610
This isn't really my
shade of lipstick.

366
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,811
I am going to have
to cite you for it.

367
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:37,333
Cite all you want, sweetie.

368
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:39,302
I'm standing right
here in front of you.

369
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:40,781
I don't think you understand.

370
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,921
Andrew Brown, health inspector.

371
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,342
Excuse me,
but don't you need to notify us first?

372
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,551
Not if it's a
surprise inspection.

373
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,263
Surprise!

374
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:03,100
Effective hair restraint...

375
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,310
...Not worn.

376
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:11,781
Live animal found in the
facility's food area.

377
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,793
You need to open this.

378
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,331
Wait. I can explain
what's in there.

379
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,742
No, I can't.
But you should definitely wait anyway.

380
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:28,840
It's okay.
We never use this room.

381
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,670
Yes, we do. I do -- sometimes.

382
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,381
Open the door. Please.

383
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:50,071
<i>Olive Snook was unaware</i>

384
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:51,973
<i>that the pie maker
could bring dead fruit</i>

385
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,281
<i>back to life
for his pies.</i>

386
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,952
Why is this room filled
with rotten fruit?

387
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:05,160
That inspection
was no accident.

388
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,640
We are being attacked
by a vicious nutbag.

389
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,001
We need to retaliate

390
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,340
with a swift and
overwhelming show of force.

391
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:13,352
I don't retaliate.
I'm not a retaliar.

392
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,431
You let your emotions get away

393
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:16,130
from and everything
falls apart.

394
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:17,863
You really believe that,
don't you?

395
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,141
Yes. I've seen it happen.

396
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:20,722
She's coming to get us.

397
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:22,571
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

398
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:24,150
Nobody's coming to get anybody.

399
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,561
But she is.

400
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,572
We need to talk.

401
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,490
- You're not welcome here.
- Of course she is.

402
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:40,822
All are welcome.

403
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,260
Uh, would you like a
slice of triple berry?

404
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:44,541
Oh, thank you.

405
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:46,791
You teach me something,
pie baker.

406
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,421
Olive.

407
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,842
I wanted to apologize for
my outburst yesterday.

408
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,302
- It was inappropriate.
- Thank you.

409
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,370
And I'm sorry for pretending
to be a stutterer.

410
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:03,812
You were pretending?

411
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:05,980
That's mean,
and it's disrespectful.

412
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:07,871
I like to mislead
my competition --

413
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,623
encourage underestimation
with the idea

414
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:11,231
that I have an impediment.

415
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,321
But I know that stuttering can
be a very serious disorder,

416
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,750
and I only chose to mimic it
because I'm legally blind.

417
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:17,072
She's doing it again.

418
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:19,240
- You need to leave.
- Oh, come on.

419
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:21,391
We all know that the
world of small business

420
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,163
is nothing but a big,
sexy game.

421
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,541
Call me old-fashioned,
but I like to win.

422
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,961
There are plenty of customers
for both of us, Dilly.

423
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:30,621
Why can't we both win?

424
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,472
Because I like your crust roof,

425
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,521
your square footage,
and your corner location,

426
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:36,853
even if your sign does go
on the fritz now and then.

427
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:40,510
Oh, and I was so,
so sorry to hear about your inspection.

428
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:43,300
You didn't come here to
apologize at all, did you?

429
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:47,602
No. I came by to tell you that
it's only gonna get worse.

430
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:49,511
You've shown yourself
to be vulnerable

431
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,023
and careless competitors,

432
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,032
so you can count on more
surprise inspections

433
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,902
and disruptions
to your business.

434
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,252
- Why are you doing this to us?
- What I see, I want.

435
00:19:57,285 --> 00:20:00,452
What I want, I take.
Nothing scares me.

436
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:02,682
I've looked death in
the eye and survived

437
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,581
to open a successful
candy franchise.

438
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:06,623
- Can you say that?
- Actually, yes.

439
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,750
Not the "candy franchise" part,
but --

440
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:11,141
I won't let you bully
me into a fight, Dilly.

441
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,771
- That's not how I settle things.
- Then you'll lose.

442
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:15,632
Thanks for the pie.

443
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,843
What is up with that... witch?

444
00:20:23,228 --> 00:20:25,681
<i>What was up with that
witch was this --</i>

445
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:29,431
<i>Dilania "Dilly" Balsam
and brother Billy's lives</i>

446
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:31,191
<i>were turned upside down</i>

447
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:33,523
<i>when their parents
died of bird flu.</i>

448
00:20:33,717 --> 00:20:35,441
<i>Dilly felt adrift,</i>

449
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:38,531
<i>until she resolved to
confront her greatest fear.</i>

450
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,941
<i>She set out across
Bodega bay,</i>

451
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:43,641
<i>determined to look the
killers of her parents</i>

452
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:46,833
<i>in their beady-eyed,
feathered faces.</i>

453
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,290
<i>Then, just as she was about
to reach the other side,</i>

454
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,331
<i>her worst nightmare.</i>

455
00:20:57,968 --> 00:21:01,170
<i>Dilly Balsam survived
the attack,</i>

456
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,472
<i>to be rescued by
a local merchant,</i>

457
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:06,093
<i>who offered her a
very sweet treat.</i>

458
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:08,810
<i>She realized that
her love of taffy</i>

459
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:10,600
<i>and fear of nothing</i>

460
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:12,970
<i>would serve her
well in business.</i>

461
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:17,902
<i>And Balsam's Bittersweets
Taffy & Sweets Emporium</i>

462
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:19,651
<i>was born.</i>

463
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:28,742
What?

464
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,752
You think I should
do something.

465
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:34,790
We're just saying.

466
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:35,800
No.

467
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,843
You let your anger win and
you engage the crazy person,

468
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,322
then you're no
different than they are.

469
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:41,052
People say, "Hey.

470
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:43,101
Look at that.
There's two crazy people fighting."

471
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:44,173
I will not engage.

472
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:45,690
Yeah, but if you don't engage,

473
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,402
pretty soon,
people will start saying,

474
00:21:47,435 --> 00:21:48,981
"Hey, look at that crazy person

475
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,833
eating that guy just sitting there,
doing nothing."

476
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,903
We've got to give her a
dose of her own medicine.

477
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,852
Chuck, don't go over
to the dark side.

478
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:56,652
Revenge never works.

479
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:01,782
I got to go.

480
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:04,700
Me too.

481
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,491
Well, this can't end well.

482
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:14,913
Wait!

483
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:17,471
Didn't think you'd do this.

484
00:22:17,506 --> 00:22:19,663
Thought you were all goody-good,
apple pie, and baseball.

485
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:21,773
Well, only insofar as I know
how to use a baseball bat

486
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,103
to make someone's face
look like an apple pie.

487
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:29,801
I am sorry about Ned.

488
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,802
Well, not about Ned,
but about upsetting you.

489
00:22:31,837 --> 00:22:33,283
I thought you were
okay about it.

490
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:34,520
So did I.

491
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:37,561
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

492
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,361
Here's what we're not gonna do.

493
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,201
We're not gonna start with
all this puppy-dog-face,

494
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,293
"get back on your horse
and nd a man" crapola.

495
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:48,080
'Cause maybe you forgot,
but Ned was the horse

496
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:49,392
and you pushed me off.
So maybe,

497
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:51,013
just maybe,
I need to get a little angry

498
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:52,472
before I can be
all happy about it.

499
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:53,742
Okay. I get it.

500
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:55,251
Thank you.

501
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,291
There's no alarm system.

502
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,082
- Got a credit card?
- Why?

503
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:02,932
- You know how to pick a lock?
- No.

504
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:05,142
You're gonna need to
pay for the damages.

505
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,102
- Cool.
- Come on!

506
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:18,101
Here.

507
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,313
You ready?

508
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:24,111
- For Ned.
- For Ned.

509
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:31,322
I hate rats.

510
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:34,372
So do health inspectors.

511
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,252
- We're done here.
- We're so done.

512
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:52,850
Don't mess with the pie hose.

513
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,603
<i>He cleaned for hours,</i>

514
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,670
<i>yet he could not
wipe away the fear</i>

515
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,050
<i>the battle with
Balsam's Bittersweets...</i>

516
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,942
<i>...Would only turn
more bitter.</i>

517
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:17,450
Chuck? I thought you
were Dilly Balsam.

518
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:19,990
Why are you dressed
like a cat burglar?

519
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:22,511
Why are you dressed
like a fish m***monr?

520
00:24:22,717 --> 00:24:25,141
- I'm scrubbing the kitchen.
- I was out with Olive.

521
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:26,923
You know what?
She is really great.

522
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:29,263
Chuck?

523
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:32,022
Sorry. My whole body's
pumping with adrenaline.

524
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,312
Are you upset with me?

525
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:37,471
<i>The truth he was
hiding from Chuck</i>

526
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,773
<i>was one spot he
could not scrub out.</i>

527
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:41,272
What's freaking me out is the

528
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:43,531
ruthless woman trying to
shut down the pie hole.

529
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:44,902
<i>This was true.</i>

530
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,903
- It has nothing to do with us.
<i>- This was not.</i>

531
00:24:48,535 --> 00:24:50,873
Are you sure you wouldn't
feel better if you just...

532
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,492
fought back a little?

533
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,920
Whis it so hard for you to
see that the brave thing here

534
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:56,870
is not to fight back?

535
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,852
Well, in that case,
Olive and I were cowards tonight.

536
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:02,270
We may have set loose some
inappropriate vermin.

537
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,461
Where are you going?

538
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:09,213
To clean up another mess.

539
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:10,712
Ned.

540
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:12,342
Ned?

541
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,970
<i>The expression "like a
rat in a candy store,"</i>

542
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:21,181
<i>though slightly less popular,
is equally true.</i>

543
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:31,241
<i>As Ned came to try to undo what
Chuck and Olive had done,</i>

544
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:33,462
<i>he found not
fighting the fight</i>

545
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:35,990
<i>was becoming more work
than fighting it.</i>

546
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:37,281
Gross.

547
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:00,971
Not good.

548
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:07,350
Billy?

549
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:11,532
Billy, were you dead?

550
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,320
Oh! Wait.

551
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:18,820
Freeze!

552
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:20,991
You killed my brother!

553
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:27,800
Chuck, this place is
crawling with police.

554
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:29,041
You could be recognized.

555
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:30,263
She shouldn't be here.

556
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,893
I've been saying
that for weeks.

557
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:33,623
I had to come.
This is all my fault.

558
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:35,071
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is --

559
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:37,272
if I'd have listened to you when
you told me not to retaliate,

560
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:38,770
you wouldn't have to
clean up all my mess.

561
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,271
- I did a terrible thing.
- Okay.

562
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,151
- So it's a little your fault.
- Well, maybe now you're even.

563
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:44,531
- What do you mean "even"?
- Nothing.

564
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:46,032
What happened at
the candy shop?

565
00:26:46,068 --> 00:26:47,952
I was collecting the rats,
and I was about to leave,

566
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,700
when I saw Billy dead
in the taffy vat.

567
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:50,810
Did you...

568
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:52,361
Yeah.

569
00:26:52,657 --> 00:26:55,543
But he couldn't talk on account
of his mouth was full of taffy.

570
00:26:55,578 --> 00:26:58,110
I heard the police, and I...
him again.

571
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,242
They caught me red-handed.

572
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,542
Well, me and Nancy
Shrew will get you out.

573
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:14,513
I mean, it's a broad generalization,
but my guess is,

574
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,733
an attractive man who
makes pies for a living

575
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:19,461
shouldn't even spend a short
amount of time in prison.

576
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:23,222
<i>Without the pie maker and
with little to go on,</i>

577
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:26,850
<i>Emerson Cod and Chuck set
out to seek the truth.</i>

578
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:31,690
- You gonna... do something?
- I am doing something.

579
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,362
- But we can't wake him up.
- I know that.

580
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,092
- Don't you think I know that?
- I'm just saying.

581
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:40,962
It's been a while since you
solved a crime for real --

582
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:43,241
You know,
the old-fashioned way.

583
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,452
I did fine the
old-fashioned way,

584
00:27:45,506 --> 00:27:47,732
and I'd do fine now if I
could just think without you

585
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,412
blabber-jabbering.

586
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,651
This what you do when
you're in here --

587
00:27:53,685 --> 00:27:55,833
muttering with the bodies?
Bicker and moan?

588
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,720
We were just observing
the body for any, uh...

589
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:01,180
visible signs.

590
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:03,310
- I like my way better.
- What's that?

591
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,062
Cutting the sucker open.

592
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:06,893
I got to do an autopsy.

593
00:28:07,528 --> 00:28:09,640
Oh, good.
You two check under the hood.

594
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:12,043
I'm gonna do a full background
check on Billy Balsam,

595
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:15,570
see if anybody else wanted to put
him in a permanent candy coma.

596
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,452
Olive...

597
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:22,451
Olive?

598
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,332
Olive, it's okay.

599
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:33,002
- I brought you a pie.
- Thank you.

600
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:35,963
It has a special filling.

601
00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:45,552
Please take that away.

602
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:52,901
<i>As Olive considered how
the inch-thick glass</i>

603
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:55,502
<i>prevented her from holding
the man she still loved,</i>

604
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:57,681
<i>she realized that
for the pie maker,</i>

605
00:28:57,706 --> 00:29:01,362
<i>there might always be an
invisible barrier between them.</i>

606
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,030
No known enemies?

607
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:05,453
Well, that's not good.

608
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,212
You're never gonna believe
what we saw at the au--

609
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,041
- How did you know?
- Got it.

610
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:12,623
- How'd I know what?
- About the finger.

611
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:14,222
Oh, I learned it early on.

612
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:15,712
See, it's sort of the universal

613
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:17,740
"Hush up,
I'm on the damn phone" symbol.

614
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:19,210
Oh, well, it must also be

615
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,073
the "Billy Balsam bit
off his killer's finger,

616
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:23,193
'cause we found it in his
stomach at the autopsy" symbol.

617
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:24,600
A real finger?

618
00:29:24,688 --> 00:29:26,832
Good -- all we got to do is
lift a print off that finger

619
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,050
and match it to who done it and
get our boy out the slammer.

620
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,350
There's no fingerprint.
The gastric acid in his stomach ate away

621
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:33,070
at the skin,
erased any trace of a print.

622
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,851
Police say the ail's gone cold.

623
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:37,521
So whoever killed Billy is
walking around with nine fingers,

624
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:39,093
thinking they got
away with murder.

625
00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:40,532
Footloose and finger-free.

626
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,953
<i>The pie maker
considered how not</i>

627
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:46,261
<i>telling Chuck the
truth about her father</i>

628
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:48,640
<i>was a lot like being
locked in a prison.</i>

629
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,521
<i>Then he considered how
being locked in a prison</i>

630
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:55,920
<i>was actually much worse than some
silly metaphor about truth.</i>

631
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:59,210
Hey, baker boy.
You got a new roommate.

632
00:30:01,478 --> 00:30:03,003
Burly Bruce?

633
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:05,340
Aren't you the guy
who got me locked up?!

634
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:07,042
<i>The pie maker
was surprised,</i>

635
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:10,351
<i>that here, perhaps 30 seconds
from his own violent death,</i>

636
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,563
<i>there were no
grand revelations,</i>

637
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:15,061
<i>but rather only one
simple thought.</i>

638
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,153
- Chuck.
- It is you.

639
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:20,522
<i>But it was the thought
that saved his life.</i>

640
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,411
You know, you never told me
how you met your girlfriend.

641
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:25,531
Sheila, right?

642
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:28,951
It's a funny story.

643
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:31,162
We met carpooling.

644
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:34,081
I was tired of being stuck
in traffic all the time.

645
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:36,550
Rule is, you need two or
more for the diamond lane,

646
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,170
so I answered a personal
ad in a magazine.

647
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:42,383
Next thing I know,
she's at my door.

648
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:45,471
Now, the first few weeks,
we commuted together every day.

649
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:47,683
She never said much.

650
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:50,222
Then one night,
I'm fixing dinner at my place,

651
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:52,812
and I think,
"I wonder what she's doing."

652
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:54,981
So I invite her over.
What the hell?

653
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:56,771
I did it as a friend, you know?

654
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,812
- You know how that is.
- Uh, yeah.

655
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:00,582
Something happened
at that dinner.

656
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:01,943
I don't know what it was.

657
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,191
The magic of romance, right?

658
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:06,452
But there was
definitely a spark.

659
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:08,572
We had so much in common.

660
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:10,662
We talked for hours.

661
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,011
One thing led to another,
and before you know it,

662
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:14,691
she was basically
living with me.

663
00:31:14,796 --> 00:31:16,250
I love her so much.

664
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:18,223
That's why I took
the fall for her.

665
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:19,573
I know you love Sheila, Bruce,

666
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:21,502
but maybe this is a
chance to move on,

667
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,460
find someone... full of life.

668
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:26,420
No. Sheila's my girlfriend.

669
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:29,590
I don't care if they don't
parole me for 80 years.

670
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:31,470
I'll find her again.

671
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:33,573
<i>The truth could
knock all it wanted,</i>

672
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:36,351
<i>but burly Bruce would
never open the door.</i>

673
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:38,733
<i>And maybe that
was for the best.</i>

674
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,162
I'm sure Sheila will
still be there, Bruce,

675
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:42,730
waiting for you.

676
00:31:45,577 --> 00:31:47,533
<i>17 miles away,</i>

677
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,952
<i>the search to finger
the fingerless killer</i>

678
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,410
<i>of Billy
Balsam continued.</i>

679
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,632
No missing-digit
emergencies reported

680
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:57,963
at any of the local
hospitals last night.

681
00:31:58,165 --> 00:31:59,971
Maybe the killer didn't
realize they lost a finger,

682
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:02,101
so they never reported
it to the hospital.

683
00:32:02,176 --> 00:32:04,022
That would narrow
our list of suspects

684
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:05,882
down to only insanely
stupid people.

685
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,051
Some amputees have
phantom limbs.

686
00:32:08,107 --> 00:32:09,950
They think the severed
body part is still there,

687
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:11,550
even when it's not. It's like a

688
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:13,300
psychological
protection mechanism

689
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:14,842
to save them from the trauma.

690
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:18,431
We need to go back
to Bittersweets.

691
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:20,922
We need to get into
the scene of the crime.

692
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:23,061
How are we gonna
get past Dilly?

693
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:27,731
Hi ya.

694
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:30,820
You got a lot of spunk
coming back here.

695
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,530
I'm surprised you're here.

696
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,912
Yeah, well,
it's what Billy would want.

697
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:37,541
Can I talk to you for
a second in private?

698
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:41,500
What are you doing?

699
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:45,593
I mean outside
private-- outside.

700
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,303
I know this has been
so hard for you,

701
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,512
and I feel your pain. It's --

702
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:52,843
death is the worst.

703
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,981
This dude bit off
somebody's finger

704
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:05,311
and was found faceup
in this taffy.

705
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:07,520
Which means...

706
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:09,863
He probably wasn't
attacked from behind.

707
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:11,241
Right.

708
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:13,280
So there must have
been a struggle.

709
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,743
I'd say more like
a full-on brawl.

710
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,240
This table was moved.

711
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:25,581
Wrong kitchen.

712
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:27,722
You know,
marble's a very interesting stone.

713
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,713
It's resistant to grease and oils,
which leave stains.

714
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:33,111
So, if it's not cleaned
properly and right away

715
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,941
and someone were to put
their hand on it, say, um...

716
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,433
In the heat of a scuffle...

717
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,572
Then the oils on
their hands should...

718
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:45,101
...Leave imprints
on the surface.

719
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:55,112
- Two hands.
- Nine fingerprints.

720
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:58,412
One taffy-drowning murderer.

721
00:33:58,628 --> 00:33:59,772
I just want you to know

722
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:01,722
that even though we got
off on the wrong foot,

723
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:04,300
we are still your neighbors,
and we are here for you.

724
00:34:04,338 --> 00:34:05,840
And I realize we may
not be able to smile

725
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,573
and wave at each
other for a while

726
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:09,351
because of events
that have occurred.

727
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:10,552
Yeah, I broke your sign

728
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:12,560
and called the city
health inspector hotline,

729
00:34:12,598 --> 00:34:14,592
and you all killed my brother.

730
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:17,762
So we agree to
disagree on that.

731
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:25,571
Do you want proof?
Do you want me to show you

732
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,531
something that proves exactly
what happened to Billy?

733
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,861
Let me show you.

734
00:34:32,448 --> 00:34:35,030
- What? It's an empty car trunk.
- No, it's not.

735
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,701
Oh, crap!

736
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:42,912
Help! Help!

737
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:49,883
Her hands--
she's wearing mittens.

738
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:52,091
Put the gun down, lady.

739
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:54,690
The pie-making murderer
couldn't finish the job,

740
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:57,021
so he sent his girlfriend and
the muscle to finish me off?

741
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:59,053
Ned didn't kill anyone,
and you know it.

742
00:34:59,185 --> 00:35:01,073
We're just trying to
find out the truth.

743
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:03,751
The only truth you need to
know is I miss my brother.

744
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:13,230
- You got 10 fingers.
- You're not the killer.

745
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:15,791
And I don't think you
want to be one, either.

746
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:18,022
Let us take the evidence
to the authorities.

747
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,413
We'll find out who really
killed your brother.

748
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:28,123
All right. You can go.

749
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:32,942
If you can put whoever killed
my brother behind bars,

750
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:34,422
I will be happy.

751
00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:36,222
I thought I wanted revenge,

752
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:39,593
but all I really need
is j-j-j-justice.

753
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:44,813
- Did she just stutter?
- Yep.

754
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:49,101
And take your trunk
monkey with you.

755
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:51,941
<i>The facts were these--</i>

756
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,532
<i>After Olive was freed from
Dilly Balsam's trunk...</i>

757
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,242
Stinks in there.

758
00:35:57,576 --> 00:36:00,332
<i>...The authorities explained
that the time it would take</i>

759
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,362
<i>for the dismembered
digit to pass</i>

760
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:05,470
<i>through the digestive system
of Billy Balsam and have</i>

761
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:08,592
<i>its fingerprints erased by the
acid contained in the stomach</i>

762
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,042
<i>put the time of death
of one Billy Balsam</i>

763
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:14,171
<i>hours earlier than the
time the pie maker</i>

764
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,591
<i>was found hovering
over the body.</i>

765
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:19,493
<i>Fingerprint analysis of
the sheet of candy fruit</i>

766
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,850
<i>exposed the nine-fingered
culprit to be none other than...</i>

767
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:26,521
<i>Andrew Brown,
health inspector,</i>

768
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,573
<i>whom, it was revealed upon
further investigation,</i>

769
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:32,983
<i>had been blackmailing
Dilly and Billy Balsam.</i>

770
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:36,693
<i>Having paid off the inspector to
conduct a surprise inspection</i>

771
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:39,532
<i>that led to the pie hole's
temporary shutdown,</i>

772
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:42,453
<i>brown had demanded a bribe,
lest he reveal</i>

773
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:46,083
<i>Billy and Dilly's dastardly
deed and shut them down, too.</i>

774
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:50,330
<i>Unwilling to be bullied,
Billy Balsam balked.</i>

775
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:00,650
<i>Health inspector Andrew
Brown is now believed to be</i>

776
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,701
<i>the number-one suspect in the
murder of Balsam's Bittersweets</i>

777
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:06,563
<i>Taffy & Sweets emporium
co-owner Billy Balsam.</i>

778
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:10,032
<i>Thanks to the work of private
investigator Emerson Cod,</i>

779
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:13,130
<i>the owner of the local pie hole
has been cleared of all charges</i>

780
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:14,660
<i>and released from jail.</i>

781
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:17,042
<i>Authorities are conducting an
extensive search for Andrew Brown,</i>

782
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:18,782
<i>who remains at large.</i>

783
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:21,821
<i>Up next, can apes drive?
We'll find out.</i>

784
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,573
Dead girl walking.

785
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:27,781
Walking right toward me.

786
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,540
Are you okay?

787
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,660
Sure. I mean, I am now.

788
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,330
Ned.

789
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:37,870
- That hug goes double for me.
- Oh, double. Double hug.

790
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:41,630
- Olive.
- What?

791
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,681
Come on.

792
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,732
Doing this work without you...

793
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:59,613
Well, it actually
ends up meaning

794
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,440
I'm doing a whole lot of work.

795
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:04,491
Not that I can't do it,
'cause I can.

796
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:08,623
- I just don't like it.
- Glad to be back.

797
00:38:09,545 --> 00:38:11,623
It's not all that bad in jail.

798
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,963
I had a lot of time to think,
and I came to a decision.

799
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:17,683
Everyone talks about how
the truth will set you free,

800
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:20,022
but burly Bruce was free to
love someone 'cause he was

801
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:22,643
so good at lying to himself
about that doll being real.

802
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,261
Which is to say...

803
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,011
"Go, lying."

804
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:29,471
Or at least "Yay to
not telling the truth."

805
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:36,101
I'm not gonna tell
Chuck about her dad.

806
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,813
I just heard that as though
it came out of my own mouth.

807
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:43,690
- Oh, wait. It did.
- Well, you were right.

808
00:38:44,077 --> 00:38:46,282
- Good night.
- Good night.

809
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,331
Welcome home.

810
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:57,043
<i>Safely home and cleared of
having committed any crime,</i>

811
00:38:57,426 --> 00:39:01,173
<i>the pie maker enjoyed a
celebratory piece of pie</i>

812
00:39:01,228 --> 00:39:03,050
<i>and went up to bed.</i>

813
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:21,322
- Olive.
- Fredo.

814
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,653
I knew it was you.

815
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:49,763
<i>Sometimes, a
crime of passion</i>

816
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,470
<i>is not realizing the
passion in time,</i>

817
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:56,602
<i>while other times, the crime is
not seeing the world as it is.</i>

818
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:03,863
<i>But most crimes of passion
are actually a crime.</i>

819
00:40:17,006 --> 00:40:21,172
So, people can actually feel
their limbs after they're gone.

820
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:23,751
It's weird,
but I kind of like it.

821
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,341
I know. Me too.

822
00:40:28,057 --> 00:40:31,181
When I was in jail,
I think you were my phantom limb.

823
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:35,391
- I was?
- You were.

824
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:37,972
It felt like you were
with me the whole time.

825
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,401
I'm so glad you're back.

826
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:45,863
<i>The pie maker
had never felt</i>

827
00:40:45,908 --> 00:40:48,951
<i>closer to another person
as he did at that moment.</i>

828
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:51,950
<i>He felt a rush of
emotion overcome him...</i>

829
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,570
Chuck.

830
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,082
<i>...Causing one
crime of passion</i>

831
00:40:56,118 --> 00:40:59,410
<i>that came in the form
of a confession.</i>

832
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:01,253
I killed your dad.

833
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:08,253
