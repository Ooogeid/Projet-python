Pushing Daisies - Season 02 Episode 06
<i>"Oh Oh Oh... It's Magic!"</i>

00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,643
Subtitle (DOT v.1.00): <i>A²S Team</i>
--==All-about-Subs.fr==--

3
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:10,725
<i>At this very moment
in the town of Coeur d'Coeurs,</i>

4
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:12,771
<i>young Ned believed in magic.</i>

5
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:16,298
<i>It was not the magic
that sparked from his fingertip</i>

6
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:18,676
<i>when he touched
a dead thing alive again.</i>

7
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:22,033
<i>That particular magic
had not yet been discovered.</i>

8
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:25,548
<i>This was the magic
of a father's love.</i>

9
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,252
<i>Young Ned would discover
this magic was not magic at all.</i>

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,670
Alakazam!

11
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:35,543
<i>It was just a trick.</i>

12
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:39,427
<i>After Ned's mother died,
his father performed another trick...</i>

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,127
<i>a cruel disappearing act.</i>

14
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:43,804
I'll be back.

15
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:46,794
<i>And when his father never came back,</i>

16
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,706
<i>Ned stopped believing in magic.</i>

17
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:53,468
<i>Young Ned discovered his father
would one day perform</i>

18
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:55,739
<i>his sleights of hand
and misdirections</i>

19
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:58,731
<i>for a younger,
more impressionable audience,</i>

20
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:01,072
<i>a new family
that did not include Ned,</i>

21
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:04,826
<i>but did include his half-brothers,
Maurice and Ralston.</i>

22
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:09,619
<i>Maurice and Ralston loved their father
and delighted in his magical tricks</i>

23
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,438
<i>and insisted on learning
every one of them.</i>

24
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:18,082
<i>But there was one magic trick
their father never taught them</i>

25
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,162
<i>and would only show them once...</i>

26
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,527
<i>a cruel disappearing act.</i>

27
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,631
<i>It's 19 years, 42 weeks,</i>

28
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:28,603
<i>6 days, 13 hours,
and 7 minutes later.</i>

29
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:33,098
<i>Maurice and Ralston have become
the illusionist duo "Two for the Show."</i>

30
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,608
<i>The mercurial world of magic
and its associations</i>

31
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,902
<i>had another effect
on half-brother Ned,</i>

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,935
<i>who could wake the dead...</i>

33
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:43,031
- Magicians?
- Illusionists.

34
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,030
<i>At the mere mention of magic,</i>

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,347
<i>he experienced the sting
of anxiety-induced acid reflux.</i>

36
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:50,997
Who doesn't like magic?

37
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:53,303
I love magic...

38
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,826
as much as I love other forms
of popular entertainment,

39
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:59,226
like boxarate tae-kill-do cage-fighting
or monster trucks on ice.

40
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:01,528
To certain factions
of the god-fearing public,

41
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:03,718
magic is the devil's work,
you little devils.

42
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,332
Magically delicious little devils.

43
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:08,892
Oh, I thought you were...

44
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:10,826
magically delicious little devils.

45
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:13,303
Like a confection.

46
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:16,388
Inside one of these pies is a prize.

47
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,858
But which one?
This pie? That pie?

48
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:20,179
Pick a pie, any pie.

49
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:21,319
That one! That one!

50
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:28,076
You just magically
julienned the cherries.

51
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:29,519
But wait, there's more.

52
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:32,956
- Oh! A magic show!
- Oh! A magic show!

53
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:34,249
A magic show?!

54
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:37,126
Where did I put
that rat's ass I could give?

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,463
Magic ain't nothing
but a voodoo grift.

56
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,464
Magic is as magical
as you want it to be.

57
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:44,133
He magically put
those tickets in that pie.

58
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,072
If by "magically", you mean

59
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:48,820
"made you look that way so you wouldn't
see what they were doing this way",

60
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,307
then, yes, those tickets
alakazammed their way

61
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,791
right underneath
that delicious, flaky crust.

62
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:56,941
Or Hocus pulled the damn tickets
out of his pocket

63
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,190
and Pocus slid them
under the pie pan,

64
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,468
as evidenced by the cherry-rhubarb
crumble on his sleeve.

65
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,322
We're performing after the second
performance of the Great Herrmann.

66
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:09,152
He's the big, muckety-muck patriarch
of the <i>Conjurer's Castle</i>,

67
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:10,676
and to us, too.

68
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,203
After dad had to leave...

69
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:14,372
- "Had to leave"?
- Why else would he have left?

70
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:18,126
After dad had to leave,
Herrmann was the next best thing.

71
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,421
Another magic dad.

72
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:23,882
We'll introduce you after the show,
if you come to the show.

73
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,492
- Will you come , big brother?
- Big half-brother,

74
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:30,889
once removed by the fact that you
didn't know I existed until last week.

75
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:34,265
I'd like to RSVP
in the resoundingly affirmative.

76
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:36,201
I thought you said
magic was a voodoo grift.

77
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:37,644
It is a voodoo grift.

78
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:40,730
But exposing these two
and their fairy-dust deceptions

79
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:44,736
will only hone my PI skills, much like
a brainteaser or "Where's Waldo?".

80
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:46,571
You're not invited
if you're gonna heckle.

81
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:47,739
But shazam...

82
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,862
I have a ticket.

83
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:52,076
I'll be there, front and center,
loud and applauding,

84
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:54,704
snapping like a beatnik or praising
the lord, whatever you'd like.

85
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,623
Loud and applauding!
Loud and applauding!

86
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:59,626
And preferably amazed.
What do you say, <i>frère</i> pie maker?

87
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:03,338
Look! There's a ticket
with your name on it.

88
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:24,278
You barely said a word to them.

89
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:26,281
I barely know them.
I saw them once when I was 9,

90
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:29,364
and they were just those little bastards
my father was cheating on me with.

91
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,561
Those little bastards
are now your little brothers.

92
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:35,244
You can't just flash some jazz hands
and then abracadabra... brotherly love.

93
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:37,304
What he said.
There should be a grace period,

94
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:40,301
then a getting-to-know-you period,
then a dinner on a national holiday.

95
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:42,985
I invite them to the pie hole,
and suddenly it's,

96
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,130
"<i>frère</i> pie maker, come to our show."

97
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,654
- It's a magic show.
- What do you got against a magic show?

98
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:51,594
There's sequins and drama
and the promise of bloodshed.

99
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,846
Next to pageants,
they're my favorite thing.

100
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,182
- They give me acid reflux.
- Oh, here.

101
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,517
Suck a lozenge.

102
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:00,877
A lozenge that'll make me forget
they're putting on a magic show,

103
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:03,345
the kind of show my dad put on,
so what they're pulling out

104
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,102
of their magic hats isn't a rabbit,
it's my childhood trauma.

105
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:08,486
They're wearing it like a cape
and taking it to the stage.

106
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:15,258
I was just about to tell y'all
to shut the hell up,

107
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:17,263
and then you stopped talking
so I didn't have to.

108
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:19,765
Maurice and Ralston are the family
that you didn't know you had.

109
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:23,085
If I could talk to my aunt Lily
as the mother I didn't know I had...

110
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,044
Oh, I'd have a sea of questions.

111
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:27,773
Don't you have a sea of questions?

112
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,641
There may be a pond.

113
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:31,361
Then dive in.

114
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,761
I'm not a diver,
I'm a cautious swimmer.

115
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,016
I test the water with my big toe
and then gently wade into the shallows.

116
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:42,837
<i>While the pie maker insisted on wading
into the shallows of brotherly love,</i>

117
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:47,469
<i>Chuck insisted on diving into the depths
of a recent and strange revelation.</i>

118
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,975
<i>Her aunt Lily was,
in fact, her mother Lily.</i>

119
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:56,583
<i>Not satisfied hearing
such life-altering news secondhand,</i>

120
00:05:56,884 --> 00:06:00,883
<i>Chuck wanted to hear the words
directly from her mother's lips.</i>

121
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:02,507
Hello?

122
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:05,752
<i>Oh, hello,
I'm from </i>Livelong Day Life Insurance.

123
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:10,477
Now, we have an amazing mother's day
offer for women who have given birth.

124
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,174
Now, may I ask,
do you qualify for...

125
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:18,014
<i>Our November cheese
is rubbed with paprika.</i>

126
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:20,867
It is particularly appealing to...

127
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:23,343
the woman who has had a <i>bébé</i>?

128
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:26,173
Have you ever had a <i>bébé</i>?

129
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,704
You've been randomly selected to receive
your very own psychic reading.

130
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:33,219
Hello?

131
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:36,959
Oh, no.

132
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:38,993
Here comes another magic dad.

133
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,454
Is that the Great Herrmann?

134
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,414
Maybe he could be your magic dad,
too.

135
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,204
Already had a magic dad.
It didn't work out.

136
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,294
I need another lozenge.

137
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:57,428
Lozenge isn't working.
Stomach acid's rising...

138
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,806
As well as
other contents of stomach.

139
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,182
Are you the pie maker?

140
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,142
I'm a pie maker.

141
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,146
Hello!
Excuse me, excuse me.

142
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,385
I feel I should hug you.
Can I give you a big hug?

143
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:10,733
I'm already hugging
and there's nothing you can do about it.

144
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:11,859
I want a hug!

145
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,448
I'm not made of hugs.

146
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:16,587
Maurice and Ralston
can't stop gushing.

147
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:18,856
I'm so grateful
that you came into their lives.

148
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:21,915
Perhaps you can take some heat off me.
The boys are rather needy.

149
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:23,596
We'll talk about it later.

150
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:25,957
Pretty girl, pretty girl, and you...

151
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:30,273
I sense you're a great investigator
of things unsolved...

152
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,755
named after a poet and a fish.

153
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,859
I sense you better give me my wallet
'fore I make my foot disappear up...

154
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,386
The boys tell me you're a heckler.

155
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,094
We don't play that way
at the <i>Conjurer's Castle</i>,

156
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:43,498
so let's nip that in the bud,
shall we?

157
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:46,769
And how do you propose nip, Herman?

158
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,408
It's Herrmann.

159
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:50,452
And this is how we nip.

160
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,469
Ever had your breath taken,
Emerson Cod?

161
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:57,933
Leached from your lungs by a cement mass
crushing you in a deadly embrace?

162
00:07:58,774 --> 00:07:59,524
No.

163
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:03,510
In just moments, I will be contorting
my shackled body into this box,

164
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:07,532
which will then be filled with
quick and hard brand quick-set cement

165
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,160
and then welded shut.

166
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:11,663
Demented and cemented,

167
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:13,648
I give you "Cementia"!

168
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:18,566
If my shackles are secure, Mr. Cod,
then kindly return to the audience.

169
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,653
Applause for Emerson Cod!

170
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:28,022
Now you see me...

171
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:49,749
It was no accident
I chose you to volunteer.

172
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,487
I require your keen eye

173
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:53,911
in investigation of things
in a personal matter.

174
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:55,838
Someone has been killing
my assistants.

175
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:59,540
I invite you tonight
to solve their murders.

176
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,719
I live to amaze another day!

177
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:07,900
<i>But not another day after that.</i>

178
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,298
Her name was Alice.

179
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:15,971
Tonight would've been
our 200th performance together.

180
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,693
I found her just like this...

181
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,724
except over there.

182
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,697
You turned your assistant
into a bunny?

183
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,230
My assistant
has always been a bunny.

184
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,036
I just wanted to see
if he knew that.

185
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:29,178
Alice was murdered like the others.

186
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:33,533
Fred and Ginger were impaled
when a rigging in my coat misfired.

187
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:37,556
They would fly out of my pockets
in a puff of glitter and birdseed

188
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:40,216
as I strummed
a chirping slide guitar.

189
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:43,237
And Mercury, sweet Mercury.

190
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,555
Mercury loved performing
with balloons and children.

191
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,683
That's when he was happiest of all.

192
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:50,309
And now he's dead,

193
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,710
bludgeoned by a falling sandbag.

194
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:54,713
Who would want to kill
all your animals?

195
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:59,610
While we can appreciate and sympathize
with your predicament, Mr Herrmann...

196
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:01,028
Please, call me Great.

197
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:02,021
No.

198
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,657
We're private detectives,
not pet detectives.

199
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:07,134
It would sully my reputation
as an expert in the field

200
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:08,735
if I were to take to investigating

201
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:11,664
missing "puddy tats"
or dead "bunny wabbits".

202
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,833
I want to help missing
puddies and dead bunnies.

203
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,170
I'm curious... Do pet detectives
get paid more than the other kind?

204
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:20,595
Pet detectives get paid
a whole lot more,

205
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,607
so you need to get to prestidigitating
a little more green

206
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:25,052
if you want to get serious.

207
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,268
- Blow on my hands.
- Man, give me my damn money.

208
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:39,817
Now, if you'll excuse me,

209
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,902
the county bridge and tunnel folk
have arrived

210
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:43,174
for the 9:00.

211
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:46,449
Great?

212
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:48,535
I never got to ask...

213
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,120
How exactly do you know
Maurice and Ralston?

214
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:54,415
I was there when their father left...
Your father left.

215
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,248
I had real good seats to that show.

216
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,553
I was the dress rehearsal.
The show sucked then.

217
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,042
What do you tell
a couple of kids you've never met

218
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:04,135
that their dad, who you've never met,
has just dropped 'em like they were hot?

219
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,749
You can't sugarcoat that turd.

220
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:07,887
No, not effectively.
What did you tell them?

221
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,180
What they wanted to hear.

222
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,100
That their dad was an important man
with important-man matters to attend to.

223
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:17,372
Blah, blah, blah.
Please stop crying. Blah.

224
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:21,132
Did their da...
my dad say anything to you?

225
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:24,292
What was he gonna say?
"Hey, the boys'll be hungry in an hour"?

226
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:27,914
He was ditching the kids at
a Sunday matinée, for christmas' sake.

227
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,076
Thanks for looking out for them.

228
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:32,451
Didn't have any other choice.

229
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:34,832
Every day after school,
they'd pop by,

230
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,125
looking to be taught some new magic
trick or play with my monkey.

231
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:39,794
Heed this warning...

232
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:43,297
Establish very clear
boundaries early and often.

233
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:45,598
I guess they just needed a father.

234
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:47,102
Son...

235
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:50,529
Ever feed a stray pussycat?
It was like that.

236
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,958
You love the pussycat,
and I do love those boys,

237
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:57,276
but that plate of tasty paté
with the tuna sauce was not a promise.

238
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:03,399
<i>It was the promise of sisterly devotion
that concerned Lily.</i>

239
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,231
<i>30 years, 9 months ago,
Lily broke that promise</i>

240
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,781
<i>when she was impregnated
by her sister Vivian's fiancé.</i>

241
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:13,354
<i>Lily lived in fear that one day</i>

242
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:16,753
<i>Vivian would discover her betrayal
and settle her hash,</i>

243
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:20,690
<i>and today that hash-settling day
has come one day closer.</i>

244
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:26,882
Who the hell are you?

245
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:29,847
<i>"Who the hell he was"
was Dwight Dixon.</i>

246
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:33,661
<i>In his youth, Dwight Dixon
brandished the blue beret</i>

247
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:35,913
<i>of the United Nations Peacekeepers.</i>

248
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:39,394
<i>Together with Chuck's father
and the pie maker's father,</i>

249
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,998
<i>Dwight performed tasks
of peace enforcement</i>

250
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:46,189
<i>and, in the process, learned many things
about his brothers in arms...</i>

251
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,709
<i>Some things
Lily would rather he not know.</i>

252
00:12:50,457 --> 00:12:52,025
Charles kept a picture of you.

253
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,758
You were a mermaid sitting
in the cradle of a giant fishhook

254
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:57,971
with a clamshell brassiere and...

255
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,791
the tail of a mackerel.

256
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,702
I don't think
we were ever mackerels.

257
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:04,294
Oh, you were always a mackerel.

258
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:05,969
Whenever I saw that picture,
I'd say...

259
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:07,089
"Holy mackerel."

260
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,215
I heard that one coming
from around the corner.

261
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,881
It was wearing tap shoes.

262
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:14,155
Charles never told me
you were witty!

263
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:17,360
It's probably the only thing
he never told me about you.

264
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,913
Boy, did he talk...

265
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,426
about you...

266
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:23,973
when he wasn't talking about this one,
which was 99.9% of the time.

267
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,615
I'm quite the conversation piece.

268
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:30,354
When you opened that door,
I got a "Rock 'em sock 'em robot"

269
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,572
pow to the chin.

270
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,742
Now I know why Charles
always regretted

271
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:37,286
letting another woman
come between the two of you.

272
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,288
He broke my heart.

273
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:42,958
Charles broke a lot of hearts,
but he only got his broken once.

274
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:45,461
Knocked him for a doozy, too.

275
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:47,255
Do you have a point to this visit,

276
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,697
or did you just stop by
for snorts and giggles?

277
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,117
The snorts and giggles
are the raisins in my oatmeal.

278
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:56,013
No, I'm here for something...
a common brass pocket watch.

279
00:13:56,316 --> 00:14:00,799
It belonged to Charles, hence it had
a "CC" engraved on the back.

280
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:03,998
It looked a lot like this one,
which is mine, hence the "DD".

281
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,880
We got 'em when we were
in service together.

282
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,149
I don't recall a watch.

283
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:10,262
- Vivian, maybe...
- She doesn't recall, either.

284
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:11,042
Well,

285
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,366
pocket watch or no pocket watch, I think
I can tell when it's time for me to go.

286
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:19,228
- I'll get your coat.
- Thank you.

287
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:23,951
I'm not gonna say anything to Vivian
about what you did to her.

288
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:25,431
That would be cruel.

289
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,842
Not as cruel as what you did, but
no need to quantify your sister's pain.

290
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,798
Hey, don't come for me, fella.
I fight dirty.

291
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:32,267
I don't want to fight.

292
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,552
I need to change
your perception of me.

293
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,814
Let's sit down and tear a pheasant
together... you, me, and your sister.

294
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,443
If I ever see you again,
it won't be pheasant I'll be tearing.

295
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:44,116
Tabasco.
You sure are a spicy cocktail.

296
00:14:45,555 --> 00:14:49,886
<i>While Lily was giving Dwight
the stink-eye with the only eye she had,</i>

297
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:54,388
<i>her sister, Vivian, had set her eyes
on something much sweeter,</i>

298
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:58,515
<i>a confection she hadn't tasted
in quite some time...</i>

299
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:01,181
<i>A date.</i>

300
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:08,711
<i>As the Great Herrmann
took to the stage</i>

301
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,573
<i>for his second performance
of the night...</i>

302
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:12,289
Now you see me...

303
00:15:17,446 --> 00:15:20,118
<i>A murder investigation
was being performed</i>

304
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:22,766
<i>under the proscenium arch
of his dressing room.</i>

305
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:23,976
Poor Mercury.

306
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,689
- I wish you could tell who did you in.
- He's a monkey.

307
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:31,942
Barring and evolutionary leaps
yet unheard of, the monkey can't talk.

308
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:34,695
Well, he's also dead,
which is why he really can't talk.

309
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:36,889
- That's true, too.
- Alice can talk.

310
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,496
She's got burns on her lips
and ulcers on her tongue.

311
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:41,467
She's telling us that
she was poisoned.

312
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:43,925
We got a monkey
flattened by a sandbag.

313
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:46,415
Means the killer knows
their way around backstage.

314
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:50,386
We've got two doves impaled by bad taste
and a malfunctioning coat gag.

315
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,588
Killer knows
how the Great Herrmann's tricks work.

316
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:55,341
I think Alice ate the lettuce off
the Great Herrmann's BLT.

317
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,634
Killer knows how to make a sandwich.

318
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,687
The lettuce was supposed to stay
on the sandwich

319
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:01,430
and be eaten by the Great Herrmann.

320
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,184
The falling sandbag, the rigged jacket.
Killer wasn't trying to kill animals.

321
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:07,478
Killer was trying to kill
the Great Herrmann.

322
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:16,713
He didn't get out!

323
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,829
He didn't get out!

324
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:28,582
Isn't it funny how easy it is to remain
calm when everyone else is freaking out?

325
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:36,933
<i>Sadly, the Great Herrmann had failed
to escape his great escape.</i>

326
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:40,749
<i>His untimely expiration
was deemed by the authorities</i>

327
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,870
<i>to be accidental death
due to aggravated "Cementia."</i>

328
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,141
This wasn't an accident.

329
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,904
The Great Herrmann performed
that trick a thousand times.

330
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,947
What did he do
with all those cement blocks?

331
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:54,492
Donated them to the Papen County Marine
Institute to create artificial reefs.

332
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:58,063
The Great Herrmann had a dedicated fan
base of barnacles, corals, and oysters.

333
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:02,574
Well, tonight the invertebrates
of the sea will mourn his loss.

334
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,118
Poor Herrmann.

335
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,189
Fred and Ginger and Alice and Mercury.
I want them all avenged!

336
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:11,820
I'm sorry, but now that everyone's
calmed down, I'm freaking out.

337
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,900
I think it's the animal cruelty.

338
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,045
Don't freak out.

339
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:17,782
I know a dog and a pig that haven't been
impaled, poisoned, or bludgeoned

340
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:19,986
that need to be fed,
loved, and walked.

341
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,066
Maybe I'll go do that right now.

342
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:24,513
I'm sorry about
your next-best-thing magic dad.

343
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,430
And I'm...

344
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,496
I'm sorry about yours, too.

345
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:34,585
He wasn't my...
He didn't...

346
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:37,025
We didn't have
that kind of relationship.

347
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:40,462
Although he did put his hand
on my shoulder and called me "son",

348
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,960
which felt like someone
rubbed their feet across a shag rug,

349
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,367
reached into my chest
and gave my heart a static-electric pop.

350
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:48,004
I always loved
that static-electric pop.

351
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,684
It's all very confusing.

352
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,146
There's murdered magic dads and

353
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:54,855
the promise of tasty paté
with tuna sauce.

354
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:58,009
What do you think you were saying?
'cause that ain't what came out.

355
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,389
What I'm saying...

356
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,301
I need to say to them.

357
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,040
I'm gonna take care of this.
Herrmann will be avenged.

358
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,873
I don't mean vigilante justice, because
what kind of example would that be?

359
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:12,561
I mean regular
go-to-jail-for-your-crimes justice.

360
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:14,772
You gonna kick someone's ass,
<i>frère</i> pie maker?

361
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:16,718
Yes.

362
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,552
I'm gonna kick someone's ass.

363
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:24,034
<i>And the ass-kicking would commence
with the ass that poured the cement.</i>

364
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:26,325
I gave him
plenty of time to get out.

365
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:28,035
- Why didn't he get out?
- Don't know.

366
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,079
It's pretty cramped in there.
Maybe he got a clot and passed out.

367
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,856
- How'd he usually get out?
- He doesn't tell me that stuff.

368
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:35,498
The monkey knows more than I do.

369
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,807
- You mean the dead monkey?
- Yes, the dead monkey.

370
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:40,026
What, are you gonna try
and pin that one on me, too?

371
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:42,367
- What about Fred and Ginger?
- Don't forget the rabbit.

372
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:44,145
Alice was the only one I liked.

373
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:45,576
Damn monkey was mean.

374
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:48,104
And those birds...
those horrible birds.

375
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:50,974
Every time they'd fly out
of his pockets, they'd attack my weave.

376
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:54,269
So when animals attack, you attack back,
then kill the guy who trained them.

377
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,191
No, I stand there
humiliated by a mean monkey

378
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:01,021
night after night for eight years.

379
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:03,070
I told myself no more than 3,
but it's been 8.

380
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:06,781
I stand there, and I take it, hoping
the Great Herrmann will make good

381
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:09,243
on the carrot he's been dangling
and give me my own act.

382
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,995
Eight years of carrot-dangling
while the Bobbsey Twins pass you by?

383
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:13,436
Honey, you've been spurned,

384
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:16,708
and next to the spurned lover,
the spurned employee rides shotgun

385
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,669
on the homicide chuckwagon.

386
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:22,589
Herrmann and anyone he shared a stage
with has ended up dead, except you.

387
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:24,325
Which means you're the killer...

388
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:25,300
Killer.

389
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:27,820
Or... I'm next.

390
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,931
Or it was an accident,
and no one's next.

391
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,888
Also, you're wrong.

392
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:36,595
Someone else shared the stage
with the Great Herrmann...

393
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:37,955
The Geek.

394
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,692
So, you like the comic books,
and action figures?

395
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,236
He's the kind that bites
the heads off chickens.

396
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:48,240
Oh, animal-rights groups put a stop
to that kind of geek a long time ago.

397
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:51,910
Performers dressing up
as savages and eating live animals.

398
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:55,099
It's tacky and a surefire way
to alienate your audience.

399
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,585
I eat glass and nails
and regurgitate fish, frogs, and mice.

400
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,837
I'm working my way up to a kitten.

401
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:04,759
Regurgitating a kitten?
That's a unique talent.

402
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:07,814
I trained my body
to do the extraordinary.

403
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,847
My first job was as a plant
in Herrmann's audience.

404
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:12,096
That's how we met.

405
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:14,994
He'd pretend to hypnotize me,
and then, under his spell,

406
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:17,501
I'd drink a bottle of beer
and then eat the bottle.

407
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,380
We were like a father-and-son act.

408
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:23,643
What were you and your tummy doing when
Herrmann was on stage getting cemented?

409
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:26,575
I was walking the crowd.
I pickpocket rings, watches,

410
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:29,219
and keys and then regurgitate
them later in my act.

411
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,988
With all that happened,
I forgot to give some of them back.

412
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,522
Listen for yourself.

413
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:38,624
Did you swallow a magnet?

414
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,876
Somebody must've had one
in their pocket.

415
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,212
That's an amazing talent,
Mister Geek.

416
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,466
Herrmann was the only one around here
who had any respect for my contribution.

417
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,551
Any idea why he couldn't get out
of that box?

418
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:50,612
Can't say.

419
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:53,885
I bet the Great Herrmann
is in there right now striking some

420
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:58,018
"Last days of Pompeii" pose that's gonna
tell you everything you need to know.

421
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:01,939
<i>While the investigators continued
to ponder why the Great Herrmann</i>

422
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,937
<i>did not get out...</i>

423
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:07,254
<i>Olive Snook...</i>

424
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:10,561
<i>was about to ponder
how someone else did.</i>

425
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:12,883
We're closed.

426
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:15,936
Vivian! You're out!

427
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,799
I thought we'd agreed you'd call
before dropping by unexpectedly,

428
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,848
which would have been
expected had you called.

429
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:23,901
I couldn't risk sending
a message and Lily intercepting it.

430
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:26,129
This has to be covert.

431
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,544
I'm on a date...

432
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,358
with a man.

433
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:32,330
Evening.

434
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:34,174
Evening.

435
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,599
We walked out of that sandstorm
with our boots, our berets,

436
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:39,986
and our pocket watches with

437
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,303
no pockets to put them in.

438
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,545
We made a spit pact,
like in the boy scouts.

439
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:48,992
Last one alive and kicking takes them
watches into the desert

440
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,538
and lets the sandstorm claim them.

441
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:54,288
That's so very romantic and poetic,

442
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:57,010
and you certainly took
your time to come calling.

443
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,868
Charles has been dead for 20 years.

444
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:00,497
I've been in prison for 22.

445
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:03,125
- Emotional or federal?
- I'm gonna say "yes" to both.

446
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:05,255
I can only say "yes" to one.

447
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:07,813
Must seem
a little less romantic now.

448
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:08,915
Oh, no.

449
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:11,299
On the contrary.

450
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,011
I knew what kind of man Charles was,

451
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,305
and the way you tell it, you boys
sound more like bandits

452
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:18,844
than peacekeepers.

453
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,463
We were a little of both.

454
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:23,531
About Charles' pocket watch...

455
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,813
I do recall it.

456
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:27,883
So does Lily.
I don't know why she lied to you.

457
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:29,619
I think
she just wanted you to leave.

458
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,825
If Lily wants to keep that watch,
she should keep it.

459
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,207
She didn't keep it.

460
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:36,254
We buried it with our niece,
lonely tourist Charlotte Charles.

461
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,637
It was her father's.
We wanted her to have it.

462
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:43,915
That poor girl murdered on a Tahitian
getaway. That was Charles' little girl?

463
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:47,716
Lily is sensitive
when it comes to Charlotte.

464
00:22:47,872 --> 00:22:49,168
Of course she is.

465
00:22:50,174 --> 00:22:51,339
She lost her daughter.

466
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:52,736
- Niece!
- Niece.

467
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:54,670
I know what the relationship is.

468
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,595
I'm just saying,
I think you both lost a daughter.

469
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:02,517
You raised the girl. How could you
not feel like she's your own?

470
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:07,251
I'm glad the pocket watch
is with Charlotte.

471
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:11,104
<i>Because now,
he knew where to find it,</i>

472
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,802
<i>or so he thought,</i>

473
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:15,753
<i>just as our private investigators
thought they knew</i>

474
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:18,266
<i>where to find the Great Herrmann.</i>

475
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:21,095
Where's the Great Herrmann?

476
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:24,447
Give me that.

477
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,419
Now you see me...

478
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:34,099
"... And now you don't. Double kisses,
double hugs, the Great Herrmann."

479
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:35,728
Son of a bitch.

480
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:41,199
It was a disappearing act.

481
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:42,605
Now you see him...

482
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:43,975
now you don't.

483
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:46,599
The good news is he's still alive...

484
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:48,855
- somewhere.
- Why would Herrmann disappear?

485
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:50,654
He wouldn't disappeared
unless he had to.

486
00:23:50,684 --> 00:23:53,978
He's an important man. He probably
had important-man matters to attend to.

487
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,856
That's what Herrmann told us
when dad left.

488
00:23:56,886 --> 00:24:00,075
That's why "oh". It was an attempt to
corral those words back into my mouth.

489
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:03,636
What did Herrmann tell you
about when dad left?

490
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,580
Did he say why dad had to leave?

491
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:08,416
He told me what he told you.

492
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,002
Did he tell you anything
he didn't tell us?

493
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,338
There may have been select details.

494
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,336
<i>The facts were these...</i>

495
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,877
<i>On a cool autumn day 9 years,</i>

496
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:20,929
<i>48 weeks, 26 days,
and 7 hours earlier,</i>

497
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,726
<i>Maurice and Ralston's father
promised them a magic show</i>

498
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,414
<i>they would never forget.</i>

499
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,970
<i>A new magician, cleverly billed
as Herman Gunt's Magic Express,</i>

500
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:33,150
<i>called for a volunteer.</i>

501
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:36,894
<i>"I'll be back", dear dad said.</i>

502
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:07,259
<i>The fledgling magician tried
to comfort the fatherless boys</i>

503
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:11,914
<i>with vague but important motives
behind their dear dad's disappearance.</i>

504
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,452
<i>The twins' fragile hearts</i>

505
00:25:15,482 --> 00:25:18,555
<i>gladly believed
in the illusion of his words...</i>

506
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:20,616
<i>Until now.</i>

507
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:23,251
He wasn't an important man.

508
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:25,452
He didn't have important-man matters
to attend to.

509
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:26,803
Your dad...

510
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:28,549
our dad...

511
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:31,458
was just some guy ditching
his kids at a Sunday matinée.

512
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,939
That's what Herrmann told me.
That's what he didn't tell you.

513
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:38,164
He didn't want to hurt you anymore
than you had already been hurt.

514
00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:40,476
You sure didn't have
a problem telling us.

515
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:41,306
Yeah!

516
00:25:41,336 --> 00:25:44,469
In my defense, you badgered me a little,
and considerable time has passed.

517
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:47,599
I probably sound like some
horrible missionary showing up

518
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:50,060
and telling the natives
they're worshipping a false god, but...

519
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:51,429
you kind of are.

520
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:54,494
He left three sons.

521
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:57,665
There really isn't a good excuse.

522
00:25:57,802 --> 00:26:00,387
Did Herrmann tell you Ralston
wet himself when dad disappeared?

523
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:03,754
It was years before we could perform
a disappearing act without using a mop.

524
00:26:04,007 --> 00:26:05,283
Why would you say that?

525
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:08,220
I get anxiety-induced acid reflux
at the mere mention of magic.

526
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,038
Ralston, you wet yourself.

527
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:13,218
We're two grown men
with dad-related body-fluid issues.

528
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:16,962
I can't suck lozenges for the rest of my
life, and you can't wear adult diapers.

529
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:18,828
I learned to control
my bladder years ago.

530
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:21,308
Good for you.

531
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:24,344
I know my acid reflux
is just heartburn,

532
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,340
and your heart's burning, too.

533
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,591
Look at the way you're holding on
to that scarf.

534
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,108
You're not clinging to Herrmann.
You're clinging to dad.

535
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:33,910
Holding tighter
isn't gonna bring him back.

536
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,939
It's not gonna bring
either of them back.

537
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:41,412
Where's the rest of it?

538
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:44,072
Wasn't it in that block of cement
with Herrmann's, now you don't note?

539
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:47,543
Yeah,
it probably should've been, huh?

540
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,775
The great Herrmann is dead.
He died from "Cementia"

541
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:55,750
on stage with the rest
of this scarf around his neck.

542
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:58,287
I knew I shouldn't have came in here.
I knew it.

543
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,812
I should have took my ass home,
turned off my phone,

544
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:03,148
and got up under the covers, but no.

545
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,220
Someone switched the blocks.

546
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,061
It's classic sleight of hand.

547
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:09,459
Herrmann was that little ball
under the coconut shell.

548
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:12,377
Someone shuffled the shells around,
and we looked under the wrong one.

549
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:16,313
There were two performances
of "Cementia", so two blocks.

550
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:19,617
Killer shuffles the blocks, hides
the one with Herrmann's body in it, and

551
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,153
everybody thinks the great Great just
disappeared into his disappearing act.

552
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:26,219
And no body, no murder.

553
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:28,339
Makes for a great urban legend,
though.

554
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:30,961
How do you shuffle
a 500-pound block of cement?

555
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:32,496
Forklift.

556
00:27:32,562 --> 00:27:35,135
Only one block was forklifted out
of the <i>Conjurer's Castle</i> tonight.

557
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:37,030
Which means the other one
is still inside.

558
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,749
The switch had to happen somewhere
between the stage and the loading dock

559
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,322
when people weren't watching
the blocks too carefully.

560
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:46,591
<i>Using metal detectors
to detect the metal of the shackles</i>

561
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:49,657
<i>worn by the Great Herrmann
while performing "Cementia"...</i>

562
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:51,596
<i>"Two for the show",</i>

563
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:55,119
<i>featuring Olive Snook,
began their search at the loading dock.</i>

564
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:56,883
Well, I always loved
a good treasure hunt.

565
00:27:57,383 --> 00:28:00,031
<i>The private investigator,
the pie maker and Chuck</i>

566
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:02,480
<i>began their search under the stage.</i>

567
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,286
It might not be
the cement that killed him.

568
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,738
We could chisel open that block
and find a murder weapon, like

569
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:09,881
a Mojave rattlesnake
or a hidden hypodermic needle

570
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:13,300
that the Great Herrmann unknowingly
injected himself with whilst contorting.

571
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,361
Or we could chisel open that block
and find he drowned in cement.

572
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:18,286
Well, when we do chisel it open,

573
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:21,659
it's too bad Maurice and Ralston
can't talk to the Great Herrmann.

574
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,041
They didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.

575
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:26,021
The boohoo bosom done dried up.

576
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:29,378
Well, my boohoo bosom
is plumping and brimming with milk.

577
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:34,494
A small conversation can go a long way,
even under the falsest of pretenses.

578
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:36,566
Have you been
crank-calling Lily again?

579
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:38,262
Not recently...

580
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:42,174
Although that does depend on
how you define "recently".

581
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:44,090
Woman, don't you know
people have caller ID?

582
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:48,279
There's something underneath
these floorboards.

583
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,614
I give you "Cementia".

584
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,736
Herrmann slid right off the stage

585
00:28:57,766 --> 00:29:00,328
and dropped into
this strategically jackhammered grave.

586
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:03,169
Out of all the ways to have your body
stashed, this one's not so terrible.

587
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:05,630
Maybe the killer wanted
the great Herrmann

588
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:07,617
to be part of
the <i>Conjurer's Castle</i> forever.

589
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:10,825
If the killer cared that much, you'd
think he'd at least break out his trowel

590
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:13,092
and make the thing look nice.
Look at those edges.

591
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:14,705
He's got to fill all this in.

592
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:17,245
Lord knows
there's enough cement in the house.

593
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,649
Did someone just turn on
the cement mixer?

594
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,777
Maybe it's Olive and the boys.

595
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,238
Maybe what's Olive and the boys?

596
00:29:30,632 --> 00:29:33,366
- Whoever turned on the cement mixer.
- You found the Great Herrmann.

597
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:35,368
Whoever dropped this block in there

598
00:29:35,428 --> 00:29:38,656
is back to make sure Herrmann is
part of the <i>Conjurer's Castle</i> forever.

599
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,063
That's his killer?

600
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:43,784
No, no! Fools rush in!

601
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:45,008
We're not fools!

602
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,209
Over there!

603
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,591
They sprang like attack monkeys.

604
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:52,176
I'll take care of them.
You take care of him.

605
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:54,209
Do either of you have a gun?

606
00:29:54,613 --> 00:29:55,537
- No.
- No.

607
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,279
I'm going with Emerson.

608
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,764
Don't be going around chasing
murder suspects willy-nilly.

609
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:05,106
What you gonna do?
Use your wonder-twin powers?

610
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,197
Wait for me!

611
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:12,614
- Emerson.
- What?

612
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:13,617
In here.

613
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:18,083
Is he dead?

614
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:19,320
That's the Geek.

615
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:22,582
He eats glass and swallows
small animals. What's that up his nose?

616
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,752
Maybe it's a small animal
trying to crawl to freedom.

617
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,094
Oh, no, that's all the way up in there.
He's dead.

618
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:37,096
Yeah, he's... he's...
he's gone.

619
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:43,587
You killed Herrmann,
buried him in the floor,

620
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:46,064
and then you snuck back in here
so you could seal the deal

621
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,875
with some more of
your cement handiwork.

622
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:51,277
But you got surprised by the Geek,
and then you killed him, too.

623
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:53,246
Is that how you're gonna frame me

624
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:55,354
after you beat me to death with
your metal detectors?

625
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:56,658
I am an unarmed woman.

626
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:59,169
Why don't you calibrate
those things to find your manhood?

627
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,309
If you didn't kill anybody
and you ain't running 'round

628
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:04,082
here burying bodies and disposing
of witnesses, what you doin' here?

629
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,574
Packing.

630
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:09,101
The universe killed Herrmann
to send me a message,

631
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:12,145
and that message is that eight years
is long enough to wait for a carrot.

632
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:15,723
Yeah, well, my associates is out digging
up that carrot you been trying to bury,

633
00:31:15,753 --> 00:31:18,137
and we gonna see what the universe
has to say about that.

634
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:21,444
<i>As Emerson Cod chiseled away
at his suspect,</i>

635
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:24,727
<i>the pie maker and Chuck chiseled away
at the Great Herrmann.</i>

636
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:28,481
I live to amaze another day!

637
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,199
No,
you live to amaze another minute.

638
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:32,697
You've been crushed by
"Cementia's" deadly embrace.

639
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,281
I was hoping that didn't happen.

640
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,197
How am I talking right now
and not dead?

641
00:31:36,476 --> 00:31:38,117
- Magic.
- It's a family trait.

642
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,965
Must have gotten that
from your father.

643
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:42,340
And that's some potent kung fu.

644
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,144
Herrmann, look, I know that asking
a magician to reveal the secret

645
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:47,617
- behind his great escape is very rude.
- Then don't do it.

646
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:48,960
Nobody likes rude.

647
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,590
It could help us catch your killer.

648
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:54,575
Magic man to magic man.
Plug your ears.

649
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,900
<i>Magic man to magic man,</i>

650
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,331
<i>the Great Herrmann detailed
the facts of the escape that wasn't.</i>

651
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,182
<i>It was not magic that</i>

652
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:07,219
<i>got the Great Herrmann out of his box,
but a series of trapdoors.</i>

653
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:11,983
<i>But a magnet concealed
in his shoe was not underfoot.</i>

654
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:21,242
Magnets in your shoes? That's
the secret to your greatest trick?

655
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,870
I could've lied to you. Told you
it was force fields or telekinesis.

656
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,671
Somebody snatched the magnets out
of my shoes while I wasn't wearing them.

657
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:30,849
Do you have
any last words or regrets or

658
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:33,823
something you'd maybe like
to say to Maurice and Ralston?

659
00:32:34,263 --> 00:32:36,257
Something I'd like them to have.

660
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,576
My freezer has a false bottom.

661
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:42,096
Inside, you'll find my magic book
of magic tricks and illusions.

662
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:43,640
Give it to Maurice and Ralston.

663
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:47,101
- I'd like to keep it in the family.
- Time for my next trick.

664
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:50,229
With a bit of showmanship,
if you don't mind.

665
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,315
Now you see me...

666
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:55,717
There were supposed to be magnets
in the Great Herrmann's shoes.

667
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:57,976
That's how he triggers
the trapdoor and escapes "Cementia".

668
00:32:58,006 --> 00:33:00,352
Someone stole the magnets
so he couldn't escape.

669
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:02,825
After Herrmann died, there were
magnets in the Geek's stomach.

670
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:05,036
- So what?
- Sew buttons.

671
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,521
He ate the evidence.
The Geek's the killer.

672
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:09,824
The Geek ain't the killer.
The Geek is dead.

673
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,970
Black magic woman killed him.

674
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:16,201
She took that dangling carrot
and jammed it in that damn fool's head.

675
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:18,423
Stop saying that.
I did not.

676
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:20,383
<i>In fact, she hadn't.</i>

677
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:23,697
They did not just leave me
with a dead body.

678
00:33:33,926 --> 00:33:36,545
- Right now, I feel like I'm very calm.
- You are. You are.

679
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:40,281
Thank you, and I want to stay that way,
but I need you to stay calm, too.

680
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,519
- So what's our promise to each other?
- Stay calm.

681
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:44,843
- Which means?
- No screaming?

682
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:46,409
You're wonderful.

683
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:48,333
I can't wait to let you go.

684
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,329
Everybody can see you.

685
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,249
Olive, are you okay?

686
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:54,047
I'm calm?

687
00:33:54,077 --> 00:33:57,006
Hey, nerd, you need to get yourself
a bigger human shield or something.

688
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,006
You hanging out all sorts
of places I could shoot.

689
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,175
How about you just let
wee lady wee go?

690
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:03,459
Well, I have a gun, too.

691
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:06,191
I swallowed a pearl-handled pistol.

692
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:09,100
I'm cocking the trigger
with my stomach muscles right now,

693
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:12,603
and when it flies out of my mouth,
it's going to shoot you in the face!

694
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,710
I did hear a click.

695
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,646
Wait... It's a click-clicking.

696
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:17,108
Oh, never mind. It's a watch.

697
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:20,116
You ain't shooting
nobody in their face, Tums.

698
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,113
You are not gonna get away
with murder.

699
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:23,544
Ned, he's got a nail.

700
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:25,285
<i>The facts were these...</i>

701
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:27,988
<i>The Geek, a.k.a. Gunther Pinker,</i>

702
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:30,715
<i>saw a father in the Great Herrmann</i>

703
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:33,666
<i>and a long and happy
future performing together.</i>

704
00:34:34,778 --> 00:34:37,628
<i>But Herrmann
did not see a son in him...</i>

705
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:41,148
<i>Only a novelty act
whose novelty had run out.</i>

706
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:52,314
<i>Herrmann had conveniently arranged
his own funeral in "Cementia."</i>

707
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,209
<i>The keys to his escape
were consumed.</i>

708
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:02,810
<i>He made the Great Herrmann vanish
and replaced him with another cube.</i>

709
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,745
<i>No body, no murder.</i>

710
00:35:04,775 --> 00:35:06,811
<i>He intended to return
with his trowel</i>

711
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:10,643
<i>and seal the Great Herrmann's grave
with the very brand of cement</i>

712
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:12,107
<i>that took his life.</i>

713
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:14,375
I would have eaten
anything for that man.

714
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:16,053
I loved him like a father.

715
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,793
He shouldn't have called
your act cheap.

716
00:35:17,855 --> 00:35:21,977
That first beer bottle I ate for him
was a promise, a promise he broke.

717
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:25,843
He turned his back on me,
abandoned me like I was... cheap.

718
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:29,647
I was abandoned by my father when
I was 9. I hated him for leaving me.

719
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:31,643
I wrote letters to my future self

720
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:34,440
telling future me to never forgive
my father and to always hold a grudge.

721
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,355
Those letters were little,
angry time capsules.

722
00:35:38,457 --> 00:35:40,452
But being angry didn't help.

723
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:42,667
Despite what he did to me...

724
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:45,530
I still loved him,

725
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,823
and...

726
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:48,102
I wanted him back.

727
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:48,883
Now!

728
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,881
<i>The Geek, a.k.a. Gunther Pinker,</i>

729
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:08,023
<i>regurgitator of fish, frogs,
mice and now kittens,</i>

730
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:12,480

the Great Herrmann, a.k.a. Herman Gunt.</i>

731
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:17,144
<i>When they were ready, twin magicians
Maurice and Ralston dealt</i>

732
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,230
<i>with the loss of their magic dad,</i>

733
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,062
<i>finding his book of secrets
where he had left it.</i>

734
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:26,888
<i>But they knew there was someone who had
waited eight long years for that carrot.</i>

735
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,258
We'll make you a photocopy.

736
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,529
<i>And with it,
Alexandria the assistant</i>

737
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,077
<i>would become the Great Alexandria,</i>

738
00:36:34,107 --> 00:36:37,092
<i>newest headliner
at the </i>Conjurer's Castle.

739
00:36:38,165 --> 00:36:41,813
<i>As for the pie maker,
he discovered a new side to magic.</i>

740
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:44,591
<i>Magic was not just what disappears,</i>

741
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:47,635
<i>but what reappears
when you least expect it.</i>

742
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:52,327
<i>Emboldened with this new perspective
and free of the sting of acid reflux,</i>

743
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:56,433
<i>the pie maker arranged a private
magic show for the girl he loved.</i>

744
00:36:56,463 --> 00:36:57,518
Are you ready?

745
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,607
Well, if we're going to a magic show,
I hope you've got your lozenges.

746
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:04,374
Oh, sorry.

747
00:37:04,654 --> 00:37:06,777
You helped me conquer
my lozenge dependency.

748
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:09,488
As terrifying as it is,
magic runs in my family...

749
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:12,865
And I kind of like
being <i>frère</i> pie maker.

750
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:17,765
It's a nice feeling to be able to talk
to the family you didn't know you had.

751
00:37:20,316 --> 00:37:21,834
Okay, you can look.

752
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,826
Yeah?

753
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:25,889
Okay.

754
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,703
I want you to have
that same nice feeling.

755
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:44,899
Do you want to talk to your mom?

756
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:47,610
Are we gonna crank-call Lily?

757
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,227
- In a way.
- Ding-dong-ditch?

758
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:54,216
How?

759
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,893
A small conversation
can go a long way,

760
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,996
even under the falsest of pretenses.

761
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,709
Okay, now that Vivian
has gone to bed,

762
00:38:04,857 --> 00:38:06,212
have you ever role-played?

763
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,368
Oh, I've role-played...

764
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,154
but never in a context I'd be
comfortable role-playing with you.

765
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:14,672
Oh, no, not...
not that kind of a role-play.

766
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:16,256
More Olives... Olive.

767
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:21,060
This is a work-your-grooves-out
kind of a role-play,

768
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:23,049
not get-your-groove-on.

769
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:24,192
Oh, okay.

770
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:28,001
You've told me things only me, you
and that nunnery know about Charlotte.

771
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:30,111
You being her mother and

772
00:38:30,896 --> 00:38:32,880
- not being her mother.
- That again.

773
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,260
Say, when you were a jockey,

774
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,701
did you ride the horses or just
beat them after they were dead?

775
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:39,477
I'm not talking about a dead horse.
I'm talking about a dead daughter,

776
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:41,566
and that's an awful lot of weight
to haul around.

777
00:38:41,596 --> 00:38:43,269
You are harshing my buzz.

778
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:45,366
Oh, I don't want to harsh.
I want to help.

779
00:38:45,396 --> 00:38:48,488
Help me, help you carry the weight.

780
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:50,381
Oh, Lily, unburden yourself.

781
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:52,787
If Charlotte were alive right now

782
00:38:52,817 --> 00:38:55,511
and you didn't have to worry
about Vivian settling your hash,

783
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,942
what would you say to her?

784
00:38:58,114 --> 00:39:00,598
Is this the role-play part
where you're supposed to be Charlotte?

785
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,950
Yes, aunt Lily. It's Charlotte.
Don't you recognize me?

786
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,530
You should get your eye checked.

787
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:10,109
Charlotte,
there's something you should know.

788
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:16,082
I'm listening.

789
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,868
<i>I'm your mother.</i>

790
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:20,036
Presto.

791
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:22,705
Go on.

792
00:39:22,922 --> 00:39:24,740
Ask your sea of questions.

793
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:29,209
She can hear me?

794
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
There's so many.

795
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,871
- <i>I want to know everything.</i>
- I want to know every...

796
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,191
everything?

797
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:44,285
Everything.

798
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,588
Start at the beginning.

799
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:49,440
Tell me about the...
the day I was born.

800
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:51,901
Could you tell me
about the day I was born?

801
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,943
I was at the nunnery.

802
00:39:56,973 --> 00:39:59,325
It was right in the middle
of mid-middle morning prayers.

803
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:03,240
<i>Sister Mary Mary came running with
a crucifix and a bucket of holy water.</i>

804
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,165
<i>She had ideas about
the kind of spawn I was carrying.</i>

805
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:07,900
But...

806
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:12,257
after you were born...

807
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:19,470
even she could see
you were an angel.

808
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:24,570
<i>As the once-dead girl named Chuck </i>
