1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:02,280
I'm going to die.

2
00:00:03,745 --> 00:00:04,975
And I was told,

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,309
'"He will knock four times."'

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:11,280
What is it? What's inside your head?

5
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:12,479
It's real!

6
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:16,896
The darkness heralds only one thing.

7
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:21,960
The end of time itself.

8
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:24,701
My head!

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,469
Oh, my head!

10
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:30,081
If she ever remembers me,
her mind will burn and she will die.

11
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:32,239
What have you done, you monster?

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,240
And so it came to pass,
on Christmas Day,

13
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:41,600
that the human race
did cease to exist.

14
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:43,679
This day

15
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,840
was the day upon
which the whole creation

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,830
would change forever.

17
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,297
This was the day

18
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:54,217
the Time Lords returned.

22
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,680
What news of the Doctor?

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,900
Disappeared,

24
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,880
my Lord President.

25
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,840
But we know his intention.
He still possesses the Moment.

26
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,200
And he'll use it, to destroy Daleks

27
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:16,391
and Time Lords alike.

28
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:18,391
The Visionary confirms it.

29
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:20,020
Ending, burning,

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,188
falling, all of it falling,

31
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:25,727
the black and pitch
and screaming fire

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,456
so burning.

33
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,326
All of her prophecies say the same.

34
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,649
That this is the last day
of the Time War.

35
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:36,826
That Gallifrey falls.
That we die,

36
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:38,316
today.

37
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:40,760
Ending, ending, ending.

38
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:42,193
Ending!

39
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,200
Perhaps it's time.

40
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:49,496
This is only the furthest edge
of the Time War.

41
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,400
But at its heart,

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,720
millions die every second.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,741
Lost in bloodlust and insanity.

44
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,857
With time itself resurrecting them,

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,280
to find new ways of dying,

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,017
over and over again,

47
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,078
a travesty of life.

48
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:08,400
Isn't it better to end it,

49
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,719
- At last?
- Thank you for your opinion.

50
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:17,104
I will not die!

51
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,301
Do you hear me?

52
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,745
A billion years of Time Lord history

53
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:26,506
riding on our backs.

54
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:29,685
I will not let this perish.

55
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:32,081
I will not!

56
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,363
There is...

57
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:46,654
There is one part
of the prophecy, my Lord.

58
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:49,596
Forgive me...

59
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:51,460
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,566
It's rather difficult

61
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,637
to decipher, but...

62
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,482
it talks of two survivors,

63
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:00,640
beyond the Final Day.

64
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,040
Two children of Gallifrey.

65
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:04,351
Does it name them?

66
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:08,369
It foresees them locked in
their final confrontation,

67
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,859
The Enmity of Ages,
which would suggest...

68
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,102
The Doctor!

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,234
And the Master.

70
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:19,760
One word keeps being repeated,
my Lord.

71
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:21,790
One constant word.

72
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,800
- Earth.
- Earth, Earth.

73
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,560
Earth, earth, earth, ...

74
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:30,531
Planet Earth.

75
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,760
Indigenous species, the human race.

76
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,306
Maybe that's where the answer lies.

77
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:42,320
Our salvation.

78
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:44,494
On Earth.

79
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,719
Now, then. I've got a planet to run.

80
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,321
Is everybody ready?

81
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,562
6 billion, 7 hundred and 27 million,

82
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,040
 9 hundred and 49 thousand

83
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,920
300 and 38 versions of us

84
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:06,560
awaiting orders.

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,880
This is Washington.

86
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,529
As President of the United States,

87
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:13,680
I can transfer
all the United Nations protocols

88
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,000
to you immediately,

89
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,960
putting you in charge
of all the Earth's defences.

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,267
UNIT HQ, Geneva reporting.

91
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,685
All under your command, sir.

92
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,960
This is the Central Military Commission
here in Beijing, sir.

93
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,840
With over 2.5 million soldiers.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,890
Sir!

95
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:33,999
Present arms!

96
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:40,320
Enough soldiers and weapons
to turn this planet into a warship.

97
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,760
Nothing to say?

98
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,573
What's that? Pardon?

99
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:50,120
- Sorry?
- You let him go, you swine.

100
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,494
Your dad's still kicking up a fuss.

101
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,861
- I'd be proud if I was.
- Hush, now.

102
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:58,759
Listen to your Master.

103
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:08,920
That's a mobile.

104
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,200
- It's mine, let me turn it off.
- I don't think you understand.

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,049
Everybody on this planet... is me.

106
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,301
And I'm not phoning you,
so who the hell is that?

107
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,760
It's nobody.
Probably some ring-back call.

108
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,861
And look at this. Good man!

109
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:30,799
- Who's Donna?
- She's no-one, just leave it.

110
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:35,080
Gramps. Don't hang up,
you've got to help me.

111
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,920
I ran out...
but everyone was changing.

112
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,560
Who is she? Why didn't she change?

113
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:44,597
It was this thing the Doctor did...

114
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,884
He did it to her. The Metacrisis.

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,920
He loves playing with Earth girls.

116
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,221
- Oh.
- Are you there?

117
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,680
Find her. Trace the call.

118
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:54,339
Trace the call.

119
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:58,321
Are you still there?

120
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:01,240
- Can you hear me?
- Say goodbye to the freak, Grandad.

121
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,320
Donna, get out of there!

122
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:06,195
Just get out. Run!

123
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,760
She's on Wessex Lane, Chiswick.
Open the phone lines.

124
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,107
Everyone on Wessex Lane.
Red alert.

125
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:12,934
-  What do I do?
- Run, that's all.

126
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:14,279
Run for your life!

127
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,320
- There's more of them.
- What's happening?

128
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,440
- Are you still there?
- They're everywhere...

129
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,196
I'm starving.

130
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:27,004
I'm telling you. Run, Donna!

131
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,795
- I'm still hungry!
- Just run, sweetheart.

132
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,211
Just run!

133
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:36,192
It's not just them...

134
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:38,639
I can see those things again.

135
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,761
Those creatures.

136
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,680
Why can I see a giant wasp?

137
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:46,360
Don't think about that,
Donna, my love...

138
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,018
And it hurts.

139
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,020
My head.

140
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,480
It keeps getting hotter.
And hotter!

141
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,280
And hotter. And hotter. And hotter!

142
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:03,535
What did I...?

143
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,675
What was that?

144
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:15,905
Donna, are you there?

145
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:28,759
That's better. Hello.

146
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:30,509
But really,

147
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:33,404
did you think I'd leave my best friend
without a defence mechanism?

148
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,310
- What happened?
- She's all right. I promise.

149
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,803
She'll just sleep.

150
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,086
Tell me...

151
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:42,919
Where's your TARDIS?

152
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:45,840
You could be so wonderful.

153
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,158
- Where is it?
- You're a genius.

154
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:51,120
You're stone-cold brilliant.
You are, I swear, you really are.

155
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,509
But you could be so much more.

156
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,693
You could be beautiful.

157
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:00,553
With a mind like that,
we could travel the stars.

158
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,135
It would be my honour.

159
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,680
Because you don't need
to own the universe. Just see it.

160
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:12,065
To have the privilege of seeing
the whole of time and space...

161
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:16,407
that's ownership enough.

162
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,600
Would it stop, then?

163
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:25,939
The noise in my head?

164
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,109
I can help.

165
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:33,024
I don't know
what I'd be without that noise.

166
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:38,824
Wonder what I'd be, without you.

167
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:54,441
What does he mean? What noise?

168
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,240
It began on Gallifrey.

169
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:02,423
As children.

170
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:05,438
Not that you'd call it childhood.

171
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:10,398
More a life of... duty.

172
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:13,480
Eight years old.

173
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,794
I was taken for initiation.

174
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:19,087
To stare into the Untempered Schism.

175
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:22,942
- What does that mean?
- It's a gap in the fabric of reality.

176
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:27,005
You can see into
the Time Vortex itself.

177
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:29,768
And it hurts.

178
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,680
They took me there.

179
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:34,257
In the dark.

180
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,969
I looked into time, old man.

181
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,293
And I heard it.

182
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,058
Calling to me.

183
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,570
Drums...

184
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,655
The never-ending drums.

185
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:55,033
The Untempered Schism.

186
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:57,133
That's when it began.

187
00:10:57,926 --> 00:10:59,026
History says

188
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:01,930
the Master heard a rhythm.

189
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:05,240
A torment that stayed with him
for the rest of his life.

190
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,600
A drumbeat. A warrior's march.

191
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:10,575
A symptom of insanity, my Lord.

192
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,526
A rhythm of four!

193
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:30,555
The heartbeat of a Time Lord.

194
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,025
Listen to it.

195
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:37,159
Listen.

196
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:39,351
Then let's find it.

197
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:41,199
You and me.

198
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,790
Except...

199
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:51,000
Wait a minute.

200
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:53,800
That's good.

201
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,000
- What is?
- The noise exists within my head.

202
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:00,800
And now within six billion heads.
Everyone on Earth can hear it.

203
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,937
Imagine!

204
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,450
Oh yes!

205
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:15,400
The Gate wasn't enough.
You're still dying.

206
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,279
This body was born out of death.
All it can do is die.

207
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:22,926
But what did you say to me,

208
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,440
back in the wasteland?

209
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,520
You said, "The end of time."

210
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:29,309
I said something is returning.
I was shown a prophecy.

211
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,947
- That's why I need your help.
- What if I'm part of it?

212
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:35,573
Don't you see?

213
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,431
The drumbeat is calling
from so far away.

214
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:40,200
From the end of time itself.

215
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:43,000
And now it's been amplified
six billion times.

216
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,200
Triangulate all those signals.
I could find its source!

217
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,062
That's what your prophecy was.

218
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:53,718
Me!

219
00:12:57,681 --> 00:13:00,240
- Where's the TARDIS?
- Just stop.

220
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:03,159
- Just think.
- Kill him.

221
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,373
I need that technology, Doctor.

222
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,400
Tell me where it is, or he's dead.

223
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:12,759
- Don't tell him.
- I'll kill him, right now!

224
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:16,407
Actually,
the most impressive thing about you

225
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:19,400
is that after all this time,
you're still bone-dead stupid.

226
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:24,562
- Take aim.
- You've got six billion pairs of eyes,

227
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:26,721
but you still can't see the obvious,
can you?

228
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,080
Like what?

229
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,040
That guard is one inch too tall.

230
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:38,080
Oh my God, I hit him.

231
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:40,679
I've never hit anyone in my life.

232
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,240
Come on!

233
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,624
We need to get out of here, fast.

234
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:49,320
- God bless the cactuses!
- That's CACTI.

235
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,000
That's racist!

236
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:54,349
This prophecy of yours, Doctor...
where did it come from?

237
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:58,178
Come on!

238
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,376
- We've got to get out.
- There's too many buckles and straps.

239
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Wheel him.

240
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:06,120
Get me out.

241
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,640
Don't... Don't!

242
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,360
What's going on?

243
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:13,626
- Which way?
- This way.

244
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,437
- The other way! I've got my TARDIS.
- I know what I'm doing.

245
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,719
Listen to me!

246
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,959
Find him. Find him!

247
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:28,560
Not the stairs...

248
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,479
Not the stairs!

249
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:42,088
Worst... rescue... ever!

250
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,480
- Underneath the Gate Room, sir.
- Basement. Get him.

251
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:46,839
Yes, sir.

252
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,945
Stop, and listen to me!

253
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:01,533
- Gotcha.
- You think so?

254
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,359
Don't, don't!

255
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:08,640
Now get me out of this thing!

256
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,080
Don't say thanks, will you?

257
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,240
He's not going to let us go.
Just hurry up and get me out!

258
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,770
My goodness me...

259
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:17,880
We're in space!

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,570
- Come on!
- All right!

261
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:21,749
Get a move on!

262
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,705
Open the teleport and follow him!

263
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:40,407
- Come on!
- All right!

264
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,624
He's still up there.

265
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,520
Target practice.

266
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:56,680
- Where's your flight deck?
- We're safe!

267
00:15:57,216 --> 00:16:00,120
We're a hundred thousand miles
above the Earth.

268
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:03,599
And he's got every single missile
on the planet ready to fire!

269
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:06,664
Good point.

270
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,098
But we're in space!

271
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:35,560
Turn everything you've got to the skies.
Find me that ship.

272
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:38,600
- And prime the missiles.
- Open up the radar, maximum scan.

273
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:46,703
- We've got to close it down!
- No chance, mate, we're going home.

274
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:50,480
We're a salvage team.
Local politics has nothing to do with us

275
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,040
Not unless there's a carnival.

276
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,476
Sooner we get back
to Vinvocci space the better.

277
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,800
You're not leaving.

278
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:11,399
Anything?

279
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,239
I'm sorry, sir. Nothing.

280
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:39,799
Lost him.

281
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,480
What about teleport coordinates?

282
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:43,392
I need that information.

283
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,248
He's cut the link, sir.
No trace, all dead.

284
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:49,720
Still...

285
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,139
Open fire!

286
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:58,466
No way back now.

287
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:00,435
He's stranded.

288
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,387
No sign of any missiles...

289
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:16,093
No sign of... anything.

290
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,680
You've wrecked the place!

291
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,236
The engines are burnt out.

292
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:22,720
Just auxiliary lights.
Everything else is kaput.

293
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:25,426
We can't move.
We're stuck, in orbit.

294
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:28,242
Thanks to you. You idiot!

295
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,175
I know you, though. I bet
you've got a plan, haven't you?

296
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:38,200
Come on.

297
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,320
You've always got
a trick up your sleeve.

298
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,467
Nice little bit of the old Doctor.

299
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:46,359
Sort of thing?

300
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,730
Oh, blimey.

301
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:11,119
Night has fallen.

302
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:12,950
Are we ready?

303
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,120
Every single one of us is prepared.

304
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:17,617
Then we listen.

305
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
All of us.

306
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,082
Across the world.

307
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:24,776
Listen.

308
00:19:39,716 --> 00:19:40,987
Concentrate.

309
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,359
Find the signal.

310
00:19:52,446 --> 00:19:53,246
There.

311
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:56,406
The sound is tangible.

312
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,187
Someone could only
have designed this.

313
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:04,075
But who?

314
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,160
The signal has been sent.
A simple task of four beats

315
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,680
Transmitted back through time,

316
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:13,840
and implanted
in the Master's mind as a child.

317
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,280
Then we have a link
to where the Master is right now.

318
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:21,521
But we're still trapped
inside the Timelock, sir.

319
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:23,680
The link is nothing more

320
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,371
than a thought, an idea.

321
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,200
Then we need something
to make the contact

322
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:28,342
physical.

323
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,772
Something...

324
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,600
- so simple.
- So small and shining.

325
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:37,320
Shining bright and cold.
The tiny

326
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,360
tiny star, falling, falling, burning,

327
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,362
burning, burning.

328
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:45,255
Small enough to follow the link.

329
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:46,933
And if

330
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:49,350
this were on Earth.

331
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:08,834
The sound...

332
00:21:09,515 --> 00:21:10,760
it's coming from above.

333
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,530
It's coming from the sky!

334
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,381
There!

335
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:21,440
Find it.

336
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:23,269
Get out there and find it!

337
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:58,520
It's a diamond, sir.

338
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:07,680
The most impossible diamond.

339
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,719
You won't believe this.

340
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,468
It's a Whitepoint star!

341
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,265
Is that you?

342
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:00,948
Doctor?

343
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:08,816
Anyone?

344
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:11,412
Anyone?

345
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:15,574
I think I'm lost.

346
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:19,183
And yet you are found.

347
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:26,546
Events are closing.

348
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,519
The day is almost upon us.

349
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,280
But tell me, old soldier.

350
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:35,414
Did you take arms?

351
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,661
I brought this.

352
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:40,840
But, what am I supposed to do?

353
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:43,147
This is the Doctor's final battle.

354
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:46,197
At the end of his life,

355
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,152
he must stand at arms,

356
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:51,763
or lose himself and all this world,

357
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:54,142
to the end of time.

358
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,176
But he never carries guns.

359
00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:57,827
He doesn't do...

360
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,010
Who are you?

361
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:04,352
I was lost...

362
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,226
so very long ago.

363
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:40,054
- Got this old tub mended?
- Just trying to fix the heating.

364
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:47,637
I've always dreamt of a view like that.

365
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:52,119
I'm an astronaut.

366
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:55,839
It's dawn over England, look.

367
00:24:57,702 --> 00:24:58,906
Brand new day.

368
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:02,764
My wife's buried down there.

369
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,601
I might never visit her again, now.

370
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:11,937
Do you think he changed them?

371
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,620
In their graves?

372
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:17,589
I'm sorry.

373
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:20,022
No, not your fault.

374
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:22,601
Isn't it?

375
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,488
1948, I was over there.

376
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,249
End of the Mandate in Palestine.

377
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,860
Private Mott.

378
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,210
Skinny little idiot, I was.

379
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,080
Stood on this rooftop,

380
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:39,657
the middle of a skirmish...

381
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:42,840
It was like a blizzard,
all them bullets in the air.

382
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:45,667
The world gone mad.

383
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:50,421
You don't want to listen
to an old man's tales, do you?

384
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,040
I'm older than you.

385
00:25:52,736 --> 00:25:53,686
Get away.

386
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:54,921
I'm 906.

387
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:59,244
- What, really, though?
- Yeah.

388
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:01,757
900 years...

389
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:05,958
We must look like insects to you.

390
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:09,400
I think you look like giants.

391
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,119
Listen, I...

392
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:16,680
I want you to

393
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,040
have this.
I've kept it all this time,

394
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,285
and I thought...

395
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:24,240
But if you take it, you could...

396
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:34,118
You had that gun in the mansion.

397
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,000
You could have
shot the Master there and then.

398
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,352
Too scared, I suppose.

399
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:43,841
I'd be proud.

400
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:46,000
Of what?

401
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:47,688
If you were my dad.

402
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:50,709
Come on, don't start.

403
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:55,577
But you said,

404
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:57,040
you were told...

405
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:00,589
he will knock four times,
and then you die.

406
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,593
That's him, isn't it?

407
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:05,720
The Master.
That noise

408
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:07,560
in his head?

409
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,278
The Master is going to kill you.

410
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:15,491
Then kill him first.

411
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:18,895
And that's how the Master started.

412
00:27:25,974 --> 00:27:27,647
It's not like I'm an innocent.

413
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,783
I've taken lives.

414
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,384
I got worse, I got clever.

415
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,516
Manipulated people
into taking their own.

416
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:50,524
Sometimes I think
a Time Lord lives too long.

417
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:58,827
I can't.

418
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:02,401
I just can't.

419
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,233
If the Master dies...

420
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:12,342
what happens to all the people?

421
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,040
- I don't know.
- Doctor,

422
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:18,960
what happens?

423
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:21,621
The template snaps.

424
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:25,520
What, they go back to being human?

425
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:27,920
They're alive?

426
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:30,871
And human?

427
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,140
Then don't you dare, sir.

428
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:37,710
Don't you dare,

429
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,679
put him before them.

430
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:43,883
Now you take this,
that's an order, Doctor. Take the gun.

431
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:46,280
You take the gun and save your life.

432
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:49,963
And, please don't die.
You're the most wonderful man

433
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,013
and I don't, want you to die!

434
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,079
Never.

435
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,348
A star, fell from the sky.

436
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:13,360
Don't you want to know where from?

437
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:16,840
Because now it makes sense, Doctor.

438
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:20,125
It's an open broadcast.
Don't reply or he'll know where we are.

439
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,680
The whole of my life.

440
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:23,168
My destiny.

441
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:27,553
The star was a diamond.

442
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:31,182
And the diamond...

443
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:34,363
is a Whitepoint star.

444
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,569
And I have worked all night,
to sanctify that gift.

445
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:43,037
Now the star is mine

446
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:46,203
I can increase the signal...

447
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:47,560
and use it

448
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:49,076
as a lifeline.

449
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:50,640
Do you get it now?

450
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:51,962
Do you see?

451
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,022
Keep watching, Doctor.

452
00:29:57,385 --> 00:29:58,735
This should be...

453
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:00,781
spectacular.

454
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,150
Over and out.

455
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:07,360
What's he on about? What's he doing?
Doctor, what does that mean?

456
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,271
A Whitepoint star
is only found on one planet.

457
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,726
Gallifrey.

458
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,159
Which means...

459
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,680
it's the Time Lords.

460
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:18,800
- They are returning.
- Well,

461
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,040
that's good, isn't it?
That's your people.

462
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:32,745
Open up the nuclear bolt.
Infuse the power lines to maximum.

463
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:41,160
Nuclear bolt accelerating, sir.

464
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:46,307
Send the signal back
and the link becomes a pathway.

465
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:12,972
Come home.

466
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:20,520
What's that?

467
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:23,432
Coming from Earth.

468
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:26,027
It's on every single wavelength.

469
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:34,123
Contact!

470
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:36,805
At last.

471
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:41,588
We have contact.

472
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,138
Now the High Council
of Time Lords must vote.

473
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:49,899
Whether we die here, today,

474
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:53,321
or return to the waking world

475
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:56,032
and complete the Ultimate Sanction.

476
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,600
For this is the hour

477
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:00,709
when either Gallifrey falls,

478
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:03,841
or Gallifrey

479
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:05,254
rises!

480
00:32:05,939 --> 00:32:07,605
Gallifrey rises!

481
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:09,783
Gallifrey rises!

482
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:14,173
But you said your people were dead.
Past tense.

483
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:16,920
Inside the Time War!
And the whole War was Timelocked,

484
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:18,560
like, sealed inside a bubble.

485
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,400
Not a bubble but think of it.
Nothing can get in or get out

486
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,577
of the Timelock.

487
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,360
Nothing can get in or get out,

488
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,480
except something that was already there.

489
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,440
The signal. Since he was a kid.

490
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,960
If they can follow him,
they can escape, before they die.

491
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,081
- Big reunion. We'll have a party.
- There will be no party.

492
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,196
I've heard you talk about your people
like they're wonderful.

493
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,880
That's how I choose
to remember the Time Lords of old.

494
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,240
But then they went to war,
an endless war,

495
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,826
and it changed them.
Right to the core.

496
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,440
You see my enemie, Wilf.

497
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,440
- They're the most dangerous enemies.
- Time Lords... What lords?

498
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,400
- Anyone want to explain?
- You! This is a salvage ship,

499
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,320
yes?
You go trawling the asteroid fields

500
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,600
- for junk?
- So?

501
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,997
So, you've got asteroid lasers!

502
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah, but they're all frazzled.

503
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:03,567
Consider them unfrazzled.

504
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:06,448
You there...

505
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm going to need you on navigation.
You, get in the laser-pod.

506
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,520
Laser number two.
The old soldier's got one more battle.

507
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:16,560
This ship,

508
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:19,090
can't move.
It's dead!

509
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:20,887
Fix the heating.

510
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:27,480
- But now they can see us.
- Oh, yes!

511
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:31,440
Sir. We've got a fix.
105,000 miles in orbit.

512
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:33,379
This is my ship.

513
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:36,213
And you're not moving it.
Step away from the wheel.

514
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:38,348
There's an old Earth saying, Captain.

515
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,403
A phrase of great power, and wisdom,

516
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:43,158
and consolation to the soul
in times of need.

517
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:45,960
- What's that, then?
- Allons-y!

518
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:52,880
He's moving, sir.

519
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,080
Get a fix on him.

520
00:33:54,862 --> 00:33:56,520
He's moving very fast.

521
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:58,079
Come on!

522
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:10,360
You are blinkin',

523
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,480
flippin' mad.

524
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:14,710
You two, what did I say? Lasers.

525
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,880
What for?

526
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:17,720
Because of the missiles.

527
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:21,520
We've got to fight off
the entire planet!

528
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,836
All NATO defences coordinated sir,
awaiting your command.

529
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:27,800
No need him.

530
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:30,246
Any second now,
I'll have Time Lords to spare.

531
00:34:30,346 --> 00:34:32,040
Take him out. Launch missiles!

532
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,800
Launch missiles.

533
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,360
Missiles launching

534
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,470
in three,

535
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:37,459
two,

536
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:38,937
one,

537
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,159
zero.

538
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,119
How does this thing work?

539
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,720
The tracking's automatic.

540
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,840
Just deploy the trigger on the joystick.

541
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,080
We've got incoming.

542
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,080
- Look at this one! Oh, my God!
- You two! Open fire!

543
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,000
Open fire!

544
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:22,440
Come on, Wilf!

545
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,600
I wish Donna could see me now.

546
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:32,760
Second wave. Launch missiles.

547
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,870
Yes, sir.

548
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,960
And there's more. 16 of them.

549
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:46,840
- And another 16.
- Go to the rear-gun lasers!

550
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,720
You two, open fire!

551
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:51,927
Now!

552
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:07,979
No, you don't!

553
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:21,000
Come on!

554
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:22,692
Come on!

555
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:24,403
Fire!

556
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:37,360
Lock the navigation.

557
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:40,881
- Onto what?
- England. The Naismith mansion.

558
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:44,131
- He's heading straight for you.
- But too late.

559
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:46,160
They are coming.

560
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,426
The vote is taken.
Only two stand against.

561
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:52,671
And will stand
as monument to their shame,

562
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:54,974
like the Weeping Angels of old.

563
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:58,044
Now the vanguard stands prepared,

564
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:02,039
as the children of Gallifrey
return to the universe.

565
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:03,929
To Earth.

566
00:37:12,465 --> 00:37:13,623
Destination?

567
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:15,544
50 kliks and closing.

568
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,109
We've locked on to the house.

569
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,800
We are going to stop, though?

570
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,877
We are going to stop?

571
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,930
Closer!

572
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:32,184
And closer!

573
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:34,398
And closer!

574
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:41,720
You said you were going to die.

575
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:43,240
He said what?

576
00:37:43,953 --> 00:37:45,410
But is that all of us?

577
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:48,523
I won't stop you, sir.
But is this it?

578
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,920
- I think I should warn you...
- Not now!

579
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:48,920
My Lord Doctor.

580
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:53,440
My Lord Master.

581
00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:56,600
We are gathered...

582
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,234
for the end.

583
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,478
Just turn it round, land it!

584
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:11,280
- We are not going in there.
- I am not

585
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:14,052
leaving that man on his own.
Not today.

586
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,890
Land it!

587
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:25,333
Listen to me.

588
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:28,680
- You can't!
- It is a fitting paradox

589
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,457
that our salvation comes at the hands
of our most infamous child.

590
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,700
He's not saving you.

591
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,973
Don't you realise what he's doing?

592
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,975
That's mine.

593
00:39:40,457 --> 00:39:41,680
Look around you.

594
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,920
I've transplanted myself
into every single human being.

595
00:39:45,937 --> 00:39:48,760
But who wants a mongrel
little species like them?

596
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:53,000
Because now I can transplant myself
into every single Time Lord.

597
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:54,763
Oh, yes,

598
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,014
Mr President, sir,

599
00:39:57,332 --> 00:39:59,041
standing there all noble

600
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,608
and resplendent and decrepit

601
00:40:02,531 --> 00:40:04,560
think how much better
you're going to look...

602
00:40:05,618 --> 00:40:06,418
as me!

603
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:12,991
No, don't!

604
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:14,890
No, stop it!

605
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,080
Don't!

606
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:40,613
On your knees, mankind.

607
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,640
No, that's fine, that's good,
because you said salvation.

608
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,040
I still saved you, don't forget that.

609
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,060
The approach begins.

610
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:56,774
- Approach of what?
- Something is returning.

611
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,160
Don't you ever listen?

612
00:40:59,153 --> 00:41:01,560
That was the prophecy.
Not someone, something.

613
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:02,951
What is it?

614
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
They're not just
bringing back the species.

615
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:06,920
It's Gallifrey.

616
00:41:07,728 --> 00:41:08,680
Right here,

617
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
right now.

618
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,439
Donna. Where's Donna?

619
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:46,999
Oh, Doctor... please!

620
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,852
We're getting out of here.

621
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:54,560
This whole planet's
going to be knocked out of orbit.

622
00:41:54,886 --> 00:41:56,031
What about the Doctor?

623
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:58,120
He said he was dying.

624
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:07,160
But I... I did this.
I get the credit!

625
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,679
I'm on your side.

626
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:29,000
Come on, get out of the way,
get out of the way!

627
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:33,560
Somebody, please!

628
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:34,912
I've got you.

629
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:38,039
Wilf, don't... Don't!

630
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,279
I've got you. Come on. Go on.

631
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:56,486
But... this is fantastic, isn't it?

632
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,040
- The Time Lords restored.
- You weren't there...

633
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:04,071
in the final days of the War.

634
00:43:04,747 --> 00:43:06,440
You never saw what was born.

635
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:10,490
If the Timelock's broken, everything's
coming through, not just the Daleks,

636
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,278
but the Skaro Degradations,
the Horde of Travesties,

637
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,280
the Nightmare Child,

638
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,080
the Could-have-been King with his army
of Meanwhiles and Never-weres.

639
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,930
The War turned into hell.

640
00:43:22,926 --> 00:43:25,973
And that's what you opened,
right above the Earth.

641
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:28,599
Hell is descending.

642
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:32,360
- My kind of world.
- Just listen!

643
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:34,958
Cos even the Time Lords
can't survive that.

644
00:43:35,058 --> 00:43:38,274
We will initiate the Final Sanction.

645
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:41,120
The end of time will come...

646
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:43,254
at my hand.

647
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,341
The rupture will continue,
until it rips the Time Vortex apart.

648
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:49,558
That's suicide.

649
00:43:50,722 --> 00:43:51,360
We

650
00:43:52,073 --> 00:43:53,625
will ascend...

651
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:57,955
to become creatures
of consciousness alone.

652
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,844
Free of these bodies, free of time,

653
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:04,480
and cause and effect,

654
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,520
while creation itself ceases to be.

655
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,920
You see now?

656
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:12,029
That's what they were planning

657
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:14,732
in the final days of the War.

658
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,920
I had to stop them.

659
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:19,700
Then...

660
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:23,784
take me with you, Lord President.

661
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:27,631
Let me ascend into glory.

662
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:32,968
You are diseased.

663
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,399
Albeit a disease of our own making.

664
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,567
No more.

665
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,158
Choose your enemy well.

666
00:44:52,258 --> 00:44:53,629
We are many.

667
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,040
The Master is but one.

668
00:44:56,372 --> 00:44:58,080
But he's the President.

669
00:44:58,818 --> 00:45:00,759
Kill him,
and Gallifrey could be yours.

670
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:06,765
He's to blame, not me!

671
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:13,520
The link is inside my head.

672
00:45:15,937 --> 00:45:17,106
Kill me,

673
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:20,639
the link gets broken, they go back.

674
00:45:27,455 --> 00:45:29,976
You never would, you coward.

675
00:45:35,794 --> 00:45:36,814
Go on then.

676
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:39,173
Do it.

677
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:54,040
Exactly.

678
00:45:54,863 --> 00:45:57,600
It's not just me, it's him.
He's the link, kill him!

679
00:45:57,775 --> 00:46:00,090
The final act of your life

680
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:01,992
is murder.

681
00:46:03,225 --> 00:46:04,720
But which one of us?

682
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,079
Get out of the way.

683
00:47:05,414 --> 00:47:07,291
The link is broken.

684
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,800
Back into the Time War, Rassilon.

685
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:11,759
Back into hell.

686
00:47:12,713 --> 00:47:14,760
Gallifrey falling!

687
00:47:17,149 --> 00:47:20,911
Gallifrey falls!

688
00:47:21,761 --> 00:47:24,680
You'll die with me, Doctor.

689
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:25,982
I know.

690
00:47:39,507 --> 00:47:40,520
Get out of the way.

691
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:47,631
You did this to me!

692
00:47:49,614 --> 00:47:51,040
All of my life!

693
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,806
You made me!

694
00:47:57,881 --> 00:47:58,600
One!

695
00:48:00,729 --> 00:48:01,439
Two!

696
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:03,800
Three!

697
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,719
FOUR!

698
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:55,358
I'm alive.

699
00:48:58,961 --> 00:48:59,750
I've...

700
00:49:02,403 --> 00:49:03,341
There was...

701
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,211
I'm still alive.

702
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:56,304
They've gone, then?

703
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,794
Good-oh.

704
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:02,000
If you could let me out...?

705
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:08,920
Only, this thing seems to be
making a bit of a noise.

706
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:12,470
The Master...

707
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:16,119
left the nuclear bolt running.

708
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:19,680
It's gone into overload.

709
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:21,240
And that's bad, is it?

710
00:50:23,496 --> 00:50:26,148
cos all the excess radiation
gets vented inside there.

711
00:50:28,132 --> 00:50:29,302
Vinvocci glass.

712
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,029
Contains it.

713
00:50:33,462 --> 00:50:36,120
All 500,000 rads,
about to flood that thing.

714
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:40,049
Well, you'd better let me out, then.

715
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:43,799
Except it's gone critical.

716
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:48,537
Touch one control and it floods.

717
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:55,421
Even this would set it off.

718
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:00,719
I'm sorry.

719
00:51:01,953 --> 00:51:02,810
(Sure.)

720
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:06,583
Look, just leave me.

721
00:51:11,927 --> 00:51:13,560
OK. Right, then... I will.

722
00:51:14,686 --> 00:51:16,589
Cos you had to go in there,
didn't you?

723
00:51:17,401 --> 00:51:19,980
You had to go and get stuck,
oh, yes!

724
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:26,115
Cos that's who you are, Wilfred.

725
00:51:28,273 --> 00:51:29,693
You were always this.

726
00:51:32,146 --> 00:51:34,440
Waiting for me all this time.

727
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,054
Oh, really, just leave me.

728
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,120
I'm an old man, Doctor.
I've had my time.

729
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,929
Well, exactly. Look at you.

730
00:51:43,855 --> 00:51:45,279
Not remotely important.

731
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,599
But me...

732
00:51:52,398 --> 00:51:55,080
... I could do so much more.

733
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,514
So much more!

734
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:01,693
But this is what I get.

735
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,160
My reward.

736
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,520
And it's not fair!

737
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:31,160
Lived too long.

738
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:32,905
No...

739
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,760
no, no, please, please don't.
No, don't.

740
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:39,866
Don't... Please don't! Please!

741
00:52:43,057 --> 00:52:43,895
Wilfred...

742
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,639
it's my honour.

743
00:52:50,556 --> 00:52:54,159
Better be quick. Three, two, one.

744
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:46,280
What...?

745
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,067
Still with us?

746
00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:05,480
The system's dead.

747
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:10,039
I absorbed it all.

748
00:54:11,884 --> 00:54:13,600
Whole thing's kaput.

749
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,840
Now it opens, yeah.

750
00:54:21,535 --> 00:54:24,294
There we are then. Safe and sound.

751
00:54:26,278 --> 00:54:28,480
Mind you, you're in hell of a state.

752
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,744
You've got some battle scars there.

753
00:54:38,938 --> 00:54:39,701
But they've...

754
00:54:41,201 --> 00:54:42,204
Your face!

755
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:45,279
How did you do that?

756
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:54,963
It's started.

757
00:55:09,654 --> 00:55:13,320
It's no good. How long was
she lying there? It's like hypothermia!

758
00:55:13,481 --> 00:55:14,500
Try them again.

759
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,200
I did, it's engaged. Everyone's
dialling 999, I can't get through.

760
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,720
We've got to do something.
Wake her up. Donna?

761
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:22,840
Can you hear me?

762
00:55:33,776 --> 00:55:35,171
It's me, I'm here.

763
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:38,000
You're safe, you're home.

764
00:55:41,044 --> 00:55:42,139
But... I was...

765
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,217
What happened?

766
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:49,759
Did I miss something... again?

767
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,529
She's smiling.

768
00:56:05,123 --> 00:56:06,506
As if today wasn't bad enough.

769
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,760
Anyway...

770
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:14,780
Don't go thinking
this is goodbye, Wilf.

771
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,670
I'll see you again,

772
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:19,759
- one more time.
- What do you mean, when's that?

773
00:56:20,997 --> 00:56:23,520
Just keep looking. I'll be there.

774
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,970
Where are you going?

775
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:32,831
To get my reward.

776
00:56:54,499 --> 00:56:57,139
- I told you to stay behind.
- You looked like you needed help.

777
00:56:57,852 --> 00:57:00,273
Besides, you're the one
who persuaded me to go freelance.

778
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:02,520
Yeah, but we're being fired
at by a Sontaran.

779
00:57:03,638 --> 00:57:06,960
A dumpling with a gun. And this is
no place for a married woman.

780
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:09,559
Well, then.
You shouldn't have married me.

781
00:57:30,976 --> 00:57:33,400
If we go in here
and down to the factory floor

782
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,459
and down past that corridor,
then he won't know that we're here.

783
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:37,479
Mickey...

784
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,485
That was the maddest Christmas ever.

785
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:15,924
Mum doesn't know what happened.

786
00:58:16,024 --> 00:58:19,080
She got Mr Smith to put out
a story saying wi-fi went mad,

787
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,798
all over the world,
giving everyone hallucinations.

788
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,840
How else do you explain it?
Everyone with a different face...

789
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:29,959
But it's you!

790
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:34,471
You're...

791
00:58:38,401 --> 00:58:39,158
Mum?

792
00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:42,461
Mum!

793
00:58:43,637 --> 00:58:45,945
- What? What is it?
- It's him.

794
00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:47,546
It's the Doctor.

795
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,068
From the man over there.

796
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,759
So, Alonso...

797
01:00:12,803 --> 01:00:13,959
... going my way?

798
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,560
How do you know my name?

799
01:00:17,521 --> 01:00:18,805
I'm kinda psychic.

800
01:00:19,331 --> 01:00:20,439
- Really?
- Yeah.

801
01:00:22,353 --> 01:00:24,080
Do you know what I'm thinking
right now?

802
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:37,374
No, it's not just a story, no.
Every word of it is true.

803
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:40,693
I found my great grandmother's diary
in the loft.

804
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:44,400
She was a nurse in 1913, and she fell
in love with this man called John Smith.

805
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:47,520
Except he was a visitor...
from another world.

806
01:00:48,189 --> 01:00:50,265
She fell in love
with a man from the stars.

807
01:00:50,565 --> 01:00:52,159
And she wrote it all down.

808
01:00:54,256 --> 01:00:55,226
Thank you.

809
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:00,160
And who's it for?

810
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,968
- The Doctor.
- To the Doctor.

811
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:07,040
Funny, that's the name he used.

812
01:01:15,364 --> 01:01:17,479
Was she happy... in the end?

813
01:01:20,929 --> 01:01:22,637
Yes. Yes, she was.

814
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,919
Were you?

815
01:02:02,921 --> 01:02:04,480
Three cheers. Hip, hip...

816
01:02:04,681 --> 01:02:06,181
Hooray!

817
01:02:06,761 --> 01:02:09,960
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

818
01:02:10,254 --> 01:02:11,640
Right, come on then, you lot.

819
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,240
This photo is just with friends.

820
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,734
Come on. And I want all of you
in it, come on. That's it.

821
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:21,279
Well, friends, and Nerys.

822
01:02:22,785 --> 01:02:25,520
I'm only joking. Oh, look at her!

823
01:02:25,988 --> 01:02:28,280
- You made me wear peach.
- That's cos you are a peach.

824
01:02:28,948 --> 01:02:32,207
- Furry skin, stone inside, going off.
- OK, smile.

825
01:02:32,307 --> 01:02:33,895
Cheese!

826
01:02:36,176 --> 01:02:37,865
How about it, Wilfred?

827
01:02:38,516 --> 01:02:40,083
Well, it's never too late.

828
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:43,160
Will you behave, Minnie!
Honestly!

829
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,400
I'm going to catch that bouquet.

830
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,165
Oh, dear.

831
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:54,486
Dad...

832
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:07,040
And here you are, same old face.

833
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:09,040
Didn't I tell you
you'd be all right?

834
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,180
Oh! They've arrested Mr Naismith.

835
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,649
It was on the news. Crimes
undisclosed. And his daughter.

836
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,932
Both of 'em, locked up.

837
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,322
But I keep thinking,

838
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,781
Doctor,
there's one thing you never told me.

839
01:03:20,937 --> 01:03:22,981
That woman. Who was she?

840
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,280
I just wanted to give you this.

841
01:03:33,575 --> 01:03:34,689
Wedding present.

842
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:38,474
Thing is, I never carry money.
So I just popped back in time,

843
01:03:38,574 --> 01:03:40,826
borrowed a quid
off a really lovely man.

844
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:43,836
Geoffrey Noble, his name was.

845
01:03:45,926 --> 01:03:47,333
"Have it," he said.

846
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:50,443
"Have that on me."

847
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,060
Smile!

848
01:04:04,276 --> 01:04:06,103
Oh, don't tell me, it's a bill.

849
01:04:06,478 --> 01:04:08,011
Just what I need, right now.

850
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,360
A lottery ticket?!

851
01:04:11,364 --> 01:04:14,080
What a cheap present.
Who was that?

852
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:18,155
Still, you never know, it's a triple
rollover this week, I might get lucky.

853
01:04:21,384 --> 01:04:25,106
Come on, we're on a tight schedule,
oxtail soup at 2.30.

854
01:05:06,232 --> 01:05:09,404
I'm late, I've missed it. It's midnight.
Mickey'll be calling me everything.

855
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:11,975
- This is your fault.
- No, it's Jimbo!

856
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,878
He said he was going to give us a lift,
then he said his axle broke.

857
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:16,113
I can't help it.

858
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:20,372
- Get rid of him, Mum, he's useless.
- Listen to you! With a mechanic.

859
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,160
Be fair though, my time of life,
I'm not gonna do much better.

860
01:05:26,794 --> 01:05:28,040
Don't be like that.

861
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:31,840
You never know.
There could be someone out there.

862
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:35,079
Maybe. One day.

863
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,753
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year!

864
01:05:41,841 --> 01:05:44,359
- Don't stay out all night.
- Try and stop me.

865
01:05:53,195 --> 01:05:54,978
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah.

866
01:05:56,073 --> 01:05:57,400
Too much to drink?

867
01:05:57,919 --> 01:05:59,190
Something like that.

868
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,412
Maybe it's time you went home.

869
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:04,640
- Yeah.
- Anyway...

870
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,839
- Happy New Year.
- And you.

871
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:10,007
What year is this?

872
01:06:11,389 --> 01:06:12,910
Blimey, how much have you had?!

873
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,759
2005. January 1st.

874
01:06:18,472 --> 01:06:19,558
2005.

875
01:06:21,535 --> 01:06:22,686
_Tell you what...

876
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,960
... I bet you're going to have
a really great year.

877
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,120
See ya.

878
01:07:39,354 --> 01:07:41,224
We will sing to you, Doctor.

879
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:44,439
The universe will sing you
to your sleep.

880
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:29,443
This song is ending.

881
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,680
But the story never ends.

882
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:02,901
I don't want to go.

883
01:11:00,704 --> 01:11:04,202
Legs. I've still got legs, good.

884
01:11:05,847 --> 01:11:10,489
Arms. Hands.
Ooh, fingers, lots of fingers.

885
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:12,600
Ears, yes. Eyes, two.

886
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:16,157
Nose, I've had worse. Chin, blimey.

887
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,527
Hair...

888
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,440
I'm a girl!

889
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:25,520
No! No... I'm not a girl.
And still not ginger!

890
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:30,283
And something else,
something important, I'm, I'm...

891
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:34,519
Crashing!

892
01:11:52,091 --> 01:11:55,226
Geronimo!

893
