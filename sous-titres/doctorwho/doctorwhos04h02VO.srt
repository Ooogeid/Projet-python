00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,065
It is said that
in the final days of planet Earth,

2
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:14,805
everyone had bad dreams.

3
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:24,147
To the west of the north of that
world, the human race did gather,

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,615
in celebration of a pagan rite,
to banish the cold and the dark.

5
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:35,915
Each and every one
of those people had dreamt

6
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,045
of the terrible things to come.

7
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:40,165
But they forgot.

8
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,960
Because they must.

9
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,965
They forgot their nightmares
of fire and war and insanity.

10
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:50,485
They forgot.

11
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:53,225
Except for one.

12
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,571
They call it
the Legend of the Blue Box.

13
00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:10,685
Oh.

14
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:15,437
I've never been in here before.
I'm not one for churches

15
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:16,607
too cold.

16
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:21,525
This was the site of a convent,
back in the 1300s.

17
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:25,762
It's said a demon fell from the sky.

18
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:28,185
Then a man appeared.

19
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,304
A man in a blue box.

20
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:33,789
They called him
the sainted physician.

21
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,400
He smote the demon

22
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,344
and then disappeared.

23
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,072
That's a bit of a coincidence.

24
00:02:41,772 --> 00:02:44,392
It's said there's
no such thing as coincidence.

25
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,741
Who knows?

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,440
- Perhaps he's coming back.
- Oh, that would make my Christmas!

30
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,909
Ah! Now, sorry, there you are.

31
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:08,807
So, where were we?

32
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,465
I was summoned, wasn't I?

33
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:13,600
An Ood, in the snow,

34
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,452
calling to me.

35
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:18,267
I didn't exactly come straight here.
Had a bit of fun, y'know?

36
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:19,785
Travelled about. Did this and that.

37
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,225
Got into trouble, you know me.
It was brilliant.

38
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:26,145
I saw the Phosphorous Carousel
of the Great Magellan Gestadt.

39
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:29,280
Saved a planet
from the Red Carnivorous Maw.

40
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:33,226
Named a galaxy Alison.
Got married. That was a mistake.

41
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:37,625
Good Queen Bess, and let me tell
you, her nickname is no longer...

42
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,495
Anyway...

43
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:41,960
what d'you want?

44
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,227
You should not have delayed.

45
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:47,825
The last time I was here, you said
my song would be ending soon,

46
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,840
and I'm in no hurry for that.

47
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:52,027
You will come with me.

48
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,043
Hold on, better lock the TARDIS.

49
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
See? Like a car.

50
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:01,360
I locked it, like a car.

51
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,538
Like... it's funny.

52
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,320
No? Little bit?

53
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,160
Blimey, try to make an Ood laugh.

54
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,840
So how old are you now,
Ood Sigma?

55
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,325
Magnificent!

56
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,205
Oh, come on!
That is... splendid!

57
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,160
You've achieved
all this in how long?

58
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,160
100 years.

59
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:39,661
Then we've got a problem.

60
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,385
Cos all of this is way too fast.

61
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,184
Not just the city,
I mean your ability to call me.

62
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:48,044
Reaching all the way
back to the 21st century.

63
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,036
Something's accelerating
your species way beyond normal.

64
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,610
And the Mind of the Ood is troubled.

65
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:58,382
- Why, what's happened?
- Every night, Doctor...

66
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,216
every night, we have bad dreams.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,960
Returning, returning,
returning, it is slowly returning.

68
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,705
Through the dark and the fire
and the blood, always returning,

69
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,039
returning to this world.

70
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,249
It is returning, and he is returning.

71
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,727
And they are returning, but too late,

72
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:24,489
too late, far too late, he is come.

73
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:30,800
Sit with the Elder of the Ood
and share the dreaming.

74
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:33,322
So...

75
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,130
Right.

76
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:39,766
Hallo!

77
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,970
You will join, you will join,

78
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,929
you will join, you will join,

79
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:50,926
you will join, you will join,

80
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
you will join.

81
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,360
He comes to us.

82
00:06:57,805 --> 00:06:58,768
Every night.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,825
I think all the peoples
of the universe dream of him now.

84
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
- That man is dead.
- There is yet more.

85
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:07,407
Join us.

86
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,320
Events are taking shape.

87
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,773
So many years ago,
and yet changing the now.

88
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:15,704
There is a man...

89
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,268
..so scared.

90
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,040
Wilfred! Is he all right?

91
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:24,225
- What about Donna, is she safe?
- You should not have delayed,

92
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:27,540
for the lines of convergence
are being drawn across the Earth,

93
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,683
even now.

94
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,890
The king is in his counting house.

95
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:38,624
I don't know who they are.

96
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,218
And there is another.

97
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:44,730
The most lonely of all,
lost and forgotten.

98
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,187
The Master's wife.

99
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:50,720
We see so much,

100
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:52,720
but understand little.

101
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,040
The woman in the cage, who is she?

102
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,133
She was...

103
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:00,432
It w-wasn't her fault, she was...

104
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,954
The Master,
he's a Time Lord, like me.

105
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:08,659
I can show you.

106
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:12,932
The Master took the name of Saxon.

107
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:16,160
He married a human, a woman
called Lucy. And he corrupted her.

108
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,200
She stood at his side
while he conquered the Earth.

109
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:25,505
I reversed everything he'd done,
so it never even happened.

110
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,320
But Lucy Saxon remembered.

111
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,982
I held him in my arms.

112
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,178
I burnt his body!

113
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,615
The Master is dead!

114
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:42,640
And yet, you did not see...

115
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:46,960
What's that?

116
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,685
Part of him survived.

117
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:02,440
I have to go!

118
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,065
But something more
is happening, Doctor.

119
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,880
The Master
is part of a greater design.

120
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,366
Because a shadow
is falling over creation.

121
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:14,240
Something vast
is stirring in the dark.

122
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:20,270
The Ood have gained this power
to see through time

123
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,745
because time is bleeding.

124
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:26,151
Shapes of things once lost
are moving through the veil.

125
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:31,053
And these events from years ago
threaten to destroy this future,

126
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,760
and the present, and the past.

127
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:37,638
- What do you mean?
- This is what we have seen, Doctor.

128
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:41,265
The darkness heralds only one thing.

129
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:44,565
The end of time itself.

130
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:59,805
Events that have happened
are happening now.

131
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:39,602
Mrs Saxon.

132
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:41,960
Let me introduce myself.

133
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:44,913
I'm your new Governor.

134
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm afraid the previous Governor
met with something of an accident,

135
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:52,773
which took
quite some time to arrange.

136
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,378
Miss Trefusis, if you will prepare.

137
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:03,205
You kept your silence well,
Mrs Saxon.

138
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:07,320
Your trial was held
in secret, with no jury.

139
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:12,519
So, no-one knows
who Harold Saxon was.

140
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,080
Where he came from.

141
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:17,480
Why you killed him.

142
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,553
Make her kneel.

143
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:28,276
There are those of us
who never lost faith.

144
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:33,040
And in his wisdom, Harold Saxon
prepared for this moment.

145
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,800
He knew that he might die
and he made us ready.

146
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:40,403
Tonight, Mrs Saxon...

147
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,360
..he returns.

148
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:10,825
As it was written
in the Secret Books of Saxon,

149
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:12,823
these...

150
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,445
are the Potions of Life.

151
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:17,720
Listen to me!
Whatever he told you...

152
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:20,057
you've got no idea
what you're doing!

153
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,400
Miss Trefusis...

154
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,520
- the catalyst.
- What are you doing?

155
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:27,205
Leave me alone! Don't. Don't!

156
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:28,853
You were Saxon's wife.

157
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:30,400
You bore his imprint.

158
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,480
That's all we needed -

159
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:36,965
the final biometrical signature.

160
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,960
You can't bring him back, you can't!

161
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,705
I'm begging you!

162
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:00,680
Stop this now before it's too late!

163
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,800
We give ourselves...

164
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,903
that Saxon might live!

165
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,320
Can't you see?!
He lied to you!

166
00:13:12,853 --> 00:13:14,851
His name isn't even Harold Saxon!

167
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:17,698
And this was written also.

168
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,585
For his name is...

169
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:24,121
the Master!

170
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:25,693
Never.

171
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,367
Never.

172
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:28,845
Never. Never.

173
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:31,560
Never dying. Never dying!

174
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:34,000
Never dying! Never dying!

175
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:35,570
Never dying!

176
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,107
Oh, Lucy...

177
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,436
sweet Lucy Saxon.

178
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
My ever faithful.

179
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:57,225
Did the widow's kiss
bring me back to life?

180
00:13:57,325 --> 00:13:59,840
- You're killing them!
- Oh, let them die.

181
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,863
They're just the first.

182
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:07,160
The whole stupid stinking
human disgrace can fall into the pit.

183
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:11,760
Can't you hear it, Lucy?

184
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,234
The noise?

185
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:17,160
The drumbeat?
Louder than ever before.

186
00:14:19,717 --> 00:14:20,976
The drums,

187
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:22,885
the never-ending drums.

188
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,600
Oh, I have missed them!

189
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,133
But no-one knew you
better than I did.

190
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,800
I knew you'd come back.

191
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,951
And all this time, your disciples
have prepared.

192
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:36,360
But so have we!

193
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,385
What are you doing?

194
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:44,005
The Secret Books of Saxon
spoke of the Potions of Life.

195
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:48,577
And I was never that bright,
but my family had contacts.

196
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,680
People who were clever enough
to calculate the opposite.

197
00:14:52,973 --> 00:14:54,160
Don't you dare!

198
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,149
I'm ordering you, Lucy.

199
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,869
You will obey me!

200
00:14:57,969 --> 00:15:00,440
Till death do us part, Harry!

201
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,840
NO-O-O-O!

202
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,237
I think we might
be in luck, darling.

203
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:39,772
It's the footage from Broadfell
Prison the night it burnt down.

204
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:41,641
Take a look at this.

205
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:47,080
Someone survived!

206
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:48,793
Do you think it's him?

207
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,875
Oh, that would be
such a Christmas present.

208
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,245
You just leave it to Daddy.

209
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,524
Ladies and gentlemen,

210
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:06,487
it seems help is at hand.

211
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,318
Christmas is cancelled.

212
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:11,414
Prepare the gate.

213
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,101
Just going down to the Lion.

214
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:33,893
Quick little snifter.
Christmas drinks.

215
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,640
Right, ta-ra.

216
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:41,810
Paratroop One to Paratroop Two,

217
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,640
we are mobilised, I repeat,
we are mobilised.

218
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,080
Rendezvous 1300 hours.

219
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:48,550
Over and out.

220
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:54,760
Come on!

221
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,975
Shake a leg!

222
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:06,796
Right, come on, let's get going.

223
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,949
Everybody all right?
Who's got the chocolates, then?

224
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,279
He's tall and thin, wears
a brown suit, maybe a blue suit,

225
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,239
he's got a long brown coat.

226
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,953
Modern sort of hair,
all sticky-uppy, right?

227
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:27,484
Oh, and on page two,
be on the lookout for a police box.

228
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:29,100
Exactly like the old ones.

229
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,813
I got locked inside one of them -
August Bank Holiday 1962.

230
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:38,240
- Were you misbehaving, Minnie?
- I certainly was. Wa-hey!

231
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,025
Yeah, all right, all right.
Listen, this is important.

232
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,265
We have got to find it,
so phone around,

233
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:47,730
phone everybody.
Sally,

234
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,025
will you get onto the Bridge Club?
Winston, you try the Old Boys.

235
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,828
Bobby, want you to ring
the skiffle band, right?

236
00:17:53,928 --> 00:17:55,529
We've got the city covered.

237
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:57,469
- The Silver Cloak.
- Yeah.

238
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,625
Who is he, then, this Doctor?

239
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,960
No, I can't tell you that. I swear.

240
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,274
But answer me this -

241
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:09,120
have you been
having bad dreams? All of you?

242
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:12,720
Dreams you can't remember?

243
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:14,800
Yeah.

244
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:16,661
That's why we need him.

245
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:19,703
We need the Doctor.

246
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,827
More than ever.

247
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,840
- Onions with that?
- Oh, yeah, go on, pile 'em on.

248
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,165
What about you, Ginger?
Onions?

249
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:33,693
He don't say much.
Give him onions.

250
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
- He's down from Huddersfield.
- Well, you look after him.

251
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,114
And don't forget tomorrow night,
the Christmas broadcast.

252
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:45,665
President Obama,
he's promised to end the recession.

253
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,658
- Bad times will soon be over, Ginger.
- Well, season's greetings to you.

254
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:52,215
And you. Happy Christmas.

255
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,360
Now, what can we get you, sir?

256
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:01,904
Everything.

257
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:08,720
I am so hungry.

258
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:14,988
They're saying that
the President's got this grand plan.

259
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:19,321
He's going to save the world
with some big financial scheme.

260
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:22,653
Whatever it is,
I bet it won't reach you and me.

261
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,778
Somebody's lively on his feet.

262
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,422
Starving.

263
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,123
Now, y'see, that's what you don't
want to do - eat it all at once.

264
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:47,072
Tempting, I know.

265
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:49,667
But if you make it last,
it can last all day.

266
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,269
Want more.

267
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,500
Want cheese and chips.

268
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,804
And meat and gravy,
and cream and beer,

269
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:58,040
and pork and beef and fat,
and great big chunks of hot, wet red.

270
00:19:58,408 --> 00:19:59,504
Good for you, mate!

271
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:01,426
Maybe we'd better be going.

272
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:05,739
You look like that bloke.
Harold Saxon.

273
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,560
The one that went mad.

274
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:12,472
Isn't that funny?

275
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,046
Isn't that just the best thing of all?

276
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:19,652
The master of disguise,

277
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,551
stuck

278
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:23,421
looking like the old Prime Minister.

279
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,426
I can't hide anywhere!
He can see me,

280
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:31,760
he can smell me...
Can't let him smell me!

281
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,560
Doctor, Doctor, shockter
stopped-her, got to stop the smell!

282
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,920
The stink, the filthy, filthy stink!

283
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:40,781
Ginger.
Come with me, right now!

284
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:42,619
Because it's funny...!

285
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,261
Don't you see?

286
00:20:45,856 --> 00:20:47,080
Look at me!

287
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,360
I'm splitting my sides.

288
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,960
I am hilarious!

289
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:54,600
I am the funniest thing
in the whole wide world!

290
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,137
Sarah!

291
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,154
God help us!

292
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,031
There's this man...!

293
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:20,202
Dinnerti-i-i-ime!

294
00:23:39,036 --> 00:23:40,440
Please, let me help!

295
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,229
You're burning up
your own life force.

296
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:49,659
Oh, my gosh, Doctor,
you're a sight for sore eyes.

297
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:50,680
Out of my way!

298
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:54,400
Did we do it?
Is that him?

299
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,580
Tall and thin, big brown coat.

300
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,807
The Silver Cloak. It worked.

301
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:01,444
Cos Wilf phoned Netty,
who phoned June,

302
00:24:01,544 --> 00:24:03,767
and her sister lives
opposite Broadfell,

303
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:05,597
and she saw the police box,

304
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:08,796
and her neighbour
saw this man heading east.

305
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:11,081
Wilfred?
Have you told them who I am?

306
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:13,699
- You promised!
- No, I just said you were a doctor.

307
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:17,280
And might I say, sir,
it is an honour to see you again.

308
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,680
But you never said
he was a looker!

309
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,539
He's gorgeous, take a photo!

310
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:25,720
Not bad, eh?

311
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,120
- Me next!
- I'm Minnie. Minnie the Menace.

312
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,604
It's a long time since
I had a photo with a handsome man.

313
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:35,560
Just get off him,
leave him alone, will you?

314
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,505
Hush, you old misery.

315
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:40,120
Come on, Doctor. Give us a smile.

316
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,960
- That's it.
- Hold on...

317
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:43,680
Did it flash?

318
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,766
No, there's a blue light, try again.

319
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm all fingers and thumbs.

320
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:50,582
- I'm really kind of busy, y'know?
- Oh, it won't take a tick.

321
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:51,920
Keep smiling.

322
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:55,118
Is that your HAND, Minnie?!

323
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:57,040
Good boy.

324
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:05,402
Come on, then.
Here we are, hurry up.

325
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:08,520
Bye. You behave, bye.

326
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,278
Over here, come on.

327
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:16,225
What's so special about this place?
We passed 15 cafes on the way.

328
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,205
Yeah. Afternoon.

329
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:22,948
Oh, we had some good times,
didn't we, though?

330
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:25,124
All those Atmos things.

331
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:28,571
And planets in the sky.
And me with that paint gun, and...

332
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,156
I keep seeing things, Doctor, I...

333
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,385
This face. At night.

334
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,121
Who are you?

335
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm Wilfred Mott.

336
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,572
No, people have waited
hundreds of years to find me

337
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:48,520
and then you manage it in a few hours.

338
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:50,276
Well, I'm just lucky, I s'pose.

339
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:52,080
No, we keep on meeting, Wilf.

340
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,112
Over and over again. Like
something's still connecting us.

341
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:57,120
What's so important about me?

342
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,000
Exactly. Why you?

343
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:09,493
I'm going to die.

344
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,940
Well, so am I, one day.

345
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,617
- Don't you dare.
- All right, I'll try not to.

346
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:19,035
But I was told.

347
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,676
"He will knock four times."

348
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:26,545
That was the prophecy.

349
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:28,792
Knock four times, and then...

350
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:31,951
But I thought when I saw you before,
you said

351
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:33,678
your people could

352
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:36,206
change, like, your whole body.

353
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,704
I can still die.

354
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:41,960
If I'm killed before regeneration,
then I'm dead.

355
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:45,243
Even then.

356
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:49,303
Even if I change,
it feels like dying.

357
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,885
Everything I am dies.

358
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,405
Some new man
goes sauntering away...

359
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,625
And I'm dead.

360
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,170
What?

361
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm sorry. But I had to.
Look, can't you make her better?

362
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,183
Stop it.

363
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,720
No, but you're so clever.
Can't you bring her memory back?

364
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,022
Just go to her now, go on,
just run across the street,

365
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:22,580
go up and say hello.

366
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:24,056
If she ever remembers me,

367
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:26,240
her mind will burn,
and she will die.

368
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,152
Don't you touch this car!

369
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:35,245
- She's not changed.
- Nah.

370
00:27:37,227 --> 00:27:38,579
Oh, there he is...

371
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:40,460
Shaun Temple.

372
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:42,640
They're engaged.

373
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,645
Getting married in the spring.

374
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,024
- Another wedding.
- Yeah.

375
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,534
Hold on, she's not gonna be called
Noble-Temple?

376
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:54,807
- Sounds like a tourist spot.
- No, it's Temple-Noble.

377
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:55,925
Right.

378
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:58,795
Is she happy,

379
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:00,391
is he nice?

380
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:04,231
Yeah, he's sweet enough,
he's a bit of a dreamer.

381
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:06,615
Mind you, he's on minimum wage,

382
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:09,600
she's earning tuppence, so all they
can afford is a tiny little flat.

383
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:13,904
And then sometimes I see
this look on her face,

384
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,005
like she's so sad.

385
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:19,219
But she can't remember why.

386
00:28:21,422 --> 00:28:22,467
She's got him.

387
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,451
She's making do.

388
00:28:26,352 --> 00:28:27,372
Aren't we all?

389
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:31,612
Yeah, how about you?

390
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:34,277
- Who've you got, now?
- No-one.

391
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:37,881
Travelling alone.

392
00:28:41,665 --> 00:28:43,365
I thought it was better.

393
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,768
But I did some things.
It went wrong,

394
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:51,323
I need...

395
00:28:52,204 --> 00:28:53,104
My word.

396
00:28:58,146 --> 00:28:59,280
Merry Christmas.

397
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:00,716
Yeah, and you!

398
00:29:02,422 --> 00:29:03,472
Look at us.

399
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,000
But don't you see?

400
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:08,386
You need her, Doctor.

401
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:10,280
Wouldn't she make you laugh again?

402
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,690
Good old Donna?

403
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,669
And so it came to pass that the players
took their final places,

404
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,170
making ready the events
that were to come.

405
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:51,688
The madman,

406
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:53,869
sat in his empire

407
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:56,083
of dust and ashes,

408
00:29:57,511 --> 00:30:00,049
little knowing
of the glory he would achieve.

409
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:06,246
While his saviour
looked upon the wilderness,

410
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,601
in the hope of changing
his inevitable fate.

411
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:15,682
Far away,

412
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:18,640
the idiots and fools dreamt of a shining

413
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:20,412
new future.

414
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:24,249
A future now doomed to never happen.

415
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:28,698
As Earth rolled onwards into night,

416
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:31,821
the people of that world did sleep,

417
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:33,416
and shiver,

418
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:36,176
somehow knowing

419
00:30:36,707 --> 00:30:40,248
that dawn would bring only one thing...

420
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,678
The final day.

421
00:32:22,772 --> 00:32:23,972
I had estates.

422
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,046
Do you remember my father's land,
back home?

423
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:33,070
Pastures of red grass,

424
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:37,264
stretching far across the slopes
of Mount Perdition.

425
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:44,044
We used to run across
those fields all day,

426
00:32:45,057 --> 00:32:46,657
calling up at the sky.

427
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:53,626
Look at us now.

428
00:32:55,637 --> 00:32:57,087
All that eloquence.

429
00:32:58,283 --> 00:33:00,120
But how many people have you killed?

430
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:04,444
I am so hungry.

431
00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:06,993
Your resurrection went wrong.

432
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,890
That energy...

433
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:11,720
Your body's ripped open.

434
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:14,728
Now you're killing yourself.

435
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:17,280
That human Christmas out there,

436
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:19,320
they eat so much.

437
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:21,960
All that roasting meat.

438
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,280
Cakes and red wine.

439
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:25,368
Hot,

440
00:33:25,857 --> 00:33:27,360
fat, blood, food.

441
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:29,720
Pots, plates of meat

442
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:31,064
and flesh

443
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,200
and grease and juice,

444
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:35,560
and baking, burnt, sticky

445
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,904
hot skin, hot, it's so hot!

446
00:33:38,004 --> 00:33:40,054
- Stop it.
- Sliced, sliced...

447
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,180
- Stop it!
- It's mine, it's mine...

448
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,350
to eat and eat...

449
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,080
What if I ask you for help?

450
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:00,200
There's more at work than you and me.

451
00:34:01,147 --> 00:34:01,960
Oh, yeah?

452
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:05,113
I've been told, something is returning.

453
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,161
And here I am!

454
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,760
It was something more.

455
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,678
But it hurts. I was told

456
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,559
- the end of time.
- It hurts,

457
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,880
Doctor, the noise...

458
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,040
The noise in my head, Doctor,

459
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:21,469
one, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four,

460
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,400
stronger than ever before!

461
00:34:26,236 --> 00:34:27,280
Can't you hear it?

462
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,458
Listen, listen, listen!

464
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:35,972
Every minute, every second,

465
00:34:37,472 --> 00:34:39,462
every beat of my hearts,

466
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:42,455
there it is...

467
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:45,037
calling to me.

468
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:48,119
Please, listen

469
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:49,769
I can't hear it.

470
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:53,520
Listen.

471
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:02,224
But

472
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:04,306
that's...

473
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:06,120
What?

474
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,330
I heard it.

475
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:10,120
But there's no noise

476
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,329
there never has been,
it's just your insanity, it's the...

477
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:15,598
What is it?

478
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:18,240
What's inside your head?

479
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:20,899
It's real!

480
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:24,562
It's real!

481
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:26,840
It's real!

482
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,096
All these years,

483
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:49,240
you thought I was mad.

484
00:35:52,772 --> 00:35:54,372
King of the wasteland.

485
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,800
But something is calling me, Doctor,

486
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,520
what is it, what is it,

487
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:00,920
what is it?

488
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:24,698
Don't!

489
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,496
Let him go!

490
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,345
Now then, steady on,

491
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:08,869
never too early for margaritas,
that's what I say.

492
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:11,357
I forgot to get lemons
so I used oranges instead.

493
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:14,520
- It's all fruit, same difference.
- Now that's lovely.

494
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,044
Look at that.

495
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,475
Absolutely beautiful.

496
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:21,360
"Love from Donna."
Did you keep the receipt?

497
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:22,859
Yes, I did.

498
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,468
Come on Gramps, you've been
a right misery ever since you got up.

499
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:28,320
Do you like it, then? The book?

500
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,880
Joshua Naismith,
what d'you get me this for?

501
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:33,361
I don't know.

502
00:37:33,906 --> 00:37:35,792
I just saw it in the shop,

503
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,200
and thought of you.

504
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:41,932
It just felt like the sort of thing
you should have.

505
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:45,171
Now look at that,

506
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,163
that's from Charlie Morton,
isn't that rude?

507
00:37:57,044 --> 00:37:58,320
If you would, Mr Danes.

508
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:04,530
I'm starving.

509
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,422
You've my daughter to thank for this

510
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:08,965
it's all her idea.

511
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:12,949
She heard rumours of Harold Saxon.
His disciples, his return.

512
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:16,316
It's the sort of thing
she finds rather...

513
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:18,884
- thrilling.
- And I was right.

514
00:38:19,248 --> 00:38:20,248
He's back.

515
00:38:20,604 --> 00:38:22,904
The very man we need, and he's here.

516
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:27,976
This is going to be wonderful.

517
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,172
Here are the presents.

518
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:37,675
I couldn't afford much,
but not for long,

519
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:40,595
if President Obama
ends the recession tonight! C'mere!

520
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:43,240
Keep it quiet, you lot,
it's the Queen's Speech.

521
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,293
Now come on, sit down, show respect.

522
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:48,452
- Merry Christmas, Mr Mott.
- Thank you. Will you behave!

523
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:51,459
Honestly, all right now. She's on.

524
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,250
It's our sovereign.

525
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,525
Events are moving, Wilfred.

526
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:05,825
Faster than we thought.

527
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:07,816
Can you see that?

528
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:10,893
Frankly, I'd tell Her Majesty,
it's time for trouser-suits.

529
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:12,880
That's not...

530
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:14,710
Only you can see.

531
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,960
Only you stand at the heart
of coincidence.

532
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:19,974
Why, what have I done?

533
00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:21,960
You're an old soldier, sir.

534
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:24,429
Only you were too late.

535
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:27,198
The war was won and passed you by.

536
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:29,000
I did my duty.

537
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:31,511
You never killed a man.

538
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:33,285
No, I didn't.

539
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,983
No, I did not, no.

540
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:37,594
Don't say that like it's shameful.

541
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,363
The time will come...

542
00:39:40,637 --> 00:39:41,920
when you must take arms.

543
00:39:43,118 --> 00:39:44,218
Who are you?

544
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:47,979
Tell the Doctor nothing of this.

545
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:50,914
His life could still be saved.

546
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:54,273
So long as you tell him nothing.

547
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:57,657
I lost him.

548
00:40:58,047 --> 00:41:00,760
I was unconscious. He's still on Earth,
but he's too far away.

549
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,174
Listen, you can't park there,
what if Donna sees it?

550
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:04,631
You're the only one,

551
00:41:04,826 --> 00:41:07,026
the only connection
I can think of, you're involved

552
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:08,600
if I could work out how...

553
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:10,632
Tell me, have you seen anything,

554
00:41:10,732 --> 00:41:12,882
I don't know,
anything strange, anything odd?

555
00:41:13,192 --> 00:41:14,880
- Well, there was...
- What?

556
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,540
What is it? Tell me.

557
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,640
- No, it's nothing.
- Maybe something out of the blue,

558
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,660
connected to your life, something.

559
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:23,795
Donna was a bit strange.

560
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:27,240
She had a funny little moment,
all because of that book.

561
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,360
What book?

562
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:31,313
His name's Joshua Naismith.

563
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,600
That's the man.
I was shown him, by the Ood.

564
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,899
- By what?
- The Ood.

565
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:35,920
- The Ood?
- Just Ood.

566
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,326
It's all part
of the convergence, maybe...

567
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:41,543
maybe touching Donna's subconscious.

568
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:45,920
She's still fighting for us, even now.

569
00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:47,514
The Doctor-Donna.

570
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:49,021
Dad, what are you up to?

571
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:50,983
You!

572
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:52,583
But...

573
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:54,720
- Get out of here!
- Merry Christmas.

574
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:57,920
Merry Christmas, but she can't see you,
what if she remembers?

575
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,800
Mum, where are those tweezers?

576
00:42:00,275 --> 00:42:01,335
- Go!
- I'm going.

577
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,301
Me, too.

578
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,681
No, you don't!

579
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:05,979
Mum?

580
00:42:07,414 --> 00:42:08,264
Gramps?

581
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:09,924
Dad.

582
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,200
- I'm warning you...
- See you later.

583
00:42:12,911 --> 00:42:14,600
Bit old for hide and seek.

584
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,000
Stay right where you are!

585
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:18,716
- You can't come with me.
- Don't leaving me with her.

586
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,447
- Fair enough.
- Mum?

587
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,720
Just you listen to me.
I forbid it.

588
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,180
Get out of there!

589
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,040
Doctor, bring my father back,

590
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:27,401
right now!

591
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:30,000
Come back here!

592
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:33,469
Come back here, I said. Come back!

593
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,816
Are you shouting at thin air?

594
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:41,401
Possibly.

595
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,310
Naismith.

596
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:47,840
If I can track him down...

597
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:51,720
Right.

598
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,440
Bigger on the inside.
Do you like it?

599
00:42:56,094 --> 00:42:57,480
I thought it'd be cleaner.

600
00:42:58,005 --> 00:42:58,905
Cleaner?

601
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,072
I could take you back home, right now.

602
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:03,240
Listen, Doctor

603
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,871
if this is a time machine,

604
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:07,000
that man you're chasing,
why can't you just

605
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,830
pop back to yesterday and catch him?

606
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,647
I can't go back inside my own timeline

607
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:13,359
I have to stay relative
to the Master within the causal nexus,

608
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,359
- understand?
- Not a word.

609
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:17,651
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

610
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:31,200
Demonstrate.

611
00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:44,480
That's not from Earth.

612
00:43:45,421 --> 00:43:46,600
And neither are you.

613
00:43:47,678 --> 00:43:49,760
A perfect combination, don't you think?

614
00:43:50,454 --> 00:43:52,784
Excuse me, sir.
If I could check the basement?

615
00:43:52,884 --> 00:43:55,120
We're getting fluctuation
on the power cords.

616
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,160
Of course.

617
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,180
Miss Addams? If you could bring
the calibration statistics.

618
00:44:15,262 --> 00:44:17,440
Who the hell is he?
What if he finds out?

619
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:18,962
An expert, they said,

620
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:20,880
what sort of expert,

621
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,238
- who is he?
- I don't know.

622
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:28,351
According to the records,
Harold Saxon was Prime Minister of this

623
00:44:28,517 --> 00:44:31,870
stupid country.
I'm choking in this thing.

624
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:33,498
I'm sorry.

625
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:39,991
By the saints, that's better.

626
00:44:40,507 --> 00:44:42,569
These people are so flat!

627
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,865
But what do we do?

628
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:51,080
We were so close,
we almost had it working.

629
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:54,160
What if this visitor
is some sort of genius?

630
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:56,160
Think about it.

631
00:44:56,653 --> 00:45:00,040
We're hijacking this project,
maybe we can use him, too.

632
00:45:00,646 --> 00:45:01,764
Harold Saxon,

633
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,520
or whatever he is,

634
00:45:04,086 --> 00:45:06,697
might be exactly what we need.

635
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,320
The Gate was found inside a spaceship,

636
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:12,801
buried at the foot of Mount Snowdon.

637
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:15,274
It was moved to an institute
known as Torchwood,

638
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:17,149
but when Torchwood fell,

639
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:20,431
let's just say, I acquired it.

640
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:24,704
I like you.

641
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:26,493
Thank you.

642
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:28,602
You'd taste great.

643
00:45:31,508 --> 00:45:32,600
Mr Danes?

644
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,015
The visitor will be given food.

645
00:46:08,906 --> 00:46:09,680
Anyway.

646
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,640
The device came equipped
with its own power supply

647
00:46:14,776 --> 00:46:15,930
a Nuclear Bolt.

648
00:46:16,623 --> 00:46:20,106
One technician remains in charge
of the feedback, 24 hours a day.

649
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:23,306
The power feeds through to the Gate,

650
00:46:23,768 --> 00:46:26,487
where it encourages some sort
of cellular regeneration.

651
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:28,867
Miss Collins was our test subject.

652
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,415
She carried some burns, as a result
of an accident when she was a child,

653
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:33,770
down her left side.

654
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:35,086
If you could?

655
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,260
The Gate mended her.

656
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:41,280
Thank you.

657
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,280
- But what do you want it for?
- We calculate

658
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:47,400
that if this device can be
fully repaired by your good self,

659
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,710
it can restore the body, forever.

660
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,200
Hence its given title.
The Immortality Gate.

661
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:55,960
Because that's what I want.
Not for me,

662
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:57,922
but for my daughter.

663
00:46:58,722 --> 00:47:00,422
I want her never to die.

664
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:02,320
My gift to her.

665
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:04,491
She will be

666
00:47:05,143 --> 00:47:06,095
immortal.

667
00:47:07,393 --> 00:47:08,293
Abigail.

668
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,090
It means "bringer of joy".

669
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:26,674
Better get to work.

670
00:47:31,512 --> 00:47:33,612
We've moved! We've really moved!

671
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,694
- You should stay here.
- Not bloody likely!

672
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:37,040
And don't swear. Hold on.

673
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:41,440
Just a second out of sync.

674
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,800
Don't want the Master
finding the TARDIS.

675
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,840
That book said he's a billionaire,
he's got his own private army.

676
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:00,636
Down here.

677
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:16,288
We're getting encouraging results

678
00:48:16,388 --> 00:48:18,120
from the ratio-foldback.
Can you confirm?

679
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:19,640
The man's a miracle.

680
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,680
All the systems
are slotting back into place.

681
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:24,000
The shatterthreads have harmonised...

682
00:48:24,387 --> 00:48:26,233
and the multiple overshots
have triplicated.

683
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,760
- Nice Gate!
- Hello.

684
00:48:28,014 --> 00:48:29,605
Sorry.
Don't call security,

685
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:31,573
or I'll tell them
you're wearing a Shimmer,

686
00:48:31,673 --> 00:48:34,637
I reckon anyone wearing a Shimmer
doesn't want the Shimmer to be noticed.

687
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:37,312
- I'll need a Shimmer in a first place.
- I'm sorry?

688
00:48:37,412 --> 00:48:38,760
What's a Shimmer?

689
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:40,318
Shimmer.

690
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,151
My Lord.
She's a cactus!

691
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:46,640
Miss Addams?

692
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,375
Miss Addams.

693
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,390
If you'll just excuse me.

694
00:48:54,776 --> 00:48:55,476
Now,

695
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:57,640
please don't imagine I'm a slave-driver.

696
00:48:57,921 --> 00:49:00,040
We can resume work
on Boxing Day, Mr Saxon.

697
00:49:00,683 --> 00:49:01,683
My name...

698
00:49:03,726 --> 00:49:04,894
is the Master.

699
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,220
Excellent.

700
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:22,629
Excellent!

701
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:24,640
Mr Danes?

702
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,000
The visitor will be restrained.

703
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:28,080
What?

704
00:49:28,404 --> 00:49:30,600
- But I repaired it.
- I'm not an idiot.

705
00:49:31,714 --> 00:49:33,680
Don't let him anywhere near that thing.

706
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,920
He's got it working, but what is it?

707
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:44,360
What's working?

708
00:49:44,914 --> 00:49:46,204
What are you doing here?

709
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:48,303
Shimmer!

710
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:52,860
Now tell me, quickly,
what's going on? The Master,

711
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,040
Harold Saxon,

712
00:49:54,316 --> 00:49:57,000
Skeletor, whatever you're calling him,
what's he doing, up there?

713
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,040
Your reputation precedes you, sir.

714
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:04,607
I have no doubt you've laid traps.
Perhaps explosives.

715
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,153
A means of escape.

716
00:50:07,535 --> 00:50:08,535
Or murder.

717
00:50:09,158 --> 00:50:11,242
Everything you've done to the Gate
will be checked

718
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,795
and double-checked
before anyone stands inside.

719
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:18,280
I checked the readings,

720
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,812
he's done good work,

721
00:50:19,912 --> 00:50:21,413
- it's operational.
- Who are you?

722
00:50:21,513 --> 00:50:24,472
I met someone like you, brilliant
but he was little and red.

723
00:50:25,097 --> 00:50:26,280
That's a Zocci.

724
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,280
We're not Zocci, we're Vinvocci.

725
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,760
- Completely different.
- And the Gate is Vinvocci.

726
00:50:31,714 --> 00:50:33,221
We're a salvage team.

727
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,681
We picked up the signal
when the humans reactivated it,

728
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:38,280
and as soon as it's working,
we can transport it to the ship.

729
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:41,560
- But what does it do?
- Well, it mends,

730
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,932
it's a simple as that,
it's a medical device

731
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:46,172
to repair the body,
it makes people better.

732
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:50,981
There's got to be more.

733
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:54,320
Every single warning says the Master's
going to do something colossal.

734
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,760
So that thing's like a sickbed, yes?

735
00:50:57,127 --> 00:50:59,002
- More or less.
- Well, pardon me for asking

736
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:00,652
but why is it so big?

737
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:03,040
Good question. Why's it so big?

738
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:06,590
It doesn't just mend
one person at a time.

739
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:09,100
That would be ridiculous.

740
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:11,638
It mends whole planets.

741
00:51:14,234 --> 00:51:15,360
It does what?

742
00:51:16,037 --> 00:51:18,920
It transmits the medical template
across the entire population.

743
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:31,579
But it's time for the broadcast.

744
00:51:32,818 --> 00:51:34,600
The President's grand initiative.

745
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,251
You might want to see this, sir,

746
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:39,006
proof that the human race
can mend its own problems.

747
00:51:39,172 --> 00:51:41,926
And now, anticipation is rising

748
00:51:42,026 --> 00:51:44,120
as we go live to Washington.

749
00:51:44,422 --> 00:51:46,470
Here, on Christmas Day,

750
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,920
the President has promised
an instant and radical solution

751
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,280
to the worldwide depression.

752
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:54,640
Barack Obama will lead us all

753
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,200
into a new age of prosperity.

754
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,381
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

755
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:04,560
I'd like to speak briefly about

756
00:52:05,112 --> 00:52:06,760
the state of our economy...

757
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,518
Turn the Gate off, right now!

758
00:52:08,943 --> 00:52:09,953
At arms!

759
00:52:11,085 --> 00:52:13,120
Whatever you do,
don't let him near that device.

760
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,840
Like that was ever gonna happen.

761
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:29,141
Homeless, was I?

762
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:31,000
Destitute and dying?

763
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:33,328
Well, look at me now.

764
00:52:34,108 --> 00:52:36,805
Deactivate it.
All of you, turn the whole thing off!

765
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,890
He's...

766
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:41,480
inside my head.

767
00:52:44,982 --> 00:52:46,000
Get out of there!

768
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,280
Doctor!

769
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:52,680
Doctor, there's this face...

770
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,280
- What is it? What can you see?
- It's him.

771
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,640
I can see him!

772
00:52:57,183 --> 00:52:58,960
- I see him!
- There's something wrong...

773
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,520
It seems to be affecting the President.

774
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:11,640
- I can't turn it off.
- That's because I locked it, idiot.

775
00:53:11,952 --> 00:53:12,852
Wilfred!

776
00:53:14,537 --> 00:53:15,880
Get inside, get him out.

777
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,640
Just need to filter the levels.

778
00:53:25,016 --> 00:53:26,696
I can see again. He's gone.

779
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,564
Radiation shielding.
Press the button.

780
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:29,840
- What?
- I can't get out

781
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:32,160
until you press the button,
that button there.

782
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,960
50 seconds and counting.

783
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,020
To what?

784
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,040
You're gonna love this.

785
00:53:40,961 --> 00:53:42,480
He was hiding the codes.

786
00:53:42,742 --> 00:53:45,526
He's extrapolated the Gate's power,
a million times over.

787
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:47,300
But it's not affecting us.

788
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,450
He's set the template to human!

789
00:53:53,495 --> 00:53:54,295
Hello?

790
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:01,680
- Donna?
- Where are you?

791
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,166
It's Mum and Shaun

792
00:54:03,266 --> 00:54:05,000
- something's wrong.
- There's this face.

793
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,238
But wait a minute, what about you?

794
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,800
- Can't you see anything?
- I can see them,

795
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:13,320
that's bad enough.

796
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,760
Not now, Winston!

797
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:16,810
Wilfred!

798
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:18,426
Those dreams...

799
00:54:18,988 --> 00:54:20,000
I can remember

800
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,380
that face.

801
00:54:21,966 --> 00:54:23,040
There's a face.

802
00:54:23,863 --> 00:54:24,720
In my head.

803
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,220
Wilfred.

804
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,040
It's everyone!

805
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,400
What is it? Hypnotism?

806
00:54:30,694 --> 00:54:31,844
Mind control?

807
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,646
You're grafting your thoughts
inside them, is that it?

808
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,370
That's way too easy.

809
00:54:36,864 --> 00:54:38,964
They're not gonna think like me.

810
00:54:39,496 --> 00:54:40,960
They're gonna become me.

811
00:54:43,643 --> 00:54:44,343
And,

812
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,670
zero!

813
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:19,160
You can't have!

814
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,360
What is it?

815
00:55:32,091 --> 00:55:33,240
But they've changed!

816
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:35,414
Granddad,

817
00:55:36,072 --> 00:55:37,120
that's like...

818
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:40,240
like the sort of thing
that happened before!

819
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:41,680
My head.

820
00:55:46,254 --> 00:55:47,000
Doctor!

821
00:55:47,996 --> 00:55:49,720
She's starting to remember.

822
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:54,116
What is it?

823
00:55:54,523 --> 00:55:56,636
What have you done, you monster?

824
00:55:57,068 --> 00:55:59,040
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

825
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:00,989
Or to me?

826
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:03,480
Or to me?

827
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,590
Or to me?

828
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:09,092
Or to us?

829
00:56:09,758 --> 00:56:10,958
Breaking news.

830
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:12,634
I'm everyone.

831
00:56:13,214 --> 00:56:15,800
And everyone in the world is me!

832
00:56:16,121 --> 00:56:17,321
I'm President.

833
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:19,200
President of the United States.

834
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,410
Look at me!

835
00:56:24,479 --> 00:56:25,720
Financial solution.

836
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:27,317
Deleted.

837
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,320
The human race
was always your favourite, Doctor.

838
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:37,016
But now,

839
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,239
there is no human race.

840
00:56:39,752 --> 00:56:40,986
There is only...

841
00:56:41,656 --> 00:56:42,956
the Master race.

842
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,855
And so it came to pass,

843
00:57:41,612 --> 00:57:42,962
on Christmas Day,

844
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:46,927
that the human race did cease to exist.

845
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:49,439
But even then,

846
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:53,475
the Master had no concept
of his greater role in events.

847
00:57:53,943 --> 00:57:57,715
For this was far more
than humanity's end.

848
00:58:00,116 --> 00:58:01,866
This day, was the day

849
00:58:02,088 --> 00:58:05,932
upon which the whole of creation
would change forever.

850
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,701
This was the day...

851
00:58:09,374 --> 00:58:11,074
the Time Lords returned.

852
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:13,960
For Gallifrey.

853
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,381
For Gallifrey!

854
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,737
For victory!

855
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:18,178
For victory!

856
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:21,740
For the end of time itself!

857
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:25,772
For the end of time itself!

858
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,120
This is the Doctor's final battle.

859
00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:09,396
He must stand at arms.

860
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,680
Or lose himself and all this world.

861
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,685
A rhythm of four.

862
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:20,960
The heartbeat of a Time Lord.

863
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,062
The Master is going to kill you.

864
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,107
Then kill him first.

865
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:30,160
At last.

866
00:59:30,472 --> 00:59:33,080
Sometimes I think
a Time Lord lives too long.

867
