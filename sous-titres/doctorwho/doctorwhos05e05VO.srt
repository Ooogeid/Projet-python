1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,960
River?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,040
Follow that ship!

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,440
Has Dr Song explained
what we're dealing with?

4
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,480
What's it going to do to me?

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,120
Amy, not the eyes, look at the
angel but don't look at the eyes.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,920
The angel, as far as we know,
is still trapped in the ship,

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,056
our mission is to get
inside and neutralise it.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,480
All that radiation
spilling out, the drive burn.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,667
The crash of the Byzantium
wasn't an accident,

10
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:32,844
but a rescue mission.
We're in the middle of an army.

11
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:34,640
The statues are
advancing on all sides.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,520
No way up, no way back, no way out.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,640
I'm about to do something
incredibly stupid and dangerous.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,210
When I do...
jump.

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,720
- On my signal.
- What signal?

16
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:43,920
Won't miss it.

23
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:21,279
Up! Look up!

24
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:24,537
- You OK?
- What happened?

25
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,127
We jumped.

26
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:27,560
Jumped where?

27
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:29,240
Up, up, look up!

28
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:31,856
- Where are we?
- Exactly where we were.

29
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:33,721
- No we're not.
- Move your feet!

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,720
Doctor, what am I
looking at, explain.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,690
Come on, think!

32
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,720
The ship crashed with
the power still on, yeah?

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
So what else is still on?

34
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,560
The artificial gravity.
One good jump, and up we fell.

35
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:59,320
Shot out the grav-globe to give
us an updraft, and here we are!

36
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,279
The statues,
they look more like Angels now.

37
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,767
They're feeding on the radiation
from the wreckage, draining all

38
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,800
the power from the ship,
restoring themselves.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,600
Within an hour, they'll be an army!

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,240
They're taking out the lights.
Look at them, look at the Angels.

41
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,245
Into the ship, now,
quickly all of you!

42
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:22,365
But how?

43
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:26,707
It's just a corridor,

44
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:30,280
the gravity orientates to the floor.

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,800
Now, in here, all of you,
don't take your eyes off the Angels,

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,960
move!

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,800
OK, men, go!

48
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,520
The Angels, presumably
they can jump up too?

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,694
They're here, now.

50
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:47,160
In the dark, we're finished. Run!

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,066
This whole place is a death trap.

52
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:52,320
No, it's a time bomb. Well, it's
a death trap and a time bomb.

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,360
And now it's a dead end.
Nobody panic.

54
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:58,841
Just me then.
What's through here?

55
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,120
Secondary flight deck.

56
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:02,783
So we've basically run up
the inside of a chimney?

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,912
- So what if the gravity fails?
- I've thought about that.

58
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:08,720
And we'll all plunge to our
deaths. See, I've thought about it.

59
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,634
The security protocols are
still live.

60
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:12,718
There's no way to
override them, it's impossible.

61
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:14,227
- How impossible?
- 2 minutes.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,876
The hull is breached
and the power's failing.

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
- Incoming!
- Lights.

64
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,760
Clerics, keep watching them.

65
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:38,626
And don't look at their eyes
anywhere else, not the eyes.

66
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,800
I've isolated the lighting grid,
they can't drain the power now.

67
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:43,535
Good work.

68
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:46,040
Yes, good. Good in many ways,
good you like it so far...

69
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,936
So far?

70
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:48,960
Well, there's only one way
to open this door.

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,400
I guess I'll need to route
all the power in this section

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,480
- through the door control.
- Good, fine, do it.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Including the lights. All of them.
I'll need to turn out the lights.

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,018
How long for?

75
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:02,360
Fraction of a sec. Maybe longer.
Maybe quite a bit.

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,241
Maybe?

77
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:05,554
I'm guessing. We're attacked
by statues in a crashed ship,

78
00:04:05,674 --> 00:04:06,960
there's no manual for this!

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,408
We lost the torches,
we'll be in total darkness.

80
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:10,400
No other way.

81
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:12,247
Bishop?

82
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:16,629
Dr Song, I've lost good Clerics today.
You trust this man?

83
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:19,400
- I absolutely trust him.
- He's not some kind of madman then?

84
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,160
I absolutely trust him.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Excuse me.

86
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm taking your word, because you're
the only one who can manage this guy.

87
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,680
But that only works so long
as he doesn't know who you are.

88
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,499
You cost me any more men,
and I might just tell him.

89
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:34,619
Understood?

90
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,103
Understood.

91
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,262
- We've got your back.
- Bless you, Bishop.

92
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,906
Combat distance, ten feet.

93
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,360
As soon as the lights go down,
continuous fire.

94
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,080
Full spread over the hostiles, do not
stop firing while the lights are out.

95
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,360
Shot gun protocol,
we don't have bullets to waste.

96
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,120
When the lights go down,
the wheel should release.

97
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,258
- Spin it clockwise, 4 turns.
- 10.

98
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,720
- No, 4, 4 turns.
- Yeah, 4, I heard you.

99
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:00,023
Ready!

100
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:03,760
On my count then.

101
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,440
God be with us all.

102
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,773
Three... two... one.

103
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:12,920
Fire!

104
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,800
- Turn!
- Doctor, quickly!

105
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,640
It's opening, it's working.

106
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:26,293
Fall back!

107
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
- Quickly.
- Doctor!

108
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:00,669
What are you doing?

109
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:03,640
Magnetized the door.

110
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:05,880
Nothing could turn that wheel now.

111
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah?

112
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
Dear God!

113
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,600
Now you're getting it!

114
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,440
You've bought us time though,
that's good, I am good with time.

115
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:23,253
Seal that door, seal it now!

116
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:29,320
We're surrounded!

117
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:31,356
Seal it, seal that door.

118
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,600
- How long have we got?
- Five minutes, max.

119
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,080
- Nine.
- Five.

120
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,379
Five, right.

121
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,120
- Why d'you say 9?
- I didn't.

122
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,240
- We need another way out of here.
- There isn't one.

123
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,440
Of course there is.
This is a galaxy class ship,

124
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,289
goes for years between planet-falls.
So what do they need?

125
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:54,192
- Of course.
- Of course, what? What do they need?

126
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:55,480
Can we get in there?

127
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:58,720
Well, it's a sealed unit, but they
must have installed it somehow.

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,677
This whole wall should slide up.

129
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,894
There's clamps,

130
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,160
release the clamps!

131
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,674
What's through there?
What do they need?

132
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,055
They need to breathe.

133
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,960
But that's...

134
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,480
... That's a...

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,400
- It's an oxygen factory.
- It's a forest.

136
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,720
It's a forest,
it's an oxygen factory.

137
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:38,023
And if we're lucky, an escape route.

138
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,840
- Eight.
- What did you say?

139
00:07:44,985 --> 00:07:47,080
- Nothing.
- Is there another exit?

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Scan the architecture, we don't
have time to get lost in there.

141
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,323
On it! Stay where you are until
I've checked the Rad levels.

142
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,800
But trees! On a space ship?

143
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
Oh, more than trees, way better than
trees. You're going to love this.

144
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,400
Treeborgs...

145
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:05,798
Trees

146
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,160
plus technology.

147
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,920
Branches become cables,
become sensors on the hull,

148
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,400
a forest sucking in starlight,
breathing out air.

149
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,560
It even rains,
there's a whole mini-climate.

150
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,053
It is an eco-pod running
through the heart of the ship.

151
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:22,480
A forest in a bottle, on a space ship,
in a maze. Have I impressed you yet?

152
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,524
- Seven.
- Seven?

153
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,402
- Sorry, what?
- You said seven.

154
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,680
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

155
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,720
There's an exit, far end of the
ship, into the Primary Flight Deck.

156
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,120
- That's where we need to go.
- Plotting a safe path.

157
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,120
- Quick as you like!
- <i>Doctor?</i>

158
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,680
<i>Excuse me, hello, Doctor</i>

159
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,840
<i>Angel Bob here, sir.</i>

160
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:50,360
There you are, Angel Bob,
how's life? Sorry, bad subject.

161
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
<i>The Angels are wondering
what you hope to achieve.</i>

162
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:54,619
Nothing, we're just hanging.

163
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:56,840
It's nice in here, consoles,
comfy chairs, a forest.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,440
How's things with you?

165
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
<i>The Angels are feasting, sir.</i>

166
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,280
<i>Soon we will be able to absorb
enough power to consume this vessel,</i>

167
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,854
<i>this world, and all
the stars and worlds beyond.</i>

168
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,040
Well, we've got comfy chairs,
did I mention?

169
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,800
<i>We have no need of comfy chairs.</i>

170
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,080
I made him say comfy chairs!

171
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,160
Six.

172
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:19,680
Enough chat.
What have you done to Amy?

173
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,320
<i>There's something in her eye.</i>

174
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,160
- What's in her eye?
- <i>We are.</i>

175
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,800
What's he talking about?

176
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,640
Doctor, I'm five.

177
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,000
I mean, five.

178
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,320
Fine! I'm fine.

179
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
You're counting.

180
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,600
- Counting?
- You're counting down. From ten.

181
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,440
- You've been for a few minutes.
- Why?

182
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,840
- I don't know.
- Well, counting down to what?

183
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:46,266
I don't know.

184
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,960
<i>We shall take her.
We shall take all of you.</i>

185
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,174
<i>We shall have dominion
over all time and space.</i>

186
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,880
Get a life, Bob.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
Oops, sorry again.

188
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,613
There's power on this ship,
but nowhere near that much.

189
00:09:58,733 --> 00:09:59,945
<i>With respect, sir,</i>

190
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:03,080
<i>there is more power on this ship
than you yet understand.</i>

191
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,280
Dear God, what is it?

192
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
They're back.

193
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:12,760
<i>It's hard to put in your terms,
Dr Song,</i>

194
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,321
<i>but as best I understand it,
the Angels are laughing.</i>

195
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,493
Laughing?

196
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,680
<i>Because you haven't noticed yet.</i>

197
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,680
<i>The Doctor in the TARDIS
hasn't noticed.</i>

198
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:27,853
No, wait, there's something I've...

199
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
... missed.

200
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,240
That's like the crack
from my bedroom wall

201
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,040
from when I was a little girl.

202
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
Two parts of space and time
that should never have touched.

203
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,520
OK, enough, we're moving out!

204
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,520
- Agreed. Doctor?
- Yeah. Fine!

205
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
- What are you doing?
- Right with you.

206
00:10:59,102 --> 00:11:01,704
- We're not leaving without you!
- Oh, yes you are. Bishop?

207
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,800
Miss Pond, Dr Song, now!

208
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,760
Doctor, come on!

209
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,199
So, what are you?

210
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
Oh, that's bad.

211
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,160
Ah, that's extremely very not good.

212
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,449
Do

213
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,640
not... blink.

214
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,312
Amy, what's wrong?

215
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,474
Why am I not dead then?

216
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,840
Good, and not so good.

217
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,840
Oh, this isn't even
a little bit good.

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,180
I mean, is that it?

219
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,400
Is that the power
that brought you here?

220
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,360
That's pure time energy,
you can't feed on that, that's the fire

221
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,040
at the end of the universe.

222
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,625
I'll tell you something else...

223
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,200
Never let me talk!

224
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:27,783
Amy, what's wrong?

225
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,280
4.

226
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,309
Med-scanner, now!

227
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:46,910
Dr Song, we can't stay here,
we've got to keep moving.

228
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:48,960
We wait for the Doctor.

229
00:12:51,163 --> 00:12:53,269
Our mission is to make this
wreckage safe,

230
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,640
and neutralise the Angels,
until that is achieved...

231
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,400
Father Octavian, when the Doctor
is in the room, your only mission

232
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,240
is to keep him alive long enough
to get everyone else home,

233
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:03,720
and trust me, it's not easy.

234
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,440
If he's dead back there,
I'll never forgive myself,

235
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:09,081
and if he's alive,
I'll never forgive him.

236
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:13,170
And, Doctor, you're standing right
behind me, aren't you?

237
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,471
I hate you!

238
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:18,800
You don't. Bishop,
the Angels are in the forest.

239
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,037
We need visual contact
on every line of approach.

240
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,566
How did you get past them?

241
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,756
I told them the crack was
the end of the universe.

242
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:25,760
What was it?

243
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,320
The end of the universe.
Let's have a look then.

244
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,000
- So, what's wrong with me?
- Nothing, you're fine.

245
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,491
Everything, you're dying.

246
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,280
Yes, you're right, if we lie to her,
she'll get all better. Right, Amy!

247
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,984
What's the matter with Amelia?

248
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:41,165
Something's in her eye,
what does that mean?

249
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,040
- Busy.
- Scared!

250
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,680
- Course, you're dying, shut up!
- Let him think.

251
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,699
What happened?
She stared at the Angel.

252
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,600
She looked into it's eyes
for too long...

253
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,240
Sir! Angel, incoming!

254
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:55,763
And here.

255
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
Keep visual contact,
do not let it move!

256
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:03,840
Come on, wakey!

257
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,040
She watched an Angel climb
out of the screen, and, and...

258
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,560
The image of an Angel is an Angel.

259
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,320
A living image in a human mind.

260
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,160
We stare at them to stop them
getting closer, we don't blink,

261
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,960
and that's what they want,
cos if our eyes are open,

262
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,080
they can climb inside.
There's an Angel in her mind.

263
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:22,643
Three.

264
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:27,929
Doctor, it's coming,
I can feel it, I'm going to die!

265
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:29,533
Please just shut up, I'm thinking.

266
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:33,240
Now counting, what's that about?
Bob, why are they making her count?

267
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,960
- <i>To make her afraid, sir.</i>
- But why, what for?

268
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,160
<i>For fun, sir.</i>

269
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:46,924
What's happening to me?
Explain!

270
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:50,767
Inside your head, in the vision centres
of your brain, there's an Angel.

271
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:53,413
It's like there's a virtual screen
inside your mind,

272
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:57,080
and the Angel is climbing out of it,
and it's coming to shut you off.

273
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,807
Then what I do?

274
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,784
If it was a real screen
we'd pull the plug,

275
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:04,640
but we can't just knock her out,
the Angel would take over!

276
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,200
Then what? Quickly!

277
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,840
We've got to pull the plug,

278
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,368
starve the Angel.

279
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:11,600
She's got seconds.

280
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,239
- How would you starve your lungs?
- I'd stop breathing.

281
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,513
Close your eyes!

282
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:17,680
No. I don't want to.

283
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,537
Good, because that's not you,
that's the Angel, it's afraid! Do it!

284
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
Close your eyes!

285
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,635
She's normalising.

286
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,760
You did it!

287
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,160
You did it!

288
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,680
Sir? Two more incoming.

289
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,080
Three more over here.

290
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,640
Still weak, dangerous to move her.

291
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,520
Can I open my eyes now?

292
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Listen to me. If you open your eyes now
for more than a second, you will die.

293
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:59,920
The Angel is still inside you.
We haven't stopped it,

294
00:16:00,385 --> 00:16:01,528
we've just sort of,

295
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:03,160
paused it.

296
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,230
You've used up your countdown.
You cannot open your eyes.

297
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,840
We're too exposed here,
we have to move on.

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,560
We're exposed everywhere, and Amy can't
move, and that's not the plan.

299
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,960
- There's a plan?
- I don't know yet. Right!

300
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,000
Father, you and your Clerics
will stay here, look after Amy.

301
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,680
If anything happens to her,

302
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,600
I'll hold you personally
responsible, twice.

303
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,072
River, you and me,

304
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,590
we're going to find the
Primary Flight Deck which is...

305
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,000
straight ahead.

306
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,400
We'll stabilise the wreckage,
stop the Angels, and cure Amy.

307
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:34,320
How?

308
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:36,080
- I'll do a thing.
- What thing?

309
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:38,840
It's a thing in progress,
respect the thing. Moving out!

310
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,680
Doctor, I'm coming with you,

311
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:42,604
my Clerics can look after Miss Pond.

312
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,600
These are my best men, they'd lay
down their lives in her protection.

313
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,520
- I don't need you. I don't care.
- Where Dr Song goes, I go.

314
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
What?

315
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:53,577
You two engaged or something?

316
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:57,193
Yes. In a manner of speaking.

317
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:01,253
Marco, you're in charge
till I get back.

318
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:02,761
Sir!

319
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,930
Doctor... Please.
Can't I come with you?

320
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,666
You'd slow us down, Miss Pond.

321
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,191
I don't want to sound selfish,
but you'd really speed me up.

322
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:15,885
You'll be safer here,
we can't protect you on the move.

323
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:18,702
I'll be back for you
soon as I can, I promise.

324
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:21,719
- You always say that.
- I always come back.

325
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:26,400
Good luck everyone, behave,
do not let that girl open her eyes.

326
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:29,928
And keep watching the forest,
stop those Angels advancing.

327
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:33,480
Amy, later!
River, going to need your computer.

328
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah.

329
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,103
Later.

330
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:49,830
You need to start trusting me,
it's never been more important.

331
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:51,880
But you don't always
tell me the truth.

332
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,679
If I always told you the truth,
I wouldn't need you to trust me.

333
00:17:57,835 --> 00:18:00,880
The crack in my wall.
How can it be here?

334
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:03,238
I don't know yet,
but I'm working it out.

335
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,589
Now, listen.

336
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:08,395
Remember what I told you
when you were seven?

337
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:11,635
- What did you tell me?
- No, no...

338
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,313
That's not the point.

339
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:18,160
You have to remember.

340
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,513
Remember what?

341
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:27,755
Doctor?

342
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,610
Doctor?

343
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
What's that?

344
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,600
Readings from a crack in a wall.

345
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,911
How that be the end of the universe?

346
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,326
Here's what I think.
One day there'll be a very big bang.

347
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:45,880
So big every moment in history,
past and future, will crack.

348
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,600
Is that possible? How?

349
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:50,045
How can you
be engaged in a manner of speaking?

350
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,256
Well...

351
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,486
Sucker for a man in uniform.

352
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,040
Dr Song is in my personal custody.

353
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:06,920
I released her from the Stormcage
Containment Facility four days ago,

354
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:08,814
and I am legally responsible for her

355
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:11,863
until she has accomplished
her mission and earned her pardon.

356
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,851
Just so we understand each other.

357
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:19,440
You were in Stormcage?

358
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:22,760
What? What is that?

359
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,840
The date! The date of the explosion!
Where the crack begins.

360
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:30,284
And for those of us who can't
read the base code of the universe?

361
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:34,075
Amy's time!

362
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,560
So. What's happening?
Anything happening out there?

363
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,337
The Angels are still grouping.

364
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,456
Are you getting this too?

365
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,280
- The trees is dead?
- What's wrong with the trees?

366
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:56,478
Here too, sir. They're ripping
the Treeborgs apart.

367
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,120
And here,
they're taking out the lights.

368
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,160
What is it, what's happening?
Tell me, I can't see.

369
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,319
It's the trees, ma'am.
The trees are going out.

370
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,726
It doesn't open it from here.

371
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:16,343
But it's the Primary Flight Deck,

372
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,896
this has got to be a
service hatch or something.

373
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:21,086
Hurry up and open it,
time's running out.

374
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:24,216
What did you say? Time's
running out, is that what you said?

375
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:27,200
- Yeah, I just meant...
- I know what you meant, hush!

376
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,000
But what if it could?

377
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,880
- What if what could?
- Time. What if time could run out?

378
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:34,346
Got it!

379
00:20:35,137 --> 00:20:36,737
Angels advancing, sir.

380
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,103
Over here, again.

381
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:44,400
Weapons primed, combat distance
five feet, wait for it!

382
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,920
What is it?
What's happening, just tell me!

383
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,800
Keep your position and,
ma'am, keep your eyes shut!

384
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:51,109
Wait!

385
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,717
The ship's not on fire, is it?

386
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:05,719
It can't be, the compressors
would have taken care of it.

387
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:12,944
Marco, the Angels have gone.

388
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,200
- Where'd they go?
- What, the Angels?

389
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,280
- This side's clear too, sir.
- The Angels have gone?

390
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:21,836
There's still movement out there,
but away from us now.

391
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:24,719
- It's like they're running.
- Running from what?

392
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,683
Phillip, Crispin,

393
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,999
need to get a closer look at that.

394
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,999
What are you all looking at?
What's there?

395
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:44,960
Cracks in time, time running out...
No, couldn't be.

396
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,454
How is a duck pond a duck pond
if there aren't any ducks?

397
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,200
And she didn't recognise the Daleks!

398
00:21:50,504 --> 00:21:54,474
OK, time can shift, time can change,
time can be rewritten.

399
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:02,600
It's like, I don't know...
a curtain of energy.

400
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:03,944
Sort of shifting.

401
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:05,700
Makes you feel weird.

402
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:09,120
Sick. And you think
it scared the Angels?

403
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:11,008
What could scare those things?

404
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,830
- What are you doing?
- Point me at the light.

405
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,494
- You can't open your eyes.
- Not for more than a second,

406
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:20,160
that's what the Doctor said.
Still got a bit of countdown left.

407
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,089
- Ma'am, you can't.
- I need to see it.

408
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,941
Am I looking the right way?
I have to be quick.

409
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:27,055
Very quick!

410
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:29,569
OK.

411
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,280
It's the same shape!
It's the crack in my wall.

412
00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:43,933
Close your eyes. Now!

413
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:47,239
It's following me!
How can it be following me?

414
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:55,440
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

415
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,000
It was the same shape!

416
00:22:57,485 --> 00:23:00,160
Marco, you want
me to get a closer look at that?

417
00:23:00,804 --> 00:23:01,804
Go for it.

418
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,280
- Don't get too close.
- Hang on, what about the other two?

419
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:08,600
- Why not just wait till they're back?
- What other two?

420
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:10,600
The ones you sent before.

421
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:12,681
I didn't send anyone before.

422
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:15,160
You did, I heard you.
Crispin and Phillip.

423
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:17,320
Crispin and who?

424
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,720
Dr Song. Get through, now.

425
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,080
Doctor?

426
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,256
Doctor?

427
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,354
Time can be unwritten.

428
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,520
Amy, there never was
a Crispin or a Phillip

429
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,231
on this mission.
I promise you.

430
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,818
No, I heard you.

431
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:42,061
Before you sent Pedro,
you sent Crispin and Phillip,

432
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:43,984
and now you can't
even remember them.

433
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:45,594
Something happened,

434
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:48,520
I don't know what,
and you don't even remember!

435
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:51,480
- Pedro?
- Yeah, before you sent Pedro.

436
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,139
Who's Pedro?

437
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,916
It's been happening
and I haven't even noticed!

438
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,221
We've have to move.

439
00:23:58,341 --> 00:24:00,920
The CyberKing! A giant cyberman walks
over all of Victorian London

440
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,243
and no-one remembers.

441
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:04,040
We have to move it!

442
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,462
Never mind the Angels,
there's worse here than Angels!

443
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:13,080
I beg to differ, sir.

444
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:16,139
Let him go.

445
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:19,473
Well, it can't let me go, sir,
not while you're looking at it.

446
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:21,514
I can't stop looking at it,
it'll kill you.

447
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:23,875
It'll kill me anyway.
Think it through.

448
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,123
There's no way out of this.
You have to leave me!

449
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:27,602
Can't you wriggle out?

450
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:31,640
No, it's too tight.
There's nothing you can do.

451
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:33,236
Something's happening!

452
00:24:33,356 --> 00:24:35,960
Pedro was here a second ago
and now you can't even remember him!

453
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,482
There never was a Pedro, there's
only ever been the two of us here!

454
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:42,280
No, there were five of us,
why can't you remember?

455
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,148
Listen, listen,

456
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,320
I need to get a closer look
at that light, whatever it is.

457
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:49,919
Don't worry, I won't get too close.

458
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,704
No, you can't, you mustn't.

459
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,834
Spare communicator,

460
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:57,831
- I'll stay in touch the whole time.
- You won't.

461
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,960
If you go back there what happened
to the others will happen to you!

462
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,250
- There weren't any others!
- There won't be any you

463
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,599
if you go back there.

464
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:08,241
Two minutes. I promise.

465
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:13,188
Please, just listen to me!

466
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,392
Sir, there's nothing you can do.

467
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:22,720
- You're dead if I leave you.
- Yes,

468
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,127
yes, I'm dead.

469
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:25,680
Before you go

470
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,313
- I'm not going!
- Listen to me, it's important!

471
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,542
- You can't trust her.
- Trust who?

472
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:33,696
You think you know her,
but you don't.

473
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:36,240
You don't understand
who or what she is.

474
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,729
- Then tell me.
- I've told you more than I should.

475
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:40,800
Now, please, you have to go,

476
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,481
it's your duty to your friends.

477
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:44,555
Just tell me why she was
in Stormcage?

478
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:46,280
She killed a man.

479
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:48,320
A good man,

480
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,479
a hero to many.

481
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,240
- Who?
- You don't want to know.

482
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,707
You really don't.

483
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:54,200
Who did she kill?

484
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,680
The Angels are coming,
you have to leave me.

485
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,120
You'll die.

486
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:03,582
I will die in the knowledge that
my courage did not desert me at the end.

487
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:06,880
For that I thank God

488
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:10,000
and bless the path that
takes you to safety.

489
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:15,760
I wish I'd known you better.

490
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:17,413
I think, sir,

491
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:19,988
you know me at my best.

492
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:24,080
Ready?

493
00:26:25,847 --> 00:26:26,847
Content.

494
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,080
There's a teleport!
If I can get it to work,

495
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,511
we can beam the others here.
Where's Octavian?

496
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:45,320
Octavian's dead. So is that
teleport, you're wasting your time.

497
00:26:45,628 --> 00:26:47,696
I'm going to need your communicator.

498
00:26:53,206 --> 00:26:54,359
Are you there?

499
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:58,958
<i>I'm here,</i>

500
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:00,630
<i>I'm fine.</i>

501
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:02,760
<i>I'm quite close to it now.</i>

502
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,916
Then come back!
Come back now, please.

503
00:27:06,653 --> 00:27:09,520
<i>It's weird looking at it.
It feels really...</i>

504
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:13,929
Really what?

505
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,318
Really what?

506
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:25,920
Please say you're there!

507
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:33,103
<i>Is that you?</i>

508
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:36,960
- Are the Clerics with you?
- They've gone.

509
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,707
There was a light
and they walked into the light.

510
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:41,560
They didn't even
remember each other.

511
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:43,522
No. They wouldn't.

512
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,517
- What is that light?
- Time running out.

513
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:47,840
Amy, I'm sorry,
I should never have left you there.

514
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,520
What do I do now?

515
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,360
You come to us. Primary Flight Deck,
other end of the forest.

516
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:54,480
I can't see! I can't open my eyes.

517
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,680
Turn on the spot.
Just do it, turn on the spot.

518
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,011
<i>When the communicator sounds
like my screwdriver,</i>

519
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:03,102
<i>that means you're facing the right way.
Follow the sound.</i>

520
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,880
<i>You have to start moving now.
There's time energy</i>

521
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,000
spilling out of that crack
and you have to stay ahead of it.

522
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,080
But the Angels, they're everywhere.

523
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,977
I'm sorry, I really am,
but the Angels can only kill you.

524
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:25,800
- What does the Time Energy do?
- Just keep moving!

525
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,840
Tell me!

526
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,520
If the Time Energy catches up with you,
you'll never have been born. It will erase

527
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,873
<i>every moment of your existence.
You will never have lived at all.</i>

528
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,029
Keep your eyes shut

529
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,240
and keep moving!

530
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,160
- It's never going to work.
- What else have you got?

531
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,720
River, tell me!

532
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:07,559
- What's that?
- The Angels running from the fire.

533
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,960
They came here to feed on the time
energy, now it's going to feed on them.

534
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:12,600
Amy, listen to me,

535
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,055
<i>I'm sending a bit
of software to your communicator.</i>

536
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:18,160
<i>It's a proximity detector, it'll beep
if there's something in your way.</i>

537
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,400
<i>You just manoeuvre
till the beeping stops.</i>

538
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,800
Because, Amy, this is important,

539
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,680
<i>the forest is full of Angels.</i>

540
00:29:28,387 --> 00:29:30,240
You're going to have to
walk like you can see.

541
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:32,079
Well, what do you mean?

542
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,760
<i>Look, just keep moving.</i>

543
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:39,920
That time energy.
What's it going to do?

544
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,480
Keep eating.

545
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,920
- How do we stop it?
- Feed it.

546
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,240
- What?
- A big

547
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,678
space-time event,
should shut it up for a while.

548
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:51,320
- Like what, for instance?
- Like me, for instance!

549
00:30:00,026 --> 00:30:00,920
What's that?

550
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:02,400
It's a warning.

551
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:07,280
There are Angels round you now.

552
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,560
Amy, listen to me.
This is going to be hard but I know

553
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,679
you can do it.

554
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,440
The Angels are scared

555
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,014
<i>and running. Right now
they're not that interested in you.</i>

556
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:25,760
<i>They'll assume you can see them,
and their instincts will kick in.</i>

557
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:29,080
<i>All you've got to do is
walk like you can see.</i>

558
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:32,191
Just don't open your eyes.

559
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:35,802
Walk like you can see.

560
00:30:41,036 --> 00:30:43,400
You're not moving.
You have to do this.

561
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:46,284
<i>Now.</i>

562
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,760
You have to do this!

563
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,436
I can't find the communicator!

564
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,640
I dropped it! I can't find it.

565
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,920
Don't open your eyes. You're on
the Flight Deck, the Doctor's here,

566
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,320
I teleported you. See?

567
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:31,200
Told you I could get it working.

568
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:32,880
I could bloody kiss you.

569
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:34,920
Ah well, maybe when you're older.

570
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:38,800
What's that?

571
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,456
The Angels are draining the last
of the ship's power. Which means...

572
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:44,704
the shield's going to release!

573
00:33:00,356 --> 00:33:01,906
Angel Bob, I presume.

574
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:05,624
The Time Field is coming.
It will destroy our reality.

575
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:08,400
And look at you, all running away.
What can I do for you?

576
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,181
There is a rupture in time.

577
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:13,040
The Angels calculate that if
you throw yourself into it,

578
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,139
it will close,
and they will be saved.

579
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,320
Yeah, could do, could do that.
But why?

580
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:19,440
<i>Your friends would also be saved.</i>

581
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,988
- Well, there is that.
- I've travelled in time.

582
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:24,437
I'm a complicated space/time event too,
throw me in.

583
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:26,924
Be serious! These Angels
are more complicated than you,

584
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:29,763
and it would take every one of them
to amount to me, so get a grip.

585
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,640
- Doctor, I can't let you do this.
- No, seriously, get a grip.

586
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,989
- You're not going to die here!
- No, I mean it.

587
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:37,120
River, Amy, get a grip.

588
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:38,927
You genius!

589
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:40,640
Sir,

590
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,602
<i>the Angels need you
to sacrifice yourself now.</i>

591
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,719
Thing is, Bob, the Angels are draining
all the power from this ship,

592
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,760
every last bit of it.
And you know what?

593
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,760
I think they've forgotten
where they're standing. I think

594
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,451
they've forgotten the gravity
of the situation.

595
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:56,280
Or to put it another way, Angels...

596
00:33:57,006 --> 00:34:00,320
You hold on tight
and don't you let go for anything.

597
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,120
Night-night.

598
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,244
Ah, bruised everywhere.

599
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,233
Me too.

600
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,650
You didn't have
to climb out with your eyes shut.

601
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,760
Neither did you, I kept saying.

602
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,040
The Angels all fell

603
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,205
into the time field, the Angel

604
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:01,200
in your memory never existed.

605
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:04,213
It can't harm you now.

606
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:06,534
Then why do I remember it at all?

607
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:09,276
Those guys on the ship
didn't remember each other.

608
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:11,360
You're a time traveller now, Amy.

609
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:14,766
Changes the way you see
the universe.

610
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:17,450
Forever. Good, isn't it?

611
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:21,393
And the crack.

612
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:23,690
Is that gone too?

613
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,623
Yeah.

614
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,889
But the explosion that caused it is

615
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:32,045
still happening...

616
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,280
somewhere out there.

617
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:39,408
Somewhere in time.

618
00:35:58,098 --> 00:35:59,528
You, me...

619
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:01,872
handcuffs.

620
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:05,856
Must it always end this way?

621
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:09,241
What now?

622
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:12,722
The prison ship's in orbit,

623
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,843
they'll beam me up any second.

624
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,880
I might have done enough
to earn a pardon this time,

625
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,284
we'll see.

626
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,893
Octavian said you killed a man.

627
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,081
Yes, I did.

628
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:29,849
A good man.

629
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:33,798
A very good man.

630
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:36,200
The best man I've ever known.

631
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:40,597
Who?

632
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:45,120
It's a long story, Doctor,
can't be told, it has to be lived.

633
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:46,975
No sneak previews.

634
00:36:49,026 --> 00:36:50,200
Except for this one.

635
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,796
You'll see me again quite soon,

636
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,560
when the Pandorica opens.

637
00:36:58,085 --> 00:36:59,491
The Pandorica.

638
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,200
That's a fairy tale.

639
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,155
Aren't we all?

640
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:14,400
- I'll see you there.
- I look forward to it.

641
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:16,120
I remember it well.

642
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:21,332
Bye, River.

643
00:37:22,357 --> 00:37:23,320
See you, Amy.

644
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:26,306
I think that's my ride.

645
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,080
Can I trust you, River Song?

646
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:30,160
If you like.

647
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:33,044
But where's the fun in that?

648
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:55,379
What are you thinking?

649
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,723
Time can be rewritten.

650
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:11,683
I want to go home.

651
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:20,840
No, not like that!

652
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:25,507
I just want to show you something.

653
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:27,460
You're running from River.

654
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:29,827
I'm running too.

655
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,416
- Well!
- Yeah!

656
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,377
- Blimey!
- I know.

657
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:50,160
- This is the same night we left?
- We've been gone five minutes.

658
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:56,939
I'm getting married in the morning.

659
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:00,003
Why did you leave it here?

660
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:02,928
Why did I leave my engagement ring
when I ran away with a strange man

661
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:04,809
- the night before my wedding?
- Yeah.

662
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:07,460
You really are an alien, aren't you?

663
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:10,103
- Who's the lucky fella?
- You met him.

664
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,760
The good looking one,
or the other one?

665
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:16,920
- The other one.
- He was good too.

666
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:18,240
Thanks.

667
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:22,280
So do you comfort a lot of people
on the night before their wedding?

668
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,760
- Why would you need comforting?
- I nearly died.

669
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,925
I was alone, in the dark,
and I nearly died.

670
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,440
- And it made me think.
- Well, yes, natural.

671
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,080
- I think sometimes. Lots of times...
- About what I want.

672
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:37,400
About who I want.
You know what I mean?

673
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah...

674
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,545
About who...

675
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,720
- I want.
- Right, yeah...

676
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,487
- No, still not getting it.
- Doctor. In a word.

677
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:57,680
In one very simple word
even you can understand...

678
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,876
- You're getting married in the morning!
- The morning's a long time away.

679
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:04,116
What are we going to do about that?
Listen to me.

680
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm 907 years old.
Do you understand what that means?

681
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,009
- It's been a while?
- No, no! I'm 907,

682
00:40:10,129 --> 00:40:12,283
and look at me.
I don't get older, I just change.

683
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:14,840
You get older, I don't,
and this can't ever work.

684
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:18,600
You are sweet, Doctor.
But I really wasn't suggesting

685
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,560
anything quite so... long term.

686
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:27,492
But you're human! You're Amy!
You're getting married in the morning!

687
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,040
In the morning.

688
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,326
Doctor?

689
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,600
It's you. It's all about you,
everything,

690
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:35,240
it's about you.

691
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:38,763
Hold that thought!

692
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:41,340
Amy Pond...

693
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:45,719
Mad, impossible Amy Pond.
I don't know why, I have no idea,

694
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,480
but quite possibly the single most
important thing in the history

695
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:51,400
of the universe
is that I get you sorted out right now.

696
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,446
That's what I've been
trying to tell you!

697
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:54,566
Come on!

698
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:59,309
Doctor!

699
00:41:02,123 --> 00:41:05,210
And for those of us who can't read
the base code of the universe?

700
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:07,183
Amy's time!

701
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,960
Rory, we need to talk
about your fiancée.

702
00:41:14,717 --> 00:41:16,280
I'm sending you somewhere...

703
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:18,680
- together!
- What? Like a date?

704
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:21,320
Venice! Venezia!

705
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:23,880
Something happens in there,
something evil.

706
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:26,800
Pale, creepy girls
who don't like sunlight.

707
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:29,340
Am I thinking what
I think I'm thinking?

708
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,200
- Vampires!
- In Venice!

709
00:41:31,673 --> 00:41:33,360
This whole thing is mental!

710
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,176
- The people upstairs are very noisy!
- There aren't any people upstairs.

711
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:47,920
I knew you were going to say that,
did anyone else?

712
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,160
Move!

713
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:53,280
- You need someone on the inside.
- No! Are you insane?

714
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,010
We don't have another option.

715
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,520
You have no idea how dangerous you make
people to themselves when you're around.

716
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,833
- Amy, come back!
- I'll be fine!

717
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,480
They're Vampires, for God's sake.
We hope!

718
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,520
So if they're not Vampires...
