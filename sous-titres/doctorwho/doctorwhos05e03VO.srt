1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,228
- Can't we shut that ruddy thing up?
- If wishes were kisses...

2
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:07,959
Hostile 36, confirm.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,640
- Able Victor Charlie down.
- 26 and 41 detailed to intercept.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,680
41?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,159
That's... that's Reg's squadron.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,800
How many?

7
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:24,127
Looks like a dozen Heinkel at least,
sir. With Messerschmitts flanking.

8
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:26,880
- Out of range?
- Normally, sir, yes.

9
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:32,480
Well, then.

10
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,520
Time to roll out the secret weapon!

00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:36,883
Amy...

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,840
Winston Churchill.

19
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:40,880
Doctor?

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,240
Is it you?

21
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:45,047
Oh, Winston, my old friend!

22
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,297
Every time!

23
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:51,360
- What's he after?
- TARDIS key, of course.

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,142
Think of what I could achieve with
your remarkable machine, Doctor!

25
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:57,039
The lives that could be saved!

26
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,627
Ah, doesn't work like that.

27
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,880
Must I take it by force?

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,880
I'd like to see you try.

29
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:06,303
At ease.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,559
You rang?

31
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:11,549
So you've changed your face, again.

32
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,715
Yeah, well, had a bit of work done.

33
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,836
Got it, got it, got it!
Cabinet War Rooms, right?

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,560
Top secret heart of the
War Office, right under London.

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
- You're late, by the way.
- Requisitions, sir.

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,869
- Late?
- I rang you a month ago.

37
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,135
Really? Sorry.
Sorry, it's a Type 40 TARDIS.

38
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:30,873
I'm just running her in.

39
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:35,632
Something the matter, Breen?

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,307
You look a little down in the dumps.

41
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:39,929
No, sir. Fine, sir.

42
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:42,760
Action this day, Breen!
Action this day!

43
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,470
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:50,335
Excuse me, sir, got another
formation coming in, Prime Minister.

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,278
- Stukas, by the look of them.
- We shall go up top then, Grp Cpt!

46
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:54,680
We'll give 'em what for!

47
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,613
- Coming, Doctor?
- Why?

48
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,407
I have something to show you.

49
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:12,944
We stand at a crossroads, Doctor.

50
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,120
Quite alone,
with our backs to the wall.

51
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,960
Invasion is expected daily.

52
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,840
So I will grasp with both hands

53
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:24,680
anything
that will give us an advantage

54
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:27,000
over the Nazi menace.

55
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,040
Such as?

56
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:34,840
Follow me.

57
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:41,160
Doctor, this is
Professor Edwin Bracewell.

58
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,440
Head of our Ironsides Project.

59
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,421
How d'you do?

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,318
Oh, Doctor...

61
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
it's...

62
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:09,800
History.

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,680
Ready, Bracewell?

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
Aye-aye, sir.

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,000
On my order!

66
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:16,823
Fire!

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,759
What was that?

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,120
That wasn't human,

69
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,033
that was never human technology.
That sounded like...

70
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:31,680
Show me! Show me what that was!

71
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,560
Advance!

72
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,429
Our new secret weapon!

73
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:45,925
What do you think?
Quite something, eh?

74
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:48,320
What are you doing here?

75
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:51,486
<i>I am your soldier.</i>

76
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:52,418
What?

77
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:54,880
- <i>I am your soldier.</i>
- Stop this.

78
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Stop now!

79
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,898
You know who I am,

80
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:01,560
you always know.

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,207
<i>Your identity is unknown.</i>

82
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:06,356
Perhaps I can clarify things here,

83
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,560
this is one of my Ironsides.

84
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,720
Your what?

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,315
You will help the Allied cause
in any way that you can?

86
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:15,255
<i>Yes.</i>

87
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,059
Until the Germans
have been utterly smashed?

88
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:18,971
<i>Yes.</i>

89
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:21,144
And what is your ultimate aim?

90
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,320
<i>To win the war!</i>

91
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,800
They're Daleks!
They're called Daleks!

92
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,520
They are
Bracewell's Ironsides, Doctor! Look!

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,720
Blueprints, statistics, field-tests,

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,920
photographs. He invented them!

95
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,280
Invented them?

96
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,720
Oh, no, no, no!

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,735
Yes! He approached one of our
brass hats a few months ago.

98
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:45,201
Fella's a genius.

99
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:47,440
A Scottish genius, too.
Maybe you should listen to...

100
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:53,680
He didn't invent them!

101
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:55,280
They're alien.

102
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,840
Alien?

103
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,200
And totally hostile!

104
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:10,239
Precisely. They will win me the war!

105
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,633
Why won't you listen? Why call me in
if you won't listen to me?!

106
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,079
When I rang you a month ago,
I must admit, I had my doubts.

107
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,665
The Ironsides seemed too
good to be true.

108
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,400
Yes! Right! So destroy them!
Exterminate them!

109
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:31,033
But imagine what I could do with a
hundred! A thousand!

110
00:06:31,153 --> 00:06:32,480
I am imagining.

111
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:40,920
Amy, tell him.

112
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,152
- Tell him what?
- About the Daleks!

113
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:45,025
What would I know about the Daleks?

114
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:47,243
Everything.
They invaded your world, remember?

115
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,480
Planets in the sky,
you don't forget that!

116
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,949
Tell me you remember the Daleks.

117
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,359
Nope, sorry.

118
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:11,434
And 6... 2357, over!

119
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,446
2357, over!

120
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:18,120
So they're up to something.
But what is it?

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,060
What are they after?

122
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,288
Well, let's just ask, shall we?

123
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,040
<i>Can I be of assistance?</i>

124
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,326
Oh. Yes. Yes!

125
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:34,600
See, my friend reckons
you're dangerous.

126
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,600
That you're an alien. Is it true?

127
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,778
<i>I am your soldier.</i>

128
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:43,266
Yeah. Got that bit. Love a squaddie.
What else, though?

129
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:45,156
<i>Please excuse me.</i>

130
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,848
<i>I have duties to perform.</i>

131
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,769
Winston, Winston, please.

132
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,466
We are waging total war, Doctor!

133
00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:57,447
Day after day, the Luftwaffe pound
this great city like an iron fist.

134
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:01,028
- Wait till the Daleks get started.
- Men, women and children slaughtered.

135
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,603
Families torn apart.
Wren's churches in flame.

136
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,840
Yeah? Try the Earth in flames!

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,960
I weep for my country,

138
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,040
I weep for my empire.

139
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,659
It is breaking my heart.

140
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,667
But you're resisting, Winston!
The whole world knows it!

141
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,384
You're a beacon of hope.

142
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:17,960
But for how long?

143
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,997
Millions of innocent lives
will be saved

144
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,406
if I use these Ironsides now!

145
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:27,652
<i>- Can I be of assistance?</i>
- Shut it!

146
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:29,600
Listen to me. Just listen!

147
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,605
The Daleks have no conscience,
no mercy.

148
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:34,599
No pity.

149
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,787
They are my oldest
and deadliest enemy.

150
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,960
You cannot trust them!

151
00:08:41,503 --> 00:08:43,343
If Hitler invaded hell,

152
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:46,149
I would give a favourable reference
to the Devil!

153
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:49,465
These machines will
be our salvation!

154
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:52,299
Oh, the all-clear.

155
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:55,905
We are safe. For now.

156
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:09,863
Doctor, it's the all-clear.

157
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,290
Are you OK?

158
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:14,280
What does hate look like, Amy?

159
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:15,961
Hate?

160
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:18,963
It looks like a Dalek.

161
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:21,428
And I'm going to prove it.

162
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:34,931
<i>Would you care for some tea?</i>

163
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,356
That would be very nice. Thank you.

164
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:41,075
All right, Prof!
The PM's been filling me in.

165
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:44,232
Amazing things,
these Ironsides of yours.

166
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:46,640
Amazing.
You must be very proud of them.

167
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,400
Just doing my bit.

168
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:50,480
Not bad for a Paisley boy.

169
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,190
Yes, I thought I detected a familiar
cadence, my dear.

170
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,200
How did you do it?
Come up with the idea?

171
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,178
How does the muse of invention
come to anyone?

172
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,612
But you get a lot of these
clever notions, do you?

173
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:05,716
Well, ideas just seem
to teem from my head!

174
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,400
Wonderful things!
Like... let me show you.

175
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:12,271
Some musings on the potential of
hypersonic flight.

176
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,867
Gravity bubbles that could sustain life
outside of the terrestrial atmosphere!

177
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:19,132
- Came to me in the bath!
- And are these your ideas or theirs?

178
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:22,603
No. These robots are entirely
under my control, Doctor.

179
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,217
They are... Thank you...
the perfect servant,

180
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:27,552
and the perfect warrior.

181
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,098
I don't know
what you're up to, Professor,

182
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:32,461
but whatever they've promised,
you cannot trust them!

183
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,506
Call them what you like,
the Daleks are death!

184
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:38,373
Yes, Doctor. Death to our enemies!

185
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:42,493
Death to the forces of darkness,
and death to the Third Reich!

186
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,760
Yes, Winston,
and death to everyone else too!

187
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,760
<i>Would you care for some tea?</i>

188
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:52,080
Stop this! What are you doing here?
What do you want?

189
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,400
<i>We seek only to help you.</i>

190
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,360
- To do what?
<i>- To win the war.</i>

191
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,668
Really? Which war?

192
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:04,160
<i>- I do not understand.</i>
- This war? Against the Nazis?

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,725
Or your war? The war against
the rest of the Universe?

194
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:09,720
The war against
all life-forms that are not Dalek?

195
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:15,576
<i>I do not understand.
I am your soldier.</i>

196
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:17,456
Oh, yeah? OK.

197
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:23,040
OK, soldier, defend yourself!

198
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,600
- What the devil...?!
- <i>You do not require tea?</i>

199
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,600
Stop it! Prime Minister, please!

200
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
Doctor, please,
these machines are precious.

201
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:34,560
Come on!

202
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,080
Fight back! You want to, don't you?

203
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,120
- You know you do!
- I must protest!

204
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,040
What are you waiting for?
You hate me. You want to kill me.

205
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,920
Well, go on! Kill me.

206
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,619
- Kill me!
- Doctor, be careful!

207
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:49,840
<i>Please desist from striking me.</i>

208
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
<i>I am your soldier.</i>

209
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,600
You are my enemy!
And I am yours!

210
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,040
You are everything I despise!

211
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:03,198
The worst thing in all creation.

212
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:07,050
I've defeated you time and time
again, I've defeated you.

213
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:11,120
I sent you back into the void! I saved
the whole of reality from you!

214
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:13,280
I am the Doctor!

215
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,535
And you are the Daleks!

216
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,575
<i>Correct.</i>

217
00:12:30,788 --> 00:12:32,794
<i>Review testimony.</i>

218
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,653
<i>I am the Doctor.</i>

219
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:36,914
<i>And you are the Daleks!</i>

220
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:40,240
Testimony? What are you
talking about, testimony?

221
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:42,773
<i>Transmitting testimony now.</i>

222
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:44,880
Transmit what, where?

223
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:55,309
<i>Receiving testimony now.</i>

224
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:58,072
<i>'I am the Doctor!</i>

225
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,360
<i>'And you are the Daleks!'</i>

226
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,600
<i>Progenitor activated.</i>

227
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:05,884
<i>Testimony accepted!</i>

228
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,832
<i>Testimony accepted!</i>

229
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,933
Get back! All of you! Marines!

230
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,160
Get in here!

231
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,520
Stop it! Stop it, please!
What are you doing?

232
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,864
You are my Ironsides!

233
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,960
- <i>We are the Daleks!</i>
- But I created you!

234
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,880
<i>No.</i>

235
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:35,000
<i>We created you!</i>

236
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,740
<i>Victory!
Victory!</i>

237
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,220
<i>Victory!</i>

238
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,219
What just happened, Doctor?

239
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,594
I wanted to know what they wanted.

240
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:56,137
What their plan was.

241
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,426
I was their plan!

242
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,680
<i>Commencing Phase Two.</i>

243
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,594
<i>The Progenitor</i>

244
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,492
<i>is activated!</i>

245
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:23,274
<i>It begins!</i>

246
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:27,591
"Testimony accepted!"
That's what they said! My testimony.

247
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,724
Don't beat yourself up.

248
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,501
What do we do? Is this what we do now?
Chase after them?

249
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,020
This is what I do.
It's dangerous, so wait here.

250
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:38,520
You mean I've got to stay safe down
here in the middle of the London Blitz?

251
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,953
Safe as it gets around me.

252
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,477
What does he expect us to do now?

253
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,833
- KBO, of course.
- What?

254
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:04,966
Keep buggering on!

255
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,320
- Prime Minister.
- Yes?

256
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,988
Signal from RDF, sir.

257
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:22,520
Unidentified object.

258
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,142
Hanging in the sky,
Captain Childers says.

259
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,684
We can't get a proper fix.
It's too far up.

260
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:29,360
What do you think, Miss Pond?

261
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,200
The Doctor's in trouble and now
we know where he is.

262
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,528
Yeah. Cos he'll be on that ship,
won't he?

263
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:37,270
- Right in the middle of everything.
- Exactly!

264
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,425
Put that light out!

265
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:57,203
<i>The final phase commences,</i>

266
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,920
<i>channel all reserve power to</i>

267
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,175
<i>Progenitor.</i>

268
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:07,960
How about that cuppa now, then?

269
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,680
<i>It is the Doctor! Exterminate!</i>

270
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,280
Wait, I wouldn't if I were you!
TARDIS self-destruct.

271
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,840
You know what that means.
My ship goes, you all go with it.

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,800
<i>You would not use such a device.</i>

273
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,840
Try me.

274
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,263
No scans!
No nothing!

275
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,821
One move and I'll destroy us all,
you got that?

276
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,578
TARDIS bang-bang, Daleks boom!

277
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:31,400
Good boy.

278
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:34,480
This ship's pretty beaten up,

279
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,040
running on empty, I'd say, like you.

280
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,560
When we last met,

281
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,990
you were at the end of your rope.

282
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:42,232
Finished.

283
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:44,760
- <i>One ship survived.</i>
- And you fell

284
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,931
back through time, yes?
Crippled?

285
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:48,040
Dying?

286
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,095
<i>We picked up a trace.</i>

287
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,720
<i>One of the Progenitor devices.</i>

288
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,840
Progenitor?
What's that when it's at home?

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,754
<i>It is our past.</i>

290
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,676
<i>And our future.</i>

291
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,840
That's deep.
That is deep for a Dalek.

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,273
- What does it mean, though?
- <i>It contains pure Dalek DNA,</i>

293
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:07,680
<i>thousands were created,
all were lost,</i>

294
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,165
<i>save one.</i>

295
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,239
OK, but there's still one thing

296
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,840
I don't get, though, if you've got
the Progenitor, why build Bracewell?

297
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:16,176
<i>It was...</i>

298
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,400
<i>necessary.</i>

299
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,543
But why?

300
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:22,697
I get it.

301
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,600
I get it!
I get it

302
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,239
this is rich!
The Progenitor wouldn't recognize you,

303
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:30,595
would it? It saw you as impure,

304
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,200
the DNA is unrecognizable as Dalek.

305
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,412
- <i>A solution was devised.</i>
- Yes, yes. Me.

306
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:39,960
My testimony. You set a trap, you knew
that the Progenitor would recognize me.

307
00:17:40,312 --> 00:17:41,760
The Daleks' greatest enemy!

308
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,020
It would accept my word.
My recognition of you.

309
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,120
What are you doing?

310
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:50,859
<i>Withdraw now, Doctor,</i>

311
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:53,344
<i>or the city dies in flames.</i>

312
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,850
Who are you kidding?
This ship is a wreck,

313
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,929
you don't have
the power to destroy London.

314
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,244
<i>Watch as the humans
destroy themselves.</i>

315
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:15,088
What the...?

316
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:25,835
The generators won't switch off!

317
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,612
The lights are on all across London,
Prime Minister!

318
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,640
Has to be them.
Has to be the Daleks.

319
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:35,455
The Germans can see every inch
of the city. We're sitting ducks.

320
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:38,584
Get those lights out before
the Germans get here!

321
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:42,080
Confirm,
Squadron 244 and 56 mobilised.

322
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,720
Emergency, emergency,

323
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,644
109?

324
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:46,240
109, confirm?

325
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:49,720
Thousands will die
if we don't get those lights out now.

326
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,400
German bombers

327
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,090
sighted over the Channel, sir.
ETA 10 minutes, sir.

328
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,440
Here they come.

329
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:58,960
Get a message to Mr Attlee.
War Cabinet meeting at 0300.

330
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:02,280
- If we're all still here.
- We can't just sit here

331
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,362
We've got to take
the fight to the Daleks!

332
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:06,480
None of our weapons
are a match for theirs.

333
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:08,727
We must have something.

334
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:16,086
Staring us in the face!

335
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:17,891
A gift!

336
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,672
From the Daleks!

337
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:22,432
Turn those lights off now.

338
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,809
Turn London off or I swear

339
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,048
I will use the TARDIS self-destruct!

340
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,744
<i>Stalemate, Doctor.</i>

341
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:32,225
<i>Leave us, and return to Earth.</i>

342
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,480
That's it?
That's your great victory? You leave?

343
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,002
<i>Extinction is not an option.</i>

344
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,994
<i>We shall return to our own time</i>

345
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,693
<i>and begin again.</i>

346
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:44,520
No! I won't let you get away

347
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,021
this time! I won't!

348
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:53,230
<i>We have succeeded,</i>

349
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:56,922
<i>DNA reconstruction is complete.</i>

350
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,741
<i>Observe, Doctor,</i>

351
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:11,160
<i>a new Dalek paradigm!</i>

352
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,729
<i>The Progenitor has fulfilled
our new destiny.</i>

353
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:46,805
<i>Behold!</i>

354
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,240
<i>The restoration of the Daleks!</i>

355
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,557
<i>The resurrection of the master race!</i>

356
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,200
Bracewell! Put the gun down!

357
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,040
My life is a lie,

358
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,520
and I choose to end it.

359
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:08,869
In your own time, Paisley boy.
Because right now we need your help.

360
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:10,433
But those creatures...

361
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:12,565
My <i>Ironsides</i>!

362
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:14,920
They made me?

363
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:17,108
I... I can remember things.

364
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:20,232
So many things. The last war.

365
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,088
The squalor and the mud

366
00:21:23,602 --> 00:21:26,071
and the awful,
awful misery of it all.

367
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,540
What am I? What am I?

368
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,040
What you are, sir, is either
on our side, or theirs.

369
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,920
Now, I don't give a damn

370
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,840
if you're a machine, Bracewell...

371
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:37,541
Are you a man?

372
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:41,360
Listen to me. I understand.

373
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,154
Really,

374
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,075
I do.

375
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:50,077
There is a spaceship up there lighting
up London like a Christmas tree.

376
00:21:50,197 --> 00:21:52,800
Thousands of people will die tonight
if we don't stop it,

377
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,554
and you're the only one
who can help take it down.

378
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:57,040
I am?

379
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,498
You're alien technology.
You're as clever as the Daleks are.

380
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:03,440
So start thinking!
What about rockets?

381
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,040
You got rockets? Cos you said
gravity whatsits,

382
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,799
hypersonic flight,
some kind of missile.

383
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,238
This isn't a fireworks party,
Miss Pond!

384
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:13,044
We need proper tactical...

385
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,720
A missile... or...?

386
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,280
Or what?

387
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,400
We could send something up there,
you say?

388
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:23,080
With a gravity bubble, yes.

389
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:25,280
Theoretically it's possible,

390
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,902
we could actually send something
into space.

391
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,960
It's time to think big!

392
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>All hail the new Daleks!</i>

393
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:42,911
<i>Yes,</i>

394
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:46,440
<i>you are inferior!</i>

395
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,920
<i>Yes.</i>

396
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>Then prepare.</i>

397
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,880
<i>We are ready!</i>

398
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,040
<i>Cleanse the unclean!</i>

399
00:22:57,431 --> 00:22:59,397
<i>Total obliteration!</i>

400
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:00,960
<i>Disintegrate!</i>

401
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:15,400
Blimey, what do you do to the ones
who mess up?

402
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,480
<i>You are the Doctor!</i>

403
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,200
<i>You must be exterminated!</i>

404
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:24,300
Don't mess with me, sweetheart!

405
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,760
<i>Advancing bombers approaching in
strike formation.</i>

406
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,646
<i>Incendiary bombs
have hit the East End of London.</i>

407
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,622
At last! Are they ready?

408
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:40,960
I hope so. But in the meantime...

409
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,790
This will pick up
Dalek transmissions.

410
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,022
<i>We are the paradigm
of a new Dalek race.</i>

411
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:49,720
It's him! It's the Doctor!

412
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,837
<i>Scientist, Strategist, Drone.</i>

413
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:57,120
<i>Eternal. And the Supreme.</i>

414
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,880
Which would be you, I'm guessing?
Well, nice paintjob.

415
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,075
<i>I'd be feeling pretty swish
if I looked like you, pretty "supreme".</i>

416
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:06,098
He's got company. New company.
We've got to hurry up!

417
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:09,384
Yes?

418
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,640
Right. Right, thanks...

419
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,200
- Ready when you are, Prime Minister.
- Splendid!

420
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,760
Spaceship's exact
co-ordinates located!

421
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,520
Go to it, Group Captain! Go to it!

422
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:22,931
Broadsword to Danny Boy!
Broadsword to Danny Boy!

423
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:24,880
Scramble! Scramble! Scramble!

424
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,139
Question is,

425
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,160
what do we do now?

426
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:31,000
Either you turn off your
clever machine or

427
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,347
I'll blow you and
your new paradigm into eternity.

428
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:34,920
<i>And yourself.</i>

429
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,120
Occupational hazard.

430
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:40,040
<i>Scan reveals nothing!</i>

431
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,983
<i>TARDIS self-destruct device
non-existent!</i>

432
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:46,360
All right, it's a Jammy Dodger,
but I was promised tea!

433
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,000
<i>Alert!
Unidentified projectile approaching!</i>

434
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,040
<i>Correction. Multiple projectiles!</i>

435
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:02,000
<i>What have the humans done?</i>

436
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,280
- I don't know.
- <i>Explain!</i>

437
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,560
<i>Explain!</i>

438
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:07,293
<i>Explain!</i>

439
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,080
<i>Danny Boy to the Doctor!
Are you receiving me? Over.</i>

440
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,680
Oh, Winston! You beauty!

441
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:20,680
Danny Boy to the Doctor!
Come in. Over.

442
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,305
Loud and clear, Danny Boy!

443
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:25,574
Big dish.
Side of the ship. Blow it up! Over!

444
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:27,280
<i>Exterminate the Doctor!</i>

445
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,680
You heard him, Group Captain!
Target that dish!

446
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,200
Send in all we've got!

447
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,520
<i>4-4 to Danny Boy, target
the dish and stop that signal. Over.</i>

448
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,212
Understood, sir. Over.

449
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,280
<i>You can count on us! Over.</i>

450
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,918
Oh, good luck, lads!

451
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,335
<i>OK, chaps, let's put London back
under cover of darkness. Tally ho!</i>

452
00:25:52,838 --> 00:25:54,920
<i>Cover my back, going in close!</i>

453
00:25:58,022 --> 00:25:59,317
<i>Pull out, pull out.</i>

454
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:03,720
<i>We've lost Jubilee, sir! Over.</i>

455
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,560
Beam still active, sir.

456
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,760
Then send them in again!

457
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,229
<i>Flintlock's down sir, and the
dish seems to be protected. Over.</i>

458
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,040
<i>Shields intact, pulse still active.</i>

459
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:30,312
Danny Boy to the Doctor...
only me left now.

460
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,395
<i>Anything you can do, sir? Over.</i>

461
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:38,840
The Doctor to Danny Boy...

462
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,460
<i>I can disrupt the Dalek
shields, but not for long. Over.</i>

463
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,727
Good show, Doctor, go to it.
Over.

464
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,940
<i>Going in, wish me luck. Over.</i>

465
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,840
<i>Shields de-activated!</i>

466
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,480
<i>Energy pulse destroyed!</i>

467
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:13,120
Direct hit, sir!

468
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:25,287
Thank the Lord!

469
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,720
Do your worst, Adolf!

470
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,770
<i>Danny Boy to the Doctor,
going in for another attack.</i>

471
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:38,880
The Doctor to Danny Boy.
Destroy this ship! Over.

472
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:40,720
<i>What about you, Doctor?</i>

473
00:27:41,197 --> 00:27:42,247
I'll be OK.

474
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:44,886
<i>Doctor!</i>

475
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:47,800
<i>Call off your attack!</i>

476
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,891
What? And let you scuttle
off back to the future? No fear.

477
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,229
This is the end for you.

478
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,303
The final end!

479
00:27:56,938 --> 00:27:58,602
<i>Call off the attack,</i>

480
00:27:58,722 --> 00:28:01,720
<i>or we will destroy the Earth.</i>

481
00:28:02,304 --> 00:28:04,440
I'm not stupid, mate!
You've just played your last card!

482
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,390
<i>Bracewell is a bomb.</i>

483
00:28:09,512 --> 00:28:12,400
You're bluffing.
Deception's second nature to you.

484
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,176
There isn't a sincere bone in your body.
There isn't a bone in your body!

485
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:19,082
<i>His power is derived</i>

486
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:22,075
<i>from an Oblivion Continuum!</i>

487
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,283
<i>Call off your attack,</i>

488
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,767
<i>or we will detonate the android.</i>

489
00:28:27,887 --> 00:28:30,501
No! This is my best chance ever!
The last of the Daleks!

490
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:34,130
I can rid the Universe of you,
once and for all!

491
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,960
<i>Then do it.</i>

492
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:40,120
<i>But we will shatter
the planet below!</i>

493
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:44,280
<i>The Earth will die screaming!</i>

494
00:28:44,949 --> 00:28:46,636
And if I let you go,

495
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:49,398
you'll be stronger than ever.

496
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:52,761
A new race of Daleks.

497
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,757
<i>Then choose, Doctor!</i>

498
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:57,920
<i>Destroy the Daleks</i>

499
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,313
<i>or save the Earth.</i>

500
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,158
<i>Begin countdown
of Oblivion Continuum!</i>

501
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:07,688
<i>Choose, Doctor!</i>

502
00:29:08,044 --> 00:29:10,767
<i>Choose! Choose!</i>

503
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:22,480
The Doctor to Danny Boy.
The Doctor to Danny Boy. Withdraw.

504
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,200
<i>Say again, sir. Over. Withdraw!</i>

505
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,400
- Return to Earth. Over and out.
- But sir...!

506
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,628
<i>There's no time, you have
to return to Earth now! Over!</i>

507
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:51,156
<i>The Doctor has failed.</i>

508
00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:54,280
<i>His
compassion is his greatest weakness.</i>

509
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,284
<i>Daleks have no such weakness.</i>

510
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:01,680
Doctor!

511
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:06,810
Sorry, Professor. You're a bomb!
An inconceivably massive Dalek bomb.

512
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,024
- What?
- There's an Oblivion Continuum

513
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:11,777
inside you, a captured wormhole
that provides perpetual power.

514
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:14,777
Detonate that, and the Earth will bleed
through into another dimension!

515
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,200
Now keep down!

516
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:22,160
<i>Detonation sequence activated.</i>

517
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,023
<i>Time corridor establishing...</i>

518
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:27,497
<i>Time jump in thirty rels!</i>

519
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:32,202
- Well?
- I dunno, I dunno, I dunno!

520
00:30:32,322 --> 00:30:35,275
- Never seen one up close before!
- They've wired him up to detonate?

521
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:39,079
Not wired him up! He is a bomb.
Walking, talking, exploding!

522
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,878
The moment that flashes red.

523
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:43,121
There's a blue wire or something
you have to cut.

524
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,267
There's always a blue wire.

525
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,240
- Or a red one.
- You're not helping!

526
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,956
It's incredible.
He talked to us about his memories.

527
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:51,129
The Great War...

528
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,720
Someone else's stolen thoughts,
implanted in a positronic brain.

529
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:57,520
Tell me about it.
Tell me about your life!

530
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,800
Doctor, I really don't think
this is the time!

531
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,760
Tell me and prove you're human.

532
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,440
Tell me everything.

533
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:07,030
<i>Countdown proceeding.</i>

534
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,404
My family ran the Post Office.

535
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:14,745
It's a little place just near
the abbey. Just by the ash trees.

536
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,689
There used to be eight trees but...
but there was a storm.

537
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,727
- And your parents? Come on! Tell me!
- Good people. Kind people.

538
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:25,000
- They died. Scarlet fever.
- What was that like? How did it feel?

539
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:29,520
How did it make you feel, Edwin?
Tell me! Tell me now!

540
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,360
It hurt. It hurts, Doctor, so badly.

541
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:35,999
Like a wound.

542
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:39,728
It was worse than a wound.
Like I'd been emptied out.

543
00:31:40,663 --> 00:31:43,366
- There was nothing.
- Good. Remember it now, Edwin!

544
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,988
The ash trees by the Post Office
and your mum and dad and losing them

545
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:49,157
and men in the trenches you saw die...
Remember it! Feel it,

546
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:52,386
because you're human. You're not like
them. You are not like the Daleks!

547
00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:53,600
It hurts! Doctor,

548
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,952
- it hurts so much!
- Good! Good! Good! Brilliant!

549
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:59,403
Embrace it. That means you're alive!

550
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:02,320
They cannot explode that bomb,
you're a human being!

551
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,544
You are flesh and blood!
They cannot explode that bomb!

552
00:32:05,664 --> 00:32:08,575
Believe it!
You are Professor Edwin Bracewell!

553
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:11,960
And you, my friend,
are a human being!

554
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
It's not working, I can't stop it!

555
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,560
Paisley.

556
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:30,280
Ever fancied someone
you know you shouldn't?

557
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:32,033
What?

558
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:34,827
Hurts, doesn't it?

559
00:32:41,997 --> 00:32:43,240
Kind of a good hurt.

560
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:48,320
I really shouldn't talk about her.

561
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,160
There's a her.

562
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,160
What was her name?

563
00:32:57,537 --> 00:32:58,600
Dorabella.

564
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:00,312
Dorabella.

565
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:02,722
It's a lovely name,
it's a beautiful name.

566
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:04,320
What was she like, Edwin?

567
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:06,877
Such a smile.

568
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,370
And her eyes...

569
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,240
Her eyes were so blue...

570
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,190
Almost violet.

571
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:20,555
Like the last touch of sunset

572
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,482
on the edge of the world...

573
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,220
Dorabella...

574
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,852
<i>Oblivion Continuum... inactive.</i>

575
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:41,888
<i> Impossible!</i>

576
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:45,619
<i>Time jump imminent! Prepare!</i>

577
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,650
Welcome to the human race.

578
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:55,956
You're brilliant,
you're brilliant... And you...

579
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,880
Now.
Gotta stop them! Stop the Daleks!

580
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,377
Wait! Doctor! Wait, Wait.

581
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:03,594
It's too late.

582
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,071
<i>You will never defeat us, Doctor,
we will return.</i>

583
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,567
<i>We will return!</i>

584
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:16,393
Gone.

585
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:18,345
They've gone.

586
00:34:19,436 --> 00:34:21,490
No, no, no! They can't!

587
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,969
They can't have got
away from me again!

588
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:25,841
No, I can feel it,

589
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:27,805
my mind is clear.

590
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:30,921
The Daleks have gone.

591
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:43,274
Doctor. It's OK! You did it.
You stopped the bomb.

592
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:44,996
Doctor?

593
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:49,151
I had a choice and they knew
I'd choose the Earth.

594
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:53,072
The Daleks have won.

595
00:34:53,765 --> 00:34:55,364
They beat me. They've won.

596
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:57,372
But you saved the Earth.

597
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:59,242
Not too shabby, is it...?

598
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,300
Is it?

599
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:10,200
No. It's not too shabby.

600
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:12,240
It's a brilliant achievement,

601
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,360
my dear friend. Here,

602
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,800
have a cigar!

603
00:35:16,412 --> 00:35:17,194
No...

604
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,795
So, what now, then?

605
00:35:39,248 --> 00:35:42,084
I still have a war to run,
Miss Pond.

606
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:44,401
- Prime Minister...
- Oh, thank you.

607
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,360
They hit the Palace
and St Paul's again.

608
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,411
Fire crews only just saved it.

609
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:52,882
Is she OK?

610
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:53,806
What?

611
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:55,532
She looks very upset.

612
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:57,532
Oh, Miss Breen?

613
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,000
Her young man didn't make it,
I'm afraid.

614
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:01,507
Just got word.

615
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,440
Shot down over the Channel.

616
00:36:05,174 --> 00:36:07,682
- Where's the Doctor?
- Tying up loose ends.

617
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:10,646
I've taken out all the alien tech
Bracewell put in.

618
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:12,212
Won't you reconsider, Doctor?

619
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:15,050
Those Spitfires
would win me the war in 24 hours!

620
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,578
- Exactly.
- But why not? Why can't we put an end

621
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,090
to all this misery?

622
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,278
Oh, it doesn't work like that,
Winston.

623
00:36:21,398 --> 00:36:22,792
It's gonna be tough.

624
00:36:23,494 --> 00:36:26,640
There are terrible days to come.
The darkest days. But you can do it.

625
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,166
- You know you can.
- Stay with us,

626
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:30,685
and help us win through!

627
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:33,768
- The world needs you.
- The world doesn't need me.

628
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:35,520
No?

629
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,610
The world's got
Winston Spencer Churchill.

630
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:43,427
It's been a pleasure, Doctor,

631
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:45,813
- as always.
- Too right.

632
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:50,840
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Oh, shall we say <i>adieu</i>?

633
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:52,479
Indeed!

634
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:54,260
Goodbye,

635
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:55,619
Miss Pond.

636
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:58,240
It's... it's been amazing.

637
00:36:58,532 --> 00:37:00,680
- Meeting you.
- I'm sure it has!

638
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:07,080
Oi, Churchill!

639
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,278
TARDIS key. The one you
just took from the Doctor.

640
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:15,608
She's good, Doctor.

641
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,600
As sharp as a pin!

642
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,680
Almost as sharp

643
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:22,355
as me!

644
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,876
KBO!

645
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:40,677
I've been expecting you, Doctor.

646
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:43,691
I knew this moment had to come.

647
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,306
Moment?

648
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,470
It's time to de-activate me.

649
00:37:48,991 --> 00:37:49,888
Is it...?

650
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:56,205
You have no choice.

651
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,870
I'm Dalek technology.

652
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:04,560
Can't allow me to go pottering around
down here where I have no business.

653
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:07,095
No, you're dead right, Professor.

654
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:10,120
100% right. And by the time
I get back here in, what?

655
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,800
- 10 minutes?
- More like 15.

656
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,046
15 minutes, that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

657
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,840
You are going to be so de-activated.

658
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:19,675
It's going be like
you've never even been...

659
00:38:20,158 --> 00:38:21,102
activated.

660
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:24,341
- 15 minutes?
- More like 20, if I'm honest.

661
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:27,704
Once Pond and I see to the
urgent thing we've got to see to.

662
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:30,600
See?

663
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,807
Very well, Doctor.
I shall wait here and

664
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:35,240
prepare myself.

665
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,640
Dalek tech, but a bit slow
on the uptake.

666
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,886
That thing we've got to do. Gonna take
half an hour, realistically, isn't it?

667
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:44,840
Easily! So no running off,
that's what I'm saying.

668
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,160
Don't go trying to find that little
Post Office with the ash trees

669
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,520
or that girl... What was her name?

670
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,549
- Dorabella.
- Dorabella.

671
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:54,984
On no account go looking for her.

672
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:58,711
Mind you, you can get
a lot done in half an hour.

673
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:07,480
Thank you.

674
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,080
Thank you, Doctor!

675
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,656
Come along, Pond!

676
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,319
You have enemies then?

677
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,120
Everyone's got enemies.

678
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,240
Yeah, but mine is the woman outside
Budgens with the mental Jack Russell.

679
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,689
You've got, like,
you know, arch-enemies.

680
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,546
Suppose so.

681
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:37,780
And here's me thinking we'd just be

682
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,534
running through time,
being daft and fixing stuff.

683
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:42,863
But no.

684
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:44,566
It's dangerous.

685
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:46,693
Very.

686
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:49,000
Is that a problem?

687
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,149
I'm still here, aren't I?

688
00:39:55,973 --> 00:39:57,512
You're worried about the Daleks.

689
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:01,159
I'm always worried about the Daleks.

690
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,840
It'll take time, though.
There's still not many of them.

691
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:06,284
They'll need a while
to build themselves up.

692
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:09,107
It's not that.
There's something else.

693
00:40:09,227 --> 00:40:12,200
Something we've forgotten.
Or rather you have.

694
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,760
- Me?
- You didn't know them, Amy.

695
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,565
You'd never seen them before
and you should have done.

696
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:19,400
You should.

697
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,659
- River?
- Follow that ship.

698
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:51,705
What do you know

699
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:53,880
of the weeping angels?

700
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,555
But it's just a statue.

701
00:40:55,675 --> 00:40:57,679
Until you turn your back.

702
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,384
Stone angel amongst stone statues.

703
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:01,760
Perfect hiding place.

704
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,070
We're all in terrible danger.

705
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,280
Keep looking!
It can't move if you're looking.

706
00:41:06,518 --> 00:41:08,231
Don't blink, Amy, don't even blink!

707
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:10,760
The time will be upon us.

708
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:12,623
The time

709
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:14,480
of angels.
