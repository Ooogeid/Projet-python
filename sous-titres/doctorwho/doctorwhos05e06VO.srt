1
00:00:14,427 --> 00:00:17,761
Signora, your school offers
a chance for betterment, escape.

2
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:19,360
My daughter...

3
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:26,233
Isabella is 17 now,

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,099
but what prospects are there
for the daughter of a boat-builder?

5
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:33,051
There's no future for us.
No future but you.

6
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:37,130
I am moved by your
concern for your daughter.

7
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:42,288
I believe protecting the future
of one's own is a sacred duty.

8
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:47,542
... she is my world.

9
00:00:56,526 --> 00:00:58,029
Then we will take your world.

10
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:01,914
I knew it!

11
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:09,000
Say goodbye to your daughter.

12
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:11,760
Now, signora?

13
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:13,600
Why wait?

14
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:15,798
Time ticks.

15
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,344
Be brave, my girl. Make me proud.

16
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,029
Step into the light, my dear.

17
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:35,160
That's it.

18
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,433
What say you, Francesco?

19
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:47,000
Do you like her?

20
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:48,937
Oh, I do, Mother.

21
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:50,847
I do.

22
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:00,360
It's me! Hello!

23
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:02,510
How are you?

24
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,440
<i>The reason for this call is because
I haven't told you for seven hours</i>

25
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,360
<i>that I love you, which is a scandal,</i>

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,360
<i>and even if we weren't
getting married tomorrow,</i>

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,000
<i>I'd ask you to marry me anyway.</i>

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,200
Yes, I would,
because you are smashing.

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,120
MUSIC:
"The Stripper" by David Rose

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,240
Blimey.

31
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:21,476
I've...

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,440
I'll see you tomorrow.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Out!

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,381
Rory!

35
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:44,120
That's a relief. I thought I'd
burst out of the wrong cake.

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,203
Again.

37
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:47,547
That reminds me, there's a girl
outside in a bikini.

38
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,714
Could someone let her in, give her
a jumper? Lucy. Lovely girl.

39
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:52,400
Diabetic.

40
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:54,705
Now, then.

41
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,360
We need to talk about your fiancee.

42
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,280
She tried to kiss me.

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,727
Tell you what, though. You're
a lucky man - she's a great kisser.

44
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:23,560
Funny how you can say something
in your head and it SOUNDS fine...

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,960

51
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:04,959
Oh! The life out there,
it dazzles.

52
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,920
I mean, it blinds you to the things
that are important.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,040
I've seen it devour
relationships and plans.

54
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,240
It's meant to do that.

55
00:04:18,078 --> 00:04:21,186
... because for one person
to have seen all that,

56
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:24,280
to taste the glory and then go back,

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,760
it WILL tear you apart.

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,315
So

59
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm sending you

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
somewhere, together.

61
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,084
What, like a date?

62
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:36,143
Anywhere you want,
any time you want.

63
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:38,205
One condition- it has to be amazing.

64
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,121
The Moulin Rouge in 1890!
The first Olympic Games!

65
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,095
Think of it as a wedding present,
because it's either this or tokens.

66
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,468
It's a lot to take in?
Tiny box, huge room inside.

67
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,240
What's that about? Let me explain.

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,720
It's another dimension.

69
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,680
It's basically another dimen...
What?

70
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,201
After Prisoner Zero,

71
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:57,761
I've been reading up on all
the latest scientific theories.

72
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,848
FTL travel, parallel universes.

73
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,730
I like the bit when someone says,
"It's bigger on the inside!"

74
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,795
I always look forward to that.

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
So, this date.

76
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm kind of done
with running down corridors.

77
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,621
What do you think?

78
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:15,360
How about somewhere... romantic?

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
Venice!

80
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:30,360
Venezia!

81
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,120
La Serenissima!

82
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:35,453
Impossible city. Preposterous city!

83
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:37,789
Founded by refugees running from
Attila the Hun.

84
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:41,535
It was just a collection
of little wooden huts in the marsh,

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
but became one of the
most powerful cities in the world.

86
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,174
Constantly being invaded,

87
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,400
constantly flooding...

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,236
constantly... Just beautiful!

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,560
Oh, you gotta love Venice.

90
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:02,682
And so many people did.
Byron, Napoleon, Casanova.

91
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,415
That reminds me.

92
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,560
1580, that's all right, Casanova
doesn't get born for 145 years.

93
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,560
Don't want to run into him.
I owe him a chicken.

94
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,482
You owe Casanova a chicken?

95
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:13,958
Long story. We had a bet.

96
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:18,200
Papers, if you please.

97
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:21,160
Proof of residency, current bill
of medical inspection.

98
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:23,080
There you go, fella.

99
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,360
All to your satisfaction,
I think you'll find.

100
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,893
I am so sorry, Your Holiness.

101
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:31,120
I didn't realise.

102
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,375
No worries.
You were just doing your job.

103
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,960
Sorry, what exactly is your job?

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,200
Checking for aliens.

105
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800
Visitors from foreign lands what
might bring the plague with them.

106
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:44,800
Oh, that's nice!
See where you bring me? The plague!

107
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
Don't worry, Viscountess.

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,440
No, we're under quarantine
here, no-one comes in,

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,880
no-one goes out,

110
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,960
and all because of the grace

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,960
and wisdom of our patron,
Signora Rosanna Calvierri.

112
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:59,960
How interesting. I heard
the plague died out years ago.

113
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,990
Not out there.

114
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,068
No, Signora Calvierri has seen it
with her own eyes.

115
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:07,643
Streets are piled high with bodies,
she said.

116
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:08,720
Did she, now?

117
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:16,120
According to this, I am your eunuch!

118
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:18,366
Oh, yeah, I'll explain later.

119
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:27,360
Veils down, girls.

120
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,200
It's the Calvierri girls.

121
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:44,371
- What do you want?
- Where's my Isabella?

122
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,200
What are you doing?
Get away from there.

123
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:55,560
It's me!

124
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,702
Girls! Come along!

125
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,650
She's gone.

126
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:12,000
It's me!

127
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,400
What was that about?

128
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,119
I hate it when he does that!

129
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,200
Who were those girls?

130
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:30,419
I thought everyone knew about
the Calvierri school.

131
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,656
My first day here.
Parents do all sorts of things

132
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:34,640
to get their children into
good schools.

133
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,109
They move house,
they change religion.

134
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,388
So, why are you
trying to get her out?

135
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,104
Something happens in there.

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,190
Something magical,

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,429
something evil.

138
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,320
My own daughter didn't recognise me.

139
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,225
And the girl who pushed me away,

140
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:55,475
her face,

141
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:57,680
like an animal.

142
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,424
I think it's time I met this

143
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,080
Signora Calvierri.

144
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,560
Mother?

145
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,235
Mummy's hydrating, Francesco.

146
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:17,702
And we never interrupt Mummy
when she's hydrating.

147
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:23,195
We were accosted again.

148
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:27,237
A man made a grab
for one of the girls.

149
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:30,951
The longer we wait,

150
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,548
the greater the risk of discovery.

151
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:34,768
 We've already converted more than enough.

152
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:35,880
Surely

153
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:38,560
It is time to introduce them
to my brothers?

154
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,980
I shall decide when we have enough.

155
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,414
If it's more you want,

156
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,383
let me take the girls into
the city tonight. We could.

157
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,680
We follow the plan.

158
00:09:49,724 --> 00:09:51,360
Let them hammer on our door...

159
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:54,000
beg to be taken.

160
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,030
And what have you been doing?

161
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:12,202
Running.

162
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:16,209
And fighting. I've been scared.
More scared than I thought was...

163
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:17,629
Did you miss me?

164
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:22,276
I knew I'd be coming back.

165
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,344
He was right.
It blots out everything else.

166
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:29,234
Rory... this is our date.

167
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:31,582
Let's not do this, not now.

168
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:38,203
We are in Venice

169
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:41,679
and it's 1580.

170
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,025
I know!

171
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,540
Flowers, signor?

172
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:12,378
What was that?

173
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,227
She'll be OK.

174
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:29,440
Where are you... Amy! Come back!

175
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:46,570
You have my daughter.

176
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,830
Isabella!

177
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,799
You're not coming in, stop there!

178
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,399
- We've told you...
- You have my daughter. Isabella!

179
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:55,760
I demand you let me see my daughter.

180
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,720
Isabella! It's me! It's your father.

181
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,990
- I'll arrest you...
- Isabella!

182
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:19,114
Hello, handsome.

183
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:23,988
Who are you?

184
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:43,920
How are you doing that?
I... am... loving it.

185
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,236
You're like Houdini, only five
scary girls, only he was shorter.

186
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:48,930
Will be shorter. I'm rambling.

187
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,760
I'll ask you again, signor.

188
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:55,400
- Who are you?
- Why don't you check this out?

189
00:12:59,253 --> 00:13:01,672
Library card.
Of course, it's with...

190
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,960
He's... I need the spare.

191
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,200
Pale, creepy girls
who don't like sunlight

192
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:10,322
and can't be seen in...

193
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:15,480
Am I thinking what
I think I'm thinking?

194
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:16,901
But the city.
*Bout à améliorer jusqu'à « Unless », j'ai du mal au moment où elles parlent en même temps que le Doc'*

195
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,400
- Why shut down the city? Unless...
- Leave now, signor.

196
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,440
Or we shall call for the steward...

197
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:24,280
if you are lucky.

198
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,760
Tell me the whole plan.

199
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,520
One day that'll work.

200
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,914
Listen, I would love to stay here.
This whole thing... I'm thrilled.

201
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,079
This is Christmas!

202
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:46,480
- I just met some vampires!
- Doctor! We just saw a vampire!

203
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,040
- And creepy girls and everything.
- Vampires!

204
00:13:53,923 --> 00:13:56,689
- We think we just saw a vampire.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

205
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,095
Amy was just telling me.

206
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:00,009
The Doctor actually
went to their house.

207
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,879
First we need to
get back in there somehow.

208
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,395
- What?
- How do we do that?

209
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,298
- Back in where?
- Come and meet my new friend.

210
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:13,220
As you saw, there's no clear way in.

211
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,480
The House of Calvierri
is like a fortress.

212
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:17,624
But there's a tunnel

213
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:22,053
underneath it, with a ladder and shaft
that leads up into the house.

214
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:25,135
I tried to get in once myself,
but I hit a trapdoor.

215
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,049
- You need someone on the inside.
- No.

216
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,637
You don't even know
what I was going to say!

217
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:32,160
We pretend you're an applicant
for the school to get you inside

218
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,479
and tonight you come down and
open the trapdoor to let us in.

219
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:38,451
- You know what I was going to say!
- Are you insane?

220
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:40,920
- We don't have another option.
- He said no, Amy.

221
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,780
- Listen to him.
- There is another option.

222
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,820
I work at the Arsenale.
We build the warships for the navy.

223
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:53,193
Gunpowder.

224
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:56,239
Most people just nick stationery
from where they work.

225
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,080
I have a thing about guns and

226
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,190
huge quantities of explosive.

227
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,680
What do you suggest, then? We wait
until they turn her into an animal?

228
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:12,360
I'll be there three,
four hours tops.

229
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:16,539
No, no, no, no, no, no.

230
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:19,040
It can't keep happening like this.
This is how they go.

231
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:26,800
But I have to know. We go together.
Say you're my daughter.

232
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,360
- What? Don't listen to him!
- Your daughter? You look about nine.

233
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,320
- Brother, then.
- Too weird. Fiance.

234
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm not having him run around
telling people he's your fiance!

235
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:38,800
No. No, you're right.

236
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:41,511
- Thank you.
-  They've already seen the Doctor.

237
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:42,920
You should do it.

238
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,600
- Me?
- Yeah! You can be my brother.

239
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,046
Why is him being your brother weird,
but with me, it's OK?

240
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:56,463
-  I thought you were her fiance.
- Yeah, that's not helping.

241
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,433
This whole thing is mental!

242
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:01,646
- They're vampires, for God's sake.
- We hope.

243
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,709
So if they're not vampires?

244
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,399
Makes you wonder what could be
so bad it doesn't actually
mind us thinking it's a vampire?
*J'arrive pas vraiment à découper a peu près proprement*

245
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,409
So, basically,

246
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:17,440
both of our parents
are dead from getting the plague.

247
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,613
I'm a gondola... driver...

248
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:22,060
so...

249
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,766
money's a bit tight...

250
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,959
... so having my sister

251
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,458
go to your school for special people

252
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:33,198
would be brilliant.

253
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,490
Cheers.

254
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,178
Have we met?

255
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,023
- I've just got one of those faces.
- I wasn't talking to you.

256
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:45,923
She's got the same face...
which is because she's my sister!

257
00:16:46,043 --> 00:16:47,743
Carlo, explain yourself.

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,661
Why have you brought me
this imbecile?

259
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:53,280
Signora, they have references
from the King of Sweden.

260
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:54,371
What?

261
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,280
Let me see.

262
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:07,840
Well, now I can see
what got my steward so excited.

263
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:10,915
What say you, Francesco?
Do you like her?

264
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:13,318
I do, Mother.

265
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:15,946
I do.

266
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:18,221
Then we would be delighted
to accept her.

267
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,560
Say goodbye to your sister.

268
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:28,109
Tell Uncle... Doctor...
I'll see you both pretty soon, OK?

269
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:32,637
I'll be fine.

270
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:36,160
Amy!

271
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:58,840
There are clothes on the bed.
Get changed and wait here.

272
00:18:01,274 --> 00:18:04,240
Blimey.
This is private education, then?

273
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,810
Hey. Hello.

274
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:13,876
I'm Amy.

275
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,117
What's your name?

276
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,011
Isabella.

277
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:22,703
Listen,

278
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:25,488
we're going to get you out of here, but
I need you to tell me what's going on.

279
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:27,640
What is this place?
What are they doing?

280
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:30,770
They come at night.

281
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:35,080
They gather around my bed and they
take me to a room...

282
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:38,640
with this green light
and a chair with...

283
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:40,572
with straps,

284
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,134
- as if for a surgeon.
- What happens in there?

285
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,846
I wake up here.

286
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:51,779
And the sunlight
burns my skin like candle wax.

287
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:12,808
She'll be fine.
You can promise me that, can you?

288
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:43,099
We're here.

289
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:55,883
Right. OK, I'll go first. If
anything happens to me, go back...

290
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:57,035
What happened?

291
00:19:57,924 --> 00:19:59,136
Between you and Amy?

292
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,306
- You said she kissed you.
- Now!

293
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,220
You want to do this Now!

294
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,127
I have a right to know.

295
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm getting married in 430 years.

296
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,535
She was frightened,
I was frightened,

297
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:30,046
but we survived,
and the relief of it...

298
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:31,560
and so she kissed me.

299
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:35,840
- And you kissed her back?
- No. I kissed her mouth.

300
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:37,560
Funny.

301
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,785
Rory... Rory, she kissed me
because I was there.

302
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,000
It would have been you,
it should have been you.

303
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,262
Yeah. Exactly.
That's why I brought you here.

304
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:49,940
Can we go and see
the vampires now, please?

305
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:52,265
Control yourself, child.

306
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:55,245
Get your hands off me.

307
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,840
Psychic paper.

308
00:20:57,738 --> 00:20:59,716
Did you really think
that would work on me?

309
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:10,920
Push...

310
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,020
Come on. There we are.

311
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,760
Amy!

312
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:22,256
Where's Amy?

313
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:24,854
Amy.

314
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:28,647
I can't see a thing.

315
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:30,921
Just as well I brought this, then.

316
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:34,520
Ultraviolet. Portable sunlight.

317
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:37,720
- Yours is bigger than mine.
- Let's not go there.

318
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,320
Where are you from?
Did you fall through the chasm?

319
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,976
Mother this is pointless.
Let's just start the process.

320
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,076
Hold your tongue, Francesco!

321
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,560
I need to know what this girl is doing
in a world of savages with psychic paper.

322
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,133
Who are you with?

323
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:53,705
I scarcely believe
your idiot brother sent you.

324
00:21:54,807 --> 00:21:58,160
What are you doing in my school?

325
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:01,520
OK, I'll tell you.

326
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,560
I'm from Ofsted.

327
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,558
- Put her in the chair.
- No!

328
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,049
Get your hands off me!

329
00:22:09,477 --> 00:22:13,286
Make sport of me, will you?
Tease me as if I were your dog?

330
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:15,800
This dog has a bite, girl.

331
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:22,296
Doctor...

332
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:28,426
If we cancel now, we lose the deposit
on the village hall, the salsa band...

333
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,875
What happened to them?

334
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:40,107
They've had
all the moisture taken out of them.

335
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:55,360
Mother...

336
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,840
where you drink from her,
may we share?

337
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:00,550
I'm so thirsty.

338
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:04,080
Of course, darling.

339
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
That's what vampires do, right?

340
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,398
They drink your blood
and replace it with their own.

341
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:10,178
Except they haven't just
had their blood taken,

342
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:13,200
- but all the water in their bodies.
- Why did they die?

343
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:16,879
Why aren't they like the girls
in the school?

344
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:21,600
Maybe not everyone
survives the process.

345
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:30,195
You know what's dangerous about you?

346
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:33,287
It's not that you make
people take risks.

347
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:35,347
It's that you make them
want to impress you.

348
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:39,280
You make it so they don't want to
let you down.

349
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:45,056
You have no idea how dangerous you make
people to themselves when you're around.

350
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,870
<i>Who are you?</i>

351
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,171
We should run. Run!

352
00:23:58,362 --> 00:23:59,920
This is how it works.

353
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:04,720
First,
we drink you until you're dry.

354
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:10,284
Then...we fill you with our blood.

355
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:13,792
It rages through you like a fire,

356
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:15,760
changing you,

357
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,400
until one morning you awake

358
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:21,440
and your humanity is a dream...

359
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,214
now faded.

360
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:27,000
Or you die.

361
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,979
- That can happen.
- And if I survive?

362
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:34,687
Then there are 10,000 husbands

363
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,838
waiting for you in the water.

364
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:40,210
Yeah, sorry.

365
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:43,338
I'm kind of engaged.

366
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:05,040
Rory, come on!

367
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:14,160
Cab for Amy Pond?

368
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:20,600
She bit me!

369
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,880
This rescue plan, not
exactly watertight, is it?

370
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,787
Rory!

371
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:29,580
- Amy!
- Quickly, through here!

372
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,821
Seal the house.

373
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:37,880
They're not vampires!
I saw them, I saw her.

374
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,080
They're not vampires.
They're aliens!

375
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:43,212
Classic! That's good news?!

376
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:44,997
What is wrong with you people?!

377
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,240
Come on, move!

378
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:56,860
Keep moving! Come on, guys.

379
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:04,368
Quickly. Get out. Quick!

380
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:10,040
Come on.

381
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,800
Run.

382
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:14,008
I can't!

383
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,331
- Is he dead?
- No, he's breathing.

384
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:46,080
And so in memory of the children
lost to the silence,

385
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:49,324
the traitor is delivered to the arms

386
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,120
of those she betrayed.

387
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:56,735
Do you expect me to drown?

388
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,640
I'm Venetian!

389
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:01,542
I can swim!

390
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:04,600
We can all swim!

391
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,480
Something touched my leg.

392
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:21,279
They're all around me!

393
00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:24,739
They bite!

394
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:32,914
Now leave us.

395
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:45,851
Mother!

396
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:48,960
Change your form...

397
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:52,540
or my brothers will think
they are being fed twice today.

398
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,360
Not long now.

399
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:01,891
It's not long.

400
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,756
Long way from Saturnyne,
aren't you...

401
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,895
Sister of the Water?

402
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:23,319
No, let me guess.

403
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:26,313
The owner of the psychic paper.

404
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Then I take it you're a refugee,
like me?

405
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:35,400
I'll make you a deal.
An answer for an answer.

406
00:28:37,143 --> 00:28:39,847
You're using a perception filter.
It doesn't change your features,

407
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,480
but manipulates the brainwaves
of the person looking at you.

408
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:47,127
But seeing one of you
for the first time in, say,

409
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:49,880
a mirror, the brain doesn't know
what to fill the gap with,

410
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,694
leaves it blank...

411
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:56,034
hence no reflection.

412
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:58,120
Your question?

413
00:28:58,425 --> 00:29:00,182
Why can we see your big teeth?

414
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,458
Self-preservation over-rides
the mirage.

415
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:06,560
The subconscious perceives the threat
and tries to alert the conscious brain.

416
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,400
- Where's Isabella?
- My turn.

417
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,970
Where are you from?

418
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:14,000
Gallifrey.

419
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,360
You should be in a museum.

420
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,626
Or in a mausoleum.

421
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,040
Why are you here?

422
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:23,700
We ran from the silence.

423
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,960
- Why are you here?
- Wedding present. The silence?

424
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,291
There were cracks.

425
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,584
Some were tiny...

426
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:39,960
some were as big as the sky.

427
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:44,522
Through some we saw worlds
and people

428
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:47,580
and through others we saw silence...

429
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,618
and the end of all things.

430
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,160
We fled to an ocean like ours

431
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,760
and the crack snapped shut
behind us...

432
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,856
and Saturnyne was lost.

433
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:06,760
So Earth is to become
Saturnyne Mark II?

434
00:30:08,027 --> 00:30:09,680
And you can help me.

435
00:30:11,062 --> 00:30:13,746
We can build a new society here,
as others have.

436
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:17,589
What do you say?

437
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,113
Where's Isabella?

438
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,898
- Isabella?
- The girl who saved my friend.

439
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,440
Deserters must be executed.

440
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:44,240
Any general will tell you that.
I need an answer, Doctor.

441
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:46,431
A partnership.

442
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,249
Any which way you choose.

443
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:53,760
I don't think that's such a good idea,
do you?

444
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,760
I'm a Time Lord.

445
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:58,280
You're a big fish.

446
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:02,574
Think of the children.

447
00:31:04,344 --> 00:31:05,344
Carlo!

448
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,000
You're right.

449
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,820
We're nothing alike.

450
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,620
I will bend the heavens
to save my race,

451
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:14,984
- while you philosophise.
- This ends today.

452
00:31:15,663 --> 00:31:17,680
I'll tear down
the House of Calvierri,

453
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:19,636
stone by stone.

454
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,472
Take your hands off me, Carlo.

455
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:28,866
And you know why?

456
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:31,995
You didn't know Isabella's name.

457
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,357
You didn't know Isabella's name.

458
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:44,920
Open the gates.

459
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,138
Attend!

460
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,091
Attend!

461
00:31:58,095 --> 00:32:01,365
The storm is coming!

462
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,060
Mummy...

463
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:13,590
What's wrong
with your perception filter?

464
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,238
That idiot child must have damaged it
when she kicked me...

465
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:28,414
Now...

466
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,520
assemble the girls.

467
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:32,869
I have a job for them.

468
00:32:39,247 --> 00:32:40,240
You're fine.

469
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:43,571
Open wide.

470
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,598
Come on brain, think, think. Think!

471
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:53,743
Think!

472
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:56,274
If they're fish people,
it explains why they hate the sun.

473
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:59,200
- Stop talking, brain thinking.
- The school thing I don't understand.

474
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,153
- Stop talking, brain thinking.
- I say we take the fight to them.

475
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,290
What?

476
00:33:05,657 --> 00:33:06,680
Her planet dies,

477
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,524
so they flee through a crack
in space and time, and end up here,

478
00:33:09,644 --> 00:33:11,633
then she closes off the city and,
one by one,

479
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:14,680
changes people into creatures like her
to start a new gene pool.

480
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,937
Got it. Then what?

481
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:18,538
They come from the sea,
they can't survive for ever on land,

482
00:33:18,658 --> 00:33:20,027
what's she going to do?

483
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,177
Unless she's going to do something
to the environment

484
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,134
to make the city habitable...

485
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:31,000
She said, "I shall bend the heavens
to save my race."

486
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:32,680
Bend the heavens...

487
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,419
Bend...

488
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:36,760
the heavens...

489
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:38,440
She's going to sink Venice.

490
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,560
- She's going to sink Venice?
- And repopulate

491
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,800
it with the girls she's transformed.

492
00:33:45,864 --> 00:33:48,689
You can't repopulate somewhere
with just women.

493
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:51,200
You need... blokes.

494
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:52,989
- She's got blokes.
- Where?

495
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:56,220
In the canal. She said, "there are
10,000 husbands waiting in the water."

496
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,942
Only the male offspring survived
the journey here.

497
00:33:59,062 --> 00:34:01,391
She's got 10,000 children swimming
in the canals,

498
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:04,300
waiting for mum to make
them some compatible girlfriends.

499
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,119
I've been around a bit,
but, really, that's...

500
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,840
The people upstairs are very noisy.

501
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:21,644
- There aren't any people upstairs.
- I knew you were going to say that.

502
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:24,046
Did anyone else know
he was going to say that?

503
00:34:28,223 --> 00:34:30,285
Like I said, they're not vampires.

504
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:32,863
Fish from space.

505
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,880
Aren't we on the second floor?

506
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,220
What's happened to them?

507
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:01,159
There's nothing left of them.
They've been fully converted.

508
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,280
Blimey, fish from space
have never been so...

509
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,510
buxom.

510
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:08,468
Move.

511
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:09,680
Come on.

512
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:15,531
Give me the lamp.

513
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,356
Go, go, go, guys!
Keep moving, go, go go!

514
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:25,560
- Stay away from the door, Doctor.
- No! Guido! What are you doing?

515
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,736
I'm not leaving you.
What are you doing?

516
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,371
Come on. That's it...

517
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:37,960
Come on.

518
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
Guido!

519
00:35:44,747 --> 00:35:45,747
Come on.

520
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:54,732
We are Venetians!

521
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:09,532
Right, to begin,

522
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:12,509
let's fill the sky with fire.

523
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:27,580
Yes!

524
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:31,320
In sight of the Lord,
protect and keep us!

525
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:42,610
Rosanna's initiating
the final phase.

526
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,046
- We need to stop her. Come on!
- No, no. Get back to the TARDIS.

527
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,600
- You can't stop her on your own.
- We don't discuss this!

528
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,800
I tell you to do something, Amy,
and you do it.

529
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,260
Thank you.

530
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,604
You're welcome.

531
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,292
Oh, my God! What is going on?

532
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:20,160
The sky, it's like it's boiling.

533
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:42,587
You're too late.

534
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,450
Such determination...

535
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:50,361
just to save one city.

536
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,920
Hard to believe it's the same man that let
an entire race

537
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,319
turn to cinders and ash.

538
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:57,486
Now you can watch

539
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:00,843
as my people take their new kingdom.

540
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:02,600
The girls have gone, Rosanna.

541
00:38:05,453 --> 00:38:06,401
You're lying.

542
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:08,146
Shouldn't I be dead?

543
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:17,042
Rosanna, please, help me. There
are 200,000 people in this city.

544
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:18,204
So save them.

545
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,310
Amy, run!

546
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,724
This way, you freak! Don't!

547
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,540
This way, you big,
stupid, great...SpongeBob!

548
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,755
The only thing I've seen
uglier than you is...your mum!

549
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:00,280
No.

550
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,640
Did you just say
something about Mummy?

551
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,360
Careful!

552
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,720
Hit him!

553
00:39:39,865 --> 00:39:41,320
This way, bring him this way!

554
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:43,027
Rory!

555
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:54,480
You stink of fish.

556
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,069
I'm hardly going to smell of
cheese and biscuits!

557
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:08,920
Hey! Mummy's boy.

558
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:22,360
That was lucky.

559
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,357
Why did you make the
sign of the cross, you numpty?

560
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:31,575
Right!
I'm being reviewed now, am I?

561
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:38,592
Now we go help the Doctor.

562
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:42,025
Rightio.

563
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,332
Open the gates!

564
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:17,160
It's the Almighty! Look at the sky!

565
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,363
Get out!
I need to stabilise the storm.

566
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,136
- We're not leaving you.
- Right,

567
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:27,840
so one minute it's, "You make people

568
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,504
a danger to themselves,"
the next it's, "We're not leaving you!"

569
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,476
But if one of you gets squashed
or blown up or eaten, who gets...

570
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:40,600
- What was that?
- Nothing.

571
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:43,622
- Bit of an earthquake.
- Earthquake?

572
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:46,473
Manipulate the elements, it can trigger
earthquakes. But don't worry about them.

573
00:41:46,593 --> 00:41:47,401
No? No.

574
00:41:48,144 --> 00:41:50,200
Worry about the tidal waves
caused by the earthquake.

575
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:56,247
Right, Rosanna's throne is the control
hub but she's locked the program,

576
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:59,360
so tear out every single wire
and circuit in the throne. Go crazy.

577
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,276
Hit it with a stick, anything. We need
it to shut down and re-route control

578
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:07,240
to the secondary hub, which I'm guessing
will also be the generator.

579
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:36,194
Shut up! Shut up.

580
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:38,994
That's better!

581
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:06,028
There he is!

582
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:17,632
Come on!

583
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:27,880
Come on! Come on!

584
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:03,431
You did it!

585
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:41,245
Rosanna!

586
00:44:42,726 --> 00:44:45,605
One city to save an entire species.

587
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,351
Was that so much to ask?

588
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:52,775
I told you,
you can't go back and change time.

589
00:44:53,645 --> 00:44:56,222
You mourn but you live.

590
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,867
I know, Rosanna, I did it.

591
00:45:01,674 --> 00:45:02,776
Tell me, Doctor...

592
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:07,298
can your conscience carry
the weight of another dead race?

593
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:10,793
Remember us.

594
00:45:14,953 --> 00:45:15,914
Dream of us.

595
00:45:18,556 --> 00:45:19,712
No...

596
00:45:20,447 --> 00:45:21,240
No!

597
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:48,217
Now, then? What about you two?

598
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:50,480
Next stop Leadworth Register Office?

599
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,282
Maybe I can give you away.

600
00:45:56,616 --> 00:45:57,605
It's fine.

601
00:45:58,296 --> 00:46:00,920
Drop me back where you found me.
I'll just say you've...

602
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:02,296
Stay.

603
00:46:03,645 --> 00:46:05,000
With us. Please.

604
00:46:05,351 --> 00:46:06,601
Just for a bit.

605
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,410
I want you to stay.

606
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:11,360
Fine with me.

607
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:12,718
Yeah?

608
00:46:13,725 --> 00:46:16,594
- Yes, I would like that.
- Nice one.

609
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,027
I will pop the kettle on.

610
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:21,316
Hey, look at this.

611
00:46:21,436 --> 00:46:23,440
Got my spaceship, got my boys.

612
00:46:24,046 --> 00:46:25,354
My work here is done.

613
00:46:27,499 --> 00:46:29,968
We are not her boys. Yeah, we are.

614
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:31,456
Yeah, we are.

615
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,862
Rory, listen to that.

616
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:39,357
What? All I can hear is...

617
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:41,101
silence.

618
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:45,720
<i>There were cracks.</i>

619
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:49,760
<i>Through some we saw silence
and the end of all things.</i>

620
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:59,240
Oh, look at you both,
five years later.

621
00:46:59,823 --> 00:47:01,023
Time to sleep.

622
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,720
Or are you waking up?

623
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:06,360
If you're the Time Lord,
let's call me the Dream Lord.

624
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:10,200
Two worlds,
here in the time machine...

625
00:47:10,713 --> 00:47:13,320
and there in the village
that time forgot.

626
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:15,439
One is real...

627
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,625
the other's fake.

628
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,920
Trouble is, Rory, Amy,
which is which?

629
00:47:20,378 --> 00:47:21,720
So here's your challenge.

630
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,722
If you die in the dream,

631
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,960
you wake up in reality. Ask me what
happens if you die in reality?

632
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,920
- What happens?
- You die, stupid.

633
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,586
That's why it's called reality.

634
00:47:33,669 --> 00:47:37,661
Pick a world,
and this nightmare will all be over.

635
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:40,574
This is going to be a tricky one.
