1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,800
But who is this creature

2
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:07,200
with terrible claws,

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:10,787
terrible teeth in his terrible jaws?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,720
Go on, your bit...

5
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:20,240
He, he has... Go on!

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,560
I can't do it, Dad.
I can listen to books, anyway.

7
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:26,525
I know it doesn't come easy,
son, but you've got to keep at it.

8
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:27,852
All right?

9
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:29,560
You're not on your own with this.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,393
Mo,

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,344
you'll be late for your shift!

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,120
You're right!

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,360
Sorry, El, got to go.

14
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:38,720
Now, who loves you more than me?

15
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:39,920
No-one.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,600
Stop saying that!

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,200
<i>Approaching stage four,
target drilling depth.</i>

18
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:04,640
<i>Stage four target drill depth scheduled
in five, four, three,</i>

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,960
two, one.

20
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:08,504
<i>Stage four target
drill depth achieved.</i>

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,880
<i>Drill depth now 21 kilometres.</i>

22
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:12,920
Hi.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,800
Nasreen here, just to let you know
we have just hit our new target!

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,680
21 kilometres, folks!

25
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,531
<i>Further than anyone's ever
drilled into the Earth.</i>

26
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:24,560
Thanks for your amazing work.
Have a great weekend!

27
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,235
Onwards and downwards.

28
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:29,309
How much further do you think
we can we go, Mack?

29
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,080
Into the unknown!
Exciting, isn't it?

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,180
Stop that!
The real worker's here now!

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,040
- Evening, Mo!
- 21k?

32
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:43,555
You wanted to grab all the
glory before I come on shift!

33
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,700
Right, off you go, get out,
my gaff for the night.

34
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:05,187
Brilliant.

35
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
That is...

36
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:13,965
mad.

37
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,171
Please...

00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,160

<i>Behold...</i>

45
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,094
Rio!

46
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,602
Not really getting
the sunshine carnival vibe.

47
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,320
Feel that, though, what's that?

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,120
Ground feels strange...

49
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,485
Just me.

50
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:55,185
Wait...

51
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:58,080
- That's weird.
- What's weird?

52
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,856
Stop trying to distract us.
We're in the wrong place.

53
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,920
Doctor, it's freezing
and I've dressed for Rio.

54
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,410
We are not stopping here.

55
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:08,240
You listening to me?

56
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,470
It's a graveyard!
You promised me a beach.

57
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,454
Blue grass.

58
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,503
Patches of it all
round the graveyard.

59
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:18,634
So, Earth,

60
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,611
2020-ish, ten years in your future,

61
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:23,360
wrong continent for Rio, I'll admit,
but it's not a massive overshoot.

62
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:25,200
Why are those people waving at us?

63
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:29,893
Can't be.

64
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:35,396
It is!

65
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:38,764
It's you two.

66
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,786
We're here.
How can we be up there?!

67
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:45,883
Ten years in your future. Come to
relive past glories, I'd imagine.

68
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,800
Humans, you're so nostalgic.

69
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:51,600
We're still together in ten years?

70
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,200
No need to sound so surprised!

71
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,190
Let's go and talk to them!
We can say hi to Future Us!

72
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:57,560
How cool is that?

73
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,442
No, best not, really best not.

74
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:02,160
These things get complicated
very quickly, and... oh, look!

75
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,482
Big mining thing.

76
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,460
Oh, I love a big mining thing.

77
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
See, way better than Rio!

78
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Rio doesn't have a big mining thing.

79
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,424
We're not going to have a look.

80
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:16,358
Let's go and have a look!

81
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:20,160
- Come on, let's see what they're doing.
- If he can't get us to Rio,

82
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,680
how's he ever going
to get us back home?

83
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,959
Did you not see, over there?
It all works out fine.

84
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,760
After everything we've seen,
we just drop back into our old lives,

85
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,400
the nurse and the kissogram?

86
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:31,466
- I guess. He's getting away.
- Hang on.

87
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:34,287
What are you doing with that?

88
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:36,411
Engagement ring! I thought
you liked me wearing it.

89
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:38,053
You could lose it!

90
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:38,925
Cost...

91
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
a lot of money, that!

92
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,040
Spoilsport.

93
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,790
Go on. I'll catch you both up.

94
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:56,623
The drill's shut down!
There's no sign of Mo.

95
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:59,488
Nobody's been in or out
of the perimeter between last night...

96
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:02,320
and... now. What's that?

97
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,469
That wasn't there last night.
How the hell did that get there?

98
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't know.

99
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:26,720
Well, that was quick!

100
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,120
- Was it?
- It's great that you came.

101
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,880
Bit retro.
What is it, portable crime lab?

102
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:36,119
Sort of.

103
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,280
Ambrose Northover.
I was the one who called.

104
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,320
I run the meals on wheels
for the whole valley.

105
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:41,992
This is my son, Elliot.

106
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:43,813
Where's your uniform?

107
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,160
Don't be cheeky, Elliot,
he's plain clothes.

108
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,414
CID, is it? Anyway, it's over here.

109
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,560
Restricted access.

110
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,440
No unauthorised personnel.

111
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,120
- That is breaking and entering.
- What did I break?!

112
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,400
Sonicing and entering,
totally different.

113
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:21,132
Come on, then.

114
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:23,803
You're sure Rory'll catch us up?

115
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:29,249
It's a family plot, see.
My aunt Gladys died six years ago.

116
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,288
Her husband, Alun,
died a few weeks back.

117
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:34,343
He lived in the
house two doors down.

118
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,680
There's not many left up here now.

119
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:40,240
Mum, he doesn't care about that!
He wants to know about the dead bodies.

120
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:42,760
Sorry.

121
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:47,295
Well, they always wanted to be
buried in the same plot, together.

122
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:49,640
But when we went to bury Uncle Alun,

123
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,200
Gladys wasn't there. Gone.

124
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,800
Body, coffin, everything.

125
00:08:58,384 --> 00:08:59,050
What?

126
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:00,920
The mad thing is, on the surface,

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,500
the grave was untouched.

128
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:05,480
No signs of it having
been messed with.

129
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:08,760
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

130
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,371
Nobody has touched the grave
since my aunt was buried.

131
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,865
But when they dug it open,
the body was gone.

132
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:16,648
How is that possible?

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,022
What about now, can you feel it now?

134
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:25,997
I've got no idea
what you're on about.

135
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,520
The ground doesn't
feel like it should.

136
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:32,133
It's ten years in the future,
maybe how this ground feels

137
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:33,480
is how it always feels.

138
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,513
Good thought! But no. It doesn't.

139
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:37,256
Hear that, drill in start-up mode.

140
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:39,834
Afterwaves of a recent
seismological shift

141
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,490
and blue grass.

142
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,200
Please!
Have you always been this disgusting?

143
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:48,638
No, that's recent.

144
00:09:49,593 --> 00:09:50,600
What's in...

145
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
here?

146
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Hello!

147
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,720
Who are you?

148
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,200
What're you doing here?
And what're you wearing?

149
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,888
I dressed for Rio!

150
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:04,080
Ministry of Drills, Earth and Science!
New Ministry, quite big,

151
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,989
merged, lot of responsibility on our
shoulders, don't like to talk about it.

152
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:09,120
- What're you doing?
- None of your business.

153
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,240
Where are you getting
these readings from?

154
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:16,282
Under the soil.

155
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:18,368
The drill's up and running again.

156
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,864
What's going on?
Who are these people?

157
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:23,240
Amy, the Doctor.
We're not staying, are we, Doctor?

158
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,760
Why's there a big patch of earth
in the middle of your floor?

159
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:28,280
We don't know,
it just appeared overnight.

160
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,259
Good, right,

161
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,520
you all need to get out of here
very fast.

162
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:35,280
- Why?
- What's your name?

163
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,640
- Nasreen Chaudhry.
- Look at the screens,

164
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,580
your readings. It's moving.

165
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:42,160
That's specialized equipment!
Get away from it.

166
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:43,400
What is?

167
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,280
Doctor, this steam,
is that a good thing?

168
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:53,085
Shouldn't think so. It's shifting
when it shouldn't be shifting.

169
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,960
What shouldn't?

170
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,320
The ground, the soil, the earth,
moving,

171
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,840
but how? Why?

172
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,980
- Earthquake?
- What's going on?

173
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,852
Doubt it.
Cos it's only happening under this room.

174
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,640
It knows we're here.
The ground's attacking us.

175
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,080
- Not possible!
- Under the circumstances, I suggest...

176
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,360
run!

177
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,360
Stay back, Amy!

178
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,760
Stay away from the earth!

179
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:34,880
It's OK.

180
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,499
It's pulling me down!

181
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:39,640
Doctor, help me, something's got me!

182
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,760
The ground's got my legs.

183
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:46,848
I've got you.

184
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,262
- Don't let go.
- Never.

185
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:53,480
Doctor, what is it,
why is it doing this?

186
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,360
Stay calm, keep hold of my hand,

187
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:56,720
don't let go.

188
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,812
Your drill,

189
00:11:57,932 --> 00:11:59,769
shut it down! Go! Now!

190
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,800
- Can you get me out?
- Amy, try and stay calm.

191
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,520
If you struggle, it'll make
things worse. Keep hold of my hand.

192
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:09,280
Shut down all drilling activity
as quick as you can.

193
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,040
Reducing main unit power.

194
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm not going to let you go.

195
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,680
It's pulling me down,
somethings pulling me!

196
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Stay calm.

197
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,160
Hold on, if they can just

198
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,000
shut down the drill...

199
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:27,880
I can't hold on!

200
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,880
- Tony, we have got to be faster!
- I'm doing my best!

201
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:33,883
Come on, shut down!

202
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,240
What's pulling me?
What is under the earth?

203
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,192
I don't want to suffocate
under there.

204
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,920
Concentrate.

205
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,380
Don't you give up!

206
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,544
Tell Rory...

207
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,160
No.

208
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,352
Amy, no!

209
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:21,879
Where is she?

210
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,099
She's gone.

211
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,440
The ground took her.

212
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,488
Do you want sugar?

213
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:38,960
Sorry?

214
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,070
In your tea. Mum's asking.

215
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,960
Just white,

216
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
thanks.

217
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:46,776
There's only one explanation,
as far as I can see.

218
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:49,577
- What's that, then?
- The graves eat people.

219
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,839
Devour them whole, leaving no trace.

220
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,440
- Not sure about that.
- They didn't steal the body from above.

221
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,549
They couldn't have got in from
the sides. Only other thing is,

222
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,483
they get in from underneath.

223
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,944
Not very likely, though.

224
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,662
When you've eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains,

225
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:07,880
however improbable,
must be the truth.

226
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,880
Sorry?

227
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,350
Sherlock Holmes.

228
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,960
Got the audiobook.

229
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,656
The graves round here eat people.

230
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:24,373
Is that what happened to Mo?

231
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:25,978
Are they dead?

232
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,794
It's not quicksand.

233
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:33,640
She didn't just sink,
something pulled her in, it wanted her.

234
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,520
The ground wanted her?

235
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,040
You said the ground was dormant,

236
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:41,304
just a patch of earth,
when you first saw it this morning.

237
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,448
And the drill had been stopped.

238
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,546
That's right.

239
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,840
But when you re-started the drill,
the ground fought back.

240
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,585
So what, the ground
wants to stop us drilling?

241
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,554
Doctor, that is ridiculous.

242
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm not saying that, and it's not
ridiculous, I don't think it's right.

243
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Of course!

244
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,741
- It's bio-programming!
- What?

245
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,364
Bio-programming!

246
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Clever.

247
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,400
You use bio-signals to resonate

248
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,760
the internal molecular structure
of natural objects!

249
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,360
It's mainly used in engineering
and construction, mostly jungle planets,

250
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,201
but that's way in the future,
and not here. What's it doing here?

251
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:22,600
Sorry, did you just say
jungle planets?

252
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,505
You're not making any sense, man!

253
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:28,120
'Scuse me, I'm making perfect sense,
you're just not keeping up.

254
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:31,609
The earth,
the ground beneath our feet,

255
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,367
was bio-programmed to attack.

256
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,802
Yeah, even if that were possible,
which, by the way, it's not, why?

257
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,977
Stop you drilling! We find what's doing
the bio-programming,

258
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,880
find Amy, get her back.

259
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,080
Have I gone mad?

260
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,560
Silence! Absolute silence!

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,480
You stopped the drill, right?

262
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,355
Yes!

263
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,560
- And you've only got the one drill?
- Yes!

264
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,760
You're sure about that?

265
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,741
Yes!

266
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,020
So, if you shut the drill down...

267
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,595
why can I still hear drilling?

268
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,960
- It's under the ground.
- That's not possible.

269
00:16:24,913 --> 00:16:26,519
No, what are you doing?

270
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,015
Hacking into your records.
Reports, samples, sensors,

271
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:32,560
good, just unite the data, make it all
one big conversation, let's have a look

272
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,520
So. We are here and this

273
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,800
is your drill hole.

274
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,806
21.009 kilometres.

275
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:39,880
Well done!

276
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:42,920
Thank you.
It's taken us a long time.

277
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,599
Why drill on this site?

278
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:48,683
We found patches of grass in this
area, containing trace minerals

279
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:50,919
unseen in this country for
20 million years.

280
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,679
The blue grass? Nasreen,

281
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:56,745
those trace minerals weren't
X marking the spot, saying dig here.

282
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:58,280
They were a warning. Stay away.

283
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,960
Cos while you've been
drilling down...

284
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:05,159
somebody else has been drilling up.

285
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:09,475
Beautiful.

286
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:12,460
Network of tunnels all the way down.

287
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,440
No, no, we've surveyed that area.

288
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,519
You only saw what
you went looking for.

289
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:19,119
What are they?

290
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,920
Heat signals.
Wait.

291
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,775
Dual readings, hot and cold,
doesn't make sense.

292
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:26,119
And now they're moving.

293
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,880
- Fast. How many people live nearby?
- Just my daughter and her family.

294
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,040
- The rest of the staff travel in.
- Grab this equipment and follow me.

295
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:35,880
Why? What're we doing?!

296
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That noise isn't a drill.

297
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,720
It's transport.

298
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,919
Three of them, 30km down,
rate of speed looks about 150km an hour.

299
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,539
Should be here in...

300
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,930
quite soon,

301
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,657
12 minutes.

302
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:52,920
Whatever bio-programmed
the Earth is on its way up, now.

303
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,720
How can something be coming up when
there's the Earth's crust down there?

304
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,079
You saw the readings!

305
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:04,600
Who are you, anyway?
How can you know all this?

306
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:08,471
Did you see that?

307
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,000
No, no!

308
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:30,200
Energy signal originating from
under the Earth. We're trapped.

309
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:34,599
Doctor! Something weird's going on
here, the graves are eating people.

310
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,760
Not now, Rory!

311
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,880
Energy barricade.
Invisible to the naked eye.

312
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:41,679
We can't get out and no-one from
the outside world can get in.

313
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:43,155
What?

314
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:45,440
OK, what about the TARDIS?

315
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,000
The what?

316
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,479
No, those energy patterns
would play havoc with the circuits.

317
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,390
With a bit of time, maybe, but we've
only got nine and a half minutes.

318
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:56,039
Nine and a half minutes to what?

319
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,000
We're trapped. And something's
burrowing towards the surface.

320
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:02,200
Where's Amy?

321
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:06,680
Get everyone inside the church!

322
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:09,999
Rory, I'll get her back.

323
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,583
- Get her back? Where's she gone?
- She was taken.

324
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,199
Into the Earth.

325
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,110
How?

326
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:19,920
- Why didn't you stop it?
- I tried. I promise, I tried.

327
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,559
You should've tried harder!

328
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,473
I'll find Amy. I'll keep
you all safe. I promise.

329
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:25,893
Come on, please.

330
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,600
I need you alongside me.

331
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,600
Where's Mo?
Is he with you?

332
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,479
This flaming door! Always sticking!
I thought you were having it fixed!

333
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,400
Dad!

334
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,180
Something's happened
to him, hasn't it?

335
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:12,559
So we can't get out,
we can't contact anyone.

336
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,446
And something,
the something that took my husband,

337
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,307
- is coming up through the Earth.
- Yes. If we move quickly enough,

338
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,520
- we can be ready.
- No, stop. This...

339
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,640
has gone far enough.
What is this?

340
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,832
- He's telling the truth, love.
- Come on!

341
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:27,782
It's not the first time
we've had no mobile or phone signals.

342
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:29,279
Reception's always rubbish.

343
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,040
Ambrose, we saw the Doctor's
friend get taken, OK?

344
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,616
You saw the lightning in the sky.
I have seen...

345
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:36,560
the impossible today,

346
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,519
and the only person who's made any
sense of it, for me, is the Doctor.

347
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,428
- Him?
- Me.

348
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
Can you get my dad back?

349
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:52,040
Yes.

350
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,547
But I need you to trust me and do
exactly as I say from this

351
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,667
second onwards
because we're running out of time.

352
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,830
So tell us what to do.

353
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:05,328
Thank you.

354
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:07,254
We've 8 minutes
to set up a line of defence.

355
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:10,581
Bring me every phone, camera, piece
of recording or transmitting equipment

356
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:11,800
you can find.

357
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:14,227
Every burglar alarm,

358
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:17,079
every movement sensor,
every security light.

359
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,899
I want the whole area
covered with sensors.

360
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,480
Right, we need to be ready
for whatever's coming up.

361
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:29,599
I need a map of the village,
marking where the cameras are going.

362
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,439
I can't do the words. I'm dyslexic.

363
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,993
That's all right, I can't
make a decent meringue.

364
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:36,763
Draw like your life
depends on it, Elliot.

365
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:40,044
6 minutes 40.

366
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,759
Works in quadrants, every movement
sensor and triplight we've got.

367
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:58,440
- If anything moves, we'll know.
- Good lad!

368
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,759
- What're you doing?
- Resources!

369
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,399
Every little helps! Meals on wheels.

370
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,079
What've you got here then, warmer in
the front, refrigerated in the back.

371
00:22:16,094 --> 00:22:18,144
Bit chilly for a hideout, mind.

372
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,319
- What are those?
- Like you say, every little helps.

373
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:24,119
No! No weapons.
It's not the way I do things.

374
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:26,239
You said we're supposed
to defend ourselves.

375
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:29,559
Ambrose, you're better than this.
I'm asking nicely.

376
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:31,713
Put them away.

377
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:49,159
Look at that! Perfect!

378
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,840
Dyslexia never stopped Da Vinci
or Einstein, it's not stopping you.

379
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:55,178
- I don't understand what you're doing.
- Two phase plan.

380
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:57,741
First, the sensors and cameras will
tell us when something arrives.

381
00:22:57,861 --> 00:22:59,391
Second, if something does arrive,

382
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,000
I use this to send a sonic pulse

383
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,603
through that network of devices,
a pulse which would temporarily

384
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:05,520
incapacitate most things
in the universe.

385
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,320
Knock 'em out. Cool.

386
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,039
- Lovely place to grow up, round here.
- Suppose.

387
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,546
I want to live in a city one day.
Soon as I'm old enough, I'll be off.

388
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,766
I was the same, where I grew up.

389
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:21,092
- Did you get away?
- Yeah.

390
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:22,360
Do you ever miss it?

391
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:27,017
So much.

392
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:30,125
Is it monsters coming?

393
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:36,360
- Have you met monsters before?
- Yeah.

394
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,480
- You scared of them?
- No! They're scared of me.

395
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:42,319
Will you really get my dad back?

396
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:43,914
No question.

397
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:48,480
I left my headphones at home.

398
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:02,119
- How're you doing?
- It's getting darker.

399
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:05,111
- How can it be getting dark so quickly?
- Shutting out light from within

400
00:24:05,231 --> 00:24:07,679
the barricade.
Trying to isolate us in the dark.

401
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,120
Which means...

402
00:24:12,476 --> 00:24:13,640
It's here.

403
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:17,400
They're close to the surface now.

404
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,600
Tony! Like you didn't know.

405
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:43,400
I can't open it! It keeps sticking!
The wood's warped.

406
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,280
- Any time you want to help!
- Can't you sonic it?

407
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,480
- It doesn't do wood!
- That is rubbish!

408
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,080
Don't diss the sonic!

409
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,034
See if we can get a fix.

410
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,810
- No power.
- It's deliberate.

411
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,208
What do we do now?

412
00:25:27,147 --> 00:25:28,555
Nothing. We've got nothing!

413
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:31,091
They sent an energy surge
to wreck our systems.

414
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:33,320
Is everyone OK? Is anyone hurt?

415
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,360
- I'm fine.
- Me too.

416
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,200
What was that?

417
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,913
It's like the holes
at the drill station.

418
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:47,280
Is this how they happened?

419
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:53,080
It's coming through
the final layer of Earth.

420
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:54,219
What is?!

421
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,344
The banging's stopped.

422
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:04,826
Where's Elliot?

423
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:07,800
Has anyone seen Elliot?

424
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:10,450
Did he come in?

425
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,295
Was he in when the door was shut?

426
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:13,760
Who counted him back in?

427
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,116
Who saw him last?

428
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:19,680
I did.

429
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:22,112
Where is he?

430
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:27,120
He said he was going
to get headphones.

431
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,876
And you let him go?

432
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,045
He was out there on his own?

433
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,920
Mum!

434
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:58,720
Grandpa Tony!

435
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,760
Let me in!

436
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:03,560
- Let me in.
- He's out there! Help me.

437
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,143
Open the door!

438
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:08,055
Mum! There's something out here!

439
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:09,000
Push!

440
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,350
Mum!

441
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,615
Hurry up!

442
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:24,000
Mum!

443
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:25,937
Come on!

444
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:30,258
Where is he?

445
00:27:33,672 --> 00:27:34,639
He was here.

446
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,841
He was here!

447
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,825
Don't go running off.

448
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,511
It's Mum!

449
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,440
Get off me!

450
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,000
- Dad!
- What happened?

451
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,280
My dad's hurt.

452
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:19,160
Get him into the church now!

453
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,460
Elliot's gone.

454
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:22,404
They've killed him, haven't they?

455
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:25,059
I don't think so.

456
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:28,040
They've taken three people, when
they could've just killed them up here.

457
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,720
There's still hope, Ambrose.
There is always hope.

458
00:28:31,988 --> 00:28:33,400
Then why've they taken him?

459
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,040
I don't know.

460
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:39,483
I'll find Elliot, I promise.
But first I've gotta stop this attack.

461
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:41,283
Please, get inside the church.

462
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:45,640
Come on, Dad.

463
00:28:46,902 --> 00:28:47,879
So, what now?

464
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:23,960
Cold blood.

465
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:27,420
I know who they are.

466
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,198
We got it!

467
00:29:57,902 --> 00:29:59,808
Defending the planet
with meals on wheels!

468
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,429
What was that?

469
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:04,889
Sounds like they're leaving.

470
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:06,578
Without this one?

471
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,388
Looks like we scared them off!

472
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:12,263
I don't think so.

473
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,326
Now both sides have hostages.

474
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,560
Let me out!

475
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:33,720
Can anybody hear me?
I'm alive in here!

476
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:35,680
Let me out!!

477
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,316
I know you're out there!

478
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,521
My name is Amy Pond and you'd better
get me out of here or so help me

479
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,446
I am going to kick your backside!

480
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:50,070
Please?

481
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:54,320
Did you just shush me?!

482
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,302
DID YOU JUST SHUSH ME?!

483
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,000
No, don't do that. No gas!

484
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,920
No gas!

485
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,538
I've met these creatures before,

486
00:31:11,658 --> 00:31:13,828
different branch of the species,
but all the same...

487
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:15,640
Let's see
if our friend's thawed out!

488
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:18,560
- Are you sure? By yourself?
- Very sure.

489
00:31:19,374 --> 00:31:20,418
But the sting...

490
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:22,720
Venom gland takes at least
24 hours to recharge.

491
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:23,869
Am I right?

492
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:28,200
I know what I'm doing.

493
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:29,474
I'll be fine.

494
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:44,288
I'm the Doctor.

495
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:46,906
I've come to talk.

496
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:50,680
I'm going to remove your mask.

497
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,609
You are beautiful.

498
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,014
Remnant of a bygone age
on planet Earth.

499
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:21,880
And by the way,
lovely mode of travel!

500
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,760
Geothermal currents, projecting
you up through a network of tunnels.

501
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:27,480
Gorgeous! Mind if I sit?

502
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:29,797
Now.

503
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:31,680
Your people

504
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,858
have a friend of mine.

505
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,025
I want her back.

506
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:44,816
Why did you come to the surface?

507
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:48,465
What do you want?

508
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,480
I do hate a monologue.
Give us a bit back. How many are you?

509
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,238
I'm the last of my species.

510
00:32:57,993 --> 00:32:58,735
Really?

511
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:03,800
"Last of the species",
the Klempari Defence.

512
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:08,360
As an interrogation defence,
it's a bit old hat, I'm afraid.

513
00:33:08,944 --> 00:33:10,920
I'm the last of my species.

514
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:13,160
No. You're really not.

515
00:33:14,315 --> 00:33:17,659
Because I'm the last of my species
and I know how it sits in a heart.

516
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:19,445
So don't insult me.

517
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:23,977
Let's start again.

518
00:33:25,414 --> 00:33:26,503
Tell me your name.

519
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,480
Alaya.

520
00:33:31,453 --> 00:33:33,744
How long has your tribe been
sleeping under the Earth?

521
00:33:36,132 --> 00:33:37,560
It's not difficult to work out.

522
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,905
You're 300 million years
out of your comfort zone.

523
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:42,014
Question is, what woke you now?

524
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,683
We were attacked.

525
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:46,190
The drill.

526
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,932
Our sensors detected a threat
to our life support systems.

527
00:33:50,472 --> 00:33:53,160
The warrior class was activated
to prevent the assault.

528
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,760
We will wipe the vermin from
the surface and reclaim our planet.

529
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,520
Do we have to say vermin?

530
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,240
They're really very nice.

531
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,515
- Primitive apes.
- Extraordinary species.

532
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,360
You attack them,
they'll fight back. But!

533
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:06,634
There's a peace to be brokered here.

534
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:10,486
- I can help you with that.
- This land is ours.

535
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:12,280
We lived here long before the apes.

536
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,189
Doesn't give you automatic
rights to it now, I'm afraid.

537
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:19,279
- Humans won't give up the planet.
- So we destroy them.

538
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,480
- You underestimate them.
- You underestimate us.

539
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,901
One tribe of homo reptilia
against 6 billion humans,

540
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,360
you've got your work cut out.

541
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,943
We did not initiate combat.

542
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:29,573
But we can still win.

543
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,913
Tell me where my friend is.

544
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:36,079
Give us back the people
who were taken.

545
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,587
No.

546
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,200
I'm not going let you
provoke a war, Alaya.

547
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:54,110
There'll be no battle here today.

548
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,880
The fire of war is already lit.
A massacre is due.

549
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:00,079
Not while I'm here.

550
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:04,440
I'll gladly die for my cause.
What will you sacrifice for yours?

551
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,840
You're going to what?!

552
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,958
I'm going to go down
below the surface,

553
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:18,599
to find the rest of the tribe.
To talk to them.

554
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:20,547
You're going to negotiate

555
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,799
- with these aliens?
- They're not aliens!

556
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:24,822
They're Earth... liens!

557
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:27,213
Once known as the Silurian race,

558
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,472
or, some would argue, Eocenes,

559
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,758
or Homo reptilia.

560
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,160
Not monsters, not evil.

561
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,040
Well, only as evil as you are.

562
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,280
The previous owners
of the planet, that's all.

563
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:41,791
Look,

564
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,719
from their point of view,
you're the invaders.

565
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,600
Your drill was threatening
their settlement.

566
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:51,920
Now, the creature in the crypt.

567
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:56,795
Her name's Alaya.

568
00:35:58,362 --> 00:36:01,145
She's one of their warriors
and she's my best bargaining chip.

569
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:03,760
I need her alive. If she lives,

570
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,742
so do Elliot and Mo and Amy.

571
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,612
Because I will find them.

572
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:13,787
While I'm gone,

573
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:16,567
you four people,

574
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:19,320
in this church, in this corner

575
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,780
of planet Earth,

576
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:24,600
you have to be the best of humanity.

577
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,040
What if they come back?

578
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,319
Shouldn't we be examining
this creature,

579
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:30,668
dissecting it,
finding its weak points?

580
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,199
No dissecting! No examining!

581
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:35,279
We return their hostage,
they return ours. Nobody gets harmed.

582
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:37,159
We can land this, together.

583
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,110
If you are the best you can be.

584
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:46,811
You are decent,

585
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:50,210
brilliant people.

586
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,800
Nobody dies today.

587
00:36:57,352 --> 00:36:58,360
Understand?

588
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,879
No, sorry, no, what're you doing?

589
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:17,239
Coming with you, of course!
What is it, some kind of transport pod?

590
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,440
Sort of, but you're not...
coming with me!

591
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,079
He's right, you're not.

592
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,399
I have spent all my life excavating
the layers of this planet.

593
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,119
And now you want me to stand
back while you head down into it?

594
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,124
- I don't have time to argue!
- I thought we were in a rush.

595
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:33,120
- It'll be dangerous.
- So's crossing the road.

596
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,840
Oh, for goodness' sake,
all right, then! Come on!

597
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,200
Come back safe.

598
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,400
Of course.

599
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:52,480
Welcome aboard the TARDIS.
Now don't touch anything!

600
00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:55,218
- Very precious.
- No way!

601
00:37:57,348 --> 00:37:58,498
But that's...

602
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:01,514
this is...

603
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,960
fantastic!

604
00:38:06,508 --> 00:38:08,213
- What does it do?
- Everything!

605
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:11,937
I'm hoping, if we're going down,
that barricade won't interfere.

606
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,512
Did you touch something?

607
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:16,960
- No! Isn't this what it does?
- I'm not doing anything!

608
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,480
We've been hijacked!
I can't stop it!

609
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:22,840
They must've sensed
the electro-magnetic field!

610
00:38:28,298 --> 00:38:30,354
They're pulling the TARDIS
down into the Earth!

611
00:38:34,597 --> 00:38:36,743
You had to come and see me.

612
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,555
We are going to keep you safe.

613
00:38:40,982 --> 00:38:42,101
Your tribe

614
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,640
are going to give us back
our people, in exchange for you.

615
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:46,802
No.

616
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,940
Shall I tell you what's really
going to happen, apes?

617
00:38:57,355 --> 00:38:58,943
One of you will kill me.

618
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:03,160
My death shall ignite a war.
And every stinking ape

619
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,319
shall be wiped from the surface
of my beloved planet.

620
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,844
We won't allow that to happen.

621
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:10,459
I know apes better than
you know yourselves.

622
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,752
I know which one
of you will kill me.

623
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,635
Do you?

624
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,240
Where are we?

625
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,999
Looks like we fell through the bottom
of their tunnel system.

626
00:40:15,392 --> 00:40:17,760
Don't suppose it was designed
for handling something like this.

627
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,420
How far down are we?

628
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:21,660
A lot more than 21km.

629
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,959
So why aren't we burning alive?

630
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,399
Don't know. Interesting, isn't it?

631
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,960
- It's like this is everyday to you!
- Not every day.

632
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:34,690
Every other day.

633
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:59,324
Don't struggle.

634
00:41:00,848 --> 00:41:02,359
Close your eyes and don't struggle.

635
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:04,680
What? Where am I?

636
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:08,169
- Why can't I move my body?
- Decontamination, they call it.

637
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,355
They did it to me.

638
00:41:11,745 --> 00:41:12,959
While I was conscious.

639
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,839
You're freaking me out now.
Did what? Who did?

640
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,025
Dissected me.

641
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,617
He's coming.

642
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:29,273
I'm sorry.

643
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,465
I wish I could help you.

644
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,313
We're looking for
a small tribal settlement.

645
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:47,187
Probably housing around
a dozen homo reptilia.

646
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:48,937
Maybe less.

647
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:52,395
One small tribe.

648
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,890
Yeah.

649
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,973
Maybe a dozen?

650
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:12,846
Maybe more than a dozen.

651
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:15,679
Maybe more like
an entire civilisation

652
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,393
living beneath the Earth.

653
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,361
<i>There are fixed points through time</i>

654
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,480
<i>where things must always stay
the way they are.</i>

655
00:42:51,212 --> 00:42:54,028
<i>This is not one of them,
this is an opportunity.</i>

656
00:42:54,444 --> 00:42:57,879
<i>- What're you doing?
- Protecting our race against the apes.</i>

657
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:01,360
<i>The future pivots around you,
here, now.</i>

658
00:43:02,185 --> 00:43:03,237
<i>This is war.</i>

659
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,248
<i>We don't stand a chance.</i>

660
00:43:05,368 --> 00:43:06,979
<i>This ends here.</i>

661
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:08,746
<i>It only ends with our victory.</i>

662
00:43:10,096 --> 00:43:11,141
<i>Don't do this.</i>

663
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,280
<i>Fire!</i>
