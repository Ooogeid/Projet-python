1
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:10,896
Can you hear me?

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,350
Please.

3
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:17,153
It's not enough he goes
drinking all round the town,

4
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:19,715
now the whole neighbourhood
has to listen to his screaming.

5
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,785
He's very ill, Madame Vernet.

6
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:27,800
Look at this,
even worse than his usual rubbish.

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,079
What's it supposed to be?

8
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:55,547
It was found behind the wall

9
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:57,797
in an attic in France.

10
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,120
It's genuine... it's a Van Gogh...

11
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:03,706
Why bring it to me?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,479
Because it's obviously a message...

13
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,549
and you can see who it's for.

14
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:12,000
Can't say I understand it.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,760
You're not supposed to
understand it, Prime Minister.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,840
You're supposed to deliver it.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Cell 426.

18
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:34,440
The Doctor? Do you mean Dr Song?

19
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:39,560
Give me that. Seriously, just give it
to me. I'm entitled to phone calls.

20
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,770
- No, and neither are you. Where is he?
- You're phoning the time vortex,

21
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,841
it doesn't always work.
But the TARDIS is smart,

22
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:53,108
she's re-routed the call.
Talk quickly.

23
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:55,619
This connection will
last less than a minute.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Dr Song.

25
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,580
Are you finished with that?

26
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,839
You're new here, aren't you?

27
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:12,680
First day.

28
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:14,440
Then I'm very sorry.

29
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:22,674
Stay exactly where you are.

30
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:27,120
She had the lipstick, the hallucinogenic
lipstick. She tried to use it on me!

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,760
Your tricks don't work in here,
Dr Song.

32
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:13,024
This is the Royal Collection.

33
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,280
And I'm the bloody Queen.

34
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,116
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,079
It's about the Doctor, Ma'am.

36
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,680
You met him once, didn't you?
I know he came here.

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
- The Doctor!
- He's in trouble.

38
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,640
I need to find him.

39
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:30,160
- Then why are you stealing a painting?
- Look at it.

40
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,480
I need to find the Doctor,

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,540
and I need to show him this.

42
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:47,559
Word on the belt is
"you're looking for time travel."

43
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:48,979
Are you selling?

44
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,397
A vortex manipulator,

45
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,840
fresh off the wrist of
a handsome Time Agent.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,040
I said off the wrist.

47
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,841
Not cheap, Dr Song.

48
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,782
Have you brought me a pretty toy?

49
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,199
This is a Calisto Pulse.

50
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,680
It can disarm micro-explosives
from up to 20 feet.

51
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:26,339
What kind of micro-explosives?

52
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,520
The kind I just put in your wine.

53
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:47,607
Va-what?

54
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,980
I can't believe I've never
thought of this before, it's genius.

55
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:53,318
Right!

56
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:55,596
Landed.

57
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:57,224
Come on.

58
00:04:57,518 --> 00:04:59,198
- Where are we?
- Planet One.

59
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:02,549
The oldest planet in the universe.
There's a cliff of pure diamond

60
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,668
and, according to legend, on the cliff
there's writing. Letters 50 feet high,

61
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:08,600
a message from the dawn of time,

62
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,018
and no one knows what it says,
cos no one's ever translated it.

63
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:14,172
- Till today.
- What happens today?

64
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:17,904
Us. The TARDIS can translate anything.
All we have to do is open the doors

65
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:20,960
and read the very first words
in recorded history.

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,700
Right place?

67
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,840
Just followed the
coordinates on the cliff-face.

68
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,200
Earth. Britain.

69
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,120
1:02am. No, pm.

70
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,108
AD.

71
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:00,880
- That's a Roman Legion.
- Well, yeah.

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,708
The Romans invaded Britain
several times during this period.

73
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:06,079
I know.
My favourite topic at school.

74
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,299
Invasion of the hot Italians.

75
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:11,640
Yeah, I did get marked
down for the title.

76
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,120
Hail, Caesar!

77
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:16,743
Hi.

78
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,639
Welcome to Britain.
We are honoured by your presence.

79
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,200
Well, you're only human.

80
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,673
Arise...

81
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:24,548
Roman person.

82
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:27,803
Why does he think you're Caesar?

83
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,720
Cleopatra will see you now.

84
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,049
Hello, sweetie.

85
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:42,304
River!

86
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:43,912
Hi.

87
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:48,400
You graffitied the oldest
cliff-face in the universe.

88
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,760
You wouldn't answer your phone.

89
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,280
- What's this?
- It's a painting.

90
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,384
Your friend Vincent.

91
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:02,155
One of his final works.

92
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:04,239
He had visions, didn't he?

93
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:06,320
I thought you ought to
know about this one.

94
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,760
Doctor, what is this?

95
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,880
U-Sub.net et la Allons-y Team
présentent

96
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:22,545
Doctor Who - saison 5

97
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,760
Transcript: Red Bee Media Ltd

98
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,320
Synchro: Citrøn, Dauphinus,
Delphiki, Imaginos, Jojo, Sargeros

99
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:06,920
- Why's it exploding?
- I assume it's some kind of warning.

100
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,838
Something's going to
happen to the TARDIS?

101
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,320
It might not be that literal.
Anyway this is where he wanted you.

102
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,920
Date and map reference
on the door sign, see?

103
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,360
Does it have a title?

104
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:18,725
The Pandorica Opens.

105
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:21,572
Come on.

106
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,788
- The Pandorica? What is it?
- A box. A cage. A prison.

107
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,560
It was built to contain the most
feared thing in all the universe.

108
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,640
And it's a fairy tale, a legend.
It can't be real.

109
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:38,560
If it is real,
it's here and it's opening.

110
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:41,800
And it's got something to do
with your TARDIS exploding.

111
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:44,920
Hidden, obviously. Buried for centuries.
You won't find it on a map.

112
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,614
No. But if you buried the most
dangerous thing in the universe,

113
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,720
you'd want to remember
where you put it.

114
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:12,639
How come it's not new?

115
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,560
Because it's already old.
Been here thousands of years.

116
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:17,428
No one knows exactly how long.

117
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:20,486
OK, this Pandorica thing.
Last time we saw you,

118
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,960
you warned us about it,
after we climbed out of the Byzantium.

119
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:24,355
Spoilers!

120
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,532
No, but you told the Doctor you'd see
him again when the Pandorica opens.

121
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,958
Maybe I did. But I haven't yet.

122
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:31,245
But I will have.

123
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:34,720
Doctor, I'm picking up
fry particles everywhere.

124
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:38,036
Energy weapons
discharged on this site.

125
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,832
If the Pandorica is here, it contains
the mightiest warrior in history.

126
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:45,952
Now, half the galaxy would want a piece
of that. Maybe even fight over it.

127
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,425
We need to get down there.

128
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,615
Right then.

129
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:02,297
Ready.

130
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,354
The underhenge.

131
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:46,691
It's a Pandorica.

132
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:49,011
More than just a fairy tale.

133
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:29,419
There was a goblin.
Or a trickster,

134
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:31,622
or a warrior.

135
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,355
A nameless, terrible thing,

136
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:37,720
soaked in the blood
of a billion galaxies.

137
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:42,164
The most feared being
in all the cosmos.

138
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,922
And nothing could stop it
or hold it, or reason with it.

139
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:53,198
One day it would just drop out of
the sky and tear down your world.

140
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,760
- How did it end up in there?
- You know fairy tales.

141
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:59,081
A good wizard tricked it.

142
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:04,519
I hate good wizards in fairy tales.
They always turn out to be him.

143
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,750
It's kind of like
Pandora's Box, then?

144
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,895
- Almost the same name.
- Sorry, what?

145
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,015
The story.

146
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:13,712
Pandora's Box,

147
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,840
with all the worst things
in the world in it.

148
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,900
That was my favourite book
when I was a kid.

149
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:24,499
- What's wrong?
- Your favourite school topic,

150
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:27,280
your favourite story.
Never ignore a coincidence,

151
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
unless you're busy. In which case,
always ignore a coincidence.

152
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,880
- Can you open it?
- Anyone can break into a prison.

153
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,400
But I'd rather know what
I'm going to find first.

154
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,239
You won't have long to wait.

155
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,840
It's already opening.

156
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:42,308
There are layers and layers of
security protocols in there,

157
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:45,480
and they're being disabled,
one by one.

158
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:48,953
Like it's being unlocked
from the inside.

159
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:51,519
- How long do we have?
- Hours at the most.

160
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,808
What kind of security?

161
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:55,310
Everything.
Deadlocks, time-stops, matter-lines.

162
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,960
- What could need all that?
- What could get past all that?

163
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,400
Think of the fear
that went into making this box.

164
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,840
What could inspire
that level of fear?

165
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:08,518
Hello, you.

166
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:11,398
Have we met?

167
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:16,680
- Why would it start to open now?
- No idea.

168
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,800
And how could Vincent
have known about it?

169
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,640
He won't even be born for centuries.

170
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,131
The stones!

171
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,741
These stones are great big transmitters,
broadcasting a warning to everyone,

172
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:28,959
everywhere, to every time zone.

173
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,119
- The Pandorica is opening!
- Doctor, everyone, everywhere?

174
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,201
Even poor Vincent heard it
in his dreams.

175
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:36,180
What's in there,
what could justify all this?

176
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,120
Everyone?

177
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,800
Anything that powerful,
I'd know about it. Why don't I know?

178
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:43,756
- You said everyone could hear it.
- So who else is coming?

179
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:51,757
What?

180
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,280
OK, if it is basically a transmitter, we
should be able to fold back the signal.

181
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,405
- Doing it.
- Doing what?

182
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,639
Stonehenge is transmitting, it's
been transmitting for a while...

183
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:05,759
Who heard?

184
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,960
Should be feeding back to you
now. River, what's out there?

185
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
- Give me a moment.
- River, quickly, anything?

186
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,330
Around this planet,

187
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:19,600
there are at least 10,000 starships.

188
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:21,315
At least?

189
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,440
10,000, 100,000, 1 million, I don't
know. There's too many readings.

190
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,999
What kind of starships?

191
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:30,680
- <i>Maintaining orbit.</i>
- <i>I obey.</i>

192
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,390
<i>Shield cover compromised
on ion sectors.</i>

193
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:35,800
Those are Daleks.

194
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,519
- <i>Scan detects no temporal activity.</i>
- <i>Soft grid scan commencing.</i>

195
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,359
<i>Reverse thrust for
compensatory stabilisation.</i>

196
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,729
Daleks, Doctor.

197
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:47,079
<i>Launch preliminary
armaments protocol.</i>

198
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,880
Yes, OK. OK, OK, OK. Dalek fleet.

199
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:52,960
Minimum 12,000 battleships,
armed to the teeth.

200
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:56,286
But we've got surprise on our side!
They'll never expect three people

201
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:59,879
to attack 12,000 Dalek battleships.
Cos we'd be killed instantly.

202
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,400
So it would be a fairly short
surprise. Forget surprise.

203
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,879
Doctor, Cyber-ships.

204
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:08,199
No, Dalek ships, listen to them,
those are Dalek ships.

205
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,560
Yes. Dalek ships and Cyber-ships.

206
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,984
We need to start a fight,
turn them on each other.

207
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:14,720
It's the Daleks, they're so cross.

208
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,440
Sontaran.
Four battle-fleets.

209
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,520
Sontarans! Talk about cross,
who stole all their handbags?

210
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,680
Terileptil. Slitheen. Chelonian.

211
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:24,637
Nestene. Drahvin.
Sycorax. Haemo-goth.

212
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:26,800
Zygon. Atraxi. Draconian.

213
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,360
They're all here. For the Pandorica.

214
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,630
What are you?

215
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:33,695
What could you possibly be?

216
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:56,960
- What do we do?
- Doctor, listen to me!

217
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,502
Everything that ever hated you
is coming here tonight.

218
00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:02,262
You can't win this.
You can't even fight it.

219
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:05,238
Doctor, this once,
just this one time,

220
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,840
please, you have to run.

221
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:09,480
- Run where?
- Fight how?

222
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:17,521
The greatest military machine
in the history of the universe.

223
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,630
What is?

224
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,900
- The Daleks?
- No, no, no.

225
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,079
The Romans!

226
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:42,849
So.

227
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:45,923
I return to my command
after one week

228
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:48,840
and discover we've been
playing host to Cleopatra.

229
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,881
Who's in Egypt. And dead!

230
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:54,399
Yes. Funny how things work out.

231
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:02,269
The sky is falling,
and you make jokes.

232
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:04,266
Who are you?

233
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:06,920
When you fight Barbarians,
what must they think of you?

234
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,600
Riddles now?

235
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,703
Where do they think you come from?

236
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:13,363
A place more deadly
and more powerful

237
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:16,220
and more impatient than
their tiny minds can imagine.

238
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:21,934
Where do I come from?

239
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:24,680
Your world has visitors.

240
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,160
- You're all Barbarians now.
- What is that?

241
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,244
Tell me, what?

242
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:32,600
A fool would say,
the work of the Gods.

243
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:36,200
But you've been a soldier too long to
believe there are Gods watching over us.

244
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,440
There is, however, a man.

245
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:40,937
And tonight he's going to need
your help.

246
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:43,657
Sir?

247
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:47,360
One moment.

248
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:04,439
It seems you have a volunteer.

249
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:13,412
- What's this got to do with the TARDIS?
- Nothing, as far as I know.

250
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:16,689
But Vincent's painting the TARDIS
was exploding, is that going to happen?

251
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:20,781
One problem at a time. There's
forcefield technology inside this box.

252
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:23,599
If I can enhance the signal, I could
extend it all over Stonehenge.

253
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,166
- Could buy us half an hour.
- What good is half an hour?

254
00:19:26,286 --> 00:19:29,218
There are fruit flies
live on Hoppledom 6

255
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:32,040
that live for 20 minutes
and they don't even mate for life.

256
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:37,122
There was going to be a point
to that. I'll get back to you.

257
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,711
- Are you proposing to someone?
- I'm sorry?

258
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,159
I found this in your pocket.

259
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,655
No. No, no, that's...

260
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,278
a memory.

261
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:59,925
A friend of mine, someone I lost.
Do you mind?

262
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:04,172
It's weird, I feel...

263
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:06,495
I don't know. Something.

264
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,361
People fall out of the world sometimes,
but they always leave traces.

265
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,120
Little things we can't
quite account for.

266
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,360
Faces in photographs, luggage,
half eaten meals...

267
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:21,077
rings...

268
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,080
Nothing is ever forgotten,
not completely.

269
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,291
And if something can be remembered,

270
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,600
it can come back.

271
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,892
So, was she nice, your friend?

272
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,640
Remember that night
you flew away with me?

273
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,051
Of course I do.

274
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:58,957
And you asked me why I was taking you
and I told you there wasn't a reason.

275
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:00,028
I was lying.

276
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,628
- What, so you did have a reason?
- Your house.

277
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:08,096
- My house.
- It was too big, too many empty rooms.

278
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,091
Does it ever bother you, Amy,
that your life doesn't make any sense?

279
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:22,428
- What was that?
- Need a proper look.

280
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,371
Got to draw its fire, give it a target.


281
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,080
You know how sometimes
I have really brilliant ideas? Sorry!

282
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,561
Look at me, I'm a target!

283
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:33,506
- What is that?
- Arm of a Cyberman.

284
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,862
- And what's a Cyberman?
- Sort of part man, part robot.

285
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:37,279
The organic part must have died
off years ago,

286
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,120
now the robot part is looking
for fresh meat.

287
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,371
- What, us?
- It's just like being an organ donor,

288
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:44,503
except you're alive
and sort of screaming.

289
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:46,574
I need to get round behind it, could
you draw its fire?

290
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:47,640
Like you did?

291
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:50,399
You'll be fine if you're quick,
it's only got one arm.

292
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,599
Come here!

293
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:09,830
Scrambled its circuits, but stay
where you are. It could be bluffing.

294
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,239
- Bluffing? It's an arm!
- I said stay where you are!

295
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:27,920
You will be assimilated.

296
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:29,120
Yeah?

297
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:30,953
You and whose body?

298
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,120
Who...? Who are you...?

299
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,955
Hello, Amy.

300
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,131
Sir, the man's coming round.

301
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:16,061
- Where's Amy?
- She's fine, just unconscious.

302
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,905
Yes, she's sedated, that's all.
Half an hour, she'll be fine.

303
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:26,024
Romans, good, I was just wishing for
Romans, good old River. How many?

304
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:29,680
50 men up top, volunteers.
What about that thing?

305
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,880
50? Not exactly a legion.

306
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,240
Your friend was very persuasive,
but it's a tough sell.

307
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,560
Yes, I know that, Rory, I'm not
exactly one to miss the obvious.

308
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,600
But we need everything we can get.

309
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:42,440
Cyber-weapons.

310
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,806
This is basically a sentry box.
So, headless wonder here was a sentry.

311
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:48,960
Probably got himself duffed up by the
locals. Never underestimate a Celt.

312
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,360
Hush, I'm thinking.
Why leave a Cyberman on guard?

313
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,440
Unless it's a Cyberthing in the box.
But why lock up one of their own?

314
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,400
OK, no, not a Cyberthing,
but what, what?

315
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:01,497
No, I'm missing something obvious,
Rory!

316
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:05,208
Something big, something right
slap in front of me, I can feel it!

317
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:07,755
- I think you probably are.
- I'll get it in a minute.

318
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:32,219
- Hello again.
- Hello.

319
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:38,840
- How've you been?
- Good. Yeah, good.

320
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:42,290
I mean, Roman.

321
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:45,950
I'm not trying to be rude,
but you died.

322
00:26:46,628 --> 00:26:49,360
Yeah, I know, I was there.

323
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,840
You died and then
you were erased from time.

324
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,293
You didn't just die, you were never
born at all, you never existed.

325
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,361
Erased? What does that mean?

326
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,422
How can you be here?

327
00:27:04,936 --> 00:27:08,394
I don't know. It's kind of fuzzy.

328
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:10,381
Fuzzy?

329
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,440
Well, I died
and turned into a Roman.

330
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,038
It's very distracting!

331
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,706
Did she miss me?

332
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:36,960
What is it?

333
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,806
- What's happening?
- The final phase.

334
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:41,500
It's opening.

335
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,475
You're surrounded.
Have you got a plan?

336
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:07,346
Yes, now hurry up and
get the TARDIS here. I need equipment!

337
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:14,580
What are you?

338
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:17,680
They're all here, all of them,
all for you.

339
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
What could you possibly be?

340
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,880
<i>Sorry, sorry, dropped it.
Hello, Stonehenge!</i>

341
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:40,720
<i>Who takes the Pandorica,</i>

342
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,320
<i>takes the universe.</i>

343
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,734
<i>But bad news, everyone...</i>

344
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:49,214
<i>Cos guess who?</i>

345
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:52,480
<i>Listen, you lot,</i>

346
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,360
<i>you're all whizzing about,
it's really very distracting.</i>

347
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,200
<i>Could you all just
stay still a minute?</i>

348
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,800
<i>Because I am talking!</i>

349
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,280
<i>The question of the hour is,
who's got the Pandorica?</i>

350
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,980
<i>Answer - I do. Next question,
who's coming to take it from me?</i>

351
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,800
<i>Come on! Look at me,</i>

352
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,796
<i>no plan, no back-up, no weapons worth
a damn. And something else,</i>

353
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
<i>I don't have, anything to lose!</i>

354
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,360
<i>So if you're sitting up there
in your silly little spaceship,</i>

355
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,192
<i>with all your silly little guns,</i>

356
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:32,163
<i>and you've got any plans
on taking the Pandorica tonight,</i>

357
00:29:32,752 --> 00:29:35,784
<i>just remember
who's standing in your way.</i>

358
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:40,240
<i>Remember every black day
I ever stopped you.</i>

359
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
<i>And then,</i>

360
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,672
<i>and then,</i>

361
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,905
<i>do the smart thing.</i>

362
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,920
<i>Let somebody else try first.</i>

363
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:11,960
That'll keep 'em
squabbling for half an hour!

364
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,268
Romans!

365
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:45,240
- What's the matter with you?
- <i>They're still out there</i>.

366
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:46,771
What do we do now?

367
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:50,111
If I can stop whatever's in this box
getting out, then they'll go home.

368
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm sorry, you're going to
have to be very brave now.

369
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:56,903
My head.

370
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,576
Just your basic knock-out drops.

371
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,211
- Get some fresh air, you'll be fine.
- Is it safe up there?

372
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,520
- Not remotely, but it's fresh.
- Fine.

373
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,163
You're the guy,
the one who did the...

374
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,255
swordy thing.

375
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:18,880
Well, thanks for the swording.
Nice swording.

376
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:22,493
No problem.

377
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:25,329
My men are up there.

378
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,400
They'll look after you.

379
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,608
Good. Love a Roman!

380
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:34,746
She doesn't remember me.

381
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,782
How can she not remember me?

382
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,480
Because you never existed.

383
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,083
What are you doing?

384
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:47,751
What's wrong?

385
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,681
There are cracks, cracks in time.

386
00:31:56,801 --> 00:32:00,258
There's going to be a huge explosion
in the future, on one particular day.

387
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:04,120
And every other moment in history
is cracking around it.

388
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,466
So how does that work?
What kind of explosion? What exploded?

389
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,960
<i>And for those of us who can't read
the base code of the universe?</i>

390
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:26,154
<i>Amy's time...</i>

391
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,266
Doesn't matter,
cracks are everywhere.

392
00:32:28,386 --> 00:32:30,480
Get too close and
you fall right out of the universe.

393
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,600
So I fell through a crack
and I was never born?

394
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,534
- Basically.
- How did I end up here?

395
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:35,720
You shouldn't have.

396
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,870
What happened?

397
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,472
From your point of view,
what physically happened?

398
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:42,840
I was in the cave, with you and Amy.

399
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:44,600
I was dying

400
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,962
and then I was just here,
a Roman soldier.

401
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:50,346
A proper Roman.
Head full of Roman...

402
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:54,640
... stuff, a whole other life.

403
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:57,943
Just here like I'd
woken up from a dream.

404
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,280
Started to think it was a dream.
You, Amy,

405
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:02,517
Leadworth.

406
00:33:02,637 --> 00:33:05,160
Then today, in the camp,
the men were talking about

407
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:06,863
the visitors,

408
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,080
the girl with the red hair.

409
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:12,786
I thought you'd come back for me.

410
00:33:12,906 --> 00:33:14,762
But she can't even remember me.

411
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,145
Oh, shut up.

412
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,640
What?

413
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,115
Go get her.

414
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:30,576
But I don't understand.
Why am I here?

415
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:33,215
Because you are.

416
00:33:34,587 --> 00:33:37,899
The universe is big.
It's vast and complicated and...

417
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,922
ridiculous, and sometimes,
very rarely,

418
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:44,066
impossible things just happen,
we call them miracles,

419
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:45,786
and that's the theory.

420
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:48,170
900 years, never seen one yet.

421
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,434
But this would do me.

422
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:53,961
Now get upstairs, she's Amy
and she's surrounded by Romans.

423
00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:56,526
I'm not sure history can take it.

424
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:14,228
You OK now?

425
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:35,885
<i>Silence will fall.</i>

426
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:41,760
Why have you brought me here?

427
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,640
So something has been here.

428
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,393
Amy...

429
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,801
Oh, Doctor,

430
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:06,638
why do I let you out?

431
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:26,040
<i>A place more deadly</i>

432
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,960
and more powerful and more impatient
than their tiny minds can imagine.

433
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:39,840
<i>So it's kind of like
Pandora's box, then?</i>

434
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,920
That was my favourite
book when I was a kid.

435
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:03,229
Are you OK?

436
00:37:04,237 --> 00:37:07,297
Did the Doctor send you?
I'm fine, he just fusses.

437
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:10,035
You got a blanket.

438
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:12,666
It's good.
Who gave you that?

439
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:14,199
One of the fellas.

440
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:15,307
Which one?

441
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,463
Just one of them. Does it matter?

442
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,693
Forget him, it.

443
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:25,422
Forget it.

444
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:27,600
What's your name?

445
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:29,041
I'm...

446
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:30,949
Rory.

447
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,967
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's just...

448
00:37:35,482 --> 00:37:37,319
not what you expect
Romans to be called.

449
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:39,464
What's it short for?
Roranicus?

450
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,610
You're crying.

451
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,880
The TARDIS, where is it? Hurry up!

452
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,059
Don't raise your voice,
don't look alarmed, just listen.

453
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,983
Hey, what's wrong?

454
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:04,200
Nothing.

455
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:05,800
It's like...

456
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:09,044
It's like I'm happy.

457
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,917
Why am I happy?

458
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,160
They're not real, they can't be.

459
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:22,253
They're all right here in the story
book, those actual Romans,

460
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:24,640
the ones I sent you,
the ones you're with right now.

461
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:27,880
They're all in a book in Amy's house,
a children's picture book.

462
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:31,280
- What are you even doing there?
- <i>The TARDIS went wrong.</i>

463
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,720
How is this possible?

464
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,737
Something is using her memories,
Amy's memories.

465
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:36,757
<i>But how?</i>

466
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,320
You said something had been there.

467
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,680
There's burn marks
on the grass outside,

468
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,039
<i>landing patterns.</i>

469
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:46,186
If they've been to her house, they
could have used her psychic residue.

470
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:48,821
Structures can hold memories,
that's why houses have ghosts.

471
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:51,400
They could've taken a snapshot
of Amy's memories. But why?

472
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:54,760
Who are those Romans?

473
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:58,075
Projections or duplicates.

474
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,360
But they were helping us.
My lipstick even worked.

475
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:03,792
They might think they're real.

476
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:05,954
The perfect disguise.

477
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:08,565
They actually believe
their own cover story,

478
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:11,960
right until they're activated.

479
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:17,723
That Centurion...

480
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:21,371
What's the matter?

481
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:22,391
Nothing.

482
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,422
I don't know why I'm doing that.

483
00:39:32,543 --> 00:39:33,443
It's me.

484
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:38,240
Amy, please...

485
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:40,840
It's me.

486
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,541
It's a trap, it has to be.

487
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:45,880
They used Amy to construct a scenario
you'd believe, to get close to you.

488
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,200
Why? Who'd do that?
What for? It doesn't make sense.

489
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,840
What's happening?

490
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,280
I don't know, it's the engines.

491
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:00,609
There's something wrong
with the TARDIS,

492
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:03,520
- like something else is controlling it.
- You're flying it wrong.

493
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:07,040
I'm flying it perfectly.

494
00:40:07,478 --> 00:40:08,800
You taught me.

495
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,440
Where are you? What's the date?

496
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,520
It's the 26th June, 2010.

497
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:17,361
You need to get out of there now!
Any other time zone, just go.

498
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,720
I can't break free.

499
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,360
Well, then, shut down the TARDIS.
Shut down everything!

500
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,892
I can't!

501
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,938
<i>Silence will fall!</i>

502
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:31,276
<i>Silence will fall!</i>

503
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:37,228
But I don't know you,

504
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,363
I've never seen you before
in my life.

505
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:42,400
- You have. You know you have.
- It's me. Why am I crying?

506
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:44,147
Because you remember me.

507
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,282
I came back!

508
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:49,420
You're crying
because you remember me.

509
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:52,596
Someone else

510
00:40:53,191 --> 00:40:54,312
is flying it.

511
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:57,480
An external force.
I've lost control.

512
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,285
But how? Why?

513
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,852
Listen to me,
just land her anywhere.

514
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:20,960
Emergency landing, now.

515
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:23,795
There are cracks in time,
I've seen them everywhere,

516
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,649
and they're getting wider. The TARDIS
exploding is what causes them,

517
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:30,320
but we can stop the cracks
ever happening if you just land her!

518
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:31,907
<i>It's not safe.</i>

519
00:41:42,384 --> 00:41:43,384
Well, now.

520
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:46,960
Ready to come out, are we?

521
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,410
No, please, no!

522
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:56,615
I'm not going.

523
00:41:57,339 --> 00:41:58,420
I'm Rory!

524
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:08,680
<i>I'm down.</i>

525
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,950
- I've landed.
- <i>OK, just walk out of the doors.</i>

526
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,920
<i>If there's no-one inside,
the TARDIS engines shut down.</i>

527
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:15,511
Just get out of there.

528
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:16,920
- I'm going.
- Run!

529
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:30,492
<i>'I can't open the doors!</i>

530
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:35,760
Listen to me, you have to run. You have
to get as far away from here as you can!

531
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:38,560
I'm a thing. I'll kill you. Just go!

532
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,840
Please, no, I don't want to go.

533
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,273
I'm Rory! I'm...

534
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:48,597
I'm...

535
00:42:49,186 --> 00:42:50,120
Williams.

536
00:42:52,765 --> 00:42:54,235
Rory Williams from Leadworth.

537
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:55,880
My boyfriend.

538
00:42:56,898 --> 00:42:59,612
- How could I ever forget you?
- Amy, you've got to run.

539
00:43:00,855 --> 00:43:02,840
I can't hold on, I'm going.

540
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,541
You are Rory Williams and you aren't
going anywhere ever again

541
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:10,760
Doctor, I can't open the doors!
Doctor, please,

542
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,400
I've e got seconds!

543
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,022
Plastic Romans.

544
00:43:14,746 --> 00:43:15,752
Duplicates,

545
00:43:15,872 --> 00:43:17,774
driven by
the Nestene Consciousness, eh?

546
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:20,606
Deep cover, but what for?
What are you doing?

547
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,560
What's in there, eh?
What's coming out?

548
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,106
The Pandorica is ready.

549
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:33,741
What, you mean it's open?

550
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,795
<i>You have been scanned.</i>

551
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:37,643
<i>Assessed.</i>

552
00:43:38,487 --> 00:43:40,087
<i>Understood.</i>

553
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,548
The ring. Remember the ring?

554
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,960
You'd never let me wear it
in case I lost it.

555
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,080
- The Doctor gave it to me.
- Show it to me.

556
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,582
Show me the ring.

557
00:43:58,204 --> 00:43:59,220
Come on!

558
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,766
Just show it to me.

559
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:13,301
Scanned?

560
00:44:14,628 --> 00:44:15,871
Scanned by what, a box?

561
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:19,720
<i>Your limits and capacities
have been extrapolated.</i>

562
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,288
The Pandorica is ready.

563
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:29,580
Ready for what?

564
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,697
<i>Ready for you.</i>

565
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:43,969
There it is.

566
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:46,277
You remember.

567
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:48,836
This is you.

568
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:50,920
And you are staying.

569
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,545
You lot,

570
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:07,664
working together,

571
00:46:08,637 --> 00:46:10,010
an alliance...

572
00:46:11,074 --> 00:46:12,415
How is that possible?

573
00:46:13,348 --> 00:46:16,764
<i>The cracks
in the skin of the universe.</i>

574
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:19,360
All reality is threatened.

575
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:22,320
<i>All universes will be deleted.</i>

576
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:23,818
What?

577
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:26,706
And you've come to me for help?

578
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:30,955
We will save the universe from you!

579
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:33,236
From me?

580
00:46:33,356 --> 00:46:35,025
<i>All projections correlate.</i>

581
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:37,960
<i>All evidence concurs.
The Doctor will destroy</i>

582
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,469
<i>the universe.</i>

583
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:42,840
- You've got it wrong.
- <i>The Pandorica</i>

584
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,143
<i>was constructed to ensure the safety
of the alliance.</i>

585
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:49,641
<i>A scenario was devised</i>

586
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:52,704
<i>from the memories of your companion.</i>

587
00:46:52,942 --> 00:46:55,600
A trap the Doctor could not resist.

588
00:46:56,218 --> 00:46:58,240
<i>The cracks in time are the work</i>

589
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,040
<i>of the Doctor. It is confirmed.</i>

590
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,720
No. Not me, the TARDIS.
And I'm not in the TARDIS, am I?

591
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:07,080
<i>Only the Doctor can pilot</i>

592
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,100
- the TARDIS.
- Please,

593
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,160
- listen to me!
- <i>You will be prevented.</i>

594
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:14,738
Total event collapse!
Every sun will supernova

595
00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:16,720
at every moment in history.

596
00:47:17,383 --> 00:47:20,320
The whole universe
will never have existed!

597
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,080
Please, listen to me!

598
00:47:22,734 --> 00:47:24,200
<i>Seal the Pandorica.</i>

599
00:47:25,274 --> 00:47:26,760
Please, listen to me!

600
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:29,440
The TARDIS is exploding right now
and I'm

601
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,240
the only one who can stop it!

602
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,240
Listen to me!

603
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:42,659
I'm sorry, my love.
