1
00:00:03,174 --> 00:00:04,000
It is,

2
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:05,671
it's you two.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,760
We could say hi to Future Us.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,439
Her name's Alaya.

5
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,480
<i>She's one of their warriors.</i>

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,960
One of you will kill me.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,640
If she lives, so do Elliot...

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,640
Mum... And Mo...
and Amy, because I will find them.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,000
My death shall ignite a war

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,920
and every stinking ape shall be wiped
from the surface of my beloved planet.

11
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,325
We return their hostage,
they return ours.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,600
Nobody dies today.

Doctor Who - saison 5

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,589
Transcript : Red Bee Media Ltd

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,640
Synchro : Citrøn, Dauphinus,
Delphiki, Imaginos, Jojo

17
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:22,866
<i>This is the story
of our planet, Earth,</i>

18
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:26,073
<i>of the day 1 000 years past
when we came to share it</i>

19
00:01:26,193 --> 00:01:28,106
<i>with a race know as Humanity.</i>

20
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:31,510
<i>It is the story of the Doctor
who helped our races</i>

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,950
<i>find common ground
and the terrible losses he suffered.</i>

22
00:01:35,203 --> 00:01:37,004
<i>It is the story of our past</i>

23
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:39,320
<i>and must never be forgotten.</i>

24
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,421
This place is enormous and deserted.

25
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,480
The majority
are probably still asleep.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,560
We need to find Amy, looking
for heat signature anomalies.

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
But, how can all this be here?

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,400
I mean, these plants.

29
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,446
Must be getting closer
to the centre of the city.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,813
You're sure this is the best way
to enter?

31
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:01,243
Front door approach! Definitely.
Always the best way...

32
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:04,045
<i>Hostile life force detected,
area 17.</i>

33
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,840
Apart from the back door
approach, that's also good,

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,141
sometimes better.

35
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,400
We're not hostile, we're not armed!

36
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:18,651
We're here in peace!

37
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,481
Don't you come near me with that!

38
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,320
From the clothing,

39
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:43,120
the human female appears to be more
resistant to the cold than the male.

40
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:45,233
I dressed for Rio!

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,728
Leave her alone!

42
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:48,600
You got me!

43
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:53,030
Decontamination complete.

44
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:56,640
Commencing dissection.

45
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,139
<i>Area 17 incursion,
species diagnostic requested.</i>

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,800
<i>Area 17 incursion,
species diagnostic requested.</i>

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,240
And stay out!

48
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,137
How did you get that?

49
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,240
You never picked
a lizard man's pocket?

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,105
Come on, before he gets back.

51
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,564
That creature,
do you think it was an alien?

52
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:32,868
Any more of them do you think?
Do you think the Earth's been invaded?

53
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:35,245
Don't know. But I know someone
who could have some answers.

54
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:37,295
We need to get back
to the surface and find him.

55
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:40,491
- I wonder where this leads.
- Maybe it's a way out of here.

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,920
- Oh, my God, no.
- What is it?

57
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,640
It's my son.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,451
It's Elliot.
What've they done to him?

59
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:01,279
No! He's in there!
We have to get him out!

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
It's Dad!

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,112
<i>Access denied.
Unauthorised genetic imprint.</i>

62
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:10,040
- Seriously. We can't get in.
- That's my boy in there!

63
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,920
These screens're monitoring something.
I think they're vital signs.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,839
Heartbeats, pulses. Why else would
he be wired up? He's still alive.

65
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:16,801
All right.

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,455
We find weapons,

67
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:22,760
get that creature from the lab
and force it to release Elliot, yeah?

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
Trust me, we'll get him out.

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,360
You lied.

70
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,360
You told us you were the police.

71
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:45,480
It was a misunderstanding.

72
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,778
Who are you?

73
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:48,920
You and the Doctor?

74
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:51,040
Why is this happening to us?

75
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,480
What did we do?

76
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,200
The Doctor'll get your son back,

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,200
I promise. In the meantime,

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
we take turns guarding the creature.

79
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,588
So that's it? We sit and wait.

80
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,642
And then we exchange her
for your family.

81
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
I promise you,

82
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:06,240
I'd trust the Doctor with my life.

83
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:07,880
We stick to his plan.

84
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,133
We keep that creature safe.

85
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:20,981
How can they have escaped?

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,474
This proves all prisoners should
remain under military guard.

87
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:30,809
I'm sure you'd prefer to be in charge
of everything and everyone, Restac.

88
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:33,240
But we rank the same.

89
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,760
Is there any word from Alaya?

90
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,520
It's fine to show concern, you know.

91
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,400
She's part of your gene-chain.

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm Decontaminating now.

93
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,567
Decontamination!

94
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,093
Why aren't you dead?
You're carrying my venom in your blood.

95
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:20,760
But you should have died.
Why aren't you dead?

96
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:22,374
Show me.

97
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,540
- How does it feel, ape?
- Like it's burning in my blood.

98
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:33,214
Please.

99
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,000
If you help me,

100
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,320
I can help you.

101
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,760
If you could cure me,

102
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,360
I could help you escape.

103
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,337
You see?

104
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:44,080
You beg, and offer betrayal,
so early!

105
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,271
Why would I want to escape
when I can watch you die?

106
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:52,118
The first ape
death of the coming war.

107
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,836
Its all right. It won't harm you.

108
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,628
I'm only neutralising all your ape
bacteria.

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,480
I'm not an ape!
Look at the scans! Two hearts!

110
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,920
Totally different! Totally not ape!

111
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,884
Remove all human germs, you remove
half the things keeping me alive.

112
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,024
No, complete the process.

113
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:25,075
That's much better, thanks!

114
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:27,480
Not got any celery, have you?

115
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,000
Not really the climate. Tomatoes, though
you'd do a roaring trade in those.

116
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:33,709
I'm the Doctor,

117
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,946
and there's Nasreen, good!

118
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,120
Oh, a green man.

119
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,656
Hello,

120
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,160
who are you?

121
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Restac. Military commander.

122
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,597
Oh, dear, really?

123
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:48,800
There's always a military,
isn't there?

124
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,929
Your weapon was attacking the
oxygen pockets above our city.

125
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:54,720
Oxygen pockets! Lovely!

126
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,789
But not so good
with an impending drill.

127
00:07:58,327 --> 00:07:59,838
Now it makes sense!

128
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,480
Where is the rest of your
invasion force?

129
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,840
Invasion force?

130
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
Me and lovely Nasreen? No!

131
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,909
We came for the humans you took.

132
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,453
And...

133
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,440
to offer the safe return of Alaya.

134
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,640
Oh, wait, you and she,

135
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
what is it, same genetic source?

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,080
Of course you're worried,
but don't be, she's safe.

137
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:24,550
You claim to come in peace,

138
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:27,720
but you hold one of us hostage.

139
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,160
Wait,
we all want the same thing here.

140
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,520
I don't negotiate with apes.

141
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm going to send a clear
message to those on the surface.

142
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,440
What's that?

143
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:38,047
Your execution.

144
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,640
These chambers
are all over the city.

145
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,370
Turn it off quick!

146
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,240
They're not moving.

147
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,960
Maybe asleep.
Take another look.

148
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,840
Don't look!

149
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,214
What are you doing?
Get out of there.

150
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:22,680
Some sort of suspended animation.

151
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:27,965
I wonder what these are.

152
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:32,809
The Doctor would know.

153
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,989
The Doctor always knows.

154
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:36,580
Look.

155
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:40,372
Wait...

156
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,700
I've got it.

157
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,120
It's how they came up to the surface.
Some sort of powered transport discs.

158
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,240
It's our way out of here.

159
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,640
Even better, weapons, come on,
now we can fight back.

160
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:06,896
- Which way now?
- Door at the end.

161
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:08,879
- Are you sure?
- Nope!

162
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:24,277
We don't stand a chance.

163
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:26,576
We have to find the Doctor.

164
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,240
Dad, are you all right?

165
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:48,016
Ambrose, I'm fine! Leave me alone.

166
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:51,362
You are not fine. Let me...

167
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,593
- Let me look.
- Get off!

168
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,121
Let me look.

169
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:08,819
I don't know what's happening to me.

170
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:12,426
It's going to be fine.

171
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,821
First thing is bring this
temperature down,

172
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,580
get you resting.

173
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:31,480
These must be the only ones awake,
the others must still be in hibernation.

174
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:34,480
Why did they go into
hibernation in the first place?

175
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,520
Their astronomers predicted the planet
heading to Earth on a crash course.

176
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,986
They a built life underground
and sleept for millennia

177
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:44,231
in order to avert what
they thought was the apocalypse.

178
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:46,501
When in reality, it was the moon,

179
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:49,087
coming into alignment
with the Earth.

180
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:53,328
How can you know that?

181
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:58,332
Long time ago,
I met another tribe of homo reptilia,

182
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:00,628
similar, but not identical.

183
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:02,839
Others of our species have survived?

184
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:08,325
The humans attacked them.

185
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:10,090
They died, I'm sorry.

186
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,054
A vermin race.

187
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:27,329
- What's the cure?
- What?

188
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:30,508
I saw what you've done to my dad.

189
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,480
What's the cure?

190
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:35,800
Why would I tell you?

191
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,451
Cos if you don't,

192
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:42,100
I'm going to have
to use this on you.

193
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:44,960
Now you reveal yourselves.

194
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:47,560
First you take my son,
now you hurt my dad.

195
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,258
I'm just protecting my family here.
That's all.

196
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,562
I don't want to use it.

197
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,320
I want you to put things right.

198
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,594
Use it.

199
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:01,079
- What?
- Use it on me.

200
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,319
But you're too afraid.

201
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:11,880
A woman who can't even protect her
own child must be too weak to...

202
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:17,052
I didn't want to do that.
Are you all right?

203
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,289
Tell me, what's the cure for my dad?

204
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:22,009
He's vermin.
He deserves a painful death.

205
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:25,323
- I'm giving you a chance.
- I knew it would be you.

206
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:28,400
The one with the most to lose,
the weakest.

207
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,599
I'm a nurse, you should've told me.

208
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,212
Ambrose... What've you done?

209
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:55,040
She kept taunting me
about Mo and Elliot and you.

210
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:02,843
We have to be better than this!

211
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:04,963
She wouldn't tell me anything.

212
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:07,960
I thought sooner or later,
she'd give in. I would've done.

213
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:11,596
I just... I just want my
family back, Dad.

214
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:13,401
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,273
How do we help you?
Tell us what to do.

216
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:18,108
I knew this would come.

217
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:21,634
And soon the war.

218
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,219
You're not dying.

219
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:27,320
I'm not going to
let you, not today...

220
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,178
You're not authorised to do this!

221
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:49,907
I'm authorised to protect the safety
of our species while they sleep.

222
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,400
Lovely place, very gleaming.

223
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,471
This is our court

224
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:57,480
and our place of execution.

225
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:02,444
- Let them go!
- Amy Pond, there's a girl to rely on.

226
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:07,291
You're covered both ways, so don't
try anything clever, buster.

227
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:12,720
Now let them go. Or I shoot.

228
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:15,680
I'm warning you!

229
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:19,359
- Don't you touch her!
- And you?

230
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:24,760
- All right, Restac.
- You've made your point.

231
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,588
This is now a military tribunal.

232
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,359
Go back to your laboratory,
Malohkeh.

233
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,985
This isn't the way.

234
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:51,707
Prepare them for execution.

235
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,824
Sorry, as rescues go,
didn't live up to its potential.

236
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:02,560
- I'm glad you're OK.
- Me too!

237
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:06,316
- Lizard men, though!
- Homo reptilia...

238
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:09,920
They occupied the planet before humans.
Now they want it back.

239
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,183
After they've wiped
out the human race.

240
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:15,480
Right, preferred it when I
didn't know, to be honest.

241
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:19,181
Why are they waiting?

242
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,120
What do you think
they're going to do with us?

243
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,871
I didn't know it
would go like that, Dad.

244
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:35,724
My little girl,

245
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,360
what have you done?

246
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:41,571
What happens now?

247
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:53,480
<i>Who is the ape leader?</i>

248
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,001
It's them.

249
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,400
How are they doing that?

250
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:00,280
How do they know that we're in here?

251
00:17:01,441 --> 00:17:03,159
<i>Who speaks for the apes?</i>

252
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:08,850
Don't tell them what's happened.

253
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,143
I speak for the...

254
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:20,574
humans. Some of us, anyway.

255
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,480
<i>Do you understand who we are?</i>

256
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,202
Sort of. A bit. Not really.

257
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:28,898
<i>We have ape hostages.</i>

258
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:33,040
- Doctor! Amy!
- Mo!

259
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:35,200
<i>Mo, are you OK?</i>

260
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:38,000
<i>I'm fine, love! I've found Elliot.
I'm bringing him home!</i>

261
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:40,240
<i>Amy! I thought I'd lost you!</i>

262
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:44,600
<i>What, cos I was sucked into the ground?
You're so clingy. Tony Mack!</i>

263
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,559
Having fun down there?

264
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,000
<i>Not to interrupt,</i>

265
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,303
<i>but just a quick reminder
to stay calm.</i>

266
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,319
<i>Show me Alaya.</i>

267
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:58,128
<i>Show me</i>

268
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:02,720
<i>and release her, immediately,
unharmed, or we kill your friends</i>

269
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,199
one by one.

270
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:07,763
<i>Steady now, everyone.</i>

271
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,727
<i>Ambrose, stop it! Get off me, Dad!</i>

272
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,440
We didn't start this!

273
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:14,840
Let Rory deal with this Ambrose!

274
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,240
We're not
doing what you say any more.

275
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,119
Now, give me back my family!

276
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:33,522
<i>Execute the girl.</i>

277
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:35,999
No, wait!

278
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:38,160
- <i>Rory!
- She's not speaking for us!</i>

279
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,874
There's no need for this.

280
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,560
Listen! Whatever you want...
we'll do it! Amy!

281
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,280
- Don't do this.
- No!

282
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,301
- Fire!
- Stop!

283
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:57,360
You want to start a war,
while the rest of us sleep, Restac?

284
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,120
The apes are attacking us!

285
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:03,991
You're our protector, not
our commander, Restac. Unchain them.

286
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
I do not recognise
your authority at this time, Eldane.

287
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:12,703
Well, then, you must shoot me.

288
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,720
You woke him to undermine me.

289
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,640
We're not monsters.
And neither are they.

290
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:27,920
What is it
about apes you love so much?

291
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,919
While you slept, they've evolved.

292
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,616
- I've seen it for myself.
- We used to hunt apes for sport.

293
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:39,200
When we came underground,
they bred and polluted this planet.

294
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:40,947
Shush now, Restac.

295
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:44,660
Go and play soldiers.
I'll let you know if I need you.

296
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:49,874
You'll need me,

297
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:52,239
then we'll see.

298
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,470
Nothing!

299
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,800
- I've got to get down there.
- <i>Rory!</i>

300
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:00,760
- <i>Hello!</i>
- Where's Amy?

301
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:03,680
- <i>She's fine, look, here she is.</i>
- Thank God.

302
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:06,089
<i>- Keeping you on your toes!
- No time to chat.</i>

303
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:10,321
<i>You need to get down here.
Go to the drill storeroom, </i>

304
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,636
<i>there's a large patch of earth
in the middle of the floor.</i>

305
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:16,593
<i>The Silurians are going to send up
transport discs to bring you back</i>

306
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:19,320
<i>down using geothermal energy
and gravity bubble-technology.</i>

307
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:23,120
<i>It's how they travel and frankly
it's pretty cool. Bring Alaya.</i>

308
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:26,960
<i>We hand her over, we can land this
after all. All going to work, promise.</i>

309
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,560
<i>Got to dash! Hurry up!</i>

310
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:33,703
The moment we get down there,
everything will fall apart.

311
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:35,288
We have to return her.

312
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:39,520
They deserve at least that.

313
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:43,480
I'd say, you've got a
fair bit to talk about.

314
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,960
- How so? You both want the planet.
- You both have a genuine claim to it.

315
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:51,160
Are you authorised to negotiate
on behalf of humanity?

316
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,680
Me? No! But they are!

317
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:55,934
- What?
- No, we're not!

318
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,680
Course you are!
Amy Pond and Nasreen Chaudhry,

319
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,271
speaking for the planet! Humanity
couldn't have better ambassadors.

320
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:03,400
Come on,

321
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,152
who has more fun than us?

322
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,800
Is this what happens, in the future,
the planet gets shared?

323
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:12,142
- Is that what we need to do?
- What are you talking about?

324
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:14,720
Nasreen, sorry, probably
worth mentioning at this stage,

325
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,320
Amy and I travel in time, a bit.

326
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,799
Anything else?

327
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,560
There are fixed points through time,
where things must always

328
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,080
stay the way they are.

329
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:28,760
This is not one of them. This is an
opportunity,

330
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,120
a temporal tipping point.
Whatever happens today, will change

331
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,212
future events, create its own
timeline, its own reality.

332
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:37,160
The future pivots around you.

333
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,718
Here. Now.

334
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:40,871
So do good.

335
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:42,674
For humanity,

336
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:45,360
and for Earth.

337
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,320
Right.

338
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,360
No pressure there, then!

339
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,200
We can't share the planet.

340
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,000
Nobody on the surface is going to go for
this idea. It is just too big a leap!

341
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:57,161
Come on.

342
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:00,047
Be extraordinary.

343
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,360
Bringing things to order.

344
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:18,520
The first meeting of representatives

345
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:22,640
of the human race and homo reptilia
is now in session.

346
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:27,520
Never said that before,
that's fab! Carry on!

347
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,663
Now, Mo, let's go and get your son.

348
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:36,760
Humans and their predecessors shooting
the breeze. Never thought I'd see it.

349
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,270
So we get on those and
they take us down through the Earth?

350
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,160
Geothermal gravity bubbles,

351
00:22:47,656 --> 00:22:48,760
or something.

352
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:50,440
They sent four.

353
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,711
She was our only bargaining chip.

354
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:56,800
We have to hand her back.

355
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:58,377
Wait.

356
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:02,293
Before we go down, there's
something I've got to do.

357
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,436
Dad,

358
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:05,690
I need your help.

359
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
- No way.
- Please, Dad...

360
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:10,748
- just a precaution.
- I've told you, I won't do it.

361
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:14,058
- Look at what they did to you!
- This isn't about me or you.

362
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:15,840
It's about your grandson.

363
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,400
If you won't do it for me,
do it for Elliot.

364
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,840
I know I did wrong.

365
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,034
But I can't lose him, Dad.

366
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:33,639
Elliot, there you are.

367
00:23:36,864 --> 00:23:39,840
- If you've harmed him in any way.
- Of course not!

368
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,480
I only store the young.

369
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:42,640
But why?

370
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,160
I took samples of the young,

371
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,120
slowed their lifecycles
to a millionth of their normal rate.

372
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:50,640
I could study how they grew,
what they needed,

373
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,440
how they lived on the surface.

374
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:54,960
You've been down here,
working by yourself, all alone?

375
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:58,129
My family, through the millennia...

376
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:01,319
For the last 300 years, just me.

377
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,439
I never meant to harm your child.

378
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,432
I rather love you.

379
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,719
It's safe. We can wake him.

380
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,089
Come.

381
00:24:31,673 --> 00:24:34,360
- Ell, it's Dad.
- What...? Dad.

382
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:38,840
You're safe now.

383
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:40,881
Where are we?

384
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:47,000
I've got to be honest with you, son.
We're in the centre of the Earth...

385
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,679
and there are lizard men.

386
00:24:57,058 --> 00:24:58,040
I'm sorry.

387
00:24:58,736 --> 00:25:00,280
I took my eye off you.

388
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,600
It's OK.

389
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,445
I forgive you.

390
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:08,959
You go on, Doctor. I'll catch up.

391
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:14,149
<i>Storage facility 19 operational.</i>

392
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:36,868
We lived on the surface of the planet,
long before you did.

393
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,549
Our sole purpose has been

394
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,440
to return to our rightful place.

395
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:44,120
We've got a planet that can't already
sustain the people who live there.

396
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,890
And you want to add
a whole other species,

397
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:48,687
to drain resources...

398
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:52,400
<i>As I sat there that day
across the table from the humans</i>

399
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,400
<i>the future of both species
and of our beloved planet Earth</i>

400
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,429
<i>rested in our hands,</i>

401
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,140
<i>but as the discussions went on,</i>

402
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:05,461
<i>I began to despair about whether
we would ever find any common ground.</i>

403
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,000
<i>As ambassadors for our species,</i>

404
00:26:08,673 --> 00:26:10,921
<i>we all had too much to lose.</i>

405
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:15,400
What about the areas
that aren't habitable to us?

406
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:17,656
Australian outback,

407
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:21,101
Sahara desert, Nevada plains...

408
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:25,577
- They're all deserted.
- Yes, fine,

409
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:29,240
but what happens when their population
grows and breeds and spreads?

410
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,865
And anyway,
what benefit does humanity get,

411
00:26:31,985 --> 00:26:34,389
and how would we ever sell this
to people on the surface?

412
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,320
If I could get a word in,

413
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
maybe I could tell you.

414
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:42,280
You give us space,
we can bring new sources of energy,

415
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,240
new methods of water supply,
new medicines,

416
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,840
scientific advances.

417
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,800
We were a great civilisation.

418
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,040
You provide a place
for us on the surface,

419
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:54,645
we'll give you knowledge
and technology

420
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:56,880
beyond humanity's dreams.

421
00:26:57,829 --> 00:26:59,567
We work together,

422
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,856
this planet could achieve greatness.

423
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:07,293
Now I'm starting to see it.

424
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:14,040
Not bad for a first session.

425
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,708
More similarities than differences.

426
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:19,847
The transport has returned.

427
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:22,046
Your friends are here.

428
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:27,471
That's not right.

429
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:34,959
What are you doing?

430
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:42,240
Protecting our race
against the apes.

431
00:27:42,568 --> 00:27:44,080
You can't do this!

432
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,559
You're a good scientist, Malohkeh,
but this is war.

433
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,040
Here they are.

434
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,319
Something's wrong.

435
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:13,719
What's he carrying?

436
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:22,480
Don't do this.
Tell me you didn't do this.

437
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:39,360
What did you do?

438
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:41,148
It was me.

439
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:44,305
I did it.

440
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,001
Mum?

441
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:47,679
I just wanted you back.

442
00:28:57,263 --> 00:28:58,697
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

443
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:01,240
You have to believe me,
they're better than this.

444
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:04,320
- This is our planet!
- We had a chance here.

445
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,675
Leave us alone.

446
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:08,901
In future, when you talk about this,
you tell people there was a chance

447
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:11,140
but you were so much less

448
00:29:11,472 --> 00:29:13,272
than the best of humanity.

449
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:27,561
My sister.

450
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,200
And you want us
to trust these apes, Doctor?

451
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:00,699
One woman.

452
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:03,722
She was scared for her family.
She's not typical.

453
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:04,862
I think she is.

454
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:07,631
One person let us down.
But there's a whole race

455
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:10,840
of dazzling, peaceful
human beings up there.

456
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,799
You were building something,
come on... An alliance could work!

457
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:18,670
It's too late for that.

458
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:24,499
Why?

459
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,406
Our drill

460
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,280
is set to start
burrowing again in...

461
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,520
15 minutes.

462
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:35,120
- What?
- What choice did I have?

463
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,480
- They had Elliot.
- Don't do this, don't call their bluff.

464
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
Let us go back.

465
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:42,720
And you promise to never come
to the surface ever again.

466
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,886
We'll walk away, leave you alone.

467
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:47,977
Execute her.

468
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:52,360
Back to the lab! Run!

469
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:54,720
Execute all the apes!

470
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,359
This is a deadly weapon, stay back.

471
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:08,447
Take everyone to the lab!

472
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,640
I'll cover you!

473
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,119
Go! Go!

474
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,680
Stop right there!
Or I'll use my very deadly weapon again.

475
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:24,960
One warning, that's all.
If there can be no deal,

476
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
you go back into hibernation.
All of you.

477
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,632
This ends here.

478
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:33,840
It only ends with our victory.

479
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:35,520
Like I said...

480
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:37,750
one warning.

481
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,920
You and your dad keep your eyes on that
screen. Let me know if we get company.

482
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,560
Keep reminding me
how much time I haven't got.

483
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:53,560
12 minutes till drill impact.

484
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,320
Sweaty forehead, dilated pupils,
what're you hiding?

485
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,720
- What happened?
- Alaya's sting.

486
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,389
She said there's no cure.
I'm dying, aren't I?

487
00:32:05,972 --> 00:32:08,392
- You're not dying, you're mutating.
- How can I stop it?

488
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:10,763
Decontamination program!
Might work, don't know.

489
00:32:11,521 --> 00:32:13,569
Eldane, can you run
the program on Tony?

490
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,720
Doctor, shedload of those creatures
coming our way!

491
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:19,400
We're surrounded!

492
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,440
How we do stop the drill,
given we can't get there in time?

493
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,996
Plus, how do we get out,
given that we're surrounded?

494
00:32:25,116 --> 00:32:26,902
How d'you feel about
an energy pulse,

495
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:29,642
channelled up through
the tunnels to the base of the drill?

496
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,793
To blow up my life's work?

497
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,840
Sorry. No nice way of putting that.

498
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,204
Right,

499
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:39,312
you're going to have to do it
before the drill hits the city, in...

500
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:41,030
11 minutes, 40 seconds.

501
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:45,080
- Squeaky bum time!
- But the explosion is going to cave

502
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,201
in all the surrounding tunnels.
We have to be on the surface by then.

503
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:50,351
But we can't get
past Restac's troops.

504
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:52,000
I can help with that.

505
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:54,480
Toxic Fumigation,

506
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:59,000
an emergency failsafe meant
to protect my species from infection.

507
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,440
A warning signal
to occupy cryo-chambers.

508
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:06,870
After that, citywide fumigation,
by toxic gas.

509
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,840
Then the city shuts down.

510
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:13,320
You could end up
killing your own people.

511
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:16,040
Only those foolish enough
to follow Restac.

512
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,040
Are you sure about this?

513
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:21,160
My priority is my race's survival.

514
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:23,658
The Earth isn't ready
for us to return yet.

515
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:26,526
- 10 minutes, Doctor.
- But maybe it should be.

516
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:27,880
So here's a deal.

517
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,680
Everybody listening.

518
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,400
Eldane, you activate shutdown.

519
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,166
I'll amend the system,
set your alarm for 1,000 years' time.

520
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:37,920
1,000 years, to sort the planet out.
To be ready. Pass it on.

521
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:40,335
As legend, or prophesy, or religion,

522
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:42,386
but somehow, make it known.

523
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:44,960
This planet is to be shared.

524
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,600
I get you.

525
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:50,200
9 min, 7 seconds.

526
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:53,960
Fluid controls, my favourite!

527
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:56,640
Energy pulse timed, primed

528
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,854
and set.

529
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:00,400
Before we go, energy barricade,
need to cancel it out, quickly.

530
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,880
Fumigation pre-launching.

531
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:09,240
There's not much time for us
to get from here to the surface!

532
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:10,880
Super-squeaky bum time!

533
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:13,510
Get ready to run for your lives.
Now.

534
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,068
But the decontamination program
on your friend hasn't started yet.

535
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:20,584
Go.

536
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,159
All of you! Go.

537
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:25,488
- We're not leaving you here!
- Granddad!

538
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,599
8 minutes, 10 seconds.

539
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,719
Now you look after your mum.

540
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:33,903
You mustn't blame her.

541
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:36,320
She only did what she
thought was right.

542
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,760
I'm not going to
see you again, am I?

543
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,570
I'll be here.

544
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:43,055
Always.

545
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:45,900
I love you, boy.

546
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:51,119
- You be sure he gets home safe!
- This is my fault.

547
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,069
I can't go back up there.

548
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:54,520
I'd be a freakshow.

549
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,040
The technology down here's
my only hope.

550
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,395
I love you, Dad.

551
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:08,636
Go. Come on.

552
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,319
Go on.

553
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:19,680
<i>Toxic fumigation initiated.</i>

554
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:21,800
<i>Return to cryo-chambers.</i>

555
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:27,560
This is not the order!

556
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:29,672
They're going!

557
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,560
- We're clear!
- Follow Nasreen. Look for a blue box.

558
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,398
Get ready to run.

559
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,760
I'm sorry. I thought for a moment,
our race, and the humans...

560
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:46,439
Yeah. Me too.

561
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,760
- We've got less than six minutes.
- Go!

562
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,814
Go! I'm right behind you!

563
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:55,062
Let's go.

564
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:56,900
I'm not coming either.

565
00:35:58,725 --> 00:35:59,560
What?

566
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:04,789
Oh, for goodness' sake!

567
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,040
We're going to hibernate with them,
me and Tony.

568
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,360
Doctor, you must go!

569
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,760
I can be decontaminated
when we're woken.

570
00:36:12,494 --> 00:36:14,721
- All the time in the world.
- But...

571
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,720
Nasreen...

572
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,895
- You...
- No. This is perfect.

573
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:21,040
I don't want to go.

574
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,099
I've got what I was digging for.

575
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,640
I can't leave
when I've only just found it.

576
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,760
Thank you, Doctor.

577
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,320
The pleasure was all mine.

578
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:40,920
Come and look for us.

579
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,400
<i>So, the Doctor sent our warriors
back to their rest</i>

580
00:36:52,227 --> 00:36:54,640
<i>on the promise of future harmony
with humans.</i>

581
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:09,290
- <i>Immediate evacuation...</i>
- Other way, idiot!

582
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,149
<i>Toxic fumigation
is about to commence.</i>

583
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:15,061
Come on!

584
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:21,819
No questions, just get in!
And yes, I know it's big!

585
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,183
Ambrose, sickbay up the stairs,
left, then left again...

586
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:27,800
get yourself fixed up. Come on!
Five minutes and counting...

587
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,040
Not here.

588
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,120
Not now. It's getting wider.

589
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,720
The crack on my bedroom wall.

590
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,360
Two parts of space and time that should
never have touched right here.

591
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:44,840
And the Byzantium. All through
the universe rips in the continuum.

592
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,960
How could it be following me?

593
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,840
Some sort of space-time cataclysm.
An explosion, maybe.

594
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,520
Big enough to put cracks
in the universe. But

595
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,636
- what?
- Four minutes 50... We have to go!

596
00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:57,930
The Angels laughed. Prisoner Zero knew,
everybody knows, except me!

597
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,918
- Doctor, just leave it.
- But where there's an explosion,

598
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,009
there's shrapnel.

599
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,200
Doctor,
you can't put your hand in there!

600
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,458
Why not?

601
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,280
I've got something!

602
00:38:23,574 --> 00:38:24,520
What is it?

603
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:30,920
I don't know.

604
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:38,070
She was there, when the gas started.
She must've been poisoned.

605
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,280
- OK, get in the TARDIS, both of you.
- You did this.

606
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,240
Rory, can you hear me?

607
00:38:56,674 --> 00:38:58,022
I don't understand.

608
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,960
Don't talk. Doctor, is he OK?
We have to get him into the TARDIS!

609
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:02,400
We were on the hill.

610
00:39:05,341 --> 00:39:06,640
I can't die here.

611
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:08,294
Don't say that.

612
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:12,720
You're so beautiful...

613
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:19,674
I'm sorry.

614
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,455
Doctor, help him.

615
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,075
If the time energy catches up with you,
you'll never have been born.

616
00:39:36,195 --> 00:39:38,680
It will erase every moment of your
existence. You will never

617
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,080
have lived at all.

618
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,080
Move away from the light,
if it touches you you'll be wiped

619
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,205
from history.

620
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,600
- Move away now.
- No!

621
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,080
I am not leaving him!

622
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,520
We have to help him!

623
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
The light's already around him,
we can't help him.

624
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,740
- I am not leaving him!
- We have to.

625
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,320
- Sorry!
- Get off me!

626
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,120
- Sorry!
- Get off me!

627
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:09,175
Let me out, please let me out...
I need to get Rory.

628
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:17,343
That light,

629
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,005
if his body's absorbed
I'll forget him.

630
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,590
He'll never have existed.

631
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,360
You can't let that happen.

632
00:40:29,204 --> 00:40:30,552
What are you doing?

633
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,302
Doctor! No!

634
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,920
We can't just leave him there.

635
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,160
Don't forget him. If you forget him,
you'll lose him forever.

636
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,424
On the Byzantium,
I still remembered the Clerics

637
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:51,595
because I am a time traveller,
now you said.

638
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:55,280
They weren't part of your world. It's
different... This is your own history

639
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,240
Don't tell me it's going to be OK.
You have to make it OK.

640
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,840
It's going to be hard,
but you can do it, Amy.

641
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:03,840
Tell me about Rory.
Fantastic Rory,

642
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,240
funny Rory, gorgeous Rory.

643
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,840
Amy, listen to me.
Do exactly as I say.

644
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,600
Amy, please.
Keep concentrating. You can do this.

645
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:15,560
- I can't.
- You can. You can do it.

646
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:18,240
I can't help you unless you do.

647
00:41:18,716 --> 00:41:21,037
We can still save his memory.
Come on, Amy.

648
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,005
Please...

649
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,864
Come on, Amy, come on.

650
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:31,763
Amy, please.

651
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,240
Don't let anything distract you.

652
00:41:40,242 --> 00:41:41,080
Remember

653
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
Rory.

654
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,960
Keep remembering,
Rory is only alive in your memory.

655
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,059
You must keep hold of him.
Don't let anything distract you.

656
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,480
Rory still lives in your mind.

657
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,300
What were you saying?

658
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,024
I have seen some things today,
but this is beyond mad.

659
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:16,480
5 seconds till it all goes up!

660
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:33,476
All Nasreen's work just

661
00:42:33,828 --> 00:42:34,825
erased.

662
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:36,320
Good thing she's not here.

663
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,681
She's going to give Tony hell
when they wake up.

664
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:44,935
You could've let those things
shoot me.

665
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:48,520
You saved me.

666
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:50,337
An eye for an eye.

667
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:53,800
It's never the way.

668
00:42:54,712 --> 00:42:56,600
Now you show your son
how wrong you were.

669
00:42:57,922 --> 00:42:59,340
How there's another way.

670
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,633
You make him the best of humanity...

671
00:43:04,948 --> 00:43:06,530
In the way you couldn't be.

672
00:43:28,574 --> 00:43:29,957
You're very quiet.

673
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:32,040
Look! There I am again!

674
00:43:32,418 --> 00:43:33,508
Hello, me!

675
00:43:38,162 --> 00:43:39,205
Are you OK?

676
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:43,560
I thought I saw someone else there
for a second.

677
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:49,800
I need a holiday.
Didn't we talk about Rio?

678
00:43:50,925 --> 00:43:51,880
You go in.

679
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:53,890
Just fix this lock, keeps

680
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
jamming.

681
00:43:57,314 --> 00:43:59,200
You boys and your locksmithery.

682
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:05,353
<i>Now as my people awaken
from their 1,000 year sleep</i>

683
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:07,500
<i>ready to rise to the surface</i>

684
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,903
<i>my thoughts turn back to the Doctor,</i>

685
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:12,258
<i>the losses he suffered then</i>

686
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:16,320
<i>and the greater loses
that were still to come.</i>

687
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,560
To me, Van Gogh is the finest painter
of them all.

688
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,116
- Look there, the window of the church.
- Is it a face?

689
00:44:35,236 --> 00:44:36,720
And not a nice face at all.

690
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,755
We need to talk to Vincent van Gogh.

691
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:40,080
Wakey! Wakey!

692
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:43,440
There's so much more to the world
than the average eye's allowed to see.'

693
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:46,120
What monster could have done this?

694
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:47,954
The eyes without mercy.

695
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:50,760
If we're not careful the result
of our present little trip will be

696
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,843
the brutal murder of the greatest artist
who ever lived.

697
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,440
Can you breathe a little quieter,
