1
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:38,606
Rory, it's starting.

2
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:47,105
False alarm.

3
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:49,087
What?

4
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:52,654
I don't know what it feels like.
I've never had a baby before.

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
I know,

6
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:02,838
- leaf blowers. Use a rake!
- No, it's...

7
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:07,280
I knew.

8
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:09,447
I just knew.

9
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:21,440
- Doctor.
- I've crushed your flowers.

10
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,572
- Amy will kill you.
- Where is she?

11
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:26,160
- She'll need a bit longer.
- Whenever you're ready, Amy.

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,928
- You've swallowed a planet.
- I'm pregnant.

13
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:35,740
- You're huge.
- Yeah, I'm pregnant.

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,673
- Look at you. When worlds collide.
- Doctor, I'm pregnant.

15
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:42,041
Look at you both. Five years later
and you haven't changed a bit.

16
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:44,268
Apart from age and size.

17
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:45,791
Good to see you, Doctor.

18
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:48,620
Are you pregnant?

19
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:58,386
Leadworth.

20
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,226
Vibrant as ever.

21
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:02,968
It's Upper Leadworth, actually.
We've gone slightly upmarket.

22
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:06,272
- Where is everyone?
- This is busy.

23
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:09,020
OK, it's quiet.

24
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:11,476
But it's really restful

25
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,812
and healthy.

26
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,120
Loads of people here live well
into their 90s.

27
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,273
- Well, don't let that get you down.
- It's not getting me down.

28
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:20,393
I wanted to see how you were.

29
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:23,280
I don't just abandon people
when they leave the TARDIS.

30
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:25,139
This Time Lord's for life.

31
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:27,400
You don't get rid
of the Doctor so easily.

32
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:30,120
- You came here by mistake, didn't you?
- Yeah,

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,709
bit of a mistake. But look,
what a result. Look at this...

34
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:35,128
bench. What a nice bench.

35
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:38,363
What will they think of next?

36
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:44,722
So.

37
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:48,629
What do you do around here
to stave off the, you know...

38
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,305
- Self harm.
- Boredom...

39
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,536
We relax...

40
00:02:56,796 --> 00:02:57,800
We live,

41
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,360
- we listen to the birds.
- Yeah, see,

42
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:03,956
birds.

43
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,444
Those are nice.

44
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:08,632
We didn't get time to listen
to birdsong back in the TARDIS days.

45
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,913
Blimey. My head's a bit...

46
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,120
No, you're right,

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,040
there wasn't a a lot of time
for birdsong back in the good...

48
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:22,840
old...

49
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,785
days.
What?

50
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:32,180
No, yes,

51
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:33,692
sorry, what?

52
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:36,063
You're OK.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,950
Thank God. I had
a terrible nightmare about you two.

54
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:42,165
That was scary.

55
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:44,960
Don't ask, you don't want to know.

56
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:46,852
- You're safe now.
- OK.

57
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:48,540
That's what counts.

58
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:50,325
Blimey,

59
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:53,942
never dropped off like that before.
Well, never, really.

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,960
I'm getting on a bit, you see.

61
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:59,320
Don't let the cool gear fool you.
Now, what's wrong with the console?

62
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:01,603
Red flashing lights...

63
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,240
I bet they mean something.

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,587
I also had a kind of dream thing.

65
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,294
- Yeah, so did I.
- Not a nightmare, though, just...

66
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:13,696
- we were married.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,145
- In a little village.
- A sweet little village,

68
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:18,876
- and you were pregnant.
- Yeah, I was huge.

69
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,969
- I was a boat.
- So you had the same dream, then?

70
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:23,720
Exactly the same dream?

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,434
- Are you calling me a boat?
- And Doctor, you were visiting.

72
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,160
Yeah, you came to our cottage.

73
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:31,531
How can we have the same dream?
It doesn't make sense.

74
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:34,344
And you had a nightmare about us.

75
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:37,440
- What happened to us in the nightmare?
- It was similar. In some aspects.

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,160
- Which aspects?
- All of them.

77
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,152
- You had the same dream?
- Basically.

78
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,651
- You said it was a nightmare.
- Did I say nightmare? No.

79
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:45,880
More of a really good... mare.

80
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,350
Look, it doesn't matter. We all had

81
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,040
some kind of psychic episode.
We probably jumped a time track

82
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,280
Forget it, we're back to reality.

83
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,068
Doctor, if we're back to reality
how come I can still hear birds?

84
00:04:58,188 --> 00:05:01,560
Yeah, the same birds.
The same ones we heard in the dream.

85
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,724
Sorry. Nodded off, stupid.

86
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:06,622
God, I must be overdoing it.

87
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,908
I was dreaming we were back
on the TARDIS.

88
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:12,240
- You had the same dream, didn't you?
- Back on the TARDIS.

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,306
- Weren't we just saying the same thing?
- We thought this was the dream.

90
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:17,872
I think so.
Why do dreams fade so quickly?

91
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:20,476
- Doctor, what is going on?
- Is this because of you?

92
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:23,010
- Is this because you've shown up again?
- Listen to me.

93
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,221
Trust nothing. From now on,
trust nothing you see, hear or feel.

94
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,913
But we're awake now. You thought
you were awake on the TARDIS too.

95
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,846
- But we're home.
- Yeah. You're home.

96
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:34,659
You're also dreaming.
Trouble is, which is which?

97
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:36,839
Are we flashing forwards...

98
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,946
or backwards?

99
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,606
Hold on tight.

100
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,763
This is going be a tricky one.

107
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:28,292
This is bad. I don't like this.

108
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:34,514
Never use force.
You just embarrass yourself.

109
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,283
Unless you're cross, in which case,

110
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:39,002
- always use force.
- Shall I run and get the manual?

111
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,609
I threw it in a supernova.

112
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,742
You threw the manual in a supernova?

113
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,800
- Why?
- Because I disagreed with it.

114
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
Stop talking to me when I'm cross.

115
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,880
OK, but whatever's wrong
with the TARDIS,

116
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,186
is that what caused us
to dream about the future?

117
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:54,440
- If we were dreaming of the future...
- We were. We were in Leadworth.

118
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:55,764
Upper Leadworth.

119
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:58,680
Yeah, and we could still be
in Upper Leadworth, dreaming of this.

120
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,600
- Don't you get it?
- No,

121
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,720
OK, no, this is real.
I'm definitely awake.

122
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:05,680
And you thought you were awake
when you were all elephanty.

123
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:07,840
Pregnant.

124
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:10,413
You could be giving birth.
This could be the dream.

125
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,074
Trust nothing we see
or hear or feel.

126
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,640
Look around you.
Examine everything. Look for all

127
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,760
the details that don't ring true.

128
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:21,280
OK, we're in a spaceship that's bigger
on the inside than the outside.

129
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,355
With a bow tie-wearing alien.

130
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:25,560
So maybe "what rings true"
isn't so simple.

131
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:27,094
Valid point.

132
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,206
It's dead.

133
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:40,060
We're in a dead time machine.

134
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:48,693
Remember, this is real,
but when we wake up in the other place,

135
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:51,048
- remember how real this feels.
- It is real.

136
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:52,800
I know it's real.

137
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:04,166
OK. This is the real one,

138
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:06,216
definitely this one. It's all solid.

139
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:07,892
It felt solid in the TARDIS too.

140
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:10,036
You can't spot a dream while
you're having it.

141
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,458
- What are you doing?
- Looking for motion blur, pixilation.

142
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,450
It could be a computer simulation.

143
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:17,384
I don't think so, though.

144
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:19,751
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

145
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:22,596
You're a doctor.

146
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:25,538
Yeah. And unlike you,
I've actually passed some exams.

147
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:28,210
A doctor, not a nurse.
Just like you've always dreamed.

148
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,880
- How interesting.
- What is?

149
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,053
Your dream wife, your dream job,

150
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:35,241
probably your dream baby.
Maybe this is your dream.

151
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,796
It's Amy's dream too. Isn't it, Amy?

152
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,448
- Yes. Course it is.
- Yeah.

153
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:41,721
- What's that?
- Old people's home.

154
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,371
You said everyone here lives
to their 90s.

155
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:52,574
There's something here
that doesn't make sense.

156
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,703
Let's go and poke it with a stick.

157
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:00,840
Can we not do the running thing?

158
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,803
Hello, Dr Williams.

159
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,247
Hello, Rory love.

160
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:10,087
Hello, Mrs Poggit. How's your hip?

161
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:11,352
A bit stiff.

162
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,047
Easy, D-96 compound, plus...

163
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,480
No, you don't have that yet,
forget that.

164
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:18,160
Who's your friend?

165
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:20,165
A junior doctor?

166
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,820
- Yes.
- Can I borrow you?

167
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,820
You're the size of my grandson.

168
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:29,840
Slightly keen to move on.
Freak psychic schism to sort out.

169
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,400
You're incredibly old, aren't you?

170
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:48,431
OK, I hate this, Doctor.

171
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:51,400
Stop it, because this is definitely
real, it's definitely this one.

172
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,971
I keep saying that, don't I?

173
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,920
- It's bloody cold.
- The heating's off.

174
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,828
- The heating's off?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:58,842
Put on a jumper.
That's what I always do.

176
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:01,720
Sorry about Mrs Poggit.
She's so lovely though.

177
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
I wouldn't believe her nice old
lady act if I were you.

178
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,697
What do you mean, "act"?

179
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:10,318
Everything's off, sensors,
core power. We're drifting.

180
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:15,239
The scanner's down so we can't
even see out. We could be anywhere.

181
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:18,703
Someone, something,
is overriding my controls.

182
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
That took a while.

183
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:24,802
Honestly,
I'd heard such good things.

184
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:27,880
Last of the Time Lords,
the Oncoming Storm.

185
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:29,654
Him in the bow tie.

186
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:32,907
How did you get into my TARDIS?

187
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:35,040
- What are you?
- What shall we call me?

188
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:39,080
If you're the Time Lord,
let's call me the Dream Lord.

189
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,800
- Nice look.
- This? No, I'm not convinced.

190
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:44,640
Bow ties?

191
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:50,689
Interesting.

192
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:53,320
I'd love to be impressed,
but Dream Lord.

193
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,040
It's in the name, isn't it?

194
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,565
Spooky, not quite there.

195
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:01,720
- And yet, very much here.
- I'll do the talking, thank you.

196
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,030
Amy, want to take a guess at what

197
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:07,761
- that is?
- Dream Lord. He creates dreams.

198
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,999
Dreams, delusions, cheap tricks.

199
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,500
And what about the gooseberry here,
does he get a guess?

200
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:16,560
Listen, mate, if anyone's the gooseberry
around here, it's the Doctor.

201
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,252
There's a delusion
I'm not responsible for.

202
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:22,080
No, he is. Isn't he, Amy?

203
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
Amy, have to sort your men out.

204
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:25,680
Choose, even.

205
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:28,760
I have chosen.
Of course I've chosen.

206
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:33,280
- It's you, stupid.
- Oh, good, thanks.

207
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,179
You can't fool me.
I've seen your dreams.

208
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,290
Some of them twice, Amy.

209
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,640
Blimey. I'd blush

210
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,560
if I had a blood supply
or a real face.

211
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,290
Where did you pick up
this cheap cabaret act?

212
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,480
Me? You're on shaky ground.

213
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,520
- Am I?
- If you had any more tawdry quirks

214
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,760
you could open
up a Tawdry Quirk Shop.

215
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:56,880
The madcap vehicle,

216
00:11:57,304 --> 00:11:58,854
the cockamamie hair,

217
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:02,040
the clothes designed by
a first-year fashion student...

218
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,911
I'm surprised you haven't
got a little purple space dog

219
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:08,520
just to ram home what
an intergalactic wag you are.

220
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,130
Where was I?

221
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,840
- You were...
- I know where I was.

222
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,947
So, here's your challenge.
Two worlds.

223
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,800
Here in the time machine,

224
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,280
and there in the village
that time forgot.

225
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,969
One is real, the other's fake.

226
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,970
And just to make it more interesting

227
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,720
you're going to face
in both worlds a deadly danger.

228
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,959
But only one of the dangers is real.

229
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,680
Tweet, tweet. Time to sleep.

230
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:40,840
Or are you waking up?

231
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:54,720
This is bad.
This is very, very bad.

232
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
Look at this X-ray.

233
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,823
Your brain is
completely see-through.

234
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:01,399
But I've always been able
to see through you, Doctor.

235
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,262
- Always? What do you mean, always?
- Now then. The prognosis is this.

236
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:08,026
If you die in the dream
you wake up in reality.

237
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:12,146
Healthy recovery in next to no time. Ask
me what happens if you die in reality?

238
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,516
What happens?

239
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:15,887
You die, stupid.
That's why it's called reality.

240
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,599
Have you met the Doctor before?
Do you know him?

241
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,608
- Doctor, does he?
- Don't get jealous.

242
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:22,391
He's been around, our boy.

243
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,445
Never mind that.
You've got a world to choose.

244
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:27,959
One reality was always
too much for you, Doctor.

245
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,040
Take two and call me in the morning.

246
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:34,079
OK, I don't like him.

247
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:35,800
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

248
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:38,470
- It's a big universe.
- Why is he doing this?

249
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,470
Maybe because he has no physical form.
That gets you down after a while,

250
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,662
so he's taking it out
on folk like us who can

251
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,440
- touch and eat and feel.
- What does he mean, deadly danger?

252
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:49,440
Nothing deadly has happened here.

253
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,560
- A bit of natural wastage, obviously.
- They've all gone.

254
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,240
They've all gone.

255
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,800
Stop. You two, over there.

256
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:16,230
Why would they leave?

257
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,999
And what did you mean about
Mrs Poggit's act?

258
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,819
One of my tawdry quirks

259
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,178
sniffing out things
that aren't what they seem.

260
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:26,174
Come on, let's think. The mechanics
of this reality split we're stuck in

261
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:30,193
time asleep matches time in our dream
world, unlike in conventional dreams.

262
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:32,480
And we're all dreaming
the same dream.

263
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,826
Sort of communal trance,
very rare, very complicated.

264
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:37,395
I'm sure there's a dream giveaway.
But my mind isn't working

265
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:41,098
because this village is so dull.

266
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,683
I'm slowing down, like you two have.

267
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:46,654
Really.

268
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:49,826
It's coming.

269
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,405
- Help her, you're a doctor.
- It's OK, we're doctors.

270
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,825
What do we do?

271
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,040
OK, it's not coming.

272
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:59,455
- What?
- This is my life now and it just turned

273
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:00,760
you white as a sheet.

274
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,570
So don't you call it dull again,
ever. OK?

275
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,080
Sorry.

276
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:34,670
Now, we all know there's
an elephant in the room.

277
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,232
I have to be this size,
I'm having a baby.

278
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:38,878
The hormones seem real, but no.

279
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:41,856
Is nobody going
to mention Rory's ponytail?

280
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,282
- You hold him down, I'll cut it off.
- This from the man in the bow tie.

281
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:48,802
Bow ties are cool.

282
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:57,430
I don't know about you, but I wouldn't
hire Mrs Poggit as a babysitter.

283
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:06,506
What's she doing?

284
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,541
What does she want?

285
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,534
Oh, no, here we go.

286
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:16,714
It's really cold.

287
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,640
- Have you got any warm clothing?
- What does it matter if we're cold?

288
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,120
We have to know what she is up to.

289
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:24,004
Sorry. Sorry.

290
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:27,480
There should be some stuff
down there, have a look.

291
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,640
I want the other life.

292
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,389
You know,
where we're happy and settled

293
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:54,671
and about to have a baby.

294
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,542
But don't you wonder,

295
00:16:57,662 --> 00:17:00,693
if that life is real, then why
would we give up all this?

296
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:02,545
Why would anyone?

297
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:06,762
- Because were going to freeze to death?
- The Doctor will fix it.

298
00:17:10,074 --> 00:17:13,161
Because we're going to get married?

299
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:18,759
- We can still get married. Some day.
- You don't want to any more?

300
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:22,999
- I thought you'd chosen me, not him.
- You are always so insecure.

301
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,795
You ran off with another man.

302
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,286
- Not in that way.
- It was the night before our wedding.

303
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:29,685
We're in a time machine.

304
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:32,598
It'd be the night before our wedding
for as long as we want.

305
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,927
We have to grow up eventually.

306
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:38,760
Says who?

307
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:46,362
Rory, wind.

308
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:49,040
Amy, could you attach this
to the monitor, please.

309
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:53,270
I was promised amazing worlds.
Instead I get duff central heating

310
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,214
and a weird, kitcheny
wind-up device.

311
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,240
It's a generator. Get winding.

312
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,160
- It's not enough.
- Rory, wind.

313
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:03,080
Why is the Dream Lord
picking on you? Why us?

314
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:11,480
Where are we?

315
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:14,920
- We're in trouble.
- What is that?

316
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:16,462
A star.

317
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:18,732
A cold star.

318
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,680
That's why we're freezing.
It's not a malfunction.

319
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,480
We're drifting towards a cold sun.

320
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,201
That's our danger
for this version of reality.

321
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:34,400
This must be the dream. There is no such
things as the cold stars. Stars burn.

322
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,320
- So's this one. It's just burning cold.
- Is that possible?

323
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,920
I can't know everything. Why does
everybody expect me to, always?

324
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,886
This is something
you haven't seen before.

325
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:47,199
- Does that mean this is the dream?
- I don't know.

326
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,604
But there it is,

327
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:52,047
and I'd say we've got about 14 minutes
until we crash into it.

328
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:55,200
- But that's not a problem.
- You know how to get us out of this?

329
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,120
- Because we'll have frozen to death.
- Then what'll we do?

330
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,529
Stay calm.
Don't get sucked in to it,

331
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:02,880
because this just might
be the battle we have to lose.

332
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:05,928
- This is so you, isn't it?
- What?

333
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:11,344
What a weird new star, 14 minutes left
to live and one man to save the day.

334
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,720
I just wanted a nice
village and a family.

335
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,029
Oh, dear, Doctor.

336
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:17,118
Dissent in the ranks.

337
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:19,240
There was an old doctor
from Gallifrey,

338
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:22,000
Who ended up throwing his life away,

339
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,525
He let down his friends and...

340
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:26,678
Oh, no.

341
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,960
We've run out of time.

342
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:31,680
Don't spend too long there.

343
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,679
Or you'll catch your death here.

344
00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:42,507
Where have the children gone? Don't
know. Play time's probably over.

345
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:46,480
You see, this is the real one.
I just feel it. Don't you feel it?

346
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,270
- I feel it both places.
- I feel it here.

347
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:51,238
It's just so

348
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:54,160
tranquil and relaxed.

349
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:57,200
Nothing bad could ever happen here.

350
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,800
Not really me, though, is it?

351
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,296
Would I be happy settling down
in a place with a pub, two shops

352
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,176
and a really bad amateur
dramatics society?

353
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:08,200
That's why I got pregnant, so I don't
have to see them doing Oklahoma.

354
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:11,519
Doctor, what are you doing?
And what are those piles of dust?

355
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:18,289
Play time's definitely over.

356
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:20,760
Oh, my God.

357
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:25,171
What happened to them?

358
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:34,840
I think they did.

359
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,834
- They're just old people.
- No.

360
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:40,400
They're very old people.

361
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:44,079
Sorry, Rory, I don't think you're
what's been keeping them alive.

362
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,550
Hello, peasants. What's this,
attack of the old people?

363
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,067
Oh, that's ridiculous.

364
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,080
This has got to be the dream,
hasn't it? What do you think, Amy?

365
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,200
Let's all jump under a bus and
wake up in the TARDIS. You first!

366
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,920
- Leave her alone!
- Do that again.

367
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,234
I love it when he does that.

368
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:06,793
Tall dark hero, "leave her alone".

369
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:09,800
- Just leave her!
- Yes, you're not quite so impressive.

370
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,800
But I know where your heart lies,
don't I, Amy Pond?

371
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:15,200
Just shut up and leave me alone.

372
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,120
But listen, you're in there.

373
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:19,929
Loves a redhead, the Doctor!

374
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,113
Has he
told you about Elizabeth the First?

375
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,236
She thought she was the first.

376
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:26,192
Drop it.
Drop all of it. I know who you are.

377
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:27,951
- Course you don't.
- Course I do.

378
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:30,600
No idea how you can be here,
but there's only one person

379
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,719
in the universe who hates me
as much as you do.

380
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:36,807
Never mind me!

381
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:39,359
Maybe you should worry about them.

382
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,200
- Hi.
- Hello.

383
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,800
We were wondering where you went
to get reinforcements!

384
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:56,159
Are you all right? You look a bit
tense.

385
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,846
- Hello, Mr Nainby!
- Rory...

386
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:01,527
Mr Nainby ran the sweet shop. He
used to slip me the odd free toffee.

387
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,200
Did I not say thank you?

388
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,888
- How did he do that?!
- I suspect he's not himself.

389
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:11,367
Don't get comfortable here.
You may have to run. Fast.

390
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:12,919
Can't we just talk to them?

391
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,107
There is an eye in her mouth!

392
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:21,032
There's a whole creature inside her.
Inside all of them.

393
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:23,275
They've been there for years,
living and waiting.

394
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:26,960
That is disgusting.

395
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:30,072
They're not going to be peeping
out of anywhere else are they?

396
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:32,993
Run! OK, Leave them. Talk to me.

397
00:22:33,113 --> 00:22:36,480
Talk to me. You are Eknodines.

398
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:39,672
A proud, ancient race,
you're better than this.

399
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,080
Why are you hiding away here?
Why aren't you at home?

400
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:45,160
- <i>We were driven from our pl...</i>
- Planet by upstart neighbours.

401
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,080
- <i>So we've... </i>
- Been living here inside the bodies

402
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,560
of old humans for...

403
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,404
years. No wonder they live so long,
you're keeping them alive.

404
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:53,040
<i>We were humbled and destroyed.</i>

405
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,560
<i>Now we will do the same to others.</i>

406
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,634
OK, makes sense, I suppose.

407
00:22:57,754 --> 00:22:59,280
Credible enough, could be real.

408
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,796
Morning.

409
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,279
You need to leave this planet.

410
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,885
Wait! Stop!

411
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:17,960
After all I've done
for the over-70s in this village.

412
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,956
OK, this is crazy.

413
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:24,129
She loves me, I fixed her depression,
she's just a little old lady.

414
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,839
Mrs Hammill, we don't understand...

415
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,720
I'll deal with this one, Chubs.

416
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:45,008
I can't hit her.

417
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:46,679
Whack her!

418
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,360
We just ran away.

419
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,715
We just abandoned the Doctor.
Don't ever call me Chubs again.

420
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,040
We don't see him for years, and
somehow we don't really connect

421
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,396
any more and then, then he takes the
bullet for us.

422
00:24:15,516 --> 00:24:17,560
Hey, he'll be fine.
You know the Doctor.

423
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:19,241
He's Mr Cool.

424
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,600
Oh,
I love a good butcher's don't you?

425
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:38,946
We've got to use these places
or they'll shut down.

426
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:42,768
But you're probably a vegetarian,
you big

427
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:45,350
- flop-haired wuss.
- Oh, pipe down. I'm busy.

428
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,045
Maybe you need a little sleep.

429
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,680
Oh, wait a moment.

430
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,160
If you fall a sleep here,
several dozen angry pensioners

431
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,240
will destroy you
with their horrible eye things.

432
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:04,080
Fingers in the ear? Brilliant!

433
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:06,400
What's next, shouting boo?

434
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:08,022
Come in.

435
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,306
Come in.

436
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,240
Yes, we've got lots at "steak"
here this week.

437
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:13,720
Lots at steak.

438
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:15,116
Get it?

439
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:17,839
Are these jokes wasted on you?

440
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:22,679
Wait, stop...

441
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,839
I can't watch.

442
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:42,228
- It's colder.
- The three of us have to agree,

443
00:25:42,348 --> 00:25:44,924
now, which is the dream.
It's this, here.

444
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,993
He could be right. The science is
all wrong here, burning ice?

445
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,528
No, no, no ice can burn, sofas
can read, it's a big universe.

446
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:54,062
We have to agree which battle
to lose. All of us, now.

447
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:57,160
- OK, which world do you think is real?
- This one. No. The other one.

448
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,799
- But are we disagreeing, or competing?
- Competing over what?

449
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:07,259
- Nine minutes till impact.
- What temperature is it?

450
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,800
Outside? How
many noughts have you got? Inside?

451
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,840
I don't know but I can't
feel my feet and... other parts.

452
00:26:13,562 --> 00:26:16,320
- I think all my parts are basically fine.
- Stop competing!

453
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:19,050
Can't we call for help?

454
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,600
Yeah, the universe is really small
bound to be someone nearby!

455
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:25,519
Put these on, both of you.

456
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:32,240
A poncho. The biggest crime
against fashion since lederhosen.

457
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,000
Here we go!

458
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:38,000
My boys... my poncho boys.

459
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:40,866
If we're going to die, let's die
looking like a Peruvian folk band.

460
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:46,218
- We're not going to die.
- No, we're not,

461
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,368
but our time's running out.
If we fall asleep here we're in trouble.

462
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:51,362
If we could divide up,

463
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,733
then we'd have an active presence
in each world, but the Dream Lord

464
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:57,240
is switching us between the worlds.
Why, why, what's the logic?

465
00:26:57,733 --> 00:27:00,520
- Good idea, Veggie,
- Let's divide you three up,

466
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,929
so I can have a little chat
with our lovely companion.

467
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,280
Maybe I'll keep her,

468
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:09,320
and you can
have Pointy Nose to yourself for

469
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:13,335
all eternity, should you manage to
clamber aboard some sort of reality.

470
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:15,185
- Can you hear that?
- What? No.

471
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:19,661
Don't be scared, we'll be back.

472
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
- Rory, Doctor, don't leave me.
- Amy,

473
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:26,841
we're going to have fun aren't we?

474
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:28,930
No, please,

475
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:30,742
not alone.

476
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:38,801
Sorry.

477
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:42,720
I'm sorry. Sorry...

478
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:48,680
Sorry.

479
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:50,080
OK, where is it?

480
00:29:00,233 --> 00:29:02,061
Oh, help, somebody!

481
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:04,880
You couldn't live near
the shops, could you?

482
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:12,920
It's OK, it's only me.

483
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,600
Get in, get in, get in.
Quickly, quickly, over here.

484
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,913
Quickly, come on, jump in.
Quick get in now, quickly. Hurry up.

485
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:30,231
Are we in?

486
00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:34,465
Come on, let's go, quickly,

487
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:36,973
all four, that's it everyone in.

488
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Poor Amy.

489
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:56,200
He always leaves you, doesn't he?

490
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,350
Alone in the dark.

491
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,280
Never apologises.

492
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,973
He doesn't have to.

493
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:05,081
That's good,

494
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,428
because he never will.

495
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,840
And now he's left you with me.

496
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:14,675
Spooky old, not-to-be-trusted me.

497
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:18,359
Anything could happen.

498
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:22,640
Who are you?

499
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:24,761
And what do you want?

500
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:28,800
The Doctor knows you,
but he's not telling me who you are.

501
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:32,600
And he always does. Takes him
a while sometimes, but he tells me.

502
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:36,800
So you're something different.

503
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:40,680
Oh, is that who you think you are?
The one he trusts?

504
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:42,280
Actually, yes.

505
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,458
The one girl in the universe to
whom the Doctor tells everything?

506
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,920
So what's his name?

507
00:30:56,592 --> 00:30:58,640
Now, which one of these men
would you really choose?

508
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:00,640
Look at them.

509
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:03,750
You ran away with a handsome hero.

510
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,040
Would you really give him up for a
bumbling country doctor who thinks

511
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,840
the only thing he needs to
be interesting is a ponytail?

512
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,971
Stop it!

513
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:16,560
But maybe it's better
than loving and losing the Doctor.

514
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:20,905
Pick a world
and this nightmare will all be over.

515
00:31:21,752 --> 00:31:24,360
They'll listen to you.
It's you they're waiting for.

516
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:25,692
Amy's men.

517
00:31:26,508 --> 00:31:27,480
Amy's choice.

518
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:50,880
Everybody, out, out out!

519
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:54,040
Into the church, that's right.
Don't answer the door.

520
00:32:01,783 --> 00:32:04,280
It's make your mind up time
in both worlds.

521
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,120
Bye. I need to find my friends.

522
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,120
Friends? Is that the right
word for the people you acquire?

523
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:13,280
Friends are people
you stay in touch with.

524
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:16,360
Your friends never see you again
once they've grown up.

525
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,640
The old man prefers the company
of the young, does he not?

526
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:01,325
How did I get up here?
I carried you.

527
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:03,760
I'm afraid you may
experience some bruising.

528
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,520
- Where's the Doctor?
- I don't know.

529
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:08,080
I want to do something for you.

530
00:33:27,622 --> 00:33:29,000
I was starting to like it.

531
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,560
It's all right, I had to
stop off at the butcher's.

532
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:39,040
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

533
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,800
I thought the freezing TARDIS
was real but now I'm not so sure.

534
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,546
- I think the baby's starting.
- Honestly?

535
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,478
Would I make it up
at a time like this?!

536
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:49,120
Well, you do have a history of...

537
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:50,960
being very lovely.

538
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:55,400
- Why are they so desperate to kill us?
- They're scared. It generates savagery.

539
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,926
Rory!

540
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,599
- No! I'm not ready.
- Stay.

541
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:21,920
Look after our baby.

542
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:31,350
No.

543
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:34,142
Come back.

544
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,197
Save him.

545
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,440
You save everyone. You always do.

546
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:45,423
It's what you do.

547
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:47,000
Not always.

548
00:34:51,238 --> 00:34:52,143
I'm sorry.

549
00:34:56,472 --> 00:34:59,800
Then what is the point of you?

550
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:20,120
This is the dream.
Definitely, this one.

551
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:22,880
Now, if we die here, we wake up?

552
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:29,160
Unless we just die.

553
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:32,536
Either way, this is my only
chance of seeing him again.

554
00:35:33,816 --> 00:35:36,100
- This is the dream.
- How do you know?

555
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:41,046
Because if this is real life,
I don't want it. I don't want it.

556
00:35:49,456 --> 00:35:52,274
- Why aren't they attacking?
- Either because this is just a dream,

557
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:54,760
or because they know
what we're about to do.

558
00:36:02,648 --> 00:36:04,594
Be very sure.
This could be the real world.

559
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:06,080
It can't be.

560
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:08,000
Rory isn't here.

561
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:14,000
I didn't know. I didn't, I didn't,
I honestly didn't, till right now.

562
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:17,942
I just want him.

563
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,240
I love Rory, and I never told him,
but now he's gone.

564
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,307
So... you chose this world.

565
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:57,425
Well done. You got it right.

566
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,779
And with only seconds left.

567
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:04,170
Fair's fair. Let's warm you up.

568
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,720
I hope you've enjoyed
your little fictions.

569
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:11,720
It all came out of your imagination,

570
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,360
so I'll leave you to ponder on that.

571
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,167
I have been defeated.

572
00:38:17,188 --> 00:38:18,323
I shall withdraw.

573
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,715
Farewell.

574
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:37,300
Something happened. I...

575
00:38:39,572 --> 00:38:40,720
What happened to me?

576
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:41,901
I...

577
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,160
Oh, right.

578
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:48,025
This is good.

579
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:50,120
I am liking this.

580
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:52,070
Was it something I said?

581
00:38:58,495 --> 00:39:00,640
Can you tell what it was
so I can use it in emergencies?

582
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,325
And maybe birthdays.

583
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,000
- What are we doing now?
- Me, I'm going to blow up the TARDIS.

584
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,920
What?

585
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,360
Notice how helpful
the Dream Lord was?

586
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,372
There was misinformation,
red herring,

587
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:19,548
malice, and I could have done
without the limerick.

588
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:22,480
But he was always very keen to make
us choose between dream and reality.

589
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,056
What are you doing?!

590
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:28,160
The Dream Lord conceded.
This isn't the dream!

591
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,040
- Yes, it is!
- Stop him.

592
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,560
Star burning cold. Do me a favour!

593
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:36,962
The Dream Lord
has no power over the real world.

594
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,760
He was offering us a choice between
two dreams.

595
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,840
- How do you know that?
- Because I know who he is.

596
00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:00,760
Any questions?

597
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:05,428
What's that?

598
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,800
A speck of psychic pollen from the
candle meadows of Karass don Slava.

599
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:12,160
Must have been
hanging around for ages.

600
00:40:13,022 --> 00:40:16,480
Fell in the time rotor, heated up and
induced a dream state for all of us.

601
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,640
So that was the Dream Lord then?

602
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,120
Those little specks.

603
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
No, no. No.

604
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,080
Sorry, wasn't it obvious?
The Dream Lord was me.

605
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,440
Psychic pollen,
it's a mind parasite.

606
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,360
It feeds on everything dark in you.

607
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,568
Gives it a voice,
turns it against you.

608
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,600
I'm 907. It had a lot to go on.

609
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,920
But why didn't it feed on us, too?

610
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,040
Darkness in you pair? It would've
starved to death in an instant.

611
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,200
I choose my friends with great care.

612
00:40:58,383 --> 00:40:59,236
Otherwise

613
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,883
I'm stuck with my own company,
and you know how that works out.

614
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:06,135
But those things he said about you.

615
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:09,120
You don't think any of that's true?

616
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:14,520
Amy, right now a question
is about to occur to Rory.

617
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,720
And seeing as the answer is about
to change his life,

618
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,920
I think you should give him
your full attention.

619
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,840
- Yeah. Actually, yeah.
- There it is.

620
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,937
Cos what I don't get is you blew up
the TARDIS, that stopped that dream,

621
00:41:28,057 --> 00:41:29,850
but what stopped
the Leadworth dream?

622
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:31,820
We crashed the camper van.

623
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:34,120
Oh, right,
I don't remember that bit.

624
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:36,360
No, you weren't there,
you were already...

625
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,560
Already what?

626
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:42,160
Dead. You died in that dream.
Mrs Poggit got you.

627
00:41:46,188 --> 00:41:49,240
But how did you know it was a dream?
Before you crashed the van,

628
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:51,633
how did you know
you wouldn't just die?

629
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:55,240
I didn't.

630
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:19,275
So...

631
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:23,043
Well, then, where now?

632
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:26,560
Or should I just pop down to
the swimming pool for a few lengths?

633
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:28,483
I don't know.

634
00:42:29,275 --> 00:42:32,400
Anywhere's good for me.
I'm happy anywhere.

635
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:35,520
It's up to Amy this time.

636
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:37,811
Amy's choice.

637
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,200
Ground feels strange.

638
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,680
The graves round here eat people.

639
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,040
You stopped the drill, right? Yes.

640
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,520
Why can I still hear drilling?

641
00:43:15,738 --> 00:43:16,960
Doctor, what was that?

642
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:18,926
Is it monsters coming?

643
00:43:19,046 --> 00:43:20,880
Under the circumstances
I'd suggest...

644
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:22,000
Run!

645
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,560
- Amy!
- Come on, I've got you!

646
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,600
Amy, no! No!

647
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,560
- Have you met monsters before?
- Yeah.

648
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,085
- Are you scared of them?
- No.

649
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,800
They're scared of me.
