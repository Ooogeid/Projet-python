The Eleventh Hour

8
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:10,983
Dear Santa, thank you for the dolls

9
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:13,255
and pencils and the fish.

10
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,635
It's Easter now,
so I hope I didn't wake you.

11
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,209
But honest, it is an emergency.

12
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,120
There's a crack in my wall.

13
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,029
Aunt Sharon says it's
just an ordinary crack, but...

14
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:34,855
I know it's not, because,
at night, there's voices.

15
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:39,037
So please, please,
could you send someone to fix it?

16
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:41,636
Or a policeman. Or...

17
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,126
Back in a moment.

18
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,433
Thank you, Santa.

19
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,052
Can I have an apple?

20
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,870
All I can think about apples.

21
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,648
I love apples.
Maybe I'm having a craving.

22
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,720
That's new,
never had cravings before.

23
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:38,600
Look at that!

24
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:40,560
Are you OK?

25
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:44,320
Just had a fall. All the way down
there, right to the library.

26
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,355
- Hell of a climb back up.
- You're soaking wet.

27
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:50,143
- I was in the swimming pool.
- You said you were in the library.

28
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:51,720
So was the swimming pool.

29
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,319
- Are you a policeman?
- Why?

30
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,058
Did you call a policeman?

31
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:59,120
Did you come
about the crack in my wall?

32
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:01,840
What cra...?

33
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,193
Are you all right, mister?

34
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:09,290
No, I'm fine, it's OK.

35
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:11,744
This is all perfectly norm...

36
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,740
Who are you?

37
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:23,600
I don't know yet. I'm still cooking.

38
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,840
Does it scare you?

39
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,097
No, it just looks a bit weird.

40
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:31,104
No, no, no. The crack in your wall.
Does it scare you?

41
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:31,979
Yes.

42
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,160
Well, then, no time to lose.

43
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,520
I'm the Doctor.
Do everything I tell you,

44
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,932
don't ask stupid questions
and don't wander off.

45
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:48,840
You all right?

46
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,770
Early days.

47
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,080
Steering's a bit off.

48
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,720
If you're a doctor,
why does your box say Police?

49
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,960
- That's disgusting. What is that?
- An apple.

50
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,800
- Apples are rubbish. I hate apples.
- You said you loved them.

51
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,840
No, no, I love yoghurt. Yoghurt's
my favourite. Give me yoghurt.

52
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:34,920
I hate yoghurt,
it's just stuff with bits in.

53
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,193
- You said it was your favourite.
- New mouth, new rules.

54
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:41,440
It's like eating after cleaning your
teeth, everything tastes wro-agh!

55
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,413
What is it? What's wrong with you?

56
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,433
Wrong with me? It's not my fault.

57
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:50,280
Why can't you give me decent food?
You're Scottish, fry something.

58
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:56,320
Ah! Bacon!

59
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,347
Bacon. That's bacon.

60
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:08,164
Are you trying to poison me?

61
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
You see, beans.

62
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:21,960
Beans are evil. Bad, bad beans.

63
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,342
Bread and butter.

64
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,400
Now you're talking.

65
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,217
And stay out!

66
00:07:37,546 --> 00:07:39,196
We've got some carrots.

67
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:43,520
Carrots? Are you insane?
No, wait, hang on.

68
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
I know what I need.
I need... I need... I need...

69
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,605
Fish fingers and custard.

70
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,000
- Funny.
- Am I?

71
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:10,230
Good. Funny's good.

72
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,018
- What's your name?
- Amelia Pond.

73
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:14,760
Ah, that's a brilliant name.

74
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:19,374
Amelia Pond,
like a name in a fairy tale.

75
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:21,509
Are we in Scotland, Amelia?

76
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:23,966
No. We had to move to England.

77
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,157
It's rubbish.

78
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,747
So what about your mum and dad,
then?

79
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,080
Are they upstairs?
Thought we'd have woken them by now.

80
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:34,599
I don't have a mum and dad.
Just an aunt.

81
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:40,079
- I don't even have an aunt.
- You're lucky.

82
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:41,959
I know.

83
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,948
So, your aunt.
Where is she?

84
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:49,513
She's out.

85
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:52,755
And she left you all alone?

86
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,292
- I'm not scared.
- You're not scared of anything!

87
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:59,412
Box falls out of the sky, man falls
out of box, man eats fish custard,

88
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,879
and look at you, just sitting there.

89
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,491
- So you know what I think?
- What?

90
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:12,560
Must be a hell of
a scary crack in your wall.

91
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:26,956
You've had some cowboys in here.

92
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:28,526
Not actual cowboys,

93
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:30,955
though that can happen.

94
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,759
I used to hate apples,
so my mum put faces on them.

95
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:46,920
She sounds good, your mum.
I'll keep it for later.

96
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,480
This wall is solid and the crack
doesn't go all the way through it.

97
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:56,812
So here's a thing,
where's the draught coming from?

98
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,280
Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.
You know what the crack is?

99
00:10:03,863 --> 00:10:04,683
What?

100
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:06,559
It's a crack.

101
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,187
I'll tell you something funny.
If you knocked this wall down,

102
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:16,520
the crack would stay put,
cos the crack isn't in the wall.

103
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,640
- Where is it, then?
- Everywhere.

104
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:24,073
In everything. It's a split
in the skin of the world.

105
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:28,124
Two parts of space and time
that should never have touched,

106
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:29,694
pressed together...

107
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:34,772
... right here in the wall
of your bedroom.

108
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:37,120
- Sometimes, can you hear...
- A voice?

109
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:38,803
Yes.

110
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,875
<i>Prisoner Zero has escaped.</i>

111
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,775
Prisoner Zero?
Prisoner Zero has escaped.

112
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,400
That's what I heard.
What does it mean?

113
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,862
<i>Prisoner zero has escaped.</i>

114
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:07,647
It means that, on the other side
of this wall, there's a prison

115
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,960
and they've lost a prisoner.
Do you know what that means?

116
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,960
- What?
- You need a better wall.

117
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:15,413
The only way to close the breach
is to open it all the way.

118
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,583
The forces will invert
and it'll snap itself shut.

119
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:21,960
- Or...
- What?

120
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:26,372
You know when grown-ups tell you
everything's going to be fine

121
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:29,120
and you think they're probably lying
to make you feel better?

122
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,039
Yes.

123
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:33,349
Everything's going to be fine.

124
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:54,760
<i>Prisoner Zero has escaped.</i>

125
00:11:58,742 --> 00:12:00,635
<i>Prisoner Zero has escaped.</i>

126
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:01,866
Hello?

127
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,887
Hello?

128
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:11,880
What's that?

129
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,280
There. You see, told you
it would close. Good as new.

130
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:25,994
What was that thing?

131
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:27,680
Was that Prisoner Zero?

132
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,540
No. I think
that was Prisoner Zero's guard.

133
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,760
Whatever it was, it sent me
a message. Psychic paper,

134
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,001
takes a lovely little message.

135
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,520
"Prisoner Zero has escaped."

136
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,380
But why tell us?

137
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,160
Unless...

138
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,683
Unless what?

139
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,040
Unless Prisoner Zero
escaped through here.

140
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,320
But he couldn't have.

141
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:54,126
We'd know.

142
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:02,778
It's difficult.
Brand-new me, nothing works yet.

143
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:05,198
But there's something I'm missing...

144
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:09,080
... in the corner...

145
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,526
... of my eye.

146
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,720
No, no, no, no, no, no!

147
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:28,260
I've got to get back in there.

148
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,130
The engines are phasing,
it's going to burn!

149
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:32,904
But...

150
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,375
... it's just a box! How can a box
have engines?

151
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,921
It's not a box. It's a time machine.

152
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,551
What, a real one?

153
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:46,640
You've got a real time machine?

154
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,850
Not for much longer
if I can't get her stabilised.

155
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,770
Five-minute hop into the future
should do it.

156
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:54,920
- Can I come?
- Not safe in here, not yet. 5 minutes.

157
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,680
Give me 5 minutes,
I'll be right back.

158
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,840
People always say that.

159
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,460
Am I people?

160
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,560
Do I even look like people?

161
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,385
Trust me. I'm the Doctor.

162
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,995
Geronimo!

163
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:23,175
Amelia!

164
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:28,051
Amelia, I worked out what
it was. I know what I was missing!

165
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,221
You've got to get out of there!

166
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,357
Amelia?

167
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:39,120
Amelia, are you all right?
Are you there?

168
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:41,880
Prisoner Zero is here.

169
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,993
Prisoner Zero is here! Prisoner Zero
is here! Do you understand me?

170
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:47,671
Prisoner Zero is...

171
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:15,669
They all called out at once,
that's what you're saying?

172
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:18,747
All of them, all the coma patients.

173
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,400
You do understand that these people are
all comatose, don't you?

174
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,818
- They can't speak.
- Yes, Dr Ramsden.

175
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:27,088
Then why are you wasting my time?

176
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,948
Because they called for you.

177
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:31,567
Me?

178
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,094
Doctor.

179
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:40,844
Doctor.

180
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,012
Doctor.

181
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,582
Doctor.

182
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,640
Doctor...
Doctor... Doctor...

183
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,513
White male, mid-20s,
breaking and entering.

184
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:07,483
Send me some back-up,
I've got him restrained.

185
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:11,880
You! Sit still.

186
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:17,000
Cricket bat.
I'm getting cricket bat.

187
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,880
You were breaking and entering.

188
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,520
Well, that's much better. Brand-new me,
whack on the head. Just what it needed.

189
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,158
Do you want to shut up now?

190
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:29,757
- I've got back-up on the way!
- Hang on, wait you're a policewoman.

191
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:31,899
And you're breaking.
You see how this works?

192
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,769
But what are you doing here?
Where's Amelia?

193
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,080
Amelia Pond?

194
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,915
Yeah. Little Scottish girl.
Where is she?

195
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,898
I promised her 5 minutes
but the engines were phasing.

196
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,760
I suppose I must have gone
a bit far.

197
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Has something happened to her?

198
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,519
Amelia Pond hasn't
lived here in a long time.

199
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:53,919
How long?

200
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,360
- Six months.
- No, no, no!

201
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,932
I can't be six months late!

202
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,202
I said five minutes.
I promised.

203
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:10,006
What happened to her?
What happened to Amelia Pond?

204
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:12,560
Sarge, it's me again. Hurry it up,

205
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:15,881
this guy knows something
about Amelia Pond.

206
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,065
I don't think they were conscious.

207
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:34,288
Dr Ramsden,
there is another sort of funny thing.

208
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:35,650
Yes, I know.

209
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,960
Dr Carver told me about
your conversation.

210
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:40,660
We've been very patient with you.

211
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,360
You're a good nurse, but my God!

212
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,458
I've seen them.

213
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:46,065
These patients are under
24-hour supervision!

214
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,600
There's no possibility
you'd have seen them

215
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,920
wandering in the village!
Why you giving me your phone?!

216
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:54,958
It's a camera too.

217
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:01,960
You need to take some time off.

218
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:03,934
A lot of time off.

219
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:05,200
Start now.

220
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,653
Now!

221
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,783
I need to speak to whoever lives
in this house now.

222
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:17,987
- I live here.
- But you're the police.

223
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:20,705
Yes, and this is where I live.
You got a problem with that?

224
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:23,840
How many rooms?

225
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:26,640
- I'm sorry, what?
- How many rooms on this floor?

226
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,400
- Count them for me now.
- Why?

227
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,884
Because it will change your life.

228
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,035
Five.

229
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Six.

230
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:38,406
Six?

231
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,089
- Look.
- Where?

232
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:42,433
Where you don't want to look.
Where you never want to look,

233
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:44,280
the corner of your eye. Look behind.

234
00:20:58,078 --> 00:20:59,414
That is not possible.

235
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:01,007
How's that possible?

236
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:04,723
There's a perception filter round the
door. Sensed it the last time was here.

237
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:06,080
Should've seen it.

238
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:10,240
That's a whole room. That's a whole room
I've never even noticed.

239
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,890
The filter stops you.
Something came a while ago to hide.

240
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,320
It's still hiding.
You need to uncuff me now!

241
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,772
I don't have the key. I lost it.

242
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,459
How can you have lost it?

243
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,120
Stay away from that door!

244
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:28,067
Do not touch that door!

245
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:30,880
Listen to me! Do not open that...

246
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,943
Why does no-one ever listen to me?
Do I have a face that nobody listens to?

247
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:38,157
Again...?

248
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,160
My screwdriver, where is it?

249
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,618
Silver thing, blue at the end.
Where did it go?

250
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,640
There's nothing here.

251
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,680
There stopped you seeing the room.
What makes you think you could see it?

252
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:52,649
Now. Please, just get out!

253
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:55,485
- Silver, blue at the end?
- My screwdriver, yeah.

254
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,400
It's here.

255
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,400
Must have rolled under the door.

256
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:02,083
Yeah.

257
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:03,313
Must have.

258
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,440
And then it must have jumped up
on the table...

259
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,720
Get out of there.

260
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,812
Get out of there!

261
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:25,539
Get out!

262
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,566
Get out of there!

263
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:42,181
What is it? What are you doing?

264
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:44,400
There's nothing here, but...

265
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:46,840
Corner of your eye.

266
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:50,763
What is it?

267
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:53,200
If it knows you've seen it,
it will kill you.

268
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,767
Don't look at it.

269
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,280
Do not...

270
00:22:58,014 --> 00:22:58,799
look.

271
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:00,720
Get out!

272
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:04,760
Give me that!

273
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:13,227
What's the bad alien done to you?

274
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,000
- Will that door hold it?
- Oh, yeah, course!

275
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,400
It's an inter-dimensional multi-form
from outer-space, they're all terrified

276
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,362
of wood.

277
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:26,320
What's that? What's it doing?

278
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,171
I don't know, getting dressed?

279
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,154
Run.
Your back-up's coming, I'll be fine.

280
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:34,542
There is no back-up.

281
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:37,484
I heard you on the radio,
ou called for back-up.

282
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:38,880
- It's a pretend radio.
- You're a policewoman.

283
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,331
I'm a kissogram!

284
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,071
- But it's just...
- No, it isn't.

285
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:56,046
Look at the faces.

286
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,670
What?

287
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm sorry, but what?

288
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,080
It's all on one.
One creature disguised as two.

289
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:11,758
Clever old multi-form.

290
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:14,920
A rush job, though.
Got the voice a bit muddled, did you?

291
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,202
Mind you, where did you get
the pattern from? You'd need a

292
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:22,480
psychic link, a live feed.
How did you fix that?

293
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,400
Stay, boy!

294
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:50,101
Her and me, we're safe.
Want to know why?

295
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,000
- She sent for back-up.
- I didn't send for back-up!

296
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:56,920
I know, that was a clever lie
to save our lives. OK, yeah, No back-up!

297
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,355
And that's why we're safe. Alone,
we're not a threat to you. If we had

298
00:25:00,475 --> 00:25:02,066
back-up, you'd have to kill us!

299
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:03,929
<i>'Attention, Prisoner Zero.</i>

300
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,133
<i>The human residence is surrounded.</i>

301
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,136
<i>Attention Prisoner Zero.</i>

302
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,280
What's that?

303
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,120
That would be back-up.

304
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,452
One more time. We do have back-up
and that's definitely why we're safe.

305
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:16,560
<i>Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence</i>

306
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,120
<i>or the human residence
will be incinerated.'</i>

307
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:21,135
Safe apart from, you know,

308
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,720
incineration.

309
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,456
<i>Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence</i>

310
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:28,280
<i>or the human residence
will be incinerated.</i>

311
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,233
<i>Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence</i>

312
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:34,080
<i>or the human residence
will be incinerated.</i>

313
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:40,267
Run.

314
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,731
- Kissogram?
- Yes a kissograme!

315
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,626
- Why'd you pretend to be a policewoman?
- You broke into my house!

316
00:25:54,746 --> 00:25:56,920
It was this or a French maid!
What's going on? Tell me!

317
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:00,588
Tell me!

318
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,834
An alien convict is hiding in your spare
room disguised as a man and a dog,

319
00:26:03,954 --> 00:26:06,880
and some other aliens are about
to incinerate your house. Any questions?

320
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,294
- Yes.
- Me too.

321
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:13,075
Don't do that, not now! It's still
rebuilding, not letting us in!

322
00:26:16,565 --> 00:26:17,440
Come on.

323
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,998
No, wait, hang on, wait.

324
00:26:20,977 --> 00:26:22,518
The shed.
I destroyed that shed

325
00:26:22,638 --> 00:26:24,563
last time I was here,
smashed it to pieces.

326
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,474
- There's a new one.
- But the new one's got old.

327
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:28,040
It's ten years old at least.

328
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:32,360
12 years. I'm not six months late,
I'm 12 years late.

329
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,240
- He's coming.
- You said six months.

330
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,090
- Why did you say 6 months?
- We've got to go.

331
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,968
This matters. This is important.

332
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:39,640
Why did you say six months?

333
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,636
Why did you say five minutes?

334
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,202
What?

335
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,200
Come on.

336
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,000
- What?
- Come on!

337
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,913
What?

338
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,408
- You're Amelia.
- You're late.

339
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,880
- Amelia Pond, you're the little girl.
- I'm Amelia

340
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,016
- you're late. 12 years.
- What happened?

341
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,313
- You hit me with a cricket bat.
- 12 years.

342
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,777
- A cricket bat.
- 12 years and four psychiatrists.

343
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:12,656
Four?

344
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:15,124
- I kept biting them.
- Why?

345
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:16,640
They said you weren't real.

346
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,281
No, come on.

347
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:24,699
What?

348
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:27,664
We're being staked out by
an ice-cream van?

349
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
What's that?
Why are you playing that?

350
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:34,877
It's supposed to be<i> Claire De Lune</i>.

351
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,856
Doctor, what's happening?

352
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,960
Hello!

353
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,108
Sorry to burst in, we're doing a special
on television faults in this area.

354
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,400
Also, crimes.

355
00:28:22,263 --> 00:28:23,376
Let's have a look.

356
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:26,640
- I was just about to phone.
- It's on every channel.

357
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:29,916
Hello, Amy, dear.

358
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,142
Are you a policewoman now?

359
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:33,800
Well, sometimes.

360
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,667
I thought you were a nurse.

361
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:36,880
I can be a nurse.

362
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:40,160
Or, actually, a nun.

363
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,119
I dabble.

364
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:44,517
Amy,

365
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,400
who is your friend?

366
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,960
Who's Amy? You were Amelia.

367
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:50,880
- Yeah, now I'm Amy.
- Amelia Pond,

368
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:52,880
that was a great name.

369
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:55,114
Bit fairy tale.

370
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,059
I know you,

371
00:28:57,314 --> 00:28:58,080
don't I?

372
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,000
I've seen you somewhere before.

373
00:29:01,357 --> 00:29:03,349
Not me. Brand-new face...

374
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:07,040
First time on.
And what sort of job's a kissogram?

375
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:10,040
I go to parties and I kiss people.

376
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:13,777
With outfits. It's a laugh.

377
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:15,805
You were a little
girl five minutes ago.

378
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:17,683
- You're worse than my aunt.
- I'm the Doctor,

379
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:19,534
I'm worse than everybody's aunt.

380
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,280
And that is not how
I'm introducing myself.

381
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:32,640
So it's everywhere,

382
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:34,200
in every language.

383
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,120
They're broadcasting
to the whole world.

384
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:43,680
What's up there,
what are you looking for?

385
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,113
Planet this size, two poles,

386
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:51,859
your basic molten core...

387
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:54,133
they're going to need
a 40% fission blast.

388
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,441
But they'll have to power up first,
won't they?

389
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,656
So assuming a medium-sized starship,

390
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:00,206
that's 20 minutes.

391
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,360
What do you think, 20 minutes?

392
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:05,584
20 minutes.

393
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:07,811
We've got 20 minutes.

394
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,440
20 minutes to what?

395
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,823
Are you the Doctor?

396
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:12,360
He is, isn't he?

397
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,015
He's the Doctor!

398
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:17,960
The Raggedy Doctor. All those cartoons
you did, when you were little.

399
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,567
The Raggedy Doctor, it's him.

400
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:24,692
Cartoons?

401
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:27,640
Gran, it's him, isn't it?

402
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:31,960
- It's really him!
- Jeff, shut up! 20 minutes to what?

403
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:38,824
The human residence. They're not talking
about your house, they're talking about

404
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:41,250
the planet.
Somewhere up there, there's a spaceship.

405
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,240
And it's going to incinerate
the planet.

406
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,584
20 minutes to the end of the world.

407
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,403
- What is this place? Where am I?
- Leadworth.

408
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:14,419
- Where's the rest of it?
- This is it.

409
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,977
- Is there an airport?
- No.

410
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:17,375
A nuclear power station?

411
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:18,676
Even a little one?

412
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:20,773
- Nearest city?
- Gloucester, half an hour by car.

413
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:22,428
Do we have a car?

414
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:25,686
Well, that's good! Fantastic,
that is 20 minutes to save the world

415
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:28,381
and I've got a post office.
And it's shut!

416
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:30,198
What is that?

417
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:32,026
It's a duck pond.

418
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,960
- Why aren't there any ducks?
- I don't know. There's never any ducks.

419
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,204
- Then how do you know it's a duck pond?
- It just is. Is it important,

420
00:31:43,324 --> 00:31:45,800
- the duck pond?
- I don't know. Why would I know?

421
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:50,400
This is too soon.

422
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:52,920
I'm not ready, I'm not done yet.

423
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,680
What's happening?
Why's it going dark?

424
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:10,640
- What's wrong with the sun?
- Nothing.

425
00:32:11,003 --> 00:32:12,796
You're looking at it
through a force-field.

426
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,613
They've sealed off
your upper atmosphere,

427
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,851
now they're getting
ready to boil the planet.

428
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:20,040
And here they come.

429
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:21,792
The human race.

430
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:24,760
The end comes,
as it was always going to, down

431
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,478
a video phone!

432
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:30,415
This isn't real, is it?
This is some kind of big wind-up.

433
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:32,853
- Why would I wind you up?
- You told me you had a time machine.

434
00:32:32,973 --> 00:32:34,920
- And you believed me.
- Then I grew up.

435
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,720
You never want to do that.
Hang on,

436
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,640
shut up, wait!
I missed it.

437
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,200
I saw it and I missed it.
What did I see?

438
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,708
I saw, what did I see?

439
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,725
20 minutes.

440
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:18,612
I can do it.

441
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:20,560
20 minutes, the planet burns.

442
00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:24,097
Run to your loved ones and say goodbye,
or stay and help me.

443
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,040
I'm sorry?

444
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:32,280
What are you doing?

445
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:37,457
Are you out of your mind?

446
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:38,746
- Who are you?
- You know.

447
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:40,143
No, really, who are you?

448
00:33:40,263 --> 00:33:42,680
- End of the world, 20 minutes.
- Better talk quickly, then!

449
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:46,640
- I am going to need my car back.
- Yes, in a bit. Now go and have coffee.

450
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:48,698
Right, yes.

451
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:53,203
Catch.

452
00:33:58,306 --> 00:33:59,489
I'm the Doctor.

453
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:01,251
I'm a time traveller.

454
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:04,130
Everything I told you
12 years ago is true.

455
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:06,743
I'm real.
What's happening in the sky is real,

456
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:10,863
and if you don't let me go now,
everything you've ever known is over.

457
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:14,405
I don't believe you.

458
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:15,584
Just...

459
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:16,821
20 minutes.

460
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:19,672
Just believe me for 20 minutes.

461
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:22,351
Look at it.

462
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:26,320
Fresh as the day you gave it to me.
And you know it's the same one.

463
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:46,678
Amy.

464
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:49,847
Believe for 20 minutes.

465
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,120
- What do we do?
- Stop that nurse!

466
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,500
The sun's going out, and you're
photographing a man and a dog. Why?

467
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:15,920
- Amy?
- Hi!

468
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:19,504
- This is Rory, he's a... friend.
- Boyfriend.

469
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:21,676
- Kind of boyfriend.
- Man and dog, why?

470
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:28,560
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Just answer his question, please.

471
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,810
It's him, though.
The Raggedy Doctor.

472
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:32,028
He came back.

473
00:35:32,153 --> 00:35:34,640
- But he was a story. He was a game.
- Man and dog. Why?

474
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,997
- Tell me now.
- Sorry. Because he can't be there.

475
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:40,800
- He's in a hospital, in a coma.
- He's in a hospital, in a coma.

476
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:46,240
Knew it. Multi-form, you see?

477
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:50,026
Disguise itself as anything,
but it needs a life feed, a psychic link

478
00:35:50,146 --> 00:35:52,080
with a living but dormant mind.

479
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,040
Prisoner Zero.

480
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,560
- What, there's a Prisoner Zero too?
- Yes.

481
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:21,080
That ship up there is scanning this area
for non-terrestrial technology.

482
00:36:21,403 --> 00:36:22,453
And nothing

483
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,413
says non-terrestrial
like a sonic screwdriver.

484
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:45,247
Oi, come back here! Come back!

485
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:53,720
I think someone's going to notice!
Don't you?

486
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:07,400
No, no, no, don't do that!

487
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,680
- Look, it's going.
- No, come back, he's here!

488
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:16,640
Come back! He's here,
Prisoner Zero is here.

489
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:18,203
Come back,

490
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:21,236
he's here! Prisoner Zero is...

491
00:37:22,002 --> 00:37:22,877
Doctor!

492
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:26,082
The drain. It just sort of melted
and went down the drain.

493
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,509
- Well, of course it did.
- What do we do now?

494
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:31,853
It's hiding in human form.
We need to drive it into the open.

495
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:35,848
No TARDIS, no screwdriver, 17 minutes.
Come on.

496
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:38,000
Think. Think.

497
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:39,797
Barney?

498
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:41,466
Barney?

499
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:44,900
Barney? Can you hear me, Barney?

500
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:48,061
Barney?

501
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:49,942
Barney?

502
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,013
That thing, that hid
in my house for 12 years?

503
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:05,654
Multi-forms can live for millennia.
12 years is a pit-stop.

504
00:38:05,774 --> 00:38:08,618
How come you show up
on the same day that lot do?

505
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:11,401
They're looking for him, but followed
me. They saw me through the crack,

506
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:14,186
got a fix. They're only late cos I am.
Give me your phone.

507
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:17,117
- How can he be real? He was never real.
- Phone, now, give me!

508
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:20,040
He was just a game, we were kids.
You made me dress up as him.

509
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,299
These photos,
they're all the coma patients?

510
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:25,583
No, they're all the multi-form.
8 comas, 8 disguises for Prisoner Zero.

511
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,400
He had a dog.
There's a dog in a coma?

512
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,240
The coma patient dreams he's walking a
dog, Prisoner Zero gets a dog. Laptop!

513
00:38:31,814 --> 00:38:34,548
Your friend, what was his name?
Not him, the good-looking one.

514
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:36,040
- Jeff.
- Thanks.

515
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,530
He had a laptop in his bag, a laptop.
Big bag, big laptop.

516
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,400
I need Jeff's laptop. You two,
get to the hospital, get everyone out,

517
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,880
clear the whole floor.
Phone me when you're done.

518
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,300
Your car, come on.

519
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:52,805
But how can he be here?
How can the Doctor be here?

520
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:07,240
Hello, laptop, give me!

521
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,900
- No, no, no, no, wait, hang on!
- It's fine, give it here.

522
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:16,320
Blimey! Get a girlfriend, Jeff.

523
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:19,195
- Gran.
- What are you doing?

524
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,120
The sun's gone wibbly, out there,

525
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,600
there's going to be a big
video conference call.

526
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,040
All the experts in the world panicking
at once, and do you know what they need?

527
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,760
Me. And here they all are.

528
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,799
All the big boys. NASA,

529
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:35,960
Jodrell Bank, Tokyo Space Centre,
Patrick Moore

530
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,119
- I like Patrick Moore.
- I'll get you his number,

531
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,870
- but watch him, he's a devil.
- You can't just hack in on a call.

532
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,840
- Can't I?
- <i>Who are you?</i>

533
00:39:43,745 --> 00:39:45,639
<i>This is a secure call,
what are you doing?</i>

534
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:48,360
I know, you should switch me off.
But before you do, watch this.

535
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,280
- <i>It's here too, I'm getting it.</i>
- Fermat's Theorem, the proof,

536
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,783
and I mean the real one,
never seen before.

537
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:56,680
Poor old Fermat, got killed in a duel
before he could write it down.

538
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,840
My fault, I slept in.

539
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,917
And here's an oldie but a goodie

540
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:03,783
why electrons have mass.
And a personal favourite of mine,

541
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:07,640
faster-than-light travel
with two diagrams and a joke.

542
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,654
Look at your screens. Whoever I am,
I'm a genius. Look at the sun.

543
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:16,108
You need all the help you can get.
Fellas, pay attention.

544
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:35,687
- <i>Sir, what are you doing?</i>
- I'm writing a computer virus.

545
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:38,772
Very clever, super-fast,
and a tiny bit alive, but don't let on.

546
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:41,520
Why am I writing it on a phone?
Never mind, you'll find out.

547
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,360
OK, I'm sending this
to all your computers.

548
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,920
Get everyone who works for you
sending this everywhere.

549
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,560
Email, text, Facebook, Bebo,
Twitter, radar dish,

550
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,480
Whatever you've got. Any questions?

551
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,280
- <i>Who was your lady friend?</i>
- Patrick, behave!

552
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,433
- <i>What does this virus do?</i>
- It's a reset command, that's all.

553
00:40:57,553 --> 00:41:00,283
It resets counters, it gets in the WiFi
and resets every counter.

554
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:04,256
Clocks, calendars, anything with a chip
will default at 0 at the same time.

555
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:07,443
But, yeah, I could be lying,
why should you trust me?

556
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,820
I'll let my best man explain.

557
00:41:14,303 --> 00:41:17,120
Jeff, you're my best man.

558
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,200
You what?

559
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:23,298
Listen to me. In ten minutes,
you're going to be a legend.

560
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:26,252
Everyone on that screen is going
to be offering you any job you want.

561
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:28,918
But first, you have
to be magnificent.

562
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,343
You have to make them trust you
and get them working.

563
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:34,560
This is it, Jeff.
Right here, right now.

564
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,150
This is when you fly.

565
00:41:37,804 --> 00:41:39,627
Today's the day you save the world.

566
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,423
- Why me?
- It's your bedroom.

567
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:47,280
Now go, go, go.

568
00:41:53,502 --> 00:41:54,502
OK, guys,

569
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:56,305
let's do this.

570
00:41:59,403 --> 00:42:01,553
And delete your internet history.

571
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:16,758
Something's happened up there,
we can't get through.

572
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:19,297
Yes, but what's happened?

573
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:21,877
I don't know. No-one knows.

574
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,692
- Phone him.
- I'm phoning him.

575
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:27,153
Doctor? We're at the hospital,
but we can't get through.

576
00:42:28,649 --> 00:42:30,938
- What did he say?
- Look in the mirror.

577
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:35,440
Uniform!

578
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:38,707
Are you on your way?

579
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,480
You're gonna need a car.

580
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:43,240
Don't worry.
I've commandeered a vehicle.

581
00:42:58,797 --> 00:42:59,600
Officer.

582
00:42:59,934 --> 00:43:02,480
- What happened?
- There was a man. A man with a dog.

583
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,920
I think Dr Ramsden's dead
and the nurses.

584
00:43:10,202 --> 00:43:11,680
- Are you in?
- <i>Yep.</i>

585
00:43:11,998 --> 00:43:14,520
- But so's Prisoner Zero.
- You need to get out of there.

586
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:17,400
<i>He was so angry. He kept shouting.
And that dog,</i>

587
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,960
<i>the size of that dog,
I swear it was rabid.</i>

588
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,720
And he just went mad,
attacking everyone.

589
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,750
Where did he go, did you see?
Has he gone? We hid in the ladies.

590
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:30,960
Oh, I'm getting it wrong again,
aren't I? I'm always doing that.

591
00:43:31,396 --> 00:43:32,792
So many mouths.

592
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,920
Oh, my God!

593
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,960
Amy? Amy, what's happening?

594
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,000
Amy, talk to me!

595
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,474
We're in the coma ward.
But it's here, it's getting in.

596
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:02,360
- Which window are you?
- What, sorry?

597
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,170
- Which window?
- First floor on the left,

598
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:06,921
fourth from the end.

599
00:44:12,803 --> 00:44:15,040
Oh, dear. Little Amelia Pond.

600
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:18,058
I've watched you grow up.

601
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:23,160
12 years, and you never even
knew I was there.

602
00:44:24,185 --> 00:44:26,475
Little Amelia Pond,

603
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:29,881
waiting for her magic Doctor
to return

604
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:32,875
but not this time, Amelia.

605
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:52,240
Right! Hello! Am I late? No,

606
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:54,656
three minutes to go.
There's still time.

607
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,960
Time for what, Time Lord?

608
00:45:00,636 --> 00:45:03,284
Take the disguise off.
They'll find you in a heartbeat.

609
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:06,504
- Nobody dies.
- The Atraxi will kill me this time.

610
00:45:07,424 --> 00:45:08,932
If I am to die,

611
00:45:09,518 --> 00:45:11,200
let there be fire.

612
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,110
OK. You came to this world by
opening a crack in space and time.

613
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,344
Do it again.

614
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:17,935
Just leave.

615
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:21,250
- I did not open the crack.
- Somebody did.

616
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,104
The cracks in the skin
of the universe

617
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,524
don't you know where they came from?

618
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:30,403
You don't, do you?

619
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:33,556
The Doctor
in the TARDIS doesn't know.

620
00:45:33,903 --> 00:45:36,985
Doesn't know, doesn't know!

621
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,268
The universe is cracked.

622
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:41,560
The Pandorica will open.

623
00:45:41,885 --> 00:45:44,020
Silence will fall.

624
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:50,777
And we're off!

625
00:45:52,304 --> 00:45:53,360
Look at that.

626
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:57,240
Look

627
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
at that!

628
00:46:02,214 --> 00:46:05,599
I know, just a clock, whatever. But
do you know what's happening right now?

629
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:09,560
In one little bedroom,
my team are working.

630
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:12,711
Jeff and the world. And do you
know what they're doing?

631
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:16,381
They're spreading the word
all over the world, quantum fast.

632
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,140
The word is out.

633
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,670
And do you know what the word is?

634
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,000
The word is zero.

635
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,640
Now, me, if I was up
in the sky in a battleship,

636
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,000
monitoring all Earth communications,
I'd take that as a hint.

637
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,580
And if I had a whole battle fleet
surrounding the planet,

638
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,493
I'd be able track a simple old

639
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:44,994
computer virus to its source in,

640
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:46,952
what, under a minute?

641
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:49,143
The source, by the way,

642
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:51,105
is right here.

643
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,414
And I think they just found us!

644
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,960
The Atraxi are limited.

645
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:08,640
While I'm in this form, they'll
still be unable to detect me.

646
00:47:09,104 --> 00:47:12,320
They've tracked a phone, not me.

647
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:16,366
But this is the good bit.
I mean, this is my favourite bit.

648
00:47:16,798 --> 00:47:17,960
Do you know

649
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,200
what this phone is full of?

650
00:47:21,904 --> 00:47:23,148
Pictures of you.

651
00:47:23,268 --> 00:47:25,664
Every form you've learned to take,
right here.

652
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:29,517
And being uploaded about now.

653
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,320
And the final score is no TARDIS,
no screwdriver two minutes to spare.

654
00:47:34,337 --> 00:47:35,387
Who da man?

655
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,960
I'm never saying that again! Fine.

656
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:44,735
Then I shall take a new form.

657
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:46,640
Stop it, you know you can't.

658
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,760
Takes months to form that
kind of psychic link.

659
00:47:50,202 --> 00:47:51,652
And I've had years.

660
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,070
No!

661
00:47:58,438 --> 00:47:59,301
Amy?

662
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,280
You've got to hold on. Amy!

663
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:06,000
Don't sleep!

664
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:08,680
- You've got to stay awake, please.
- Doctor?

665
00:48:16,055 --> 00:48:17,800
That's rubbish.
Who's that supposed to be?

666
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:19,687
- It's you.
- Me?

667
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:21,820
Is that what I look like?

668
00:48:22,148 --> 00:48:23,637
- You don't know?
- Busy day.

669
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,734
Why me, though?
You're linked with her.

670
00:48:25,854 --> 00:48:27,234
Why are you copying me?

671
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:28,409
I'm not.

672
00:48:32,569 --> 00:48:33,952
Poor Amy Pond.

673
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,014
Still such a child inside.

674
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,057
Dreaming of the magic Doctor
she knows will return to save her.

675
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:45,518
What a disappointment you've been.

676
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,560
No, she's dreaming about me
cos she can hear me.

677
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:55,680
Amy, don't just hear me, listen.

678
00:48:56,149 --> 00:48:58,280
Remember the room in your house
you couldn't see?

679
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:01,240
Remember you went inside.
I tried to stop, but you did.

680
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,560
You went in the room.

681
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,806
You went inside.

682
00:49:16,395 --> 00:49:18,023
Dream about what you saw.

683
00:49:44,407 --> 00:49:45,907
Well done, Prisoner Zero.

684
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:50,161
A perfect impersonation of yourself.

685
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,280
<i>Prisoner Zero is located.</i>

686
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:58,320
<i>Prisoner Zero is restrained.</i>

687
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,867
Silence, Doctor.

688
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,126
Silence will fall.

689
00:50:22,993 --> 00:50:25,160
The sun, it's back to normal, right?

690
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:27,160
That's good, yeah?

691
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:28,817
That means it's over.

692
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,366
- You OK? Are you with us?
- What happened?

693
00:50:35,486 --> 00:50:37,840
- He did it. The Doctor did it.
- No, I didn't.

694
00:50:38,694 --> 00:50:40,720
- What you doing?
- Tracking the signal back.

695
00:50:40,979 --> 00:50:42,360
Sorry, in advance.

696
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,320
For what?

697
00:50:44,026 --> 00:50:44,840
The bill.

698
00:50:45,116 --> 00:50:47,366
I didn't say you could go!

699
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:51,600
Article 57 of the Shadow Proclamation.
This is a

700
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,843
fully established, level 5 planet,

701
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,292
and you were going to burn it?
What?

702
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:00,261
Did you think no-one was watching?

703
00:51:00,952 --> 00:51:02,800
You lot, back here. Now!

704
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,948
Now I've done it.

705
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:09,753
Did he just bring them back?

706
00:51:10,257 --> 00:51:12,378
Did he just save the world
from aliens

707
00:51:12,498 --> 00:51:14,520
and then bring all the aliens
back again?

708
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:18,601
- Where are you going?
- The roof.

709
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,945
No, hang on.

710
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,144
- What's in here?
- I'm saving the world.

711
00:51:30,264 --> 00:51:32,084
I need a decent shirt.

712
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,346
To hell with the raggedy.

713
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,680
Time to put on a show!

714
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,880
You just summoned aliens back
to earth.

715
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:43,720
Actual aliens, deadly aliens,

716
00:51:44,814 --> 00:51:46,337
aliens of death,

717
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,640
and now you're taking
your clothes off...

718
00:51:49,076 --> 00:51:52,560
- Amy, he's taking his clothes off.
- Turn your back if it embarrasses you.

719
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,193
Are you stealing clothes now?

720
00:51:56,388 --> 00:51:58,960
Those clothes belong to people,
you know.

721
00:52:03,282 --> 00:52:05,120
Are you not you going
to turn your back?

722
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:08,356
Nope.

723
00:52:14,286 --> 00:52:17,181
So this was a good idea,
was it? They were leaving.

724
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,087
Leaving is good.
Never coming back is better.

725
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:23,520
Come on, then!

726
00:52:24,962 --> 00:52:27,360
The Doctor will see you now.

727
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:40,600
<i>You</i>

728
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,280
<i>are not of this world.</i>

729
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:45,255
No,
but I've put a lot of work into it.

730
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,630
I don't know.

731
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,427
What do you think?

732
00:52:50,649 --> 00:52:52,407
<i>Is this world important?</i>

733
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:53,556
Important?

734
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,759
What's that mean, important?

735
00:52:55,879 --> 00:52:58,200
6 billion people live here,
is that important?

736
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,560
Here's a better question.
Is this world a threat to the Atraxi?

737
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:04,920
You're monitoring the whole planet.

738
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:07,208
Is this world a threat?

739
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,080
Are the peoples
of this world guilty of any crime

740
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,525
by the laws of the Atraxi?

741
00:53:26,438 --> 00:53:28,196
One more. Just one.

742
00:53:29,591 --> 00:53:31,407
Is this world protected?

743
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,440
'cause you're not the first lot to
come here. Oh, there have been so many!

744
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,000
And what you've got to ask is...

745
00:53:44,538 --> 00:53:46,000
... what happened to them?

746
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,224
Hello.

747
00:53:58,857 --> 00:53:59,865
I'm the Doctor.

748
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:06,506
Basically...

749
00:54:09,283 --> 00:54:10,174
... run!

750
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,257
Is that it?

751
00:54:41,937 --> 00:54:43,390
Is that them gone for good?

752
00:54:44,206 --> 00:54:45,237
Who were they?

753
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:09,799
What have you got for me this time?

754
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:19,094
Look at you!

755
00:55:23,231 --> 00:55:24,825
Oh, you sexy thing!

756
00:55:26,395 --> 00:55:27,579
Look at you!

757
00:56:29,254 --> 00:56:30,836
Sorry about running off earlier.

758
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:33,836
Brand-new TARDIS, bit exciting.

759
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,040
Just had a quick hop to the moon
and back to run her in.

760
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,871
She's ready for the big stuff now.

761
00:56:41,887 --> 00:56:42,680
It's you.

762
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:45,086
You came back.

763
00:56:45,332 --> 00:56:47,125
Course I came back.
I always come back.

764
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:49,902
Something wrong with that?
And you kept the clothes.

765
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,691
Well, I just saved the world,

766
00:56:52,997 --> 00:56:56,000
the whole planet, for about the million
time, no charge. Yes, shoot me!

767
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,360
I kept the clothes.

768
00:56:57,649 --> 00:56:58,960
Including the bow tie.

769
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,560
It's cool. Bow ties are cool.

770
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,160
Are you from another planet?

771
00:57:04,193 --> 00:57:05,505
- What do you think?
- Of what?

772
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,509
Other planets.
Want to check some out?

773
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:09,600
- What does that mean?
- It means...

774
00:57:10,204 --> 00:57:11,212
it means...

775
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:12,680
come with me.

776
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:14,338
Where?

777
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:16,084
Wherever you like.

778
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:22,120
All that stuff, the hospital,
the spaceships, Prisoner Zero...

779
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,299
That's just the beginning.
There's loads more.

780
00:57:24,419 --> 00:57:25,600
But those things those,

781
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:27,960
amazing things, all that stuff...

782
00:57:32,497 --> 00:57:34,443
That was two years ago!

783
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:38,480
- So that's...
- 14 years!

784
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,220
14 years since fish custard.

785
00:57:40,536 --> 00:57:43,208
Amy Pond, the girl who waited,
you've waited long enough.

786
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,022
When I was a kid,
you said there was a swimming pool

787
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:50,636
and a library, and the swimming
pool was in the library.

788
00:57:50,756 --> 00:57:53,320
Not sure where it's got to now.
It'll turn up. Coming?

789
00:57:55,124 --> 00:57:57,714
- You wanted to come 14 years ago.
- I grew up.

790
00:57:58,487 --> 00:57:59,460
Don't worry.

791
00:57:59,929 --> 00:58:01,136
I'll soon fix that.

792
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:44,057
Anything you want to say?
Any passing remarks?

793
00:58:44,713 --> 00:58:45,967
I've heard them all.

794
00:58:55,862 --> 00:58:57,160
I'm in my nightie.

795
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,421
Don't worry.

796
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:00,683
Plenty of clothes in the wardrobe.
And

797
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,640
possibly a swimming pool.

798
00:59:05,136 --> 00:59:07,843
All of time and space,
everything that ever happened

799
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:09,284
or ever will...

800
00:59:10,163 --> 00:59:11,640
Where do you want to start?

801
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,274
You are so sure that I'm coming.

802
00:59:16,394 --> 00:59:18,196
- Yeah, I am.
- Why?

803
00:59:18,524 --> 00:59:20,832
'cause you're the Scottish girl
in the English village,

804
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:23,360
- and I know how that feels.
- Do you?

805
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,731
All these years living here,
most of your life...

806
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,360
you've still got that accent.
Yes, you're coming.

807
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,720
- Can you get me back for tomorrow?
- It's a time machine.

808
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,080
I can get you back five minutes ago.
Why, what's tomorrow?

809
00:59:36,456 --> 00:59:38,917
Nothing.
Nothing. Just you know, stuff.

810
00:59:42,061 --> 00:59:45,002
All right, then.
Back in time for stuff.

811
00:59:48,705 --> 00:59:49,877
A new one!

812
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:51,506
Lovely.

813
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:54,975
Thanks dear.

814
01:00:12,629 --> 01:00:13,953
- Why me?
- Why not?

815
01:00:14,073 --> 01:00:16,426
No, seriously?
You are asking me to run away

816
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,569
with you in the middle of the night.
It's a fair question. Why me?

817
01:00:19,689 --> 01:00:21,480
I don't know. Fun.
Do I have to have a reason?

818
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,960
- People always have a reason.
- Do I look like people?

819
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,640
Been knocking around on
my own for a while, my choice,

820
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,440
but I've started talking to myself.
It's giving me earache.

821
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,080
You're lonely. That's it?

822
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:32,412
Just that?

823
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:33,901
Just that.

824
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:35,799
Promise.

825
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:46,642
So, are you OK, then?

826
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:49,840
'cause this place, sometimes it
can make people feel a bit...

827
01:00:50,557 --> 01:00:52,490
- you know?
- I'm fine. It's just...

828
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,170
There's a whole world in here,
just like you said. It's all true.

829
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,311
I thought, I started to think
that maybe you were just like

830
01:00:59,431 --> 01:01:00,760
a madman with a box.

831
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,521
There's something you'd better
understand aboute me. It's important,

832
01:01:03,641 --> 01:01:05,040
your life may depend on it.

833
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,040
I am definitely a madman with a box.

834
01:01:13,827 --> 01:01:15,240
Goodbye, Leadworth.

835
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,296
Hello, everything!

836
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:08,593
<i>My name's Amy Pond.</i>

837
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:11,570
<i>When I was seven,
I had an imaginary friend.</i>

838
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,277
<i>Last night was
the night before my wedding</i>

839
01:02:14,535 --> 01:02:16,520
<i>and my imaginary friend came back.</i>

840
01:02:17,183 --> 01:02:18,960
All of time and space,

841
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,120
everything that ever happened,
or ever will...

842
01:02:22,222 --> 01:02:23,880
Where do you want to start?

843
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,592
Anywhere you want,
any time you want.

844
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,077
One condition...
it has to be amazing.

845
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:35,253
Now it starts.

846
01:02:36,777 --> 01:02:38,760
You might want to find something

847
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,257
to hang on to.

848
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,835
<i>It begins.</i>

849
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,800
Tell me the whole plan.

850
01:03:16,615 --> 01:03:17,840
One day, that'll work.

851
01:03:18,516 --> 01:03:20,532
One simple instruction,

852
01:03:20,652 --> 01:03:22,846
don't follow me
under any circumstances.

853
01:03:23,608 --> 01:03:24,850
Will you follow him?

854
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:26,444
Of course.

855
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,160
'cause this is what I do

856
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,280
every time, every day, every second.

857
01:03:31,295 --> 01:03:32,080
This...

858
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,730
<i>Hold tight.</i>

859
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,480
Because it will change your life.

860
01:03:35,994 --> 01:03:38,600
There's one thing you never
put in a trap if you're smart,

861
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,160
if you value your continued existence,
if you have any plans about

862
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,440
seeing tomorrow, there's one thing
you never, ever put in trouble...

863
01:03:54,141 --> 01:03:54,938
... me!
