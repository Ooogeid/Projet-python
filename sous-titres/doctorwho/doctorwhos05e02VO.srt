<i>Well done, Mabel.</i>

00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,201
<i>Well done, Alfie.</i>

3
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,772
<i>Good girl, Tabitha.</i>

4
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:31,796
<i>Very well done, Ranjit.</i>

5
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:34,919
<i>Good girl, Chloe.</i>

<i>Well done, Ben.</i>

00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,154
<i>Well done, Mandy.</i>

8
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,719
<i>Bad boy, Timmy.</i>

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,773
<i>Zero.</i>

10
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:02,400
- You got a zero, didn't you?
- Yeah. So?

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,557
- You'll have to walk home, then.
- Walk to London? That's 20 decks!

12
00:01:06,677 --> 00:01:09,761
You can't ride a Vator with a zero.
You know what happens.

13
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:11,600
You'll get sent below.

14
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:18,240
I'll wait for you.

The Beast Below

33
00:02:56,685 --> 00:02:58,185
<i>My name is Amy Pond.</i>

34
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:04,853
<i>When I was seven,
I had an imaginary friend.</i>

35
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:07,280
<i>Last night was the night before
my wedding... </i>

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
Come on, Pond.

37
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:10,760
<i>... and my imaginary
friend came back.</i>

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,562
- Now do you believe me
- OK,

39
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:16,727
your box is a spaceship.

40
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:19,759
It's really, really a spaceship.

41
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,861
We are in space!

42
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:28,133
- What are we breathing?
- I've extended the air shell we're fine.

43
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,812
Now, that's interesting.

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,417
29th Century.
Solar flares roast the earth,

45
00:03:35,537 --> 00:03:38,657
and the entire human race
packs its bags

46
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,009
and moves out
till the weather improves.

47
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,381
- Whole nations migrating to the stars.
- Doctor?

48
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,484
- Doctor?
- Isn't that amazing?

49
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:47,546
Doctor!

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,120
Come on.

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
I've found us a spaceship.

52
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:01,787
This is the United Kingdom of
Britain and Northern Ireland -

53
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,353
all of it, bolted together
and floating in the sky.

54
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,057
Starship UK. It's Britain,

55
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:08,903
but metal.

56
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,463
That's not just a ship,
that's an idea.

57
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,600
That's a whole country,

58
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:17,373
living and laughing and...

59
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,016
shopping.

60
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:22,968
Searching the stars for a new home.

61
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,435
- Can we go out and see?
- Of course but first, there's a thing.

62
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:30,915
- A thing?
- An important thing. In fact, thing one

63
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,915
we are observers only. That's the one
rule I've always stuck to in my travels.

64
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,600
I never get involved in the affairs
of other peoples or planets.

65
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,737
- That's interesting.
- So we're like a wildlife documentary,

66
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:45,256
yeah? Cos if they see a wounded cub or
something, they can't just save it

67
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:48,008
they've got to keep filming
and let it die.

68
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:51,520
That's got to be hard.

69
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:54,200
I don't think I could do that.

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,440
Don't you find that hard being all,
like, detached and cold?

71
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,037
Doctor?

72
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:12,480
<i>Welcome to London Market.</i>

73
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,915
<i>You are being monitored. </i>

74
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm in the future.

75
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:20,032
Like hundreds... of years
in the future.

76
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:24,737
- I've been dead for centuries.
- Oh, lovely.

77
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:26,880
You're a cheery one.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,104
Never mind dead, look at this place.
Isn't it wrong?

79
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:30,102
What's wrong?

80
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:33,160
Use your eyes, notice everything.
What's wrong with this picture?

81
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,391
Is it... the bicycles?

82
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:38,080
- Bit unusual on a spaceship, bicycles.
- Says the girl in the nightie.

83
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Oh, my God! I'm in my nightie.

84
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:43,440
Now, come on, look around you.
Actually look.

85
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:46,939
<i>London Market is a crime-free zone.</i>

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,684
Life on a giant starship,
back to basics.

87
00:05:49,804 --> 00:05:51,880
Bicycles, washing lines,
wind-up street lamps.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,912
But look closer. Secrets and
shadows, lives led in fear.

89
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:58,840
Society bent out of shape, on the
brink of collapse. A police state.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,479
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

91
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:09,908
Sorry.

92
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:13,119
Checking all the water in this area.

93
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:15,389
There's an escaped fish.

94
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,624
- Where was I?
- Why did you just do that?

95
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,250
I think a lot.
It's hard to keep track.

96
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,807
- Now, police state, do you see it yet?
- Where?

97
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:24,362
There.

98
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,162
Are you sure?

99
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,270
Saw it myself.

100
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,592
<i>Are you going to tell her?</i>

101
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,960
We're under orders to tell her.

102
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,554
<i>Well done. Keep tabs on him.</i>

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,092
<i>Sorry to interrupt.
There's been a sighting.</i>

104
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,549
<i>London block, Oxford Street.</i>

105
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:16,185
<i>A man.</i>

106
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:17,931
Did he do the thing?

107
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:19,308
<i>Apparently.</i>

108
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:21,546
I'll have a look on the monitors.

109
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,880
One little girl crying. So?

110
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:43,952
Crying silently.

111
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,913
I mean, children cry
cos they want attention, cos

112
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,840
they're hurt or afraid. When they cry
silently, it's cos they just can't stop.

113
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:53,560
- Any parent knows that.
- Are you a parent?

114
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:58,440
Hundreds of parents walking past and not
one of them's asking her what's wrong,

115
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,160
which means...

116
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,762
they already know, and it's something
they don't talk about Secrets.

117
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:06,555
They're not helping her, it's something
they're afraid of shadows.

118
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:09,097
Whatever they're
afraid of it's nowhere to be seen,

119
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:11,360
which means it's everywhere.

120
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,670
Police state.

121
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:17,280
- Where'd she go?
- Deck 207,

122
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,480
Apple Sesame block, Dwelling 54A.
You're looking for Mandy Tanner.

123
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:24,240
This fell out of her pocket
when I accidentally bumped into her.

124
00:08:24,442 --> 00:08:25,524
Took me four goes.

125
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:27,600
Ask her about those things.

126
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,904
The smiling fellows in the booths.
They're everywhere.

127
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,696
But they're just things.

128
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,967
They're clean.

129
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,639
Everything else here is battered and
filthy. Look at this place.

130
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,616
No-one's laid a finger on those booths.
Not a footprint within two feet of them.

131
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:44,360
Ask Mandy, "Why are people scared
of the things in the booths?"

132
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,830
Hang on, what do I do?

133
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,240
I don't know what I'm doing here
and I'm not even dressed!

134
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,520
It's this or Leadworth.
What do you think?

135
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,505
Let's see.

136
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,828
What will Amy Pond choose?

137
00:08:58,165 --> 00:08:58,948
Gotcha!

138
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,461
- Meet me back here in half an hour.
- What are you going to do?

139
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,960
What I always do.

140
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,344
Stay out of trouble.

141
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,520
Badly.

142
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:13,255
So is this how it works, Doctor?

143
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:16,627
You never interfere in the affairs
of other peoples or planets,

144
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,600
unless there's children crying?

145
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,467
Yes.

146
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:42,704
You're following me.

147
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,449
Saw you watching me
at the marketplace.

148
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:46,814
You dropped this.

149
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,366
Yeah, when your friend
kept bumping into me.

150
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:57,134
- What's that?
- There's a hole. We have to go back.

151
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:58,884
A what? A hole?

152
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:02,040
Are you stupid? There's a hole
in the road. We can't go that way.

153
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,575
There's a travel pipe down
by the airlocks, if you've got stamps.

154
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,000
- What are you doing?
- Don't mind me.

155
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,093
Never could resist
a "keep out" sign.

156
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:13,380
What's through there?
What's so scary about a hole?

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,520
Something under the road?

158
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:16,932
Nobody knows.

159
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:21,032
- We're not supposed to talk about it.
- About what?

160
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:23,280
Below.

161
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:26,242
And because you're not supposed to,
you don't?

162
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:28,084
Watch and learn.

163
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:33,915
- You sound Scottish.
- I am Scottish. What's wrong with that?

164
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:35,790
Scotland's got to be here somewhere.

165
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,621
No.

166
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,443
They wanted their own ship.

167
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:41,640
Good for them. Nothing changes.

168
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:44,667
How did you get here?

169
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:46,960
Just passing through, you know,
with a guy.

170
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:48,280
Your boyfriend?

171
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,949
What?

172
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:55,306
Nothing. It's just...

173
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,475
I'm getting married.
Funny how things slip your mind.

174
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:59,480
- Married?
- Yeah, shut up, married.

175
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:01,960
Really, actually married.

176
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:04,459
- Almost definitely.
- When?

177
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,937
Well, it's kind of weird.

178
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,878
A long time ago, tomorrow morning.

179
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,024
I wonder what I did.

180
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,927
Result!

181
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,440
- Coming?
- No.

182
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:19,040
Suit yourself.

183
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:22,480
Stop! You mustn't do that!

184
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:49,683
My God.

185
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,056
That's weird. That's...

186
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:30,044
Can't be.

187
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:47,238
The impossible truth

188
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,774
in a glass of water.

189
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,143
Not many people see it.

190
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:55,619
But you do, don't you, Doctor?

191
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:59,670
- You know me?
- Keep your voice down.

192
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,000
They're everywhere.

193
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:06,155
- Tell me what you see in the glass.
- Who says I see anything?

194
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:09,144
Don't waste time.
At the marketplace,

195
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:12,118
you placed a glass of water
on the floor, looked at it,

196
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:15,011
then came straight here
to the engine room. Why?

197
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,412
No engine vibration on deck.
Ship this size, engine this big,

198
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,984
you'd feel it. The water would move.

199
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:25,100
I thought I'd take a look.

200
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,900
It doesn't make sense.

201
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,919
These power couplings,
they're not connected. Look.

202
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:33,320
They're dummies, see?

203
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,217
And behind this wall, nothing.
It's hollow.

204
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:38,775
If I didn't know better, I'd say
there was...

205
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:39,968
No engine at all.

206
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:44,120
But it's working. This ship is
traveling though space. I saw it.

207
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,813
The impossible truth, Doctor.

208
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:49,750
We're traveling among the stars
in a spaceship that could never fly.

209
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,692
- How?
- I don't know.

210
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:54,092
There's a darkness at the heart
of this nation.

211
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:55,983
It threatens every one of us.

212
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,690
Help us, Doctor.

213
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:00,801
You're our only hope.

214
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:05,999
Your friend is safe. This will
take you to her. Now go, quickly!

215
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:09,567
Who are you?

216
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,999
How do I find you again?

217
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,853
I am Liz 10. And I will find you.

218
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:46,760
<i>Welcome to voting cubicle</i>

<i>the programme will be discontinued,</i>

<i>If you choose to accept the situation,

247
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,960

254
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:45,640
<i>and the price that has been paid

255
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:50,022
<i>May God have mercy on our souls.</i>

256
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,080
MESSAGE EN ATTENTE.

257
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,720
<i>This isn't a trick.
You've got to find</i>

258
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,999

259
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:21,103
<i>Don't let him investigate.
Stop him. Do whatever you have to.</i>

260
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:24,044
<i>Just please,
please get the Doctor off this ship!</i>

261
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,807
What have you done?

262
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:45,680
Yeah, your basic memory wipe job.

263
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,882
- Must have erased about 20 minutes.
- But why would I choose to forget?

264
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,400
Cos everyone does.

265
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,843
Everyone chooses
the "forget" button.

266
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:54,920
Did you?

267
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,706
I'm not eligible to vote yet.

268
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,678
I'm 12.

269
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:02,320
Any time after you're 16,
you're allowed to the see the film and

270
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:05,760
make your choice.
And then, once every five years...

271
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:09,357
And once every five years, everyone
chooses to forget what they've learned.

272
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,325
Democracy in action.

273
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:14,680
How do you not know about this?

274
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,531
- Are you Scottish too?
- I'm way worse than Scottish.

275
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:19,520
I can't even see the movie.
Won't play for me.

276
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:21,373
It played for me.

277
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,840
The difference being
the computer doesn't accept me as human.

278
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:25,120
Why not?

279
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,280
You look human.

280
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:30,389
No,

281
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:31,971
you look Time Lord.

282
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:34,800
- We came first.
- So there are other Time Lords?

283
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:41,100
There were, but there aren't...

284
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,705
Just me now.

285
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,357
Long story. There was a bad day.
Bad stuff happened,

286
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:50,763
and you know what? I'd love to forget it
all, every last bit of it, but I don't.

287
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:51,760
Not ever.

288
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:55,720
Cos this is what I do,
every time, every day,

289
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,394
every second.

290
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:58,695
This.

291
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,324
Hold tight.

292
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:03,370
We're bringing down the government.

293
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:17,927
Say, "Wheee!"

294
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:27,978
It's all right, love.

295
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,075
It's only me.

296
00:19:41,143 --> 00:19:42,400
High-speed air cannon.

297
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,280
Lousy way to travel.

298
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,680
- Where are we?
- 600 feet down,

299
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,861
20 miles laterally, puts us
at the heart of the ship. I'd say...

300
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:52,000
Lancashire.
What's this

301
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,800
then a cave? Can't be a cave. Looks

302
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,640
- like a cave.
- It's a rubbish dump,

303
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,000
- and it's minging!
- Yes, but

304
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,707
only food refuse.

305
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:03,223
Organic, coming through feeder tubes
from all over the ship.

306
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:06,188
The floor's all squidgy,
like a water bed.

307
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:08,285
But feeding what, though?

308
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,089
It's sort of rubbery, feel it.
Wet and slimy.

309
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:17,616
It's not a floor, it's a...

310
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,328
It's a what?

311
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:23,200
The next word is kind of the scary word.
Take a moment.

312
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,774
Get yourself in a calm place.
Go "omm".

313
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:30,344
It's a tongue.

314
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:33,684
- A tongue?
- A tongue. A great big tongue.

315
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:34,920
This is a mouth?

316
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:37,440
This whole place

317
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:38,899
is a mouth?

318
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,680
- We're in a mouth?
- Yes.

319
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,400
But on the plus side, roomy.

320
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:43,940
How do we get out?

321
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,331
How big is this beastie?
It's gorgeous!

322
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,200
Blimey! If this is just the mouth,
I'd love to see the stomach.

323
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:53,353
- Though not right now.
- Doctor, how do we get out?

324
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,646
It's being fed through surgically
implanted feeder tubes, so

325
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,083
the normal entrance is...

326
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,570
... closed for business.

327
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:09,720
- We can try, though.
- No! Stop, don't move!

328
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,727
- Too late. It's started.
- What has?

329
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:12,920
Swallow reflex.

330
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,240
- What you doing?
- I'm vibrating the chemo-receptors.

331
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,572
Chemo-what?

332
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,670
The eject button.

333
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,680
- How does a mouth have an eject button?
- Think about it!

334
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,432
Right, then.

335
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,360
This isn't going to be big
on dignity.

336
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,492
There's nothing broken,
there's no sign of concussion

337
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,305
and yes, you are covered in sick.

338
00:21:52,231 --> 00:21:54,480
- Where are we?
- Overspill pipe, at a guess.

339
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:59,160
- Oh, God, it stinks.
- That's not the pipe.

340
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,000
Can we get out?

341
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,760
One door, one door switch,
one condition.

342
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
We forget everything we saw.

343
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:11,593
Look familiar?

344
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,720
That's the carrot.

345
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,200
Here's the stick.

346
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,760
There's a creature living in the heart
of this ship. What's it doing there?

347
00:22:22,702 --> 00:22:24,931
No, that's not going to work on me,
so come on.

348
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:26,392
Big old beast below decks,

349
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,400
and everyone who protests gets shoved
down its throat. That how it works?

350
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:35,004
Stop it. I'm not leaving
and I'm not forgetting

351
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:38,291
and what are you fellows going to do
about it? Stick out your tongues?

352
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,160
Doctor?

353
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:56,876
Look who it is.

354
00:22:57,607 --> 00:22:59,487
You look a lot better
without your mask.

355
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:01,987
You must be Amy. Liz.

356
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:03,640
Liz 10.

357
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Hi!

358
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:08,640
Lovely hair, Amy.
Shame about the sick.

359
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,846
You know Mandy?

360
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,266
- She's very brave.
- How did you find us?

361
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,451
Stuck my gizmo on you.

362
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,480
Been listening in.
Nice moves on the hurl escape.

363
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:22,275
So, what's the big fella doing here?

364
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,254
You're over 16, you've voted.

365
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:26,880
Whatever this is, you've chosen
to forget about it.

366
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,160
No. Never forgot, never voted.
Not technically a British subject.

367
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,360
Then who and what are you,
and how do you know me?

368
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:37,005
You're a bit hard to miss, love.
Mysterious stranger,

369
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:41,052
MO consistent with higher alien
intelligence, hair of an idiot...

370
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:44,459
I've been brought up on the stories.

371
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:46,589
My whole family was.

372
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,809
Your family?

373
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:51,912
They're repairing. Doesn't take them
long. Let's move.

374
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,427
The Doctor.
Old drinking buddy of Henry XII.

375
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:02,939
Tea and scones with Liz II. Vicky was a
bit on the fence about you, weren't she?

376
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,784
Knighted and exiled you
on the same day.

377
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:09,720
And so much for the Virgin Queen,
you bad, bad boy!

378
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,120
Liz 10?

379
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,016
Liz 10, yeah. Elizabeth X. And down!

380
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,680
I'm the bloody Queen, mate.

381
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,272
Basically, I rule.

382
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:34,040
There's a high-speed Vator
through there.

383
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:38,608
Oh, yeah. There's these things.

384
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,480
Any ideas?

385
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,988
I saw one of these up top.

386
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:44,320
There was a hole in the road,
like it had burst through,

387
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,180
- like a root.
- Exactly like a root.

388
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,106
It's all one creature - the same
one we were inside - reaching out.

389
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,200
It must be growing through
the mechanisms of the entire ship.

390
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,920
What? Like an infestation?

391
00:24:57,589 --> 00:24:59,046
Someone's helping it.

392
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:00,581
Feeding it.

393
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:04,411
Feeding my subjects to it. Come on.
We've got to keep moving.

394
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,446
Doctor?

395
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:10,674
Oh, Amy.

396
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:15,275
We should never have come here.

397
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:20,343
<i>Don't let him investigate.</i>

398
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:22,247
<i>Stop him. Do whatever you have to.</i>

399
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:25,638
<i>Just please, please get the Doctor
off this ship.</i>

400
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,519
Winder division one.

401
00:25:32,913 --> 00:25:35,539
Ten has penetrated
to the lower levels.

402
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:38,320
Initiate the protocol.

403
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,494
God save the Queen.

404
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,280
Why all the glasses?

405
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:50,559
To remind me every single day that
my government is up to something,

406
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:53,520
and it's my duty to find out what.

407
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:58,720
A queen going undercover
to investigate her own kingdom?

408
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,048
Secrets are being kept from me.

409
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:03,009
I don't have a choice.

410
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:06,240
Ten years I've been at this,
my entire reign

411
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:09,036
and you've achieved more
in one afternoon.

412
00:26:10,348 --> 00:26:12,501
How old were you
when you came to the throne?

413
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,480
40. Why?

414
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:17,800
What, you're 50 now?

415
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:19,317
No way!

416
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:22,000
They slowed my body clock.

417
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,680
Keeps me looking like the stamps.

418
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,120
- And you always wear this in public?
- Undercover is not easy when you're me.

419
00:26:27,465 --> 00:26:29,519
The autographs, the bunting.

420
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,708
Air-balanced porcelain.

421
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:35,400
Stays on by itself,
cos it's perfectly

422
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,880
sculpted to your face.

423
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,520
So what?

424
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,741
Oh, Liz.

425
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:43,495
So everything.

426
00:26:47,246 --> 00:26:48,560
What are you doing?

427
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:50,989
How dare you come in here?

428
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,400
Ma'am,

429
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,480
you have expressed interest in
the interior workings of Starship UK.

430
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,800
You will come with us now.

431
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,841
Why would I do that?

432
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:07,040
How can they be Smilers?

433
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:09,487
Half Smiler, half human.

434
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:12,171
Whatever you creatures are,

435
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,000
I am still your queen.

436
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,120
On whose authority is this done?

437
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,640
The highest authority, Ma'am.

438
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,000
- I AM the highest authority.
- Yes, ma'am.

439
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,068
- You must go now, Ma'am.
- Where?

440
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:25,486
The tower, Ma'am.

441
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,972
Doctor, where are we?

442
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,344
The lowest point of Starship UK.

443
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:45,704
The dungeon. Ma'am.

444
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,998
Hawthorne!

445
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,020
So this is
where you hid yourself away.

446
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,080
You've got some explaining to do.
There's children down here.

447
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,571
What's all that about?

448
00:27:56,871 --> 00:28:00,665
Protesters and citizens of
limited value are fed to the beast.

449
00:28:00,952 --> 00:28:03,180
For some reason,
it won't eat the children.

450
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:06,554
You're the first adults it's spared.
You're very lucky.

451
00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:09,919
Yeah, look at us. Torture chamber
of the Tower of London.

452
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,053
Lucky.

453
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:13,884
Except it's not
a torture chamber, is it?

454
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:15,240
Well, except it is.

455
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,056
Except it isn't.

456
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:18,840
Depends on your angle.

457
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,446
What's that?

458
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:25,319
Well, like I say,
depends on the angle.

459
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:29,121
It's either the exposed pain center of big
fella's brain, being tortured relentlessly.

460
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,800
Or it's the gas pedal.

461
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,640
The accelerator,
Starship UK's go-faster button.

462
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,880
- I don't understand.
- Don't you? Try.

463
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,874
Go on.

464
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:40,328
The spaceship that could never fly,
no vibration on deck.

465
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:43,792
This creature. This poor,
trapped, terrified creature.

466
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:45,480
It's not infesting you,

467
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,560
it's not invading, it's...

468
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,789
what you have instead of an engine.

469
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,538
And this place down here
is where you hurt it,

470
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:55,320
where you torture it, day after day,
just to keep it moving.

471
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:04,094
Tell you what.

472
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:07,635
Normally, it's above
the range of human hearing.

473
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:15,109
This is the sound
none of you wanted to hear.

474
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:26,254
Stop it.

475
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:39,162
Who did this?

476
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:42,889
We act on instructions
from the highest authority.

477
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,680
I am the highest authority.

478
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:49,675
The creature will be released.

479
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:50,557
Now.

480
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:53,698
I said now!

481
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:57,080
- Is anyone listening to me?
- Liz.

482
00:29:59,577 --> 00:30:00,520
Your mask.

483
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,120
What about it?

484
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:04,699
Look at it.

485
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,052
It's old.

486
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,560
At least 200 years old, I'd say.

487
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:11,005
Yeah, it's an antique, so?

488
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:14,235
Yeah, an antique made
by a craftsmen over 200 years ago

489
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,320
and perfectly sculpted to your face.

490
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:19,942
They slowed your body clock,
all right, but you're not 50.

491
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:23,279
Nearer 300.

492
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,828
And it's been a long old reign.

493
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,830
Nah, it's ten years.

494
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,840
I've been on this throne ten years.

495
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,274
Ten years.

496
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,610
And the same ten years
over and over again,

497
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,710
always...

498
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,520
always leading you... here.

499
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,280
What have you done?

500
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:55,765
Only what you have ordered.

501
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,320
We work for you, Ma'am.

502
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:00,800
The Winders, the Smilers,

503
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:02,428
all of us.

504
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,080
<i>If you are watching this...</i>

505
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,870
<i>If I am watching this,</i>

506
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,990
<i>then I have found my way
to the Tower Of London.</i>

507
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:14,640
<i>The creature you are looking at</i>

508
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,780
<i>is called a Star Whale.</i>

509
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:19,993
<i>Once, there were millions of them.</i>

510
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:24,028
<i>They lived in the depths of space and,
according to legend,</i>

511
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:28,200
<i>guided the early space travelers
through the asteroid belts.</i>

512
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,981
<i>This one,</i>

513
00:31:30,379 --> 00:31:32,034
<i>as far as we are aware,</i>

514
00:31:32,846 --> 00:31:34,440
<i>is the last of its kind.</i>

515
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,840
<i>And what we have done to it</i>

516
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:40,084
<i>breaks my heart.</i>

517
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:43,503
<i>The Earth was burning.</i>

518
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,143
<i>Our sun had turned on us,
and every other nation</i>

519
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:48,740
<i>had fled to the skies.</i>

520
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:51,202
<i>Our children screamed</i>

521
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,396
<i>as the skies grew hotter.</i>

522
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,260
<i>And then it came,</i>

523
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:57,684
<i>like a miracle.</i>

524
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:00,520
<i>The last of the star whales.</i>

525
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,969
<i>We trapped it.</i>

526
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:05,053
<i>We built our ship around it,</i>

527
00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:07,651
<i>and we rode on its back to safety.</i>

528
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,623
<i>If you wish our voyage to continue,</i>

529
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:15,096
<i>then you must press
the "forget" button.</i>

530
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:19,000
<i>Be again the heart of this nation,</i>

531
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:21,182
<i>untainted.</i>

532
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:23,986
<i>If not,</i>

533
00:32:24,757 --> 00:32:26,200
<i>press the other button.</i>

534
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:29,157
<i>Your reign will end,</i>

535
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,357
<i>the Star Whale will be released,</i>

536
00:32:31,477 --> 00:32:33,467
<i>and our ship will disintegrate.</i>

537
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:38,385
<i>I hope I keep the strength
to make the right decision.</i>

538
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:42,381
I voted for this?

539
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:45,753
Why would I do that?

540
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,365
Because you knew if we stayed here,

541
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:51,003
I'd be faced with
an impossible choice.

542
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:54,331
Humanity or the alien.

543
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:58,080
You took it upon yourself
to save me from that.

544
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,014
And that was wrong.

545
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,203
You don't ever decide
what I need to know.

546
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:06,440
- I don't even remember doing it.
- You did it. That's what counts.

547
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:07,924
I'm...

548
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,480
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, I don't care.

549
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,814
When I'm done here,
you're going home.

550
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:20,720
Why?

551
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:22,920
Because I made a mistake?

552
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,374
One mistake?
I don't even remember doing it.

553
00:33:26,617 --> 00:33:28,260
- Doctor!
- Yeah. I know.

554
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:30,960
You're only human.

555
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:33,600
What are you doing?

556
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:37,433
The worst thing I'll ever do.

557
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:42,183
I'm going to pass a massive electrical
charge through the Star Whale's brain.

558
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:45,320
It should knock out all its higher
functions, leave it a vegetable.

559
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:47,880
The ship will still fly,
but the whale won't feel it.

560
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:50,991
- That'll be like killing it.
- Look, three options.

561
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:51,849
One,

562
00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:55,324
I let the Star Whale continue
in unendurable agony

563
00:33:55,444 --> 00:33:56,769
for hundreds more years.

564
00:33:56,889 --> 00:33:59,560
Two, I kill everyone on this ship.

565
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:01,814
Three, I murder a beautiful,

566
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:04,484
innocent creature
as painlessly as I can.

567
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:07,887
And then I find a new name,
cos I won't be the Doctor any more.

568
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:09,654
There must be some other way.

569
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:12,115
Nobody talk to me. Nobody human,

570
00:34:12,235 --> 00:34:14,280
has anything to say to me today!

571
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:39,271
Timmy!

572
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:41,553
You made it, you're OK!

573
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,470
It's me - Mandy.

574
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:00,739
<i>Come on, use your eyes.
Notice everything.</i>

575
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:02,361
<i>Notice everything.</i>

576
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:03,960
Our children screamed.

577
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,200
It came, like a miracle.
It won't eat the children.

578
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:10,640
Children screamed. Then it came.
It's the last of its kind.

579
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:13,153
- Just me now.
- The last of its kind.

580
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:16,858
Is this how it works, Doctor? Never
interfere with other people or planets.

581
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,280
- Children screamed.
- Unless it's children crying.

582
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,160
- The last of its kind.
- Just me now.

583
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,520
- Unless there's children crying.
- Yes.

584
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:26,955
<i>It won't eat the children.
Then it came.</i>

585
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:28,955
<i>Like a miracle.</i>

586
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,808
<i>The last of the Star Whales.</i>

587
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,000
Doctor, stop.

588
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:39,672
Whatever you're doing, stop it now!

589
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,120
Sorry, Your Majesty,
going to need a hand.

590
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,690
Amy, no! No!

591
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:02,640
Amy, what have you done?

592
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,840
Nothing at all.

593
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,456
Am I right?

594
00:36:06,755 --> 00:36:08,258
We've increased speed!

595
00:36:08,378 --> 00:36:10,805
Yeah, well,
you've stopped torturing the pilot.

596
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:12,120
Gotta help.

597
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:13,880
It's still here?

598
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:17,263
I don't understand.

599
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:20,880
The Star Whale didn't come like
a miracle all those years ago.

600
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:22,456
It volunteered.

601
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:25,250
You didn't have to trap it
or torture it -

602
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,117
that was all just you.

603
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,560
It came because it couldn't stand
to watch your children cry.

604
00:36:32,463 --> 00:36:35,947
What if you were really old,
and really kind and alone?

605
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:38,947
Your whole race dead, no future.

606
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,000
What couldn't you do then?

607
00:36:41,571 --> 00:36:43,871
If you were that old, and that kind,

608
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,956
and the very last of your kind...

609
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:52,618
you couldn't just stand there
and watch children cry.

610
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,531
From Her Majesty.

611
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:18,901
She says there will be
no more secrets on Starship UK.

612
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:27,737
Amy, you could have killed
everyone on this ship.

613
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:33,883
You could have killed a Star Whale.

614
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:37,179
And you saved it.

615
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,549
I know, I know.

616
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:48,560
Amazing, though, don't you think?

617
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,019
The Star Whale.

618
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:54,920
All that pain and misery...

619
00:37:57,889 --> 00:37:59,339
... and loneliness.

620
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:03,900
And it just made it kind.

621
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:07,943
But you couldn't have known
ho wit would react. You couldn't.

622
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:10,173
But I've seen it before.

623
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,646
Very old and very kind,
and the very, very last.

624
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:16,435
Sound a bit familiar?

625
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:27,720
What?

626
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:29,403
Gotcha. Ha!

627
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:34,730
Gotcha.

628
00:38:39,555 --> 00:38:42,021
Shouldn't we say goodbye?
Won't they wonder where we went?

629
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:45,083
For the rest of their lives.
Oh, the songs they'll write!

630
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,403
Never mind them. Big day tomorrow.

631
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:50,161
- Sorry, what?
- It's always a big day tomorrow.

632
00:38:50,281 --> 00:38:52,936
We've got a time machine.
I skip the little ones.

633
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:57,025
You know what I said about
getting back for tomorrow morning...

634
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,567
Have you ever run away from something
because you were scared, or,

635
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,755
or not ready, or just...

636
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:09,000
Just because you could?

637
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:11,058
Once...

638
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:13,753
a long time ago.

639
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,280
What happened?

640
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:18,549
Hello!

641
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:22,789
Right.

642
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:26,260
Doctor, there's something
I haven't told you.

643
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,000
No. Hang on,
is that a phone ringing?

644
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:34,096
- People phone you?
- Well, it's a phone box.

645
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:35,466
Would you mind?

646
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,680
Hello?

647
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,490
Sorry, who?

648
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,560
No, seriously. Who?

649
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:52,982
Says he's Prime Minister. First
the Queen, now the Prime Minister.

650
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,380
Get about, don't you?

651
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,050
Which Prime Minister?

652
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,990
Which Prime Minister?

653
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,480
- The British one.
- Which British one?

654
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,690
Which British one?

655
00:40:10,885 --> 00:40:12,356
Winston Churchill for you.

656
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,518
Oh! Hello, dear. What's up?

657
00:40:15,058 --> 00:40:16,722
Tricky situation, Doctor.

658
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:18,510
Potentially very dangerous.

659
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,534
I think I'm going to need you.

660
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:23,520
Don't worry about a thing,
Prime Minister. We're on our way.

661
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:31,680
<i>In bed above, we're deep asleep</i>

662
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:35,702
<i>While greater love lies further deep</i>

663
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:38,613
<i>This dream must end.
This world must know.</i>

664
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:41,773
<i>We all depend on the beast below.</i>

665
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:58,880
- Winston Churchill.
- Doctor, is it you?

666
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,300
Cabinet War Rooms, right?

667
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,528
I have something to show you.

668
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240
Our new secret weapon.

669
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:08,500
- This is one of my ironsides.
- Your what?

670
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,880
I am your soldier.

671
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,640
- You didn't invent them, they're alien.
- They'll win me the war.

672
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,122
They're up to something,
but what is it? What are they after?

673
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:18,200
I've defeated you time and again.

674
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,440
I've saved the whole of reality
from you.

675
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
I am the Doctor,
and you are the Daleks.

676
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,520
Behold the restoration
of the Daleks.
