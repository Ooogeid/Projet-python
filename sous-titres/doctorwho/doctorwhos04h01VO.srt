1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,655
Hello, Mum!

2
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:08,131
Susie says hello,
don't you, sweetheart?

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:10,117
That's it.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,648
Give a little wave.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,021
What was I gonna say?

6
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,482
Uncle Soon called in, he says hello.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,508
He keeps saying,
"You must be missing her."

8
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:24,867
I said,
"She's been gone for over two years now,

9
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:26,507
"I'm getting used to it!"

10
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:31,080
No, it's breaking up.
It must be the solar flares.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,978
Talk faster.

12
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:35,288
About the deposit on the house...

13
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:39,085
I've spoken to the bank...

14
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:52,840
The Red Planet!

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,107
Sun sets in ten minutes, Yuri.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,796
- You're gonna lose the light.
- That's it.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,704
Got you on External Ten.

18
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,320
Almost there.

19
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,983
That's the radial clamp down.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,160
One more thing.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,560
Get back inside,
you're using power and oxygen.

22
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:36,851
Hold on.

23
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:40,035
Get this on camera.

24
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:42,730
What do you think?

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,666
Looks good!
Nice one, Yuri.

26
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:47,639
You wasted an entire solar panel
just to make that.

27
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:50,200
Lighten up. It's a joke.

28
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:52,083
We come all this way,

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,480
to an empty planet, untouched
by civilisation, and what do we do?

30
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:57,639
Put up cheap jokes.

31
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,000
That's not funny, that's pollution.

32
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:03,655
Having fun?
I expect better of you, Ed.

33
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:06,120
Now get back to work, all of you.

34
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,243
Beautiful.

35
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,400
Rotate.

36
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:27,157
Slowly.

37
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,240
You are under arrest,
for trespassing.

38
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,000
Gadget-Gadget.

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,635
State your name,
rank, and intention.

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,160
The Doctor.

44
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:23,440
Doctor.

45
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:24,999
Fun.

46
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,654
What the hell?

47
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:30,720
It's a man!

48
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:32,800
A man on Mars!

49
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,723
- How?
- He was wearing this thing.

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,664
I have never seen anything like it.

51
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,986
- What did Mission Control say?
- They're out of range for ten hours.

52
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:44,180
- If we could cut the chat, everyone.
- Actually, chat's second on my list,

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,720
the first being gun,
pointed at my head.

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,732
Which then puts my head second
and chat third,

55
00:03:49,852 --> 00:03:51,649
Gun, head, chat. I hate lists.

56
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:54,360
But you could hurt someone with that,
just... put it down.

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,360
- You'd like that.
- Can you find me someone who wouldn't?

58
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:00,880
- Why should I trust you?
- Because I give you my word.

59
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:03,658
And, 40 million miles
away from home,

60
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:05,551
my word is all you've got.

61
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:12,039
Keep Gadget covering him.

62
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,798
Right, so you control that thing?
Auto-glove response?

63
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,600
You got it.
To the right...

64
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,068
And to the left.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,080
It's a bit flimsy.

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,000
- Does it have to keep saying that?
- It's funny.

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,748
I hate funny robots.

68
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:29,960
Excuse me, boss.

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,160
Computer log says

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,667
an extra person on site.

71
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,205
How's that possible?

72
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:36,598
Keep the Bio-dome closed.

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,680
And when using open comms
you call me Captain.

74
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,576
But... who is it?

75
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:47,461
Disconnected!

76
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,796
She's cut me off.
Can you believe her?

77
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,320
It's like we're just... gardeners!

78
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,746
As long as they leave us alone,

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,860
that's fine with me.

80
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,840
You beauties!

81
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:04,447
Look at this!

82
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,713
Better start planting some more,
if there's an extra mouth to feed.

83
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:11,320
The very first garden off Earth.

84
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:13,574
Everything brand-new.

85
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:15,612
Eden.

86
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:18,920
That's what
we should've called this place.

87
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,200
It's the Philippines.

88
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,921
I bet.
If there's someone else on Mars,

89
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,568
it's got to be the Philippines.

90
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,176
All those stories about them
building a rocket.

91
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,800
Adelaide's gonna love that.

92
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,160
Stealing her thunder.

93
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,900
Mind you, worth it to see her face.

94
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:37,240
Or it could be the Spanish.

95
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,903
They've kept that spacelink project
under wraps.

96
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:42,680
Didn't your sister work for them?

97
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:46,366
Are you all right, mate?

98
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:52,240
Come on, stop mucking about.

99
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,462
Are you OK?

100
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,149
He can't be a World State flight,
we'd know about it.

101
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,867
Therefore, he's got to be one
of the independents.

102
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,237
Was it the Branson inheritance lot?

103
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,230
They've talked about a Mars shot
for years.

104
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:21,565
OK. You got me.

105
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:24,788
- So I'm the Doctor, and you are?
- Come on.

106
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:27,448
We're the first off-world colonists
in history.

107
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
Everyone on Planet
Earth knows who we are.

108
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:31,964
You're the first?

109
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,184
The very first humans on Mars?

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,560
Then, this is...
Bowie Base One.

111
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,345
Number one?

112
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:41,520
Founded July 1st, 2058.

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,760
Established Bowie Base
One in the Gusev Crater...

114
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:53,080
- You've been here how long?
- 17 months.

115
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,160
2059.

116
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,752
It's 2059, right now.

117
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:07,520
My head is so stupid,
you're Captain Adelaide Brooke!

118
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,160
And Ed!
You're Deputy Edward Gold.

119
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:18,843
Tarak Ital, MD.

120
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,560
Nurse Yuri Kerenski.

121
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,706
Senior Technician Steffi Ehrlich.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,680
Junior Technician Roman Groom.

123
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,800
Geologist Mia Bennett.

124
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,000
You're only 27 years old.

125
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:47,080
As I said, Doctor,
everyone knows our names.

126
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:50,378
They'll never forget them.

127
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,919
What's the date, today?

128
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:58,880
Tell me the exact date.

129
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,081
November 21st 2059.

130
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,240
Right.

131
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,160
- Fine.
- Is there something wrong?

132
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,732
What's so important about my age?

133
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,759
I should... go.

134
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,583
I really should go.

135
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,241
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry with all of my hearts.

136
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:26,780
But it's one of those very rare times
when I've got no choice.

137
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:33,400
It's been an honour.

138
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,814
Seriously,

139
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,000
a very great honour to meet you all.

140
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:41,760
The Martian pioneers.

141
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Thank you.

142
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:49,720
Thank you.

143
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,160
There's the other two. Hold on...

144
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:58,311
Margaret Cain and Andrew Stone.

145
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,433
If you want to meet the new human being
you're gonna see in the next five years,

146
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:14,698
better come take a look.

147
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,200
What was that?

148
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:25,160
I really should go.

149
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:28,480
This is Central.
Bio-dome report immediately.

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,224
Show me the Bio-dome.

151
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:36,101
- Internal cameras are down.
- Show me the exterior.

152
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,960
I'm going over.

153
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:51,103
Doctor, with me.

154
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:52,922
I'm sorry,

155
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,640
I'd love to help,
but I'm leaving, right now.

156
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,066
Lock his spacesuit up.

157
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,160
This started as soon as you arrived,
so you're not going anywhere.

158
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,480
Except with me.

159
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,763
What's so important about Mia's age?

160
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:16,200
You said she's only 27,
why does it matter?

161
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:20,052
I just open my mouth and words come out.
They don't make much sense.

162
00:10:20,172 --> 00:10:22,562
- Telling me.
- Thank you, Doctor.

163
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:24,157
Any time, Doctor.

164
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,960
I hate robots. Did I say?

165
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,997
And he's not too fond of you.

166
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,447
- What's wrong with robots?
- It's the people.

167
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:36,968
Dressing them up and giving them
silly voices. You're reducing them.

168
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:38,609
Friend of mine,

169
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,080
She made her domestic robot
look like a dog.

170
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,902
Dogs. That's different.

171
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,514
But I adapted Gadget out

172
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,818
of the worker drones.
Those things are huge!

173
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,570
They built this place when the shell
was lowered dow from orbit.

174
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,560
They've got
a strength capacity of...

175
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,280
The channel is open for essential

176
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,760
communications only.

177
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,600
Sorry.

178
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,625
Love those drones.

179
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,640
I've read all that stuff about you,
Captain Adelaide.

180
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,494
But one thing they never said,
was it worth it?

181
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:08,926
The mission?

182
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:12,040
We've got excellent results
from the soil analysis.

183
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
But all of it.

184
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:16,910
Cos they say
you sacrificed everything.

185
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,851
Devoted your whole life to get here.

186
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,560
It's been chaos back home.

187
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,840
40 long years.

188
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:29,378
The climate, the ozone,
the oil apocalypse.

189
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,800
We almost reached extinction.

190
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,640
Then to fly above that...

191
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,960
to stand on a world with no smoke,

192
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:42,192
where the only straight line
is the sunlight...

193
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes. It's worth it.

194
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:51,040
That's the Adelaide Brooke
I always wanted to meet.

195
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,240
The woman with starlight
in her soul.

196
00:11:57,436 --> 00:11:58,536
What's that?

197
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:02,332
- It's Maggie.
- Don't touch her!

198
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:04,827
I know the procedure.
Maggie, can you hear me?

199
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,000
It's Tarak.

200
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,160
She's still breathing.
She's alive.

201
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:18,547
I've got Margaret Cain, head trauma.
I need a full medpack.

202
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,537
I've got it. Medpack on its way.

203
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:24,365
- I'm going to help!
- In the absence of the Captain,

204
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:27,616
you're in charge, sir!
You've got to stay in the Dome!

205
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:38,560
Don't touch her, use the gloves.

206
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,240
Do what he says. Get her to sickbay.

207
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,280
Put her in isolation.

208
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,773
We're going to the Bio-dome.

209
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:46,920
Tarak, with me,
Yuri can take care of her.

210
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,680
Ed, go back. Gadget, stand guard,
keep an eye on this area.

211
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:52,280
You're gonna need me.

212
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,345
Andy's the only other
crew member out here,

213
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,160
and if that wasn't an accident...

214
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
then he's gone wild.

215
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:02,200
You've deserted your post.
Consider that an official warning.

216
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,319
Now, get back to work. Doctor?

217
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:24,461
That sound we heard from the Bio-dome,
I've run it through diagnostics.

218
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:26,800
According to the computer...
It's Andy.

219
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:30,200
It registers
as the voice-print of Andy Stone.

220
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:31,768
Understood.

221
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:36,234
- Double-check, thanks.
- Air pressure stabilised.

222
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,860
It's Captain Brooke.

223
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,841
Andy, report. I need to see you.
Where are you?

224
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:55,920
There you go.

225
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:58,874
- What's that device?
- Screwdriver.

226
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,023
Are you the Doctor or the Janitor?

227
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:03,166
I don't know, sounds like me.

228
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:05,418
The maintenance man of the universe.

229
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,571
You, stay with me,
don't step out of my sight.

230
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:10,302
Tarak, go to External Door South,
make sure it's intact.

231
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:12,728
Quite an achievement.

232
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:15,680
First flower on Mars
in 10,000 years.

233
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,160
And you're growing veg!

234
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,825
It's that lot, they're already planning
Christmas dinner.

235
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:24,658
Last year it was dehydrated protein,
this year they want the real thing.

236
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,160
Still, fair enough. Christmas.

237
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,720
If we must.

238
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,884
You've got birds!

239
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,912
It's part of the project,
to keep the insect population down.

240
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:38,320
Good sign.

241
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,320
- In what way?
- They're still alive.

242
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:43,560
Captain? Good news.

243
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,278
It's Maggie.
She's awake, she's back with us.

244
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,640
How are you, Soldier?
Just take it easy.

245
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,760
Can you remember what happened?

246
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,240
I was just...

247
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:00,000
working.

248
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,840
Then I woke up here.

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,429
What about Andy? We can't find him.

250
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,308
- Was he all right?
- I don't know, I just...

251
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:11,080
If you remember anything,
let me know straight away.

252
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:13,480
Does she know how
she ended up in the tunnel?

253
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,162
And keep the comms clear.

254
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,274
Everything goes through me,
got that?

255
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,631
Come on. Just let me out of here.

256
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm fine. Just groggy.

257
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:27,099
You know the rules.
24 hours.

258
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:43,680
There you are.

259
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:47,818
Are you all right?

260
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:05,094
Look at me.

261
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:14,600
Is that your brother?

262
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:18,400
It's only a repeat.
The solar flares are still up.

263
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,480
Are you OK?

264
00:16:22,943 --> 00:16:23,760
Y'know...

265
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,133
He makes me laugh, though.

266
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:34,513
It's his husband,
he spends money like... an idiot!

267
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:38,560
Last year, for Mikhail's birthday,
he said, "Don't buy me anything."

268
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:40,686
"Let's save money."

269
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:42,703
Georg says, "Fine, OK."

270
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:45,415
His birthday comes around,
turns out Georg

271
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:47,069
has bought him a car!

272
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,169
Top of the range.

273
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,960
And the thing is,
he's used Mikhail's credit stamp!

274
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:55,960
So Mik's saying,
that means I bought it myself!

275
00:16:56,453 --> 00:16:59,334
Georg says,
"It's the thought that counts."

276
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,426
Where does he live?

277
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:04,320
Just outside Dagestan.

278
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,959
- Where's that?
- On the Caspian Sea.

279
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,313
Here you go...

280
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:13,283
- By the sea.
- Technically it's more of a lake.

281
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,160
Earth is so much water.

282
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,800
Look at her.
40 million miles away.

283
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:25,154
It has so much beauty.

284
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,596
We should like that world.

285
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,200
This is sickbay, we have a situation.
Maggie's condition has...

286
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,280
I don't know,
I don't know what it is.

287
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:46,190
It's water, just... pouring out.

288
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:47,680
Yuri, calm down.

289
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,139
- Just tell me what's happened to her.
- The skin is...

290
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,520
sort of broken around the mouth.

291
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
And she's exuding water.

292
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:56,421
Like she's drowning.

293
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,941
This area's unsafe,
we're going back.

294
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,640
Where was he?

295
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:11,998
Keep her contained.
Seal the door at maximum.

296
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm on my way!

297
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:29,938
Just leave him alone.

298
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:32,760
- Step away from him.
- I can help, I promise.

299
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,891
- I order you to stop or I'll shoot!
- Your hand away from him and listen.

300
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:49,632
There now...

301
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,413
That's better.

302
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,707
You must be Andy.

303
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:06,720
We've got to go.

304
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,400
Set the seals at maximum!

305
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:07,612
What the hell?

306
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,800
- That's not Maggie.
- What's happened to her?

307
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,400
What is she?

308
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:19,281
Captain, we need you back here.

309
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,080
Just tell me
that Maggie is contained.

310
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,561
- Can you confirm, Ed?
- Confirmed.

311
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,080
She's locked in.

312
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,120
Keep surveillance till I get back.

313
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,360
And close down all water supplies.

314
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,800
All pipes and outlets,
don't consume anything.

315
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,440
Have you got that, everyone?
That's an order. Don't drink the water.

316
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,131
Don't even touch it. Not one drop.

317
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:43,282
Can you talk?

318
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,760
Human beings are 60% water,
which makes them the perfect host.

319
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:50,445
What for?

320
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:53,501
I don't know. I never will...

321
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,508
Because I've got to go.

322
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,325
Whatever's started here,
I can't see it to the end.

323
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:01,960
I can't.

324
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,840
- This thing's airtight?
- And therefore watertight.

325
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,480
Depends how clever the water is.

326
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:15,320
They're fusing the system.

327
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,240
Abandon ship!

328
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,240
We haven't got time!

329
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,800
They can run faster than us,
we need a lift!

330
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,080
- That thing goes at two miles an hour!
- Not any more!

331
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:00,200
Trust me.

332
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,788
The Central Dome airlocks
have got Hardinger seals.

333
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:38,800
- There's no way they can get in.
- Come on, come on!

334
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:41,327
- I thought you hated robots!
- I do!

335
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,880
We're safe. It's hermetically sealed.
They can't get in.

336
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:57,880
Water is patient, Adelaide.

337
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,023
Water just waits.

338
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:03,081
It wears down the clifftops,
the mountains,

339
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:05,160
the whole of the world.

340
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:07,720
Water always wins. Come on!

341
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:11,520
Bio-dome Tunnel is out of bounds.
Andy and Tarak are infected,

342
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,800
repeat, infected. Make no contact.
And if they make any move,

343
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,160
tell me.
I'm going to the Medical Dome.

344
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,128
Blimey, it's a distance.
You could do with bikes in this place.

345
00:23:24,248 --> 00:23:26,688
Every pound in weight equals
three tons of fuel.

346
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:27,918
I know.

347
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,842
But... bikes!

348
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:42,681
Has that door got a Hardinger seal?

349
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:44,030
No, basic.

350
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,560
Then the moment she heads,
we evacuate. OK?

351
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:47,801
Pulse is low.

352
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
Electrical activity in the brain
seems to be going haywire.

353
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,064
- Can she talk?
- Don't know.

354
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,137
She was before we noticed
the change, but...

355
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:56,840
Can you hear me?
Do you know who I am?

356
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,200
Your commanding officer,
Captain Adelaide Brooke.

357
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,143
Can you tell me what happened?

358
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:10,359
- What language is that?
- Ancient North Martian.

359
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,880
Don't be ridiculous.

360
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,680
- It's like she recognised it.
- And her eyes are different.

361
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:18,450
They're clear,
like she's closer to human.

362
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:21,000
Not close enough for me.

363
00:24:22,443 --> 00:24:24,728
- Where do you get your water from?
- The ice field.

364
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,414
That's why we chose the crater,
we're on top of an underground glacier.

365
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:29,800
Tons of water. Marvellous.

366
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,804
But every single drop is filtered

367
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:34,520
- It's screened, it's safe.
- Looks like it.

368
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,042
If something was frozen down there...
a viral life form,

369
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,229
held in the ice
for all those years...

370
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:42,919
Look at her mouth.

371
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,880
All blackened,
like there's some sort of fission.

372
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:49,821
This thing, whatever it is,
doesn't just hide in water,

373
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:52,040
it creates water.

374
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,800
Tell me what you want.

375
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,160
She was looking at the screen.

376
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,600
At Earth. She wanted Earth.

377
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:04,427
A world full of water.

378
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:06,280
Captain. With me.

379
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:14,327
I'm sorry, but it's an unknown infection
and it's spreading.

380
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,243
That demands Action Procedure One.

381
00:25:16,343 --> 00:25:18,927
- D'you think I don't know that?
- I think you need reminding.

382
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,203
At least I'm good for something.

383
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:27,827
Now and again.

384
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,408
That's almost a compliment.

385
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:32,866
Things must be serious.

386
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:38,040
Sorry, but... Action One,
that means evacuation?

387
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:40,308
We're going home.
This is Captain Brooke.

388
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:43,480
I'm declaring Action One,
repeat to all crewmembers,

389
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,712
it's Action One, with immediate effect.
Evacuate the base.

390
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,045
I'll store the Central Computer,

391
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:52,080
Mia, strip the cargo down to essentials.
Roman, on your feet!

392
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,990
But we came all this way.

393
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,813
Say him goodbye,

394
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,720
it's too heavy. Now shove it
in storage and hurry up!

395
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,200
Steffi, what's your estimate
on shuttle viability?

396
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,827
It's a nine-month flight, it'll take
three hours to load what we need.

397
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:09,530
You've got 20 minutes.
And give me a report on Andy and Tarak.

398
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,193
Still in the Bio-dome Tunnel.

399
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:13,705
They're just standing there.
Like they're waiting.

400
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:16,480
Keep an eye on them.
And make that 20 minutes 15!

401
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:19,320
Ed, line up the shuttle,
go straight to ignition status.

402
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,600
- But what about Maggie?
- We've got no way to contain her.

403
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,080
Close this place down.
I want the power for the shuttle.

404
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,307
The only problem is...

405
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:30,640
Thank you, your spacesuit'll be returned
Good luck.

406
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,440
The problem is,
this thing is clever.

407
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,280
It didn't infect the birds
or the insects, it chose the humans.

408
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,760
You were chosen.
And I told you, water can wait.

409
00:26:39,483 --> 00:26:40,820
Tarak changed straight away,

410
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,260
but when Maggie was infected
it stayed hidden inside her.

411
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,703
No doubt, so it could infiltrate
the Central Dome.

412
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:47,240
Which means...

413
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,473
Any one of us
could already be infected.

414
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,080
We've all been drinking
the same water.

415
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,191
And if you take that
back to Earth...

416
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:57,877
One drop. Just one drop. But...

417
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,000
we're only presuming infection.

418
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,120
If we can find out
how this thing got through,

419
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,400
when it got through...

420
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,736
Continue with Action One.
I'm going to inspect the ice-field.

421
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:11,619
Right. I should leave.

422
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,226
Finally, I should leave.

423
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,371
Yuri, me old mate,
no point in me seeing the ice-field.

424
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:19,360
No point at all.

425
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,319
All I'm saying is, bikes

426
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:35,236
Little foldaway bikes,
don't weigh a thing.

427
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
I'm sorry.

428
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,240
Even if she gets past
the Medical Dome,

429
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,008
she'll never get past the Hardinger seal
at this end, right?

430
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:14,480
So we keep saying.

431
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,760
Camera's down.

432
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
We've lost her.

433
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:55,320
They tell legends of Mars,
from long ago.

434
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,160
Of a fine and noble race
who built an empire out of snow.

435
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,462
- The Ice Warriors.
- I haven't got time for stories.

436
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:05,200
Perhaps they found something
down there.

437
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,552
Used their might
and their wisdom to freeze it.

438
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:09,389
Doctor!

439
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:11,811
We need to find any sort of change
in the water process.

440
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,720
We've got to date the infection.

441
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,608
Access denied.

442
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,836
You don't look like a coward.

443
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:24,720
But all you've wanted
to do is leave.

444
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,173
You know so much about us.

445
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:31,989
- Well, you're famous.
- It's like you know more.

446
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:39,600
This moment, this precise
moment in time, it's like...

447
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:43,720
I mean, it's only a theory,
what do I know? But...

448
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,864
I think...

449
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:47,763
certain moments
in time are fixed.

450
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:51,320
Tiny, precious moments.

451
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,545
Everything else is in flux,

452
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:55,573
anything can happen, but those
certain moments, they have to stand.

453
00:29:57,617 --> 00:29:59,040
This base, on Mars,

454
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,736
with you, Adelaide Brooke,
this is one vital moment.

455
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:04,064
What happens here
must always happen.

456
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:05,509
Which is what?

457
00:30:07,186 --> 00:30:08,143
I don't know.

458
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:14,523
I think something wonderful happens.

459
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:18,800
Something that started 50 years ago,

460
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:20,166
isn't that right?

461
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:24,146
I've never told anyone that.

462
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,455
You told your daughter.

463
00:30:27,912 --> 00:30:31,582
And maybe, one day,
she tells the story to her daughter.

464
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:34,927
The day the Earth was stolen
and moved across the universe.

465
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,830
And you...

466
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:42,412
I saw the Daleks.

467
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:48,343
We looked up,

468
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:51,490
the sky had changed.

469
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:55,157
Everyone was running and screaming.

470
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,948
And my father took hold of me...

471
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:00,787
Stay here!

472
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:02,280
Don't move.

473
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:04,000
I've got to go out.

474
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,649
I'm gonna find your mother,
but I'm coming back,

475
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:08,514
I promise you.

476
00:31:09,252 --> 00:31:10,391
I'm coming back.

477
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:20,376
I never saw him again.

478
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,000
Nor my mother.

479
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,196
They were never found.

480
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,480
But out on the streets,

481
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,015
there was panic

482
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:36,599
and burning.

483
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,600
I went to the window.

484
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,517
And there...

485
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:47,760
in the sky...

486
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:50,691
I saw it, Doctor.

487
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:54,598
And it saw me.

488
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,280
It stared at me.

489
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:01,293
It looked right into me.

490
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:09,219
And then...

491
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:24,116
It simply went away.

492
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:26,375
I knew,

493
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,415
that night,

494
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,399
I knew I would follow it.

495
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,920
But not for revenge.

496
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,624
What would be the point of that?

497
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:39,909
That's what makes you remarkable.

498
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,840
And that's how you create history.

499
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
What do you mean?

500
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,043
Imagine it, Adelaide.

501
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,829
If you began a journey

502
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:53,520
that takes the human race
all the way out to the stars.

503
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,097
It begins with you.

504
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:59,375
And then your granddaughter,
you inspire her.

505
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,086
So that in 30 years
Susie Fontana Brooke

506
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:07,680
is the pilot of the first
lightspeed ship to Proxima Centauri.

507
00:33:13,614 --> 00:33:14,909
And then everywhere.

508
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:18,760
With her children, and her
children's children forging the way,

509
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:22,143
to the Dragon Star,
the Celestial Belt of the Winter Queen,

510
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:24,671
the Map of the Water
Snake Wormholes...

511
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:29,376
One day a Brooke will fall in
love with a Tandonian prince,

512
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:31,280
that's the start of
a whole new species.

513
00:33:31,747 --> 00:33:34,275
But everything starts with you,
Adelaide.

514
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,179
From 50 years ago,
to right here, today.

515
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:42,190
Imagine.

516
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:44,110
Who are you?

517
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:46,606
Why are you telling me this?

518
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,397
Doctor?

519
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:51,720
Why tell me?

520
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,960
As consolation.

521
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:01,103
Andy Stone.

522
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:03,011
He logged on yesterday.

523
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,994
Maintenance log,
21.20, November 2059.

524
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,328
Number three water filter's bust.

525
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:15,862
Guess what, the spares they sent
don't fit. What a surprise(!)

526
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:17,600
Over and out.

527
00:34:18,164 --> 00:34:19,466
A filter.

528
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:22,544
One tiny little filter
and then the Flood.

529
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:25,159
But that means
the infection arrived today!

530
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:28,876
And the water's only cycled out
of the biodome after a week.

531
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,220
The rest of us can't be infected.
We can leave!

532
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,790
Ed, we're clean!

533
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,320
How are we doing?

534
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:37,599
Shuttle's active, stage one!

535
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,727
I haven't got time to
convey the protein packs.

536
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:49,040
If you want food you're gonna have
to carry it by hand. Start loading!

537
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,240
Right now!

538
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,774
- You were right, Doctor.
- What about?

539
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,820
Bikes!

540
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:13,153
Now get to your ship.
I'm saving my people, you save yourself.

541
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:14,842
I know what this moment is.

542
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,207
It's the moment we escape,
now get out.

543
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,807
Everyone, stay...

544
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:34,320
- I'll swap them round.
- Roman, what about you?

545
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,162
Protein-packs 30 to 36.

546
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,053
Ditch the central containers.
We don't need them.

547
00:35:51,153 --> 00:35:55,920
- Units 41, 42 and 43.
- Unit 41 is here.

548
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:01,568
Roman try to condense
the oxygen membranes,

549
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:03,600
we can lose ten pounds.
Faster, come on!

550
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,080
- Ed, how's the fuel jets?
- Cooling down in about 30 seconds.

551
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:25,760
What the hell's that noise?

552
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,487
Mia, you lot, shut up.

553
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,480
It's the module sensors.

554
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,673
Exterior 12.

555
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,344
Cameras are down, but there's
pressure on top of the module.

556
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,359
Two signals right above us.

557
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,274
That means...

558
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:41,949
They're on the roof?!

559
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:58,252
- How did they get inside the Dome?
- They used the maintenance shafts.

560
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:00,443
The shaft's open,
they haven't got spacesuits.

561
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:01,700
They breathe water.

562
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,735
- But they'd freeze.
- They've got that internal fission.

563
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,320
But we're safe,
they can't get through, can they?

564
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:13,512
Can they?

565
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,240
This place is airtight!

566
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,600
Can it get through?

567
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:23,419
- Ed? Can it get through?
- I don't know!

568
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,984
Water itself isn't motile,
but it has some persistence.

569
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:30,720
Everyone, listen to me! That's ten
feet of steel-combination up there.

570
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:34,712
We need all the protein-packs
or we'll starve, now keep working!

571
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,407
Roman! Watch the ceiling!

572
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,234
Ed, get to the shuttle, fire it up.

573
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:39,801
I can carry more than this lot.

574
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,280
- That's an order!
- Captain.

575
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:57,373
Access denied.

576
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:00,069
Access denied.

577
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:03,200
Tell me what happens.

578
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,646
I don't know.

579
00:39:04,746 --> 00:39:05,703
Yes, you do.

580
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:06,698
Now tell me.

581
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:08,880
- You should be with the others.
- Tell me!

582
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:18,134
I could ramp up the pressure
in that airlock and crush you.

583
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,042
Except you won't.

584
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:22,560
You could have shot Andy Stone,
but you didn't.

585
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:24,363
I loved you for that.

586
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:28,805
Imagine...

587
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,485
Imagine you knew something...

588
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:46,120
Imagine you found yourself somewhere,
I don't know, Pompeii.

589
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:47,640
Imagine you were in Pompeii.

590
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,530
What the hell's that got to do with it?

591
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,065
You tried to save them.
But in doing so you make it happen.

592
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,150
Anything I do...

593
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,800
... just makes it happen.

594
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,360
Captain, we need you right now!

595
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,404
I'm still here.

596
00:40:19,408 --> 00:40:20,716
You're taking Action One.

597
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:27,896
There are four more standard action
procedures. And Action Five is...?

598
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:30,373
Detonation.

599
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,181
The final option.

600
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:36,330
The nuclear device at
the heart of the Central Dome.

601
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:37,938
Today,

602
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,442
on the 21st November 2059,

603
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,680
Captain Brooke
activates that device,

604
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,733
taking the base and all
her crew members with her.

605
00:40:50,304 --> 00:40:52,069
No-one ever knows why.

606
00:40:54,777 --> 00:40:56,280
But you were saving Earth.

607
00:40:57,236 --> 00:40:59,019
That's what inspires
your granddaughter.

608
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:04,080
She takes your people
out into the galaxy,

609
00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:05,880
because you die,

610
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,587
on Mars.

611
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,855
You die, today.

612
00:41:16,572 --> 00:41:18,418
She flies out there...

613
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,110
Like she's trying to meet you.

614
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:27,292
I won't die.

615
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:30,307
I will not.

616
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,000
But your death creates the future.

617
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:37,983
Help me.

618
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:41,637
Why won't you help, Doctor?

619
00:41:41,737 --> 00:41:44,008
If you know all of this,
why can't you change it?

620
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:46,355
- I can't.
- Why can't you find a way?

621
00:41:46,455 --> 00:41:49,120
- You could tell me, I don't know...
- I'm sorry, but I can't.

622
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:52,800
Sometimes I can, sometimes I do,
most times I can save someone,

623
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:54,440
or anyone.

624
00:41:55,151 --> 00:41:56,523
But not you.

625
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:01,829
You wondered all your life why
that Dalek spared you. I think it knew.

626
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:06,843
Your death is fixed,
in time, for ever.

627
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,240
And that's right.

628
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:12,230
You'll die here too.

629
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,320
No.

630
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:15,480
What's gonna save you?

631
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:18,720
Captain Adelaide Brooke.

632
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:34,364
Damn you.

633
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:38,686
Water! We've got water!

634
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:40,262
Captain! Get back!

635
00:42:40,362 --> 00:42:41,520
Get back! Captain!

636
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,439
Don't touch it, Roman. Get back!

637
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:45,324
Get back!

638
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:47,600
We're abandoning this section,
get to the shuttle!

639
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,480
Yuri, lead the way,
Section B Corridor, now.

640
00:42:53,223 --> 00:42:54,720
Get that! And that!

641
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,684
Close it!

642
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:00,275
Yuri, did that water touch you?

643
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,801
- I'm safe...
- Did it touch you?

644
00:43:01,901 --> 00:43:04,561
- Yuri, did that water touch you?
- I'm clean... I'm dry.

645
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:07,160
Everyone, Section B is out.
Listen to me!

646
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,817
Take every pack that you can,
we'll go round,

647
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:12,080
we'll make our way
out through Section F.

648
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:18,708
Go to Section F.
Mia you take the redline stock!

649
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,240
And hurry up!

650
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,138
Steffi, get back!

651
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,853
Steffi, keep back.

652
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:35,760
- Get back!
- Steffi!

653
00:43:36,464 --> 00:43:38,000
Just get back!

654
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,680
- Screen! Use the screen!
- Close the door!

655
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,929
- Steffi, we'll come get you, OK?
- We'll come get you!

656
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,648
- Steffi!
- Captain!

657
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:55,320
We'll open the access panel,
we'll get you out through the back.

658
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,659
Get out of here, move it!

659
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,440
Captain, it's inside!

660
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,874
- Steffi!
- Steffi, get back!

661
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,453
We're coming! Steffi, hold on!

662
00:44:12,585 --> 00:44:14,175
The fuse, Captain.

663
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,369
We can't get through!

664
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:19,560
Don't, please!

665
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,530
I can't move!

666
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:30,534
Hallo, Mutti. Hallo, Mars!

667
00:44:30,865 --> 00:44:32,554
Sag hallo.

668
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:50,545
Ich fragte warum nicht.
Wir koennen doch mit dem Zug...

669
00:44:50,745 --> 00:44:53,400
Steffi! Can you hear me?

670
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:57,680
Oh, my God.

671
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,319
Kannst du doch mit ihm reden?

672
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:07,532
Out! Get out!

673
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,560
Ed, we're going round the long way,
how are we doing?

674
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,123
All systems online, 100%.
Not a single delay!

675
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:33,070
Don't you worry, Captain,
we are gonna fly!

676
00:45:35,991 --> 00:45:38,231
Once again, I need air,
inspection air.

677
00:45:38,481 --> 00:45:40,026
Right now. All of you...

678
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:42,842
Locking chamber three,
locking chamber four...

679
00:45:43,705 --> 00:45:44,694
Keep looking!

680
00:45:44,794 --> 00:45:46,226
Gate five is open!

681
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:48,229
Gate six is open!

682
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:50,720
Quickly, come on!

683
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:57,716
Roman, come on, with me!

684
00:45:58,605 --> 00:45:59,531
You'd better go.

685
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,351
Don't just stand there, move!

686
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:03,604
You'd really better go without me.

687
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,300
I'm sorry, Captain.

688
00:46:08,527 --> 00:46:09,360
One drop.

689
00:46:15,466 --> 00:46:16,440
Roman!

690
00:46:17,743 --> 00:46:18,903
Roman!

691
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:20,840
Leave him, come on.

692
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:24,440
- We can't just leave him!
- Come on.

693
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,480
Let me go! Roma-a-a-a-an!

694
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:42,160
- Captain. The shuttle is down.
- What the hell d'you mean?

695
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:43,549
Compromised.

696
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,158
- It was Maggie.
- Get out of there!

697
00:46:46,728 --> 00:46:47,480
Too late.

698
00:46:49,992 --> 00:46:52,075
They want this ship to get to Earth.

699
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,600
Got no choice.

700
00:46:57,024 --> 00:46:58,600
Hated it, Adelaide.

701
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:02,542
... This bloody job. Ohhhh!

702
00:47:03,293 --> 00:47:05,095
You never gave me a chance.

703
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:15,080
You never could forgive me.

704
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:18,200
See you later.

705
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:46,457
We're losing oxygen!

706
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,059
The hull is broken!

707
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,536
I'm not just a Time Lord,
I'm the Last of the Time Lords.

708
00:48:06,672 --> 00:48:08,725
They'll never come back, not now.

709
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:13,411
I've got a TARDIS.
Same old life, last of the Time Lords.

710
00:48:13,742 --> 00:48:15,643
And they died,
took it all with them.

711
00:48:16,444 --> 00:48:18,974
The walls or reality closed,
the worlds were sealed,

712
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:20,451
gone for ever.

713
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,673
The Time Lords kept their eye
on everything. It's gone now.

714
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:25,397
But they died, the Time Lords!

715
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:27,274
All of them, they died.

716
00:48:27,656 --> 00:48:29,933
I'm the last of the Time Lords.

717
00:48:41,673 --> 00:48:44,339
Mia, take this sealant,
fix that rig!

718
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,819
Yuri, open emergency oxygen.

719
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,200
Adelaide, don't just sit there!

720
00:48:54,677 --> 00:48:57,735
That's better!
The Dome's still got integrity!

721
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:59,168
Ten feet of steel-combination,

722
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:01,401
made in Liverpool,
magnificent workmanship!

723
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:03,420
It can't be stopped.
Don't die with us.

724
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,324
No. Someone told me just recently,
they said I was gonna die,

725
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:09,128
they said, he will knock four times,
and I know what that means,

726
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:11,023
it doesn't mean
right here right now!

727
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:12,981
Cos I don't hear anyone knocking,
do you?!

728
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:19,440
Three knocks is
all you're getting!

729
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,937
Water and electricity, bad mix!

730
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,709
- What else have we got?
- But there's no way to fight them.

731
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:28,510
Heat!

732
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,631
They use water, so we can use heat!

733
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:32,855
Works against the Ice
Warriors and the Flood,

734
00:49:32,955 --> 00:49:34,835
ramp up the environment controls,
steam them!

735
00:49:34,935 --> 00:49:36,510
But you said we die!

736
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:39,539
For the future, for the human race.

737
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:41,878
Yes, because there are laws,
there are Laws of Time.

738
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:46,128
Once upon a time there were people
in charge of those laws, but they died.

739
00:49:46,497 --> 00:49:47,704
They all died.

740
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,013
Do you know who that leaves? Me!

741
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,317
It's taken me all these years to
realise, the Laws of Time are mine.

742
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,888
And they will obey me!

743
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:02,514
Environment controls are down!

744
00:50:02,777 --> 00:50:05,332
Sorry, Doctor,
it looks like history's got other ideas.

745
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,834
Not beaten yet!

746
00:50:07,053 --> 00:50:08,354
I'll go outside!

747
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:09,937
The heat regulator.

748
00:50:11,545 --> 00:50:13,023
No, not beaten, not beaten!

749
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:15,713
You've got spacesuits,
in the next section.

750
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:23,214
We're not just fighting the Flood.
We're fighting time itself.

751
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:25,200
And I'm gonna win!

752
00:50:40,843 --> 00:50:42,777
Something's happening
to the glacier.

753
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:46,086
Thinka thinka thinka think!
What have we got? Not enough oxygen!

754
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,720
Protein-packs? Useless!

755
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,904
Glacier, glacier mints, minty,
Monty, molto bene,

756
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:52,899
bunny, Bonny, bish-bash-bosh!
Baaaaaaah!

757
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:56,600
The room, the room, look at the room!
Section F, what's in Section F?

758
00:50:57,843 --> 00:50:59,057
Anyone?

759
00:50:59,157 --> 00:51:01,960
- Nothing, it's just storage.
- Storing what?

760
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,633
I don't know, weather spikes,
robots, atom clamps.

761
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:09,520
Atom clamps? Atom clamps!?
Who needs atom clamps?

762
00:51:09,976 --> 00:51:11,520
I love a funny robot!

763
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:14,419
Gadget-Gadget.

764
00:51:20,718 --> 00:51:23,089
- You take that. Good boy.
- Gadget-Gadget.

765
00:51:28,892 --> 00:51:31,057
- Off we go then!
- Gadget-Gadget.

766
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,800
Come on, come on!

767
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:51,701
Implementing Captain's protocol.

768
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:53,584
Adelaide? What are you doing?!

769
00:51:54,122 --> 00:51:55,824
Oh, my God. Action Five.

770
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,720
If I have to fight you as well,
then I will.

771
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,899
Nuclear device now
active and primed.

772
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:04,983
Nuclear device now
active and primed.

773
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,860
Blast off!

774
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,200
Gadget-gadget!

775
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,080
Fastaaaaaaaa!...

776
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:52,879
Nuclear device
entering final process.

777
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:01,080
Gadget-gadget!

778
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,800
And we're in!

779
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:31,470
Gadget-gadget!

780
00:54:57,967 --> 00:54:59,400
Isn't anyone going to thank me?

781
00:55:07,743 --> 00:55:08,982
He's lost his signal.

782
00:55:09,176 --> 00:55:10,640
Doesn't know where he is.

783
00:55:12,248 --> 00:55:13,481
That's my house.

784
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,640
Don't you get it?

785
00:55:19,204 --> 00:55:21,440
This is the 21st November 2059.

786
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,772
It's the same day on Earth.

787
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,431
And it's snowing. I love snow.

788
00:55:29,488 --> 00:55:31,127
What is that thing?

789
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:34,480
It's... bigger...

790
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:37,866
I mean, it's bigger on the inside!

791
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,240
Who the hell are you?

792
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:49,864
Look after her.

793
00:55:50,365 --> 00:55:51,391
Yes, ma'am.

794
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,402
You saved us...

795
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:04,360
Just think though...

796
00:56:05,186 --> 00:56:08,400
Your daughter, and your daughter's
daughter, you can see them again.

797
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:11,010
Family reunion!

798
00:56:11,179 --> 00:56:12,574
But I'm supposed to be dead.

799
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:14,920
Not any more.

800
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:16,872
But...

801
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:18,781
Susie...

802
00:56:20,952 --> 00:56:22,280
My granddaughter.

803
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:25,435
The person she's
supposed to become...

804
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:28,807
... might never exist now.

805
00:56:28,907 --> 00:56:32,160
Nah! Captain Adelaide can
inspire her face to face.

806
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:34,306
Different details,
but the story's the same.

807
00:56:34,406 --> 00:56:35,914
You can't know that.

808
00:56:36,502 --> 00:56:38,440
And if my family changes...

809
00:56:40,187 --> 00:56:42,101
... The whole of history could change,

810
00:56:42,877 --> 00:56:44,520
the future of the human race.

811
00:56:44,766 --> 00:56:46,720
No-one should have that much power.

812
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:48,245
Tough.

813
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:58,960
You should have left us there.

814
00:57:00,374 --> 00:57:02,373
Adelaide,
I've done this sort of thing before.

815
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:05,040
In small ways,
saved some little people.

816
00:57:06,645 --> 00:57:09,535
But never someone as important as you.
Oh, I'm good!

817
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,187
Little people?

818
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:13,360
What, like Mia and Yuri?

819
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,360
Who decides they're
so unimportant? You?

820
00:57:17,494 --> 00:57:20,435
For a long time now, I thought
I was just a survivor, but I'm not.

821
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:23,600
I'm the winner.

822
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:25,600
That's who I am.

823
00:57:27,888 --> 00:57:29,395
The Time Lord Victorious.

824
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,982
And there's no-one to stop you?

825
00:57:37,017 --> 00:57:37,621
No.

826
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,696
This is wrong, Doctor.

827
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:45,840
I don't care who you are.
The Time Lord Victorious is wrong.

828
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:47,640
That's for me to decide.

829
00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:52,720
Now, you'd better get home.

830
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,581
Oh, it's all locked up,
you've been away.

831
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,440
Still, that's easy.

832
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:05,640
All yours.

833
00:58:07,994 --> 00:58:09,790
Is there nothing you can't do?

834
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:12,161
Not any more.

835
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:29,023
I don't care who you are.

836
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:31,763
A Time Lord Victorious is wrong.

837
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:45,219
I've gone too far.

838
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:55,880
Is this it?

839
00:59:58,231 --> 00:59:59,226
My death?

840
01:00:03,856 --> 01:00:05,026
Is it time?

841
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:46,720
No.

842
01:00:56,963 --> 01:00:59,878
Every night, Doctor,
we have bad dreams.

843
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:03,113
But I was told,
he will knock four times.

844
01:01:03,632 --> 01:01:06,380
Because a shadow is
falling over creation.

845
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,145
Something vast is
stirring in the dark.

846
01:01:09,339 --> 01:01:10,897
I'm going to die.

847
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,452
My name is the Master.

848
01:01:19,578 --> 01:01:21,880
The darkness heralds
only one thing...

849
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,600
The end of Time itself.

850
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:01,459
