1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,520
<i>The Pandorica's opening.</i>

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,600
- What is it?
- Box, cage, prison?

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,730
<i>It was built to contain the most
feared thing in all the universe.</i>

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,440
<i>Anything that powerful,
I'd know about it.</i> Why don't I know?

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,880
<i>Everything that ever hated you
is coming here tonight.</i>

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,720
<i>They're all here, all of them.
All for you. What could you possibly be?</i>

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,280
<i>If something can be remembered,
it can come back.</i>

8
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:21,680
Hello, Amy.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,880
<i>But you died.</i>
How can you be here?

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,366
- What's your name?
- Rory.

11
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:27,680
- How can she not remember me?
- 'Cos you never existed.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,680
Who are those Romans?

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,480
They're not real. <i>They can't be.
They're all in a book in Amy's house.</i>

14
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:34,280
<i>It's a trap.</i> It has to be.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,320
<i>Plastic Romans.</i>

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,360
Duplicates!

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,117
<i>Listen to me, you have to run.
I'm a thing.</i>

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,760
I'll kill you. Just go!

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,640
<i>There's something wrong with
the TARDIS. Something is controlling it.</i>

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
<i>26 June 2010.</i>

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,160
<i>A scenario was devised</i>

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,800
<i>from the memories of your companion.</i>

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Rory Williams from Leadworth.

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,280
My boyfriend.
How could I ever forget you?

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,880
<i>The cracks in time
are the work of The Doctor.</i>

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,881
The Pandorica is ready.

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,728
Ready for what?

28
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:07,183
<i>Ready for you.</i>

29
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:10,480
Every sun will supernova
at every moment in history.

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,920
The whole universe will
never have existed!

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,656
Listen to me!

32
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:57,504
<i>Dear Santa.</i>

33
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,898
<i>Thank you for the dolls
and pencils and the fish.</i>

34
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>It's Easter now, so I hope
I don't wake you,</i>

35
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:08,989
but, honest, it is an emergency.

36
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,092
There's a crack in my wall.

37
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,916
Aunt Sharon says it's just an
ordinary crack, but

38
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:20,880
I know it's not,
cos at night, there's voices.

39
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:24,781
So, please, please, could you
send someone to fix it.

40
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:27,935
Or a policeman. Or...

41
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,640
Back in a moment.

42
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,412
It's a lovely painting, Amelia.

43
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,168
And what are all these?

44
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:08,121
Stars.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,870
Oh, Amelia!

46
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,440
Tell you what,

47
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:14,614
shall we go outside?

48
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:19,692
What do you see, Amelia?

49
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:21,956
The moon.

50
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,508
And what else?

51
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,280
Just the dark.

52
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:27,563
But no stars.

53
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,469
If there were stars up there, we'd
be able to see them, wouldn't we?

54
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:35,174
Amelia, look at me.

55
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:40,321
You know this is all just
a story, don't you?

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,711
You know there's no such thing
as stars.

57
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,126
<i>It's quite common, actually.</i>

58
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:03,166
<i>Throughout history, people have
talked about stars in the sky.</i>

59
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,821
<i>God knows where it comes from.</i>

60
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:08,304
<i>I just don't want her growing up and
joining one of those Star Cults.</i>

61
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:10,376
<i>I don't trust that Richard Dawkins.</i>

62
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,200
Come on, Aunt Sharon.

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,760
- Look at that! That's good, isn't it?
- Not that! This way.

64
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:59,680
- But we're not looking at anything.
- This way!

65
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:58,034
<i>Amelia Pond, please go to
the reception, please.</i>

66
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,066
<i>Your aunt is waiting for you there.</i>

67
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:11,370
Sorry.

68
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,570
OK, kid.

69
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:35,002
This is where it gets complicated.

76
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,280
So the universe ended.

77
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:24,240
You missed that.

78
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,444
In 102 AD.

79
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:33,744
I suppose this means you and I
never get born at all.

80
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,075
Twice, in my case.

81
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:44,815
You would have laughed at that.

82
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:49,553
Please laugh!

83
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,712
The Doctor said the universe
was huge and ridiculous,

84
00:08:57,832 --> 00:08:59,906
and sometimes there were miracles.

85
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:06,989
I could do with
a ridiculous miracle about now.

86
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,040
Rory! Listen, she's not dead.

87
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,800
Well, she is dead, but it's not
the end of the world.

88
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,224
Well, it is.

89
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,800
Actually, it's the end of
the universe. Oh, no. Hang on!

90
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,787
You need to get me out
of the Pandorica.

91
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,400
You're not in the Pandorica.

92
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,610
Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now,
but I was back then.

93
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,440
Well, back now from your point
of view,

94
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,284
which is back then
from my point of view.

95
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,400
Time travel, can't keep it
straight in your head.

96
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,280
It's easy to open from the
outside - just point and press.

97
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:39,119
Now go.

98
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,728
Oh, when you're done, leave
my screwdriver in her top pocket.

99
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:48,840
Good luck!

100
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,040
What do you mean?

101
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:52,876
Done what?

102
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,287
How did you do that?

103
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:07,600
You gave me this.

104
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:11,240
- No, I didn't.
- You did. Look at it.

105
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:24,200
Temporal energy. Same screwdriver, at
different points in its own time stream.

106
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,210
Which means it was me who gave it
to you. Me from the future.

107
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,080
I've got a future, that's nice.

108
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:30,960
That's not.

109
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:34,840
Yeah. What are they?

110
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:37,440
History has collapsed.

111
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:41,107
Whole races have been deleted
from existence.

112
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:43,480
These are just like after-images.

113
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:46,360
Echoes,

114
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:49,714
fossils in time.
The footprints of the never-were.

115
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,360
Er, what does that mean?

116
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,320
Total event collapse. The universe
literally never happened.

117
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:56,651
So, how can we be here?
What's keeping us safe?

118
00:10:56,771 --> 00:11:00,160
Nothing. Eye of the storm, that's all.
We're just the last light to go out.

119
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:04,751
Where's Amy?

120
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:08,792
I killed her.

121
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:11,943
Oh, Rory!

122
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:14,865
What am I?

123
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:16,840
You're a Nestene duplicate.

124
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,200
A lump of plastic
with delusions of humanity.

125
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:22,200
But I'm Rory now.

126
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,896
Whatever was happening,
it's stopped. I'm Rory!

127
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,331
That's software talking.

128
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,240
Can you help her?
Is there anything you can do?

129
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,614
Probably, if I had the time.

130
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,010
The time?!

131
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,608
All of creation has just been
wiped from the sky.

132
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:41,090
Do you know how many lives
now never happened?

133
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,891
All the people who never lived?

134
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:47,221
Your girlfriend isn't more
important than the whole universe.

135
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:50,741
She is to me!

136
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:55,973
Welcome back, Rory Williams!

137
00:11:57,914 --> 00:12:01,040
Sorry, had to be sure. Hell of a
gun-arm you're packing there.

138
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,928
Right, we need
to get her downstairs.

139
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:04,749
And take that look
off your plastic face.

140
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:06,537
You're getting
married in the morning!

141
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:14,600
- So you've got a plan, then?
- Bit of a plan, yeah.

142
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,478
Memories are more powerful
than you think,

143
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:19,275
and Amy Pond
is not an ordinary girl.

144
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,480
Grew up with a time crack in her
wall.

145
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,840
The universe pouring through
her dreams every night.

146
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,218
The Nestenes took a memory print of her
and got more than they bargained for.

147
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,644
Like you. Not just your face,
but your heart and your soul.

148
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:36,935
I'm leaving her a message,
so she knows what's happening.

149
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,219
- What are you doing?
- Saving her.

150
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,856
This is the ultimate prison.

151
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,560
You can't even escape by dying.
It forces you to stay alive.

152
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,980
But she's already dead.

153
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,339
Mostly dead. The Pandorica can
stasis-lock her that way.

154
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:55,802
All it needs is a scan of her living
DNA and it'll restore her.

155
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:59,200
- Where's it going to get that?
- In about 2,000 years.

156
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:05,706
Are you all right?

157
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,820
Who are you?

158
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:12,160
I'm... fine.
I'm supposed to...

159
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,516
rest. Got to rest, the Doctor says.

160
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:15,920
What doctor?

161
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,245
He's in here. Left a message
in my head like I'm an answerphone.

162
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,693
Where am I?

163
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:25,960
Hang on, national museum, right?
I was here once when I was a little...

164
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,960
Yeah, complicated.

165
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:31,739
Let's see, it's what...

166
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:35,680
1996?

167
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:38,810
Who are you?

168
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,348
It's a long story.

169
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,761
A very long story.

170
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:52,667
She's going to be in that box
for 2,000 years?!

171
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:54,823
Yeah, but we're taking a shortcut.

172
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:56,829
River's vortex manipulator.

173
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,093
Rubbish way to time travel, but
the universe is tiny now. We'll be fine.

174
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,329
So the future's still there, then?
Our world?

175
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,120
A version of it.
Not quite the one you know.

176
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,965
Earth alone in the sky.
Let's go and have a look.

177
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,213
You put your hand there.

178
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,080
Don't worry, should be safe.

179
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:15,594
That's not what I'm worried about.

180
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,089
She'll be fine.

181
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,111
Nothing can get into this box.

182
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,333
- You got in there.
- There's only one of me. I counted.

183
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,760
This box needs a guard.
I killed the last one.

184
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:31,138
- Don't even think about it.
- She'll be alone.

185
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:33,200
- She won't feel it.
- You bet she won't!

186
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,620
2,000 years. You won't even sleep,
you'd be conscious every second.

187
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,188
It would drive you...

188
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:39,559
mad.

189
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,276
Will she be safer if I stay?

190
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,141
Look me in the eye
and tell me she wouldn't be safer.

191
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:48,832
Answer me!

192
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:53,943
Yes.

193
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:55,880
Obviously.

194
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:58,400
Then how could I leave her?

195
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:02,158
Why do you have to be so...

196
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:05,392
human?

197
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:08,919
Because right now, I'm not.

198
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,465
Listen to me.

199
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,085
This is the last bit of advice you're
going to get in a very long time.

200
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:22,290
You're living plastic, but not immortal.
I have no idea how long you'll last.

201
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,266
And you're not indestructible.
Stay away from heat and radio signals.

202
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:28,920
You can't heal, or repair yourself.
Any damages are permanent.

203
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,160
So, for God's sake, however bored
you get, stay out of...

204
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,100
<i>According to legend,</i>

205
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,680
<i>wherever the Pandorica was taken,
throughout its long history,</i>

206
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,218
<i>the Centurion would be there,
guarding it.</i>

207
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,358
<i>He appears as an iconic image
in the artwork of many cultures,</i>

208
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:03,440
<i>and there are several documented
accounts of his appearances</i>

209
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,665
<i>and his warnings</i>

210
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:08,174
<i>to the many who attempted
to open he box before its time.</i>

211
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:10,599
<i>His last recorded appearance</i>

212
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,520
<i>was during the London blitz in 1941.</i>

213
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,499
<i>The warehouse
where the Pandorica was stored</i>

214
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,230
<i>was destroyed by incendiary bombs,</i>

215
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,579
<i>but the box itself</i>

216
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:25,040
<i>was found the next morning,
a safe distance from the blaze.</i>

217
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:28,272
<i>There are eyewitness accounts
from the night of the fire</i>

218
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:31,464
<i>of a figure in Roman dress,
carrying the box</i>

219
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:32,884
<i>from the flames.</i>

220
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:37,040
<i>Since then, there have been
no sightings of the Lone Centurion,</i>

221
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:39,138
<i>and many have speculated</i>

222
00:16:39,258 --> 00:16:41,114
<i>that if he ever existed,</i>

223
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,486
<i>he perished in the fires
of that night,</i>

224
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,753
<i>performing one last act of devotion</i>

225
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:48,228
<i>to the box he had pledged to protect</i>

226
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:50,518
<i>for nearly 2,000 years.</i>

227
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:51,979
Rory...

228
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,283
<i>Exterminate!</i>

229
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:57,528
What's that?

230
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,259
... of trouble.

231
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:05,400
Two of you? Complicated.

232
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,660
<i>Exterminate!</i>

233
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:10,215
<i>Weapons systems restoring.</i>

234
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:11,444
Come along, Ponds.

235
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,837
Exterminate!

236
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,587
What are we doing?

237
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:18,760
Running into a dead end,
where I'll have a brilliant plan,

238
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,536
that involves not being in one.

239
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:21,840
What's going on?

240
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,723
Get out of here. Go! Just run!

241
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,840
- <i>Drop the device!</i>
- It's not a weapon.

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,760
Scan it. It's not a weapon,
and you don't have the power to waste!

243
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,400
<i>Scans indicate</i>

244
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,730
<i>intruder unarmed.</i>

245
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:35,600
Do you think?

246
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:43,240
<i>Vision impaired! Vision...</i>

247
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:59,067
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I couldn't help it.

248
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:00,877
- It just happened.
- Shut up.

249
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,998
Yeah, shut up, cos we've got to go.
Come on!

250
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,181
I waited.

251
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:07,454
2,000 years, I waited for you.

252
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:08,877
No, still shut up.

253
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,675
And break!

254
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:13,895
And breathe!

255
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:16,784
Well, somebody didn't get out much
for 2,000 years.

256
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:21,080
I'm thirsty. Can I get a drink?

257
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,640
It's all mouths today, isn't it?

258
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:28,432
The light!

259
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,850
The light from the Pandorica,

260
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,653
it must have hit the Dalek.

261
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:37,698
Out, out, out!

262
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,840
2,000 years. How did you do?

263
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,401
Kept out of trouble.

264
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:52,377
How?

265
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,765
Unsuccessfully.

266
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:55,434
The mop!

267
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,716
That's how you looked
all those years ago

268
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,342
when you gave me the sonic.

269
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:01,004
No time to lose then.

270
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,969
Listen, she's not dead.

271
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:08,479
Well, she is dead, but it's not
the end of the world.

272
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,120
Oops, sorry.

273
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,040
How can he do that? Is he magic?

274
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:17,045
You need to get me out
of the Pandorica.

275
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:18,739
- You're not in there.
- Yes, I am.

276
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,360
I'm not now. But I was back then.

277
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:23,182
Right, let's go then.

278
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:25,215
Wait!

279
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:29,186
Now I don't have the sonic,
I just gave it Rory 2,000 years ago.

280
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,760
And when you're done,
leave my screwdriver in her top pocket.

281
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,610
Right then.

282
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,133
Off we go!

283
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:41,770
No, hang on, hang on.

284
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,188
How did you know...

285
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,030
to come here?

286
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:50,326
My handwriting.

287
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:05,863
There you go, drink up!

288
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,880
What is that?
How are you doing that?

289
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,188
Vortex manipulator, cheap
and nasty time travel.

290
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,356
Very bad for you.
I'm trying to give it up.

291
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,200
- Where are we going?
- The roof.

292
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,280
Doctor, it's you.

293
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:30,015
How can it be you?

294
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:31,600
Doctor, is that you?

295
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,932
Yeah, it's me.

296
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,400
Me from the future.

297
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,349
Are you...

298
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,261
I mean, is he...

299
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:56,347
Is he dead?

300
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,200
What?

301
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,399
Dead? Yes, yes. Of course he's dead.

302
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,727
Right, I've got 12 minutes,
that's good.

303
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:08,891
12 minutes to live?
How is that good?

304
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,404
You can do loads in 12 minutes,

305
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:12,360
suck a mint, buy a sledge,
have a fast bath.

306
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,526
The roof!

307
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,440
- We can't leave you here, dead.
- Oh, good!

308
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,862
Are you in charge now? So, tell me,
what are we going to do about Amelia?

309
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,298
Where did she go?

310
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:28,838
There is no Amelia.

311
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,680
From now on, there never was.
History is still collapsing.

312
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,320
- How can I be here, if she's not?
- You're an anomaly.

313
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,040
We all are. We're hanging on at the eye
of the storm, but the eye is closing,

314
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,840
and if we don't do something,
reality will never have happened.

315
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:44,480
Today, just dying is a result.
Now, come on!

316
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,520
He won't die.

317
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:50,283
Time can be rewritten.
He'll find a way.

318
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:51,464
I know he will.

319
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:53,240
Move it. Come on!

320
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,684
<i>Restore!</i>

321
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:22,477
What, it's morning already?
How did that happen?

322
00:22:22,597 --> 00:22:25,160
History is shrinking.
Is anybody listening to me?

323
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:26,860
Universe is collapsing.

324
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,160
- We don't have much time left.
- What are you doing?

325
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,041
- Looking for the TARDIS.
- But the TARDIS exploded.

326
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:34,018
Then I'm looking for
an exploding TARDIS.

327
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:35,560
I don't understand.

328
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,657
The TARDIS blew up
and took the universe with it.

329
00:22:37,777 --> 00:22:39,432
Why would it do that? How?

330
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,344
Good question for another day.
But for now...

331
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:44,250
total event collapse
means that every star

332
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,998
in the universe never happened.
Not one of them ever shone.

333
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:50,009
So, if all the stars that ever were
are gone, then what...

334
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:52,076
is that?

335
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:57,318
Like I said, I'm looking for
an exploding TARDIS.

336
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,589
- But that's the sun.
- Is it?

337
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,367
Here's the noise
that sun is making right now.

338
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:08,719
That's my TARDIS burning up.

339
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,641
That's what's been keeping
the Earth warm.

340
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:15,120
Doctor, there's something else.

341
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:17,510
There's a voice.

342
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,384
- I can't hear anything.
- Trust the plastic.

343
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:25,520
<i>I'm sorry, my love.</i>

344
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,268
Doctor, that's River.

345
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:28,840
How can she be up there?

346
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:32,464
- It must be a recording or something.
- No, it's not.

347
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:34,430
Emergency protocols,
the TARDIS has sealed off

348
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,061
the control room and put her
into a time loop to save her.

349
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,339
She is right

350
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,440
- at the heart of the explosion.
- <i>I'm sorry, my love.</i>

351
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:42,000
<i>I'm sorry, my love.</i>

352
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,698
I'm sorry, my love.

353
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,734
I'm sorry, my love.

354
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:17,040
Hi, honey. I'm home.

355
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:20,363
And what sort of time
do you call this?

356
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,941
- And the plastic Centurion?
- It's OK, he's on our side.

357
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:30,148
Really?
I dated a Nestene duplicate once,

358
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,600
swappable head,
it did keep things fresh.

359
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,919
Right then, I have questions.

360
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,606
But number one is this,

361
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,640
what in the name of sanity
have you got on your head?

362
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,889
It's a fez. I wear a fez now.
Fezes are cool.

363
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,600
<i>Exterminate!</i>

364
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:55,220
Run, move. Go! Come on!

365
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,130
Doctor, come on.

366
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,164
It's moving away,
finding another way in.

367
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:13,472
It needs to restore its power
before it can attack again.

368
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:16,953
Now, that means we've got exactly
four and a half minutes

369
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:19,294
- before it's at lethal capacity.
- How do you know?

370
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:21,418
Because that's when it's due
to kill me.

371
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:24,520
- Kill you? What do you mean, kill you?
- Sshut up, never mind.

372
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
How can that Dalek even exist?

373
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,122
It was erased from time
and then it came back. How?

374
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:30,748
You said the light
from the Pandorica...

375
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:33,761
It's not a light, it's a restoration
field, but never mind.

376
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:35,004
Call it a light.

377
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:37,880
That light brought Amy back,
but how could it bring back

378
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,232
a Dalek when the Daleks
have never existed?

379
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,964
OK, tell us.

380
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:46,703
When the Tardis blew up, it caused a
total event collapse. A time explosion.

381
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:49,705
It blasted every atom
in every moment of the universe.

382
00:25:49,825 --> 00:25:50,825
Except...

383
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:54,800
Except inside the Pandorica.

384
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,390
The perfect prison.
Inside it, perfectly preserved,

385
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,565
a few billion atoms
of the universe as it was.

386
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:03,276
In theory, you could extrapolate the
whole universe from a single one of them,

387
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:07,055
like cloning a body from a single cell.
And we've got the bumper family pack.

388
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:08,965
No, too fast, I'm not getting it.

389
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:11,941
The box contains a memory of
the universe,

390
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:13,575
and the light transmits the memory.

391
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:16,080
- And that's how we're going to do it.
- Do what?

392
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,351
Relight the fire.
Reboot the universe.

393
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:21,960
Come on!

394
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:25,200
Doctor, you're being
completely ridiculous.

395
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,373
The Pandorica partially restored
one Dalek.

396
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,921
If it can't even reboot
a single life form properly,

397
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,786
how will it reboot
the whole of reality?

398
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:35,168
What if we give it a moment
of infinite power?

399
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:38,207
Transmit the light
from the Pandorica to every particle

400
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:39,940
of space and time simultaneously?

401
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,467
That would be lovely, dear, but we can't,
because it's completely impossible.

402
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:47,775
No, you see, it's not.
It's almost completely impossible.

403
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,832
- One spark is all we need.
- For what?

404
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:53,960
Big Bang Two! Now listen...

405
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,873
- <i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>
- Get back. River, get back now!

406
00:26:59,106 --> 00:27:00,440
<i>Exterminate!</i>

407
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,720
Doctor, it's me, River.
Can you hear me?

408
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:10,600
What is it? What do you need?

409
00:27:12,478 --> 00:27:13,440
Where did he go?

410
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,415
- Damn it, he could be anywhere.
- He went downstairs.

411
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:19,666
- 12 minutes ago.
- Show me!

412
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:22,456
He died.

413
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:26,360
<i>Systems restoring!</i>

414
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,381
<i>You will be exterminated!</i>

415
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,716
We've got to move.
That thing's coming back to life.

416
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,240
You go to the Doctor.
I'll be right with you.

417
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,400
<i>You will be exterminated!</i>

418
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:45,353
Not yet,
your systems are still restoring.

419
00:27:45,473 --> 00:27:48,542
Which means your shield density
is compromised.

420
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,240
One Alpha Mezon burst through your
eyestalk

421
00:27:52,702 --> 00:27:54,233
would kill you stone dead.

422
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:57,919
<i>Records indicate
you will show mercy.</i>

423
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,574
<i>You are an associate
of the Doctor's.</i>

424
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:04,080
I'm River Song.
Check your records again.

425
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:06,880
<i>Mercy!</i>

426
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,720
- Say it again.
- <i>Mercy!</i>

427
00:28:10,006 --> 00:28:11,800
One more time.

428
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:13,039
<i>Mercy!</i>

429
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,338
How could he have moved?
He was dead!

430
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:26,969
But he was dead!

431
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:28,428
Who told you that?

432
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:31,440
- He did.
- Rule one. The Doctor lies.

433
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:34,835
- Where's the Dalek?
- It died.

434
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:46,120
Why did he tell us he was dead?

435
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:48,760
We were a diversion.

436
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,484
Long as the Dalek was chasing us,
he could work down here.

437
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,280
Can you hear me?
What were you doing?

438
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:05,680
- What's happening?
- Reality's collapsing.

439
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,640
It's speeding up. Look at this room.

440
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:12,928
- Where did everything go?
- History is being erased.

441
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:16,830
Time is running out. Doctor,
what were you doing? Tell us!

442
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:27,440
Big... Bang... Two.

443
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:31,737
The Big Bang. That's the beginning
of the universe, right?

444
00:29:32,907 --> 00:29:35,600
What, and Big Bang Two is the bang
that brings it back?

445
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,320
Is that what you mean?

446
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,181
What?

447
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:42,624
The Tardis is still burning.

448
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:44,880
It's exploding at every point
in history.

449
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:48,244
If you threw the Pandorica
into the explosion,

450
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:50,641
- right into the heart of the fire...
- Then what?

451
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:53,175
Then let there be light.

452
00:29:54,073 --> 00:29:57,894
The light from the Pandorica would
explode everywhere at once,

453
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:01,840
- just like he said.
- That would work?

454
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,520
That would bring everything back?

455
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,440
A restoration field, powered
by an exploding Tardis,

456
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,240
happening at every moment
in history.

457
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,160
That's brilliant.
It might even work!

458
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,069
He's wired the vortex manipulator
to the rest of the box.

459
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,440
Why?

460
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:22,520
So he can take it with him.

461
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,558
He's going to fly the Pandorica
into the heart of the explosion.

462
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,494
- Are you OK?
- Are you?

463
00:30:45,222 --> 00:30:46,346
Shut up then!

464
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:55,640
Amy... He wants to talk to you.

465
00:30:56,846 --> 00:31:00,600
So, what happens here? Big Bang Two?
What happens to us?

466
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:03,184
We all wake up where we ought to be.

467
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:05,640
None of this ever happens
and we don't remember it.

468
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:10,720
Tell me he comes back, too.

469
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:14,525
The Doctor will be the heart
of the explosion.

470
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,840
So all the cracks in time
will close,

471
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:21,228
but he'll be on the wrong side,

472
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:24,040
trapped in the never-space,
the void between the worlds.

473
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:27,446
All memory of him will be
purged from the universe.

474
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:30,560
He will never have been born.

475
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,158
Now, please.

476
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:36,941
He wants to talk to you
before he goes.

477
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,037
Not to you?

478
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:40,810
He doesn't really know me yet.

479
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,437
Now he never will.

480
00:32:06,911 --> 00:32:07,643
Hi.

481
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:17,880
The girl who waited.

482
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:20,720
All night in your garden.

483
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,440
- Was it worth it?
- Shut up. Of course it was.

484
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:30,400
You asked me why I was taking you
with me and I said...

485
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:32,292
"No reason."

486
00:32:34,707 --> 00:32:36,951
- I was lying.
- It's not important.

487
00:32:37,236 --> 00:32:40,199
Yeah, it's the most important thing
left in the universe.

488
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:43,419
It's why I'm doing this.

489
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:47,720
Amy, your house was too big.

490
00:32:48,328 --> 00:32:51,335
That big, empty house.

491
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:53,920
- And just you.
- And Aunt Sharon.

492
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,400
Where were your mum and dad?
Where was...

493
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,560
everybody who lived in
that big house?

494
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:03,480
- I lost my Mum and Dad.
- How?

495
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,920
What happened to them?

496
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,479
Where did they go? I...

497
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:13,480
- I don't...
- It's OK. Don't panic.

498
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,000
It's not your fault.

499
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:18,468
I don't even remember.

500
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,682
There was a crack in time
in the wall of your bedroom.

501
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:24,170
And it's been eating away

502
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,560
at your life for a long time now.

503
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:30,668
All alone.

504
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,558
The girl who didn't make sense.

505
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:37,310
How could I resist?

506
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,213
How could I just forget?

507
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,878
Nothing is ever forgotten,

508
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
not really.

509
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,317
But you have to try.

510
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
<i>Doctor! It's speeding up!</i>

511
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:58,554
There's going to be a very big bang.
Big Bang Two.

512
00:33:58,674 --> 00:34:00,845
Try and remember your family
and they'll be there.

513
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:03,080
How can I remember them
if they never existed?

514
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,377
Because you're special.

515
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:08,727
That crack in your wall,
all that time,

516
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,360
the universe pouring into your head.

517
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,490
You brought Rory back -
you can bring them back, too.

518
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,530
You just remember

519
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,113
and they'll be there.

520
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:22,240
You won't.

521
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,978
You'll have your family back.

522
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:27,764
You won't need your imaginary friend
any more.

523
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,200
Crying over me.

524
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:37,600
- Guess what?
- What?

525
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:39,782
Gotcha.

526
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,866
Back! Get back!

527
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,755
It's from the Doctor.

528
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:07,490
What does it say?

529
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,044
"Geronimo."

530
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:07,486
I escaped, then. Brilliant!

531
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:09,320
Love it when I do that.

532
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:12,121
Legs, yes.

533
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,115
Bow tie, cool.

534
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:16,495
I can buy a fez.

535
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:18,773
<i>The beach. The beach is the best.</i>

536
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:20,373
<i>Automatic sand.</i>

537
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:21,640
<i>Automatic sand?</i>

538
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,987
<i>What does that mean?</i>

539
00:36:23,107 --> 00:36:24,654
<i>It's automated, totally.</i>

540
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,840
<i>Cleans up the lolly sticks...</i>

541
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,526
No, hang on! That's last week
when we went to Space Florida.

542
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:32,080
I'm rewinding.

543
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,627
My time stream - unravelling,

544
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:36,476
erasing.

545
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:39,899
Closing.

546
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:45,116
Hello, universe.

547
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:48,172
Goodbye, Doctor.

548
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:15,335
Ah, three weeks ago, when she put
the card in the window.

549
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:17,705
I need to tell you something.

550
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,119
She can hear me.
But if she can hear me...

551
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,320
<i>Good luck, everyone. Behave.
Do not let that girl open her eyes.</i>

552
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,124
<i>Amy, later! River, going to need
your computer.</i>

553
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:48,612
Amy, you need to start trusting me.
It's never been more important.

554
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:50,880
But you don't always
tell me the truth.

555
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,680
If I always told you the truth,
I wouldn't need you to trust me.

556
00:37:54,784 --> 00:37:57,815
Doctor, the crack in my wall.

557
00:37:58,723 --> 00:37:59,880
How can it be here?

558
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,760
I don't know yet
but I'm working it out.

559
00:38:07,923 --> 00:38:09,036
Now, listen.

560
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,579
Remember what I told you when you
were seven?

561
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:12,934
What did you tell me?

562
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,802
That's not the point.

563
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:21,691
You have to remember.

564
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:29,235
Remember what?

565
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:41,059
Amelia's house.

566
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,008
When she was seven.

567
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:47,820
The night she waited.

568
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,300
The girl who waited.

569
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,034
Come here, you.

570
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,533
It's funny.

571
00:39:30,978 --> 00:39:33,826
I thought if you could hear me,
I could hang on somehow.

572
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:36,676
Silly me.

573
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:39,656
Silly old Doctor.

574
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:47,521
When you wake up,

575
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,456
you'll have a mum and dad...

576
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,118
And you won't even remember me.

577
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:57,685
Well, you'll remember me a little.

578
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:01,432
I'll be a story in your head.

579
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:04,195
But that's OK.

580
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,116
We're all stories in the end.

581
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:10,818
Just make it a good one, eh?

582
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:12,890
Cos it was, you know.

583
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,240
It was the best.

584
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,297
A daft old man

585
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:22,160
who stole a magic box

586
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:24,261
and ran away.

587
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,854
Did I ever tell you that I stole it?

588
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:32,160
Well, I borrowed it.
I was always going to take it back.

589
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,863
Oh, that box, Amy.

590
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,509
You'll dream about that box.

591
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:44,749
It'll never leave you.

592
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:49,796
Big and little at the same time.

593
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,146
Brand new and ancient.

594
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:57,218
And the bluest blue ever.

595
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,840
And the times we had?

596
00:41:02,316 --> 00:41:03,401
Would've had...

597
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,009
Never had.

598
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:10,840
In your dreams,
they'll still be there.

599
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:16,836
The Doctor and Amy Pond.

600
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,516
And the days that never came.

601
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:31,440
The cracks are closing.

602
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:38,710
But they can't close properly
until I'm on the other side.

603
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,161
I don't belong here any more.

604
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,582
I think I'll skip
the rest of the rewind.

605
00:41:56,544 --> 00:41:57,696
I hate repeats.

606
00:42:01,523 --> 00:42:04,400
Live well. Love Rory.

607
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,403
Bye bye, Pond.

608
00:43:23,974 --> 00:43:25,723
Morning!

609
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:29,520
You're my mum.

610
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,880
- Oh, my God. You're my mum.
- Well, of course I'm your mum.

611
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,435
What's the matter with you?
And this is your breakfast,

612
00:43:35,555 --> 00:43:36,811
which your father made,

613
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:39,280
so feel free to tip it out of
the window if it's an atrocity.

614
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,166
Downstairs, 10 minutes? Big day!

615
00:43:44,965 --> 00:43:48,030
Of course she's my mum.
Why is that surprising?

616
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,560
I fear I may have been using
the same joke book as the best man.

617
00:43:58,934 --> 00:44:00,452
You're my tiny little dad!

618
00:44:00,814 --> 00:44:03,800
Amelia, why are you behaving as if
you've never seen us before?

619
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:05,850
I don't know. It's just...

620
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:10,456
Hello!

621
00:44:10,576 --> 00:44:13,120
<i>Do you feel like you've forgotten
something really important?'</i>

622
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,834
Do you feel like there's
a great big thing in your head,

623
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,440
and you feel like
you should remember it, but you can't?

624
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,658
Are you just saying yes
cos you're scared of me?

625
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:26,521
I love you.

626
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:28,919
I mean, I love you too!

627
00:44:52,452 --> 00:44:56,155
Ladies and gentlemen,
the father of the bride, Augustus Pond!

628
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:03,960
Sorry, everyone. I'll be another

629
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,178
two minutes.

630
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,967
I'm just reviewing certain aspects.

631
00:45:09,549 --> 00:45:11,200
Your father, Amelia, will be

632
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,720
the absolute death of me. Unless,
of course, I strike pre-emptively.

633
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,440
You OK?

634
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,155
I'm fine.

635
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:36,663
Right.

636
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,847
You're crying.

637
00:45:40,725 --> 00:45:42,671
So I am. Why am I doing that?

638
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:44,815
Because you're

639
00:45:45,406 --> 00:45:46,871
happy, probably.

640
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:50,129
Happy Mrs Rory. Happy, happy, happy.

641
00:45:51,377 --> 00:45:52,396
I'm sad.

642
00:45:53,655 --> 00:45:54,920
I'm really, really sad.

643
00:45:56,022 --> 00:45:57,022
Great.

644
00:45:57,405 --> 00:45:58,483
Why am I sad?

645
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:01,522
What's that?

646
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:04,920
Someone left it for you.

647
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:07,979
- A woman.
- But what is it?

648
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,720
- It's a book.
- It's blank.

649
00:46:10,991 --> 00:46:12,795
- It's a present.
- But why?

650
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:15,057
You know the old saying.

651
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,240
The old...

652
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:18,822
wedding...

653
00:46:19,169 --> 00:46:20,169
thing.

654
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:35,238
Ready now.

655
00:46:37,179 --> 00:46:38,550
Sorry about that.

656
00:46:38,948 --> 00:46:41,320
Last-minute adjustments
to certain aspects.

657
00:47:06,997 --> 00:47:08,216
Shut up, Dad!

658
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,240
Shut up, please!

659
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:12,000
There's someone missing,

660
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:14,344
someone important.
Someone so,

661
00:47:14,813 --> 00:47:15,973
so important.

662
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:18,141
- Amy, what's wrong?
- Sorry.

663
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:20,625
Sorry, everyone.

664
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,800
But when I was a kid,
I had an imaginary friend.

665
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:28,040
- No, not this again.
- The raggedy Doctor.

666
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,911
My raggedy Doctor.

667
00:47:31,325 --> 00:47:32,755
But he wasn't imaginary.

668
00:47:34,442 --> 00:47:35,480
He was real.

669
00:47:36,868 --> 00:47:39,399
- The psychiatrists we sent her to!
- I remember you!

670
00:47:41,016 --> 00:47:42,211
I remember!

671
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,280
I brought the others back,
I can bring you home, too.

672
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:47,391
Raggedy man, I remember you,

673
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:49,793
and you are late for my wedding!

674
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,677
I found you.

675
00:47:58,797 --> 00:48:00,680
I found you in words, like you knew

676
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,560
I would. That's why you
told me the story, the brand new,

677
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,120
ancient blue box.

678
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Very clever.

679
00:48:10,461 --> 00:48:11,320
What is it?

680
00:48:11,738 --> 00:48:12,945
Something old.

681
00:48:13,285 --> 00:48:14,445
Something new.

682
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,039
Something borrowed.

683
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:19,776
Something blue.

684
00:48:27,356 --> 00:48:28,600
It's the Doctor!

685
00:48:32,313 --> 00:48:33,960
How did we forget the Doctor?

686
00:48:40,178 --> 00:48:41,327
OK, Doctor.

687
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,460
Did I surprise you this time?

688
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,941
Completely astonished.

689
00:48:49,797 --> 00:48:51,080
Never expected that.

690
00:48:51,988 --> 00:48:54,640
How lucky I happened to be wearing
this old thing.

691
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,527
Hello, everyone.

692
00:48:57,996 --> 00:48:59,640
I'm Amy's imaginary friend.

693
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,400
But I came anyway.

694
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,622
You absolutely,
definitely may kiss the bride.

695
00:49:06,742 --> 00:49:09,306
Amelia! From now on,
I shall be leaving the...

696
00:49:09,915 --> 00:49:12,083
kissing duties to the brand new

697
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:13,665
Mr Pond.

698
00:49:14,586 --> 00:49:16,273
No, I'm not Mr Pond.

699
00:49:16,801 --> 00:49:19,074
- That's not how it works.
- Yeah, it is.

700
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:20,574
Yeah, it is.

701
00:49:20,972 --> 00:49:23,551
Right then, everyone.
I'll move my box.

702
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:25,777
You're going to need the space.

703
00:49:27,016 --> 00:49:29,149
I only came for the dancing.

704
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,640
You're terrible.
That is embarrassing!

705
00:49:40,432 --> 00:49:43,080
That's it. That's good.
Keep it loose.

706
00:49:57,947 --> 00:49:59,260
2,000 years.

707
00:50:00,924 --> 00:50:02,354
The boy who waited.

708
00:50:04,662 --> 00:50:05,975
Good on you, mate.

709
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:24,092
Did you dance?

710
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:28,572
You always dance at weddings,
don't you?

711
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,400
You tell me.

712
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:31,900
Spoilers.

713
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:36,083
The writing's all back,
but I didn't peek.

714
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:38,876
Thank you.

715
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,017
Are you married,

716
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:48,322
River?

717
00:50:49,478 --> 00:50:50,697
Are you asking?

718
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:57,227
No, hang on.

719
00:50:57,347 --> 00:51:00,414
Did you think I was asking you
to marry me, or asking

720
00:51:00,534 --> 00:51:01,926
if you were married?

721
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:05,840
No, but was that "yes", or "yes"?

722
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:13,977
Who are you?

723
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,585
You're going to find out
very soon now.

724
00:51:18,687 --> 00:51:19,894
And I'm sorry,

725
00:51:21,155 --> 00:51:23,241
but that's when everything changes.

726
00:51:42,574 --> 00:51:45,793
Where are you off to? We haven't even
had a snog in the shrubbery yet.

727
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,254
Shut up, it's my wedding.

728
00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:49,560
Our wedding.

729
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,214
Sorry, you two,
shouldn't have slipped away.

730
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:53,680
Bit busy, you know?

731
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:56,640
You just saved the whole of space
and time.

732
00:51:57,062 --> 00:51:59,242
Take the evening off.
Maybe a bit of tomorrow.

733
00:51:59,362 --> 00:52:02,558
Space and time isn't safe yet.
The TARDIS exploded for a reason.

734
00:52:02,678 --> 00:52:05,560
Something drew the TARDIS
to this particular date, and blew it up.

735
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:08,047
Why? And why now?
The silence,

736
00:52:08,886 --> 00:52:12,240
whatever it is, is still out there,
and I have to... Excuse me a moment.

737
00:52:15,243 --> 00:52:17,059
I'm sorry, this is a very bad line.

738
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:19,192
No, but that's not possible.

739
00:52:19,312 --> 00:52:22,249
She was sealed into the Seventh Obelisk.
I was at the prayer meeting.

740
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:25,812
No, I get that it's important.
An Egyptian goddess loose

741
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:27,880
on the Orient Express.

742
00:52:29,128 --> 00:52:30,194
In space!

743
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,893
Give us a mo.

744
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:34,940
Sorry, something's come up.
This will have to be goodbye.

745
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,880
Yeah, I think it's goodbye.
Do you think it's goodbye?

746
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:40,160
Definitely goodbye.

747
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:45,090
Goodbye!

748
00:52:51,662 --> 00:52:53,642
Don't worry about a thing,
Your Majesty.

749
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:55,974
We're on our way.

750
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,080
Thanks for following Dr Who
with our subtitles! RDV December, 24th
