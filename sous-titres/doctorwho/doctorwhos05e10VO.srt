1
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,356
So this is one of the last
paintings Van Gogh ever painted.

2
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,228
Those final months of his life
were probably

3
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:41,554
the most astonishing
artistic outpouring in history.

4
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,211
It was like Shakespeare
knocking off Othello,

5
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,040
Macbeth and King Lear
over the summer hols.

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,160
And especially astonishing
because Van Gogh did it with

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,960
no hope of praise or reward.

8
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,400
- Thanks for bringing me.
- You're welcome.

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,673
You're being so nice to me. Why?

10
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,632
- I'm always nice to you.
- Not like this.

11
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:04,668
These places you're taking me

12
00:01:04,788 --> 00:01:07,120
Arcadia, the Trojan Gardens,
now this.

13
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:08,599
It's suspicious.

14
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,560
There's nothing
to be suspicious about.

15
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,963
I was joking. Why aren't you?

16
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:17,238
Each of these pictures now
is worth tens of millions of pounds.

17
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:19,800
Yet in his lifetime,
he was a commercial disaster.

18
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:22,600
Sold only one painting,

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,406
to the sister of a friend.

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,200
We have here possibly

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,268
the greatest artist of all time,

22
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,720
but when he died, you could
have sold his entire body of work

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,421
and got about enough money
to buy a sofa

24
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:37,431
and a couple of chairs.

25
00:01:39,097 --> 00:01:40,833
If you follow me now...

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,034
- Who is it?
- It's the doctor!

27
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:46,547
He was the doctor who took care of
Van Gogh when he started to go mad.

28
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:47,665
I knew that.

29
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:50,972
Look! There it is, the actual one.

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,710
Yes. You can almost feel his hand
painting it right in front of you.

31
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,979
Carving the colours into shapes...

32
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:00,880
- Wait a minute.
- What?

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,160
Well, just look at that.

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,421
What?

35
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,472
- Something very not good.
- What's very not good?

36
00:02:07,592 --> 00:02:09,095
In the window of the church.

37
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:13,763
Is it a face?

38
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:18,133
And not a nice face at all.

39
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:21,720
I know evil when I see it
and I see it in that window.

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,126
It has changed hands
for something in the region of 20...

41
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,551
Excuse me. If I can just interrupt
for one second. Sorry, everyone.

42
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:32,160
Routine inspection,
Ministry of Art and...

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,376
Artiness. So...

44
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:35,627
- Dr Black.
- Yes, that's right.

45
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:38,209
Do you know when that picture
of the church was painted?

46
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:39,800
What an interesting question.

47
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,640
- Most people...
- When was it?

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,400
- Exactly?
- As exactly as you can.

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
Without a long speech, if poss.
I'm in a hurry.

50
00:02:45,838 --> 00:02:49,716
Well, in that case, probably somewhere
between the 1st and 3rd of June.

51
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,280
- What year?
- 1890.

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,424
Less than a year before...

53
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,365
before he killed himself.

54
00:02:58,359 --> 00:02:59,920
Thank you, sir. Very helpful.

55
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:01,888
Nice bow-tie.

56
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:03,649
Bow-ties are cool.

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,014
- Yours is very...
- Oh, thank you.

58
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,848
Keep telling them stuff.
We need to go.

59
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,055
- What about the other pictures?
- Art can wait. This is life and death.

60
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:13,920
We need to talk to Vincent Van Gogh.

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
U-Sub.net et la Allons-y Team
présentent

Doctor Who - saison 5

63
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:22,840
Transcript : Red Bee Media Ltd

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,700
Synchro : Citrøn, Dauphinus, Delphiki,
Imaginos, Jojo, Sargeros

65
00:03:57,991 --> 00:03:59,354
Right, here's the plan.

66
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:02,600
We find Vincent and he leads us straight
to the church and our nasty friend.

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,705
Easy peasy.

68
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,600
No. I suspect nothing will be easy
with Mr Van Gogh.

69
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,794
Now, he'll probably be
in the local cafe,

70
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:11,126
sort of...

71
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:14,520
orangey light,
chairs and tables outside.

72
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:18,063
- Like this?
- That's the one.

73
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,160
Or indeed like that.

74
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,800
Exactly like that.

75
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:26,853
Good evening.

76
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:30,040
Does the name Vincent Van Gogh
ring a bell?

77
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,241
Don't mention that man to me.

78
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:33,574
Excuse me.

79
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,758
Do you know Vincent Van Gogh?

80
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,120
Unfortunately.

81
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:39,660
Unfortunately?

82
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,600
He's drunk, he's mad

83
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,755
and he never pays his bills.

84
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:46,469
Good painter, though?

85
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:51,640
Come on! Come on!

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,920
One painting for one drink.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
That's not a bad deal.

88
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
It wouldn't be
if the painting were any good.

89
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:01,433
I can't hang that up on my walls.
It'd scare the customers half to death.

90
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:04,400
It's bad enough having you
in here in person,

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,944
looming over the customers
day and night in a stupid hat.

92
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:09,870
- You pay money or you get out.
- I'll pay if you like.

93
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,720
What?

94
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:14,209
If you like, I'll pay for the drink.
Or I'll pay for the painting

95
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,457
and you can use the money
to pay for the drink.

96
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:20,200
Exactly who are you?

97
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm... new in town.

98
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,302
In that case,
you don't know three things.

99
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:29,320
One, I pay for my own drinks,
thank you.

100
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:31,949
Two,

101
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,120
no-one ever buys any of my paintings
or they would be laughed out of town,

102
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,011
so if you want to stay in town,

103
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:38,840
I suggest you keep your cash
to yourself.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,680
And three, your friend's cute,

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,640
but you should keep your big nose
out of other people's business.

106
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,536
Come on, just one more drink.

107
00:05:45,656 --> 00:05:47,287
- I'll pay tomorrow.
- No.

108
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:50,341
Or, on the other hand,
slightly more compassionately,

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,638
Or, on the other hand, to protect
my business from madmen, no.

110
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:57,435
- Or?
- Just shut up,

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,945
the pair of you!

112
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,475
I would like
a bottle of wine, please,

113
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,669
which I will then share
with whomever I choose.

114
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:07,200
That could be good.

115
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,280
- That's good by me.
- Good.

116
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,878
That accent of yours.

117
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:21,920
You from Holland like me?

118
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,354
- Yes.
- No.

119
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:27,200
She means yes. So, start again.

120
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,639
- Hello, I'm the Doctor.
- I knew it!

121
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:31,296
Sorry?

122
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:35,240
My brother's always sending doctors,
but you won't be able to help.

123
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,440
I'm not that kind of doctor.

124
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,667
That's incredible,
don't you think, Amy?

125
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,680
Absolutely. One of my favourites.

126
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
One of my favourite whats?

127
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,800
- You've never seen my work before.
- Ah, yes.

128
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:50,440
One of my favourite paintings
that I've ever seen. Generally.

129
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,910
Then you can't have seen
many paintings, then.

130
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:54,771
I know it's terrible.

131
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,290
It's the best I could do.

132
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:01,200
Your hair is orange.

133
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,264
So's yours.

134
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,691
It was more orange,
but now is, of course,

135
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:13,735
less.

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,555
So, Vincent,
painted any churches recently?

137
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:21,040
Any churchy plans?
Are churches, chapels,

138
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,954
religiousy stuff like that,

139
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,680
something you'd like to get into?
You know, fairly soon?

140
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,646
There is one church
I'm thinking of painting

141
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,142
when the weather is right.

142
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:32,080
That is very good news.

143
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,200
She's been murdered!

144
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,280
Help me!

145
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,720
That, on the other hand,
isn't quite such good news.

146
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,809
Come on, Amy, Vincent!

147
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
She's been ripped to shreds!

148
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,114
- Please, let me look. I'm a doctor.
- Who is it?

149
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,479
Is she dead?

150
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,201
Away, all of you vultures!
This is my daughter.

151
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,090
Giselle.

152
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,919
What monster could have done this?

153
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,843
- Get away from her!
- OK.

154
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:08,868
Get that madman out of here!

155
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,553
You bring this on us.

156
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,916
Your madness! You!

157
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,236
He's to blame!

158
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,367
Are you all right?

159
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:30,639
I'm used to it.

160
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:32,996
Has anything like this
happened here before?

161
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:35,320
Only a week ago.
It's a terrible time.

162
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:39,079
As I thought, as I thought.
Come on, we'd better get you home.

163
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,791
- Where are you staying tonight?
- You're very kind.

164
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:56,497
Dark night, very starry.

165
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,160
It's not much.

166
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:00,447
I live on my own.

167
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:04,319
But you should be OK for one night.
One night.

168
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:08,160
- We're going to stay with him?
- Until he paints that church.

169
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:12,547
- Watch out. That one's wet.
- What?

170
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:29,436
Sorry about all the clutter.

171
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:32,735
Some clutter.

172
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:36,479
I've come to accept the only person
who's going to love my paintings is me.

173
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:39,707
I mean, really.

174
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,395
I know, it's a mess.

175
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,360
I'll have a proper clear-out.
I must, I really must.

176
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:01,478
- Coffee, anyone?
- Not for me, actually.

177
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:05,951
You should be careful with these.

178
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,213
They're...

179
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,408
precious.

180
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:11,760
Precious to me.
Not precious to anyone else.

181
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,188
They're precious to me!

182
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:14,640
You're very kind.

183
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:16,920
And kindness is most welcome.

184
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,504
Right, so, this church, then.
Near here, is it?

185
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:23,080
What is it with you and the church?

186
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,560
Just casually interested in it.

187
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:27,519
Far from casual.

188
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,279
Seems to me.
You never talk about anything else.

189
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:31,708
He's a strange one.

190
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:34,680
Let's talk about you.
What are you interested in?

191
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,820
Look around.

192
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:38,120
Art.

193
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:41,040
It seems to me there's so much more
to the world

194
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,474
than the average eye
is allowed to see.

195
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,760
I believe, if you look hard,

196
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:49,215
there are more wonders
in this universe

197
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:52,235
than you could ever have dreamed of.

198
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:55,280
You don't have to tell me.

199
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,217
It's colour.
Colour that holds the key.

200
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,560
I can hear the colours.

201
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:02,931
Listen to them.

202
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:05,280
Every time I step outside,

203
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,119
I feel nature is shouting at me.

204
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:09,680
"Come on. Come and get me. Come on.

205
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,220
Come on! Capture my mystery!"

206
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,760
Maybe you've had enough coffee.

207
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,944
How about some nice calming tea?

208
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:21,216
Let's get you a cup of camomile
or something, shall we?

209
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,436
Where's Amy?

210
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,720
- What happened?
- I was having a look at the paintings

211
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,639
when something hit me from behind.

212
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,760
It's OK. He's gone now
and we're here.

213
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,804
Take it easy.

214
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:41,080
- Take it easy!
- What's happening?

215
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,800
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

216
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,600
Oh, dear.

217
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,480
Run. Run!

218
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,540
That's not a bad idea. Amy, get back.
He's having some kind of fit.

219
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:59,242
I'll try to calm him down.

220
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,060
Easy, Vincent, easy.

221
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,880
Look, it's me.

222
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:06,064
It's the Doctor, look.

223
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:07,869
No one else is here.

224
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,320
- Vincent...
- Look out!

225
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,630
I can't see anything. What is it?

226
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:19,005
That is a good question.

227
00:12:20,554 --> 00:12:22,592
- Let me help you.
- You can see him too?

228
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:24,266
Yes. Ish.

229
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:27,480
Not really.

230
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,783
You couldn't see him?

231
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,481
He's gone.

232
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:04,836
Right. Yes,

233
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:06,462
of course.

234
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,166
Right.

235
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,439
- He's invisible? What did he look like?
- I'll show you.

236
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,120
- What?
- It's just... That was quite a good.

237
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,800
On you go.

238
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:50,399
Amy, make Mr Van Gogh comfortable.

239
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:53,074
Don't let any invisible monsters
in through the front door.

240
00:13:53,194 --> 00:13:55,279
But it could be outside, waiting.

241
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:58,530
Don't worry.
What's the worst that can happen?

242
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,067
You could get torn into pieces
by a monster you can't see.

243
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:02,187
Yes, that.

244
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:06,485
Don't worry. I'll be back before
you can say, "Where's he got to now?"

245
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,720
Not that fast!

246
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:15,698
But pretty fast.

247
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:18,626
See you around.

248
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,812
You in here somewhere?

249
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:03,591
I can't apologize enough.
I thought you were a useless gadget.

250
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,679
That you were just
an embarrassing present

251
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,475
from a dull godmother
with two heads and bad breath.

252
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:10,724
Twice.

253
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,952
How wrong can a man be?

254
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:29,547
Good.

255
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,200
You're working.

256
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,160
See what you make of this.

257
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,489
Who is that?

258
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,040
It's not that.

259
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,880
There are thousands of them
and you can see them plain as day.

260
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,200
Definitely not.
This is the problem

261
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,687
with the impressionists

262
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:51,200
not accurate enough. This would
never happen with Gainsborough

263
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,159
or one of those proper painters.

264
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:56,280
Sorry, Vincent.

265
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,720
You'll just have to draw
something better.

266
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,529
That's better, old girl.

267
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,315
Time-delay, but you always
get it right in the end.

268
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:15,600
Good. Let's find out
who this is, then.

269
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:18,661
There you are, you poor thing.

270
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:20,381
You brutal, murderous,

271
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:22,000
abandoned thing.

272
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,164
I hope we meet again soon
so I can take you home.

273
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,640
Maybe not that soon.

274
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:28,281
Never do that!

275
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:31,753
You scared the living daylights
out of me.

276
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:33,452
Sorry. I got bored.

277
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:36,426
As much as you admire
his command of colour and shape,

278
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:39,440
it is hard to get fond
of Vincent Van Gogh's snoring.

279
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:43,601
Wakey, wakey!

280
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:47,263
Rise and shine!
Breakfast is served in the courtyard.

281
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,360
What a morning.

282
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:54,592
Come on.

283
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:57,640
Amy's got a little surprise for you.

284
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,440
I thought I'd brighten things up
to thank you for saving me last night.

285
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:06,951
I thought you might like, possibly
to paint them or something?

286
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:08,240
Might be a thought.

287
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,160
They're not my favourite flower.

288
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:12,501
You don't like sunflowers?

289
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:15,911
It's not that I don't like them.
I find them complex.

290
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:18,681
Always somewhere
between living and dying.

291
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:21,240
Half-human as they turn to the sun.

292
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,931
A little disgusting.

293
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:24,701
But, you know,

294
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:26,760
they are a challenge.

295
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,798
One I'm pretty sure
you will rise to.

296
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:32,080
But, moving on, there's something
I need to show you.

297
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:34,440
That's him.

298
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:36,512
And the eyes.

299
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:38,270
Without mercy.

300
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:41,033
This is a creature
called the Krafayis.

301
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:44,886
They travel in space,
they travel as a pack,

302
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:46,831
scavenging across the universe.

303
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,772
Sometimes one of
them gets left behind

304
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:52,200
and because they are a brutal race,
the others never come back.

305
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,849
Dotted all around the universe are

306
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,023
individual, utterly merciless,

307
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:59,390
utterly abandoned Krafayis.

308
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,947
And what they do is...
Kill, until they're killed.

309
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:06,269
Which they usually aren't. Because
other creatures can't see them.

310
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:07,994
But I can.

311
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,600
And that's why we are
in a unique position today, my friend,

312
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,680
to end this reign of terror.

313
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,200
So, feeling like
painting the church today?

314
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,440
- What about the monster?
- Take my word for it. If you paint it,

315
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,760
he will come.

316
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,861
- I'll get my things.
- In your own time.

317
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,680
I promise you, we'll be out
of your hair by this time tomorrow.

318
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:40,258
- This is risky.
- Riskier than normal?

319
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:42,737
Think about it.

320
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:45,794
This is the middle of Vincent
Van Gogh's greatest year of painting.

321
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:48,440
If we're not carreful,
the result of our trip could be

322
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,080
the brutal murder of the greatest artist
who ever lived.

323
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:55,800
Half the pictures on the wall
of the Musée d'Orsay will disappear.

324
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:00,270
And it will be our fault.

325
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:22,640
Vincent, can I help?

326
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,355
It's so clear you cannot help.

327
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:29,720
And when you leave,
and everyone always leaves,

328
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:34,425
I will be left once more
with an empty heart and no hope.

329
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,858
My experience is that there is,

330
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,240
you know,

331
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:41,810
surprisingly, always hope.

332
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,180
Then your experience is incomplete.

333
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,874
I know how it will end.

334
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:50,486
And it will not end well.

335
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,040
Come on. Come out,

336
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,722
- let's go outside.
- Out!

337
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,420
You get out.

338
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,684
What are you doing here?

339
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:07,880
What are you doing here?

340
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:12,400
Very well. I'll leave.
I'll leave you.

341
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:20,520
- What's happening?
- We're leaving.

342
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,640
Everyone knows he's a delicate man.

343
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,956
Just months from now...

344
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:29,381
He'll take his own life.

345
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,952
Don't say that.

346
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:36,406
Please.

347
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:49,693
We have to do this on our own.
Go to the church at the right time

348
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:52,238
and hope the monster still turns up.

349
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm ready.

350
00:21:58,179 --> 00:21:59,179
Let's go.

351
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:07,697
I'm sorry you're so sad.

352
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:09,280
I'm not.

353
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,641
Sometimes these moods torture me
for weeks, for months.

354
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:13,880
But I'm good now.

355
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:17,887
If Amy Pond can soldier on,
then so can Vincent Van Gogh.

356
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:20,450
I'm not soldiering on. I'm fine.

357
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,963
I hear the song of your sadness.

358
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,778
You've lost someone I think.

359
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,213
I'm not sad.

360
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:31,912
They why are you crying?

361
00:22:36,216 --> 00:22:38,633
It's all right. I understand.

362
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,040
I'm not sure I do.

363
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:45,669
We must have a plan.

364
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:48,361
- When the creature returns...
- Then we shall fight him again.

365
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,632
Yes, tick.

366
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,920
But last night, we were lucky.

367
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:56,075
Amy could have been killed.

368
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,760
So this time, for a start, we have
to make sure I can see him too.

369
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,958
How are we meant
to do that, suddenly?

370
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:03,399
The answer's in this box.

371
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,153
I had an excellent,
if smelly, godmother.

372
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,720
It's that poor girl
from the village.

373
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:36,527
You do have a plan? Don't you?

374
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,200
It's a thing, like a plan,
but with more greatness.

375
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,560
You'll be sure to tell me
if you see any, you know,

376
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:55,680
monsters.

377
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,323
While I may be mad, I'm not stupid.

378
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:00,630
Quite.

379
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,942
To be honest...

380
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,482
not sure about mad either.

381
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:11,970
It seems to me depression
is a very complex...

382
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:16,652
I'm working.

383
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,335
Paint.

384
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,183
Do painting!

385
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:28,840
I remember watching Michelangelo
painting the Sistine Chapel.

386
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:30,874
What a whinger.

387
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:32,278
I said to him,

388
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:35,405
"If you're scared of heights,
you shouldn't have taken the job."

389
00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:39,165
And Picasso.
What a ghastly old goat.

390
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:43,359
I kept telling him,
"Concentrate, Pablo,

391
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,565
it's one eye,

392
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:47,720
- "either side of the face."
- Quiet.

393
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,264
Is this how time normally passes?

394
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,560
Really slowly.

395
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:58,200
In the right order.

396
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:01,280
If there's one thing I can't stand,

397
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,244
it's an unpunctual alien attack.

398
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:05,240
Are you OK?

399
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:08,680
You seem a bit... If I didn't
know you better, I'd say nervous.

400
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:11,640
There's something not right
and I can't quite put my finger on it.

401
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:12,670
There.

402
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,441
He's at the window.

403
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:18,080
- Where?
- There, on the right.

404
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,800
As I thought. Come on.

405
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:22,025
I'm going in.

406
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,550
- I'm coming, too.
- No!

407
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:27,148
You're Vincent Van Gogh.

408
00:25:29,452 --> 00:25:30,999
But you're not armed.

409
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,840
- I am.
- What with?

410
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,040
Overconfidence, this and a small
screw driver. I'm sorted.

411
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,723
Just have to find the right crosactic
setting, and stun him with it.

412
00:25:38,843 --> 00:25:40,200
Sonic never fails. Anyway,

413
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,950
Amy, only one thought,

414
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,680
one simple instruction,

415
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:47,835
don't follow me
under any circumstances.

416
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,770
I won't.

417
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:56,330
Will you follow him?

418
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:57,725
Of course.

419
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:00,301
I love you.

420
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,758
- Has he moved?
- No.

421
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:24,774
Just shifted to the next window.

422
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:27,529
But, wait!

423
00:27:28,243 --> 00:27:29,800
He's turning now.

424
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,600
Damn. He's moved.

425
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:01,668
I thought I told you...

426
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:04,373
Never mind. We'll talk
about it later. Quick. In here.

427
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:11,531
Absolutely...

428
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:13,205
quiet.

429
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:21,760
Can you breath a little quieter,
please?

430
00:28:31,728 --> 00:28:33,076
He's gone past.

431
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:46,658
I think he heard us.

432
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:50,760
Impressive hearing he's got.

433
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,539
What's less impressive are
our chances of survival.

434
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:59,640
Are you looking for me, sonny?

435
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,746
Come on. Over here.

436
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,760
Because I'm right here
waiting for you.

437
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,840
Come on. Quickly!

438
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,121
Get behind me.

439
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:18,669
Doing anything?

440
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,360
Where is he?

441
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,971
Where do you think he is,
you idiot? Use your head.

442
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,830
Anything?

443
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:30,326
Nothing.

444
00:29:30,684 --> 00:29:32,908
In fact, he seemed
to rather enjoy it.

445
00:29:34,837 --> 00:29:35,672
Duck.

446
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,753
Left.

447
00:29:39,364 --> 00:29:40,396
Right, sorry.

448
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:42,858
Your right, my left.

449
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:44,380
This is no good at all.

450
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,188
- Run like crazy and regroup.
- Come on, in here.

451
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,464
Here's the plan. Amy, Rory.

452
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:07,049
- Who?
- Sorry.

453
00:30:07,982 --> 00:30:09,661
- What is the plan?
- I don't know.

454
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:10,963
But in the future,

455
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm just using this screwdriver
for screwing in screws.

456
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Give me a second. I'll be back.

457
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,802
- I suppose we could try talking to him.
- Talking to him?

458
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:22,788
Yes. Might be interesting
to know his side of the story.

459
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:27,120
Yes, though maybe he's not really
in the mood for conversation

460
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,763
right at this precise moment.

461
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:35,124
Well, no harm trying. Listen!

462
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,920
I know you can understand me.

463
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,702
Even though I know you won't understand
why you can understand me.

464
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:46,445
I also know
that no-one's talked to you

465
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:49,358
for a pretty long stretch,
but please...

466
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,036
listen.

467
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:56,551
I also don't belong on this planet.

468
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,329
I also am...

469
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:00,640
alone.

470
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,925
If you trust me, I'm sure we can
come to some kind of, you know,

471
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:08,649
understanding.
And then, and then,

472
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:10,424
who knows?

473
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:22,720
Over here, mate!

474
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,655
- What's it up to now?
- It's moving round the room.

475
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:29,477
Feeling its way around.

476
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:31,838
What?

477
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,155
It's like it's trapped.

478
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:37,037
It's moving round
the edges of the room.

479
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:41,503
I can't see a thing.

480
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,560
- I am really stupid.
- Oh, get a grip!

481
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,774
This is not a moment
to re-evaluate your self-esteem.

482
00:31:48,894 --> 00:31:50,494
No, I am really stupid

483
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:52,968
and I'm growing old.

484
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:56,240
Why does it attack,
but never eat its victims?

485
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,760
Why was it abandoned
by its pack and left here to die?

486
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,998
Why is it feeling its way helplessly
around the walls of the room?

487
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,067
It can't see, it's blind.

488
00:32:06,187 --> 00:32:09,090
That of course explains why it has
such perfect hearing!

489
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,603
Which also explains

490
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:13,375
why it is now turning around
and heading straight for us.

491
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,026
Vincent. Vincent, what's happening?

492
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:17,280
It's charging now.

493
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:18,575
Get back!

494
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,827
He wasn't without mercy at all.

495
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,800
He was without sight.

496
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:45,920
I didn't mean that to happen.

497
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,831
I only meant to wound it,
I never meant to...

498
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,873
He's trying to say something.

499
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:55,510
What?

500
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,431
I'm having trouble making it out,
but I think he's saying,

501
00:33:00,004 --> 00:33:01,556
"I am afraid.

502
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:03,633
I'm afraid."

503
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,110
There, there.

504
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,744
It's OK, it's OK.

505
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:13,652
You'll be fine.

506
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:26,823
He was frightened.

507
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:30,443
And he lashed out.

508
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:33,604
Like humans, who lash out
when they're frightened.

509
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,735
Like the villagers who scream at me.

510
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,920
Like the children
who throw stones at me.

511
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:44,689
Sometimes winning...

512
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:46,432
winning is no fun at all.

513
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:07,203
Hold my hand, Doctor.

514
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:11,727
Try to see what I see.

515
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:16,586
We are so lucky we are still alive
to see this beautiful world.

516
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,557
Look at the sky.

517
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:22,586
It's not dark
and black and without character.

518
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,170
The black is in fact deep blue.

519
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:27,292
And over there,

520
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,109
lighter blue.

521
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:31,948
And blowing through
the blueness and the blackness, the wind

522
00:34:32,073 --> 00:34:34,737
swirling through the air,
and then shining,

523
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:37,259
burning, bursting through,
the stars!

524
00:34:38,273 --> 00:34:40,418
Can you see
how they roar their light?

525
00:34:42,124 --> 00:34:43,574
Everywhere we look,

526
00:34:44,544 --> 00:34:48,160
the complex magic of nature
blazes before our eyes.

527
00:34:51,372 --> 00:34:53,592
I've seen many things, my friend.

528
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:55,200
But you're right.

529
00:34:56,979 --> 00:34:57,985
Nothing...

530
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:01,095
quite as wonderful
as the things you see.

531
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:12,257
I will miss you terribly.

532
00:35:25,654 --> 00:35:28,400
<i>I only wish I had something
of real value to give you.</i>

533
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:34,480
No, I could never accept such

534
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,360
an extraordinary gift.

535
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:38,362
Very well.

536
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:42,160
You are not the first
to decline the offer. Amy, the blessed,

537
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:43,695
the wonderful.

538
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:46,600
Be good to yourself

539
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:48,954
and be kind to yourself.

540
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,440
- I'll try my best.
- And maybe give the beard

541
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,554
a little trim before
you next kiss someone.

542
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:56,840
I will. I will.
And if you tire

543
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,560
of this Doctor of yours, return.
And we will have children by the dozen.

544
00:36:02,972 --> 00:36:04,393
Doctor, my friend.

545
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:06,680
We have fought monsters together

546
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,046
and we have won.

547
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:12,147
On my own,
I fear I may not do as well.

548
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,686
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I was thinking I may need

549
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:33,441
- some food before we leave.
- You're not thinking exactly

550
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,053
what I'm thinking.

551
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,717
Got something I'd like to show you.
Maybe just

552
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:45,200
tidy yourself up a bit first.

553
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,907
Now, you know we've had quite
a few chats about the possibility

554
00:36:52,032 --> 00:36:55,095
there might be more to life
than normal people imagine?

555
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:59,340
Well, brace yourself, Vinny.

556
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,416
How come I'm the crazy one.

557
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,619
And you two have stayed sane?

558
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:40,360
What do these things all do?

559
00:37:40,665 --> 00:37:41,840
A huge variety

560
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,004
of things.

561
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:44,920
This one here, for instance,

562
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,630
plays soothing music.

563
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:49,040
While this one

564
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,720
makes a huge amount of noise.

565
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:57,386
And this one
makes everything go tonto.

566
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:06,440
And this one?

567
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,420
That's a friction contrafibulator!

568
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:10,360
And this?

569
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,865
That's ketchup.

570
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,160
- And that one's mustard.
- Nice!

571
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:16,960
Come on. Back to the cafe

572
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,860
and you can tell me about
all the wonders of the universe.

573
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:23,654
Good idea. Although, actually,
there's a little something

574
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,658
I'd like to show you first.

575
00:38:31,698 --> 00:38:33,350
- Where are we?
- Paris.

576
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:35,999
2010 AD.
And this is the...

577
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
mighty Musée d'Orsay. Home to many
of the greatest paintings in history.

578
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,430
That's wonderful.

579
00:38:42,978 --> 00:38:45,720
Ignore that. I've got something
more important to show you.

580
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:54,840
Dr Black,

581
00:39:56,832 --> 00:39:58,192
we met a few days ago.

582
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,960
I asked you about the church

583
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:01,227
at Auvers.

584
00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:02,960
Yes. Glad to be of help.

585
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:05,552
- You were nice about my tie.
- Yes.

586
00:40:05,677 --> 00:40:08,997
And today is another cracker
if I may say so. But I just wondered,

587
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,892
between you and me, in 100 words,

588
00:40:13,104 --> 00:40:16,292
where do you think Van Gogh rates
in the history of art?

589
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:17,616
Well...

590
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:21,366
big question. But,

591
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,880
to me, Van Gogh
is the finest painter of them all.

592
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:29,920
Certainly, the most popular,
great painter of all time,

593
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,725
the most beloved.

594
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:34,880
His command of color
the most magnificent.

595
00:40:35,714 --> 00:40:37,718
He transformed the pain

596
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,233
of his tormented life
into ecstatic beauty.

597
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:43,881
Pain is easy to portray,

598
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:47,120
but to use your passion
and pain to portray the ecstasy

599
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,225
and joy and magnificence
of our world...

600
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,163
No-one had ever done it before.

601
00:40:53,913 --> 00:40:55,920
Perhaps no-one ever will again.

602
00:40:56,777 --> 00:41:00,117
To my mind, that strange, wild man

603
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,262
who roamed the fields of Provence

604
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:05,414
was not only
the world's greatest artist,

605
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:06,548
but also,

606
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:10,018
one of the greatest men
who ever lived.

607
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:14,728
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:17,031
I'm sorry. Is it too much?

609
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:21,332
They are tears of joy.

610
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:26,090
Thank you, sir.

611
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,459
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

612
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:32,767
- You're welcome.
- Sorry about the beard.

613
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:52,721
This changes everything.

614
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:56,320
I'll step out tomorrow with my easel
on my back a different man.

615
00:41:57,102 --> 00:42:00,480
I still can't believe that one haystacks
was in the museum. How embarrassing.

616
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,600
It's been a great adventure
and a great

617
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:03,960
honor.

618
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,321
You've turned out to be
the first doctor ever

619
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:09,480
actually to make a difference
to my life.

620
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,960
I'm delighted.
I won't ever forget you.

621
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,305
You are sure marriage
is out of the question?

622
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,520
This time.

623
00:42:19,973 --> 00:42:21,919
I'm not really the marrying kind.

624
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,641
Come on. Let's go back
to the gallery right now.

625
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,812
Time can be re-written.
I know it can.

626
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:56,320
Come on!

627
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,440
The long life

628
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,343
of Vincent Van Gogh.

629
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:03,960
- There'll be hundreds of new paintings.
- I'm not sure there will.

630
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:06,749
Come on!

631
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,920
We have here the last work

632
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,600
Vincent Van Gogh,
who committed suicide

633
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,203
at only 37.

634
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,960
He is now acknowledged to be one
of the foremost artists of all time.

635
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,875
If you follow me now...

636
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,099
So, you were right.

637
00:43:36,803 --> 00:43:38,040
No new paintings.

638
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,800
We didn't make a difference at all.

639
00:43:43,073 --> 00:43:44,444
I wouldn't say that.

640
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:49,487
The way I see it, every life
is a pile of good things

641
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:51,592
and bad things.

642
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:55,659
The good things

643
00:43:56,432 --> 00:43:57,628
don't always

644
00:43:57,753 --> 00:43:59,737
soften the bad things.
But, vice versa,

645
00:43:59,862 --> 00:44:02,600
he bad things don't necessarily spoil
the good things or make

646
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,053
them unimportant.

647
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:09,467
And we definitely added
to his pile of good things.

648
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:13,323
And if you look carefully...

649
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,243
maybe we did indeed make a couple

650
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:19,040
of little changes.

651
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,067
No Krafayis.

652
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,696
No Krafayis.

653
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,953
If we had got married,
our kids would have had very,

654
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:08,688
very red hair.

655
00:45:11,383 --> 00:45:12,871
The ultimate ginger.

656
00:45:15,273 --> 00:45:16,738
The ultimate ginge.

657
00:45:22,362 --> 00:45:24,002
Brighter than sunflowers.

658
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:41,880
<i>Hello? I need your help.
There's been an accident.</i>

659
00:45:46,435 --> 00:45:47,800
What is he doing up there?

660
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,840
- Have you put the advert up yet?
- I did it today. Paper shop window.

661
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,896
- Find me a man.
- Yeah, otherwise

662
00:45:53,021 --> 00:45:55,800
- you'll have to settle for me.
- You'll have to settle for me first.

663
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:00,840
I love you, I love you.

664
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:05,720
That's good cos I'm your new lodger.
