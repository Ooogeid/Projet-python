1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,960
It's a beautiful day.

2
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,522
<i>Hallucinogenic lipstick.</i>

3
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:38,843
She's here.

4
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,086
Wrong! Wrong!

5
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,161
Bit right, mostly wrong.

6
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:19,760
I love museums.

7
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,818
Yeah, great!
Can we go to a planet now?

8
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:23,590
Big space ship,
Churchill's bunker...?

9
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,148
- You promised me a planet.
- Amy, this isn't any old asteroid.

10
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:29,304
It's the Delerium Archive, final
resting place of the headless monks.

11
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,685
The biggest museum ever.

12
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:34,025
You've got a time machine,
why do you need museums?

13
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:36,040
Wrong! Very wrong!

14
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,498
Oooh, one of mine. Also one of mine.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
I see!

16
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:43,341
It's how you keep score.

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,511
Oh great, an old box.

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,240
It's from one of the old starliners.
A Home Box.

19
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:06,753
What's a Home Box?

20
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:10,151
Like a black box on a plane,
except it homes.

21
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:11,629
Anything happens to the ship,

22
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:14,560
the Home Box flies home,
with all the flight data.

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
So?

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,760
The writing, the graffiti -
Old High Gallifreyan.

25
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:21,280
The lost language of the Time Lords.

26
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:27,623
There were days.

27
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,322
There were many days,

28
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:31,480
these words could burn stars

29
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:35,120
and raise up empires,
and topple Gods.

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,630
What does it say?

31
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,315
"Hello, sweetie."

32
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:12,400
Party's over, Doctor Song.

33
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:16,246
Why are we doing this? Cos someone
on a space ship 12,000 years ago

34
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:18,102
is trying to attract my attention.

35
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:21,120
Let's see if we can get
the security playback working.

36
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:34,000
<i>The party's over, Doctor Song,</i>

37
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,920
yet still you're on board.

38
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,330
Sorry, Alistair.

39
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:43,037
I needed to see
what was in your vault.

40
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,960
Do you all know what's down there?

41
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:47,326
Any of you?

42
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,983
Because I'll tell you something.

43
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:53,094
This ship won't reach
its destination.

44
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:55,200
Wait till she runs.

45
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,680
Don't make it look like
an execution.

46
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:02,453
Triple-seven, five, slash,
three, four, nine by ten.

47
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:05,200
Zero, twelve, slash, acorn.

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,048
And I could do
with an air corridor...

49
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:09,880
- What was that, what did she say?
- Co-ordinates!

50
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:14,040
Like I said on the dance floor,

51
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:18,256
you might want to find something
to hang on to!

52
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:54,360
Follow that ship.

53
00:04:57,438 --> 00:04:59,988

59
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,520
They've gone into warp drive, we're
losing them! Stay close!

60
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,793
I'm trying!

61
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,640
- Use the stabilisers.
- There aren't any stabilisers!

62
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,890
The blue switches!

63
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,240
The blue ones don't do anything,
they're just... blue.

64
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,680
Yes, they're blue. Look!

65
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,383
They're the blue stabilisers!

66
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
See?

67
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,880
Yeah, well, it's just boring now,
isn't it?

68
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,794
They're boring-ers.
They're blue boring-ers.

69
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:16,800
- How come she can fly the TARDIS?
- You call that flying the TARDIS?

70
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:22,874
I've mapped the probability
vectors, done a fold-back

71
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:26,994
on the temporal isometry, charted
the ship to its destination, and...

72
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,960
parked us right along side.

73
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,555
Parked us? We haven't landed.

74
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:36,560
Of course we've landed.
I just landed her.

75
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,280
But it didn't make the noise.

76
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,640
- What noise?
- You know, the...

77
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:51,240
It's not supposed to make that noise.
You leave the brakes on.

78
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,440
Yeah, well, it's a brilliant noise.
I love that noise.

79
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:57,810
Come along, Pond, let's have a look.

80
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:00,493
No, wait! Environment checks.

81
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:02,677
Oh, yes, sorry! Quite right.

82
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,929
Environment checks.

83
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:10,420
- Nice out.
- We're somewhere in the Garn Belt.

84
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,721
There's an atmosphere.
Early indications suggest...

85
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:16,080
We're on Alfava Metraxis, the
seventh planet of the Dundra System.

86
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,680
Oxygen-rich atmosphere, toxins in
the soft band, 11-hour day, and...

87
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:23,805
chances of rain later.

88
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:26,306
He thinks he's so hot
when he does that.

89
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,080
How come you can fly the TARDIS?

90
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
I had lessons from the very best.

91
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:32,280
Well, yeah.

92
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
It's a shame you were busy that day.

93
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,960
Right then, why did they land here?

94
00:07:40,385 --> 00:07:42,777
- They didn't land.
- Sorry?

95
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:46,684
You should've checked
the Home Box - it crashed.

96
00:07:57,157 --> 00:08:00,263
Explain! Who is that and how
did she do that museum thing?

97
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:03,230
It's a long story and I don't
know most of it. Off we go!

98
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,560
- What r'you doing?
- Leaving. She's where she wants to,

99
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,237
- let's go where we want.
- Are you basically running away?

100
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,174
- Why?
- Cos she's my future.

101
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,370
- Can you run away from that?
- From anything I like.

102
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,914
Time is not the boss of me.

103
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:17,000
- Hang on, is that a planet out there?
- Yes, of course it's a planet.

104
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,928
You promised me a planet.

105
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,820
Five minutes?

106
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:25,356
- Five minutes!
- Yes!

107
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:27,765
But that's all,
cos I'm telling you now,

108
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:30,635
that woman is not dragging me
into anything!

109
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,144
What caused it to crash? Not me.

110
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:53,711
The airlock would've sealed
seconds after you blew it.

111
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:56,160
According to the Home Box, the
warp engines had a phase-shift.

112
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:57,663
No survivors.

113
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:01,183
A phase-shift would have to be
sabotage. I did warn them.

114
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:02,792
About what?

115
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:05,280
Well, at least the building
was empty. Aplan temple.

116
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,363
Unoccupied for centuries.

117
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,440
Aren't you going to introduce us?

118
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,360
I'm going to be a Professor
some day, am I?

119
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:23,224
How exciting!

120
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:25,989
Spoilers!

121
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,639
But who is she
and how did she do that?

122
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,560
She just left you a note
in a museum!

123
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:33,054
Two things always guaranteed
to turn up in a museum.

124
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:36,774
The Home Box of category four
starliner and, sooner or later,

125
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:38,760
Him.

126
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,568
- It's how he keeps score.
- I know.

127
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:43,999
It's hilarious, isn't it?

128
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,358
I'm nobody's taxi service!

129
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:49,327
I'm not gonna be there to catch you
every time you feel like

130
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,220
jumping out of a space ship.

131
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,448
And you are so wrong.

132
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:57,194
There's one survivor.

133
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:02,160
There's a thing in the belly of
that ship that can't ever die.

134
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:11,560
Now he's listening!
You lot in orbit yet?

135
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,450
I saw it land.
I'm at the crash site.

136
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,680
Try and home in on my signal.

137
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:19,360
Can you sonic me?

138
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,440
I need to boost the signal
so we can use it as a beacon.

139
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
You so-niced her!

140
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,360
We have a minute. Shall we?

141
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:33,585
Where were we up to?

142
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,520
- Have we done the Bone Meadows?
- What's the book?

143
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,080
Stay away from it.

144
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:40,678
- What is it though?
- Her diary.

145
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:42,816
- Our diary.
- Her past, my...

146
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:44,637
future.

147
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,480
Time travel. We keep meeting
in the wrong order.

148
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,066
You promised me an army,
Doctor Song.

149
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,683
I promised you
the equivalent of an army.

150
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,360
This is the Doctor.

151
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,680
Father Octavian, Sir. Bishop, second
class. 20 clerics at my command.

152
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,560
The troops are already in the
drop ship and landing shortly.

153
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,280
Doctor Song was helping us
with a covert investigation.

154
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:28,440
Has Doctor Song explained
what we're dealing with?

155
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:33,632
What do you know
of the Weeping Angels?

156
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,836
The Angel, as far as we know,
is still trapped in the ship.

157
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:41,555
Our mission is to get
inside and neutralise it.

158
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:43,397
We can't get through up top,

159
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:45,320
we'd be too close to the drives.

160
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:50,283
According to this,
behind the cliff face,

161
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:53,160
there's a network of catacombs
leading right up to the temple.

162
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,591
We can blow
through the base of the cliffs,

163
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:57,932
get into the entrance chamber,
then make our way up.

164
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,880
- Oh, good.
- Good, sir?

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
Catacombs, probably dark ones.
Dark catacombs, great!

166
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:06,720
Technically, I think it's
called a maze of the dead.

167
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,520
You can stop any time you like.

168
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,119
Excuse me, sir.

169
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:19,268
You're letting people
call you "sir". You never do that.

170
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,360
So, whatever a Weeping Angel is,
it's really bad, yeah?

171
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,293
Now that's interesting...

172
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,796
You're still here. Which part of "Wait
in the TARDIS till I tell you it's safe"

173
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,713
was so confusing?

174
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,846
Are you all Mr Grumpy Face today?

175
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:37,069
A Weeping Angel, Amy,
is the deadliest,

176
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,953
most powerful, most malevolent life
form evolution has ever produced,

177
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,661
now one is trapped inside that
wreckage and I'm supposed to climb in

178
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:45,999
with a screwdriver and a torch, and
assuming I survive the radiation,

179
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:48,280
and the whole ship
doesn't blow up in my face,

180
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,240
do something incredibly clever
which I haven't thought of yet.

181
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,080
That's my day, that's what
I'm up to. Any questions?

182
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:56,080
Is River Song your wife?

183
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,627
Cos she's someone from your future,
and the way she talks to you,

184
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,194
I've never seen anyone do that.

185
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,040
She's kinda like, you know,
"Heel, boy!"

186
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,760
She's Mrs Doctor from the future,
isn't she?

187
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,680
Is she gonna be your wife one day?

188
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,849
You're right.

189
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,930
I am definitely Mr
Grumpy Face today.

190
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,520
Oops! Her indoors!

191
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,322
Father Octavian!

192
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,264
Why do they call them Father?

193
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:31,088
He's their Bishop,
they're his clerics.

194
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,777
It's the 51st Century,
the Church has moved on.

195
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,760
What do you think?

196
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,285
It's from the security cameras
in the Byzantium vault.

197
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,667
I ripped it when I was on board.
Sorry about the quality.

198
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,745
- It's four seconds. Put it on loop.
- Yeah. It's an Angel.

199
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:58,203
Hands covering its face.

200
00:13:58,323 --> 00:13:59,920
You've encountered
the Angels before?

201
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,828
Once, on Earth, a long time ago.

202
00:14:01,948 --> 00:14:03,870
But those were scavengers,
barely surviving.

203
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,160
It's just a statue.

204
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,917
- It's a statue when you see it.
- Where did it come from?

205
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:10,680
Oh, pulled from the ruins of
Razbahan, end of last century.

206
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,084
It's been in private hands
ever since, dormant all that time.

207
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:16,612
There's a difference
between dormant and patient.

208
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,682
What's that mean, it's a statue
when you see it?

209
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:23,047
The Weeping Angels can only move
if they're unseen.

210
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,880
So legend has it.

211
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,776
No, it's not legend.
It's a quantum lock.

212
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,997
In the sight of any living creature,

213
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:31,120
the Angels literally cease to exist.

214
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,000
They're just stone.
The ultimate defence mechanism.

215
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,968
- What, being a stone?
- Being a stone...

216
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:41,160
until you turn your back.

217
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,906
The hyperdrive would've split
on impact.

218
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:49,760
The whole ship will be flooded
with radiation, cracked electrons,

219
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,898
gravity storms, deadly to almost any
living thing.

220
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,939
- Deadly to an Angel?
- Dinner to an Angel.

221
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,790
The longer we leave it, the stronger
it will grow. Who built that temple?

222
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,106
The Aplans. The indigenous life-form.
They died out 400 years ago.

223
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:04,365
200 years later,
the planet was terraformed.

224
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,154
Currently, there are
six billion human colonists.

225
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,830
You lot, you're everywhere!
Like rabbits!

226
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,556
I'll never get done saving you.

227
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:14,680
Sir, if there is a clear and present
danger to the local population...

228
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:17,437
There is. Bad as it gets. Bishop!

229
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,194
Lock and load!

230
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:21,314
Verger, how we doing with those
explosives?

231
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,520
- Dr Song, with me.
- Two minutes.

232
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,040
Sweetie, I need you.

233
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,969
Anybody need me? Nobody?

234
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:30,517
Nobody?

235
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,585
I found this. Definitive work
on the Angels. Well, the only one.

236
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:51,810
Written by a madman, barely readable,
but I've marked a few passages.

237
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,379
Not bad, bit slow in the middle,
didn't you hate his girlfriend?

238
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:56,280
No, hang on, wait, wait!

239
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,960
Did you have more
than one clip of the Angel?

240
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,440
No, just the four seconds.

241
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,904
This book is wrong! What's wrong
with this book, it's wrong.

242
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:35,277
It's so strange when you go all
baby-face.

243
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,840
How early is this for you?

244
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,360
Very early.

245
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:40,767
So you don't know who I am yet?

246
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,400
How do you know who I am?
I don't always look the same.

247
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,422
I've got pictures of all your faces.

248
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:48,760
You never show up in the right order
though. I need the spotter's guide.

249
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,424
Pictures? Why aren't there pictures?

250
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,566
You're just a recording.

251
00:17:27,415 --> 00:17:28,960
You can't move.

252
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,637
This whole book, it's a warning
about the Weeping Angels.

253
00:18:02,757 --> 00:18:05,440
So why no pictures? Why not
show us what to look out for?

254
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,000
- There was a bit about images.
- Yes! Hang on...

255
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:13,280
That which holds the image of
an angel becomes itself an angel.

256
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:18,091
Doctor!

257
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,163
What does that mean?

258
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:23,777
"An image of a Angel
becomes itself an Angel."

259
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
Doctor! It's in the room!

260
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,120
- Amy!
- Doctor!

261
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:34,488
Are you all right? What's happening?

262
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:36,200
Doctor!

263
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,280
It's coming out of the television.

264
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,960
- The Angel is here.
- Don't take your eyes off it!

265
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,640
It can't move if you're looking.
What's wrong? It's deadlocked.

266
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,200
- There is no deadlock.
- Don't even blink, Amy!

267
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,200
Doctor!

268
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,759
- What are you doing?
- Cutting the power.

269
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,240
It's using the screen,
I'm turning the screen off.

270
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,393
It's no good,
it's deadlocked the whole system.

271
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:57,202
- There's no deadlock. There is now!
- Help me!

272
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:59,520
- Can you turn it off?
- Doctor!

273
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,506
- The screen, can you turn it off?
- I tried.

274
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:03,360
Try again but don't
take your eyes off the Angel.

275
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm not!

276
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,700
Each time it moves,
it'll move faster. Don't even blink.

277
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:12,680
I'm not blinking! Have you ever
tried not blinking?

278
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,160
- It just keeps switching back on!
- Yeah, it's the Angel.

279
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,640
But it's just a recording.

280
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,880
No, anything that takes
the image of an Angel

281
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,007
is an Angel.

282
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:42,203
What are you doing?

283
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:43,840
I'm trying to cut through.
It's not even warm.

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,960
There is no way in,
it's not physically possible.

285
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,960
Doctor!

286
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,000
What's it gonna do to me?

287
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,187
Just keep looking at it.
Don't stop looking!

288
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:53,452
Just tell me.

289
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:57,080
Just tell me. Tell me!

290
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,120
Amy, not the eyes. Look anywhere
but don't look at the eyes.

291
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,598
- Why?
- What is it?

292
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:05,997
The eyes are not the windows
of the soul, they are the doors.

293
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:07,682
Beware what may enter there.

294
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:10,066
- Doctor, what did you say?
- Don't look at the eyes!

295
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:13,160
No, about images,
what did you say about images?

296
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:16,911
Whatever holds the image
of an angel, is an angel.

297
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:19,451
OK...

298
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:22,400
Hold this.

299
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:26,835
One, two, three, four...

300
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:34,239
I froze it!

301
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,021
There was a sort of blip on the tape
and I froze it on the blip.

302
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,360
It wasn't the image of an angel
any more.

303
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:41,840
That was good, yeah?

304
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,240
It was, wasn't it?

305
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,795
- That was pretty good.
- That was amazing!

306
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,520
- River, hug Amy.
- Why?

307
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,440
- Cos I'm busy.
- I'm fine.

308
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,960
You're brilliant!

309
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:54,280
Thanks. Yeah.
I kind of creamed it, didn't I?

310
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,520
So it was here? That was the Angel?
That was a projection of the Angel.

311
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,049
It's reaching out, getting a good
look at us. It's no longer dormant.

312
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,935
It's gone positive!

313
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:11,320
Doctor! We're through!

314
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,800
OK. Now it starts.

315
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,049
- Coming?
- Yeah, coming.

316
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:26,640
There's just... something in my eye.

317
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,319
- Do we have a gravity globe?
- Grav globe.

318
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:47,160
Where are we? What is this?

319
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,120
It's an Aplan mortarium.

320
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,440
Sometimes called a maze of the dead.

321
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,680
And what's that?

322
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,840
If you happen to be a
creature of living stone.

323
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:07,600
The perfect hiding place.

324
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,400
I guess this makes
it a bit trickier.

325
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,720
A bit, yeah.

326
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,174
A stone angel on the loose
amongst stone statues.

327
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,440
Harder than I'd prayed for.

328
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:20,600
A needle in a haystack.

329
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,031
A needle that looks like hay.
A hay-like needle. Of death.

330
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:26,640
A hay-alike needle of death
in a haystack of, er, statues.

331
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,392
No, yours was fine.

332
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,560
Right. Check every single statue
in this chamber.

333
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,280
You know what you're looking for.
Complete visual inspection.

334
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,840
One question, how do we fight it?

335
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:39,873
We find it, and hope.

336
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:48,400
He doesn't know yet, does he?
Who and what you are.

337
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:50,720
It's too early in his time stream.

338
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,760
Make sure he doesn't work
it out, or he's not gonna help us.

339
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,333
I won't let you down.

340
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,703
Believe you me, I have no
intention of going back to prison.

341
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:05,741
Sir? Side chamber. One visible exit.

342
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:10,900
Check it out. Angelo, go with him.

343
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,111
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

344
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,214
So, what's a maze of the dead?

345
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,680
Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds.

346
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,480
It's just a labyrinth with
dead people buried in the walls.

347
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,040
OK, that was fairly bad.

348
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:15,560
Right give me your arm...

349
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:20,027
This won't hurt a bit.

350
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,480
There, you see. I lied.

351
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,400
It's a viro-stabiliser.

352
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,514
Stabilises your metabolism against
radiation, drive burn, anything.

353
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,190
You're going to need it when we get
up to that ship.

354
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,440
So what's he like?
In the future, I mean.

355
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,991
Cos you know him in the future,
don't you?

356
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:42,480
The Doctor?

357
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:44,680
The Doctor's the Doctor.

358
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:51,145
That's very helpful.
Mind if I write that down?

359
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:54,160
- Yes, we are.
- Sorry, what?

360
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:57,475
- Talking about you.
- I wasn't listening, I'm busy.

361
00:24:58,605 --> 00:24:59,760
The other way up.

362
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:08,280
- Yeah.
- You're so his wife.

363
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,240
Oh, Amy, Amy, Amy! This is
the Doctor we're talking about.

364
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,693
Do you really think it could be
anything that simple?

365
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:15,243
Yep.

366
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,080
You're good.
I'm not saying you're right...

367
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:24,700
but you are very good.

368
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:33,440
Can you believe this?
We're hunting statues.

369
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:37,818
Better than chasing lava snakes.

370
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,120
Actually, lava snakes
weren't that bad.

371
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:21,460
Who's there? Is someone there?

372
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:25,512
Angelo?

373
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:28,986
Angelo!

374
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:36,141
Christian, is that you?

375
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:38,832
<i>Angelo, come and see this.</i>

376
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,530
- What is it?
- <i>Just come and see it.</i>

377
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,680
It's not a school trip, just...

378
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:52,001
tell me.

379
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:53,469
No, really,

380
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,921
come and see.

381
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,183
Sorry. Sorry, I thought...
I thought it looked at me.

382
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:24,811
We know what the Angel looks like.
Is that the Angel?

383
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
- No, sir.
- No, sir, it is not!

384
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,510
According to the Doctor,
we are facing an enemy

385
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,760
of unknowable power
and infinite evil.

386
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,280
So it would be good,
it would be very good,

387
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,489
if we could all remain calm
in the presence of decor.

388
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:38,720
What's your name?

389
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:40,707
Bob, sir.

390
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,867
That's a great name. I love Bob.

391
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,280
It's a Sacred Name.

392
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,190
We all have Sacred Names,

393
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:48,941
they're given to us
in the service of the Church.

394
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:50,598
Sacred Bob.

395
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,680
More like Scared Bob now, eh?

396
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,293
- Yes, sir.
- Ah, good.

397
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:59,353
Scared keeps you fast.
Anyone in this room

398
00:27:59,473 --> 00:28:01,240
who isn't scared is a moron.

399
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:04,706
Carry on.

400
00:28:09,752 --> 00:28:11,800
We'll be moving into the maze
in two minutes.

401
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:14,176
You stay with Christian and Angelo.

402
00:28:14,296 --> 00:28:15,760
Guard the approach.

403
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:26,640
Isn't there a chance
this lot's just gonna collapse?

404
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,280
There's a whole ship up there.

405
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,287
Incredible builders, the Aplans.

406
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:32,360
Had dinner with their
chief architect once.

407
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:35,173
- Two heads are better than one.
- You mean you helped him?

408
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:38,488
No, I mean he had two heads. That book.
The very end, what did it say?

409
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:39,771
Hang on.

410
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:41,762
Read it to me.

411
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:47,504
"What if we had ideas that could
think for themselves?

412
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:50,392
"What if one day our dreams
no longer needed us?

413
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:54,587
"When these things occur and are held
to be true, the time will be upon us.

414
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,720
"The Time...

415
00:28:57,398 --> 00:28:58,440
of Angels."

416
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,673
<i>Hey, Angelo.</i>

417
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:02,395
<i>Christian?</i>

418
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,319
<i>Where are you?</i>

419
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:15,018
Are we there yet?
It's a hell of a climb.

420
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,403
The maze is on six levels
representing the ascent of the soul.

421
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:20,277
Only two levels to go.

422
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:22,449
Lovely species, the Aplans.

423
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:24,610
We should visit them some time.

424
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:27,889
I thought they were all dead.

425
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,436
So's Virginia Woolf.
I'm on her bowling team.

426
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:33,994
Very relaxed, sort of cheerful.
That's having two heads.

427
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:36,234
You're never short of a snog
with an extra head.

428
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,960
Doctor, there's something.
I don't know what it is.

429
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,359
Yeah, something wrong.

430
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,754
Don't know what it is yet either.
Then they've started having laws

431
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:46,793
against self-marrying.
But that's the church for you.

432
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,960
No offense, Bishop.

433
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:53,536
Quite a lot taken,
if that's all right, Doctor.

434
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:04,276
Lowest point in the wreckage
is only about 50 feet up from here.

435
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,625
That way.

436
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:08,120
Church had a point,
if you think about it.

437
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,526
The divorces must have been messy.

438
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:16,240
What's wrong?

439
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:29,400
Exactly.

440
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,400
How could we not notice that?

441
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,008
Low level perception filter,
or maybe we're thick.

442
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:35,685
- What's wrong?
- Nobody move.

443
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:37,726
Everyone stay exactly
where they are.

444
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:41,712
Bishop, I am truly sorry. I've made
a mistake and we are all in danger.

445
00:30:41,832 --> 00:30:42,840
What danger?

446
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:46,720
The Aplans.

447
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:50,672
- The Aplans?
- They've got two heads.

448
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:51,905
I get that. So?

449
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:53,775
So why don't the statues?

450
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,680
Everyone, over there. Just move,

451
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,193
don't ask questions, don't speak.

452
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:09,480
I want you all to switch off
your torches.

453
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:11,018
Sir?

454
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:12,836
Just do it.

455
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:21,388
I'm going to turn off
this one too, just for a moment.

456
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:23,080
Are you sure about this?

457
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,340
No.

458
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,960
Oh, my God! They've moved.

459
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,560
They're Angels.

460
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:53,480
- All of them!
- But they can't be.

461
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:55,494
Clerics, keep watching them.

462
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:05,880
Every statue in this maze,
every single one,

463
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,283
is a Weeping Angel.

464
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,440
And they're coming after us.

465
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:28,810
<i>Bob, come and see this.</i>

466
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:31,144
Angelo?

467
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:34,607
<i>Come and see what we've found.</i>

468
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:38,162
Are you with Christian?
The Bishop said you'd be five minutes.

469
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:40,221
<i>I'm here, Bob. Come and see this.</i>

470
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:43,640
Where are you?

471
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:45,507
<i>Through the arch, Bob.</i>

472
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:47,920
<i>Honestly, you've got
to come and see this.</i>

473
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:49,545
What have you found?

474
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:50,794
<i>Come and see.</i>

475
00:32:51,892 --> 00:32:53,561
No. What is it?

476
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,321
<i>Come and see.</i>

477
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:23,802
There was only one Angel on the ship.
Just the one, I swear.

478
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:25,920
- Could they have been here already?
- The Aplans,

479
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,379
- how did they die out?
- Nobody knows.

480
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:31,167
We know.
They don't look like Angels.

481
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:33,160
They're not fast.
You said they were fast.

482
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,106
- They should have had us by now.
- They're dying. Losing their form.

483
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:37,990
They've been here
for centuries, starving.

484
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,700
- Losing their image.
- And their image is their power.

485
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:42,240
Power.

486
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,597
Power!

487
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:47,028
Don't you see? All that radiation
spilling out, the drive burn.

488
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:49,360
The crash wasn't an accident,
it was a rescue mission,

489
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,960
for the Angels. We're in the middle
of an army and it's waking up.

490
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:55,100
We need to get out of here fast.

491
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,600
Bob, Angelo, Christian,
come in, please.

492
00:33:58,815 --> 00:34:00,800
- Any of you, come in!
- <i>It's Bob, sir.</i>

493
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,879
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

494
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,804
Bob, are Angelo
and Christian with you?

495
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,560
All the statues are active.

496
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,327
- I repeat, all the statues are active!
- <i>I know, sir.</i>

497
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,199
<i>Angelo and Christian are dead, sir.</i>

498
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,939
<i>The statues killed them, sir.</i>

499
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:14,364
Bob, Sacred Bob,
it's me, the Doctor.

500
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:16,466
- Where are you now?
- I'm talking to...

501
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:17,400
Shut up!

502
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,025
<i>I'm on my way up to you, sir,
I'm homing on your signal.</i>

503
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:22,678
Well done, Bob.
Scared keeps you fast, told you.

504
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:24,589
Your friends,
what did the Angel do to them?

505
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:26,141
<i>Snapped their necks, sir.</i>

506
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,679
That's odd. That's not how the Angels
kill you, they displace you in time.

507
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:32,520
Unless they needed
the bodies for something.

508
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,947
Did you check their data packs
for vital signs?

509
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:39,094
We may be able
to initiate a rescue plan.

510
00:34:39,214 --> 00:34:41,559
Don't be an idiot!
The Angels don't leave you alive!

511
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,846
Keep running, but tell me,
how did you escape?

512
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:47,117
<i>I didn't escape, sir.
The Angel killed me, too.</i>

513
00:34:52,781 --> 00:34:54,413
What do you mean
the Angel killed you?

514
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:57,526
<i>Snapped my neck, sir.
Wasn't as painless as I expected</i>

515
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:59,826
<i>but it was pretty quick,
so that was something.</i>

516
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,200
If you're dead,
how can I be talking to you?

517
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,823
<i>You're not talking to me, sir.
The Angel has no voice.</i>

518
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,520
<i>It stripped my cerebral cortex
and re-animated a version</i>

519
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,360
<i>of my consciousness to communicate
with you. Sorry about the confusion.</i>

520
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,400
So when you say you're
on your way up...

521
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,040
<i>It's the Angel that's coming, sir.</i>

522
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,600
- Yes.
- <i>No way out.</i>

523
00:35:17,258 --> 00:35:18,880
Then we get out through
the wreckage.

524
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:21,526
- All of you run!
- Doctor

525
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,440
Yes, I'm coming, just go.

526
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,466
Called you an idiot. Sorry, there's no
way we could have rescued them.

527
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:34,552
I know that, sir. And when you've
flown away in your little blue box,

528
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:36,440
I'll explain that to their families.

529
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:45,637
Angel Bob, which Angel am I talking to?
The one from the ship?

530
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,653
The other Angels
are still restoring.

531
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,418
So the Angel is not in the wreckage.
Thank you.

532
00:35:55,134 --> 00:35:56,645
Don't wait for me, go, run.

533
00:35:56,765 --> 00:35:57,760
I can't!

534
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:02,127
- No, really I can't.
- Why not?

535
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:05,117
Look at it.
Look at my hand. It's stone!

536
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,360
There it is - the Byzantium.

537
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,120
It's got to be 30 feet.

538
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,280
How do we get up there?

539
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:32,120
Check all these exits.
I want them all secure.

540
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:36,157
- You looked into the eyes of an Angel?
- I couldn't stop myself. I tried.

541
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,600
It's messing with you.
Your hand is not made of stone.

542
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:39,916
It is. Look at it!

543
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:43,400
It's in your mind. I promise you.
You can move that hand. You can let go.

544
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,040
I can't, OK?
I've tried and I can't. It's stone.

545
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:49,037
The Angel is gonna come

546
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,091
it's gonna turn this light off,

547
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,880
and then there's nothing I can do
to stop it. So do it, concentrate,

548
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,583
- move your hand!
- I can't.

549
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:58,040
- Then we're both going to die.
- You're not going to die.

550
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,720
They'll kill the lights.

551
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,280
You've got to go, you know you have.

552
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:06,288
You've got all that stuff with River
and that's all got to happen.

553
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:07,600
You can't die here!

554
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,783
Time can be re-written,
it doesn't work like that.

555
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,766
Keep your eyes on it. Don't blink.

556
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:16,049
Run!

557
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:17,920
I'm not going,
I'm not leaving you here.

558
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,441
I don't need you to die for me,
do I look that clingy?

559
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:22,293
- You can move your hand.
- It's stone.

560
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:23,526
It's not stone!

561
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:26,732
Those people
up there will die without you.

562
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:29,097
If you stay with me,
you'll have as good as killed them.

563
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:31,948
Amy Pond, you are magnificent.
And I'm sorry.

564
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:35,240
It's OK. I understand.

565
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:37,497
You've got to leave me.

566
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:39,678
I'm not leaving you, never.
I'm sorry about this.

567
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,920
See, not stone. Now run!

568
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,840
- You bit me!
- Yep and you're alive.

569
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I've got a mark! Look at my hand!

570
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,665
And you're alive, did I mention?

571
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:50,655
Blimey, your teeth!
Have you got space teeth?

572
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:52,080
Alive. All I'm saying.

573
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,755
The statues are advancing
along all corridors.

574
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,534
- Sir, my torch keeps flickering.
- They all do.

575
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,976
So does the gravity globe.

576
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:05,871
Clerics, we're down to four men.
Expect incoming.

577
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,960
Yeah, it's the Angels.

578
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,640
They're coming. And they're draining
the power for themselves.

579
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,793
Which means
we won't be able to see them.

580
00:38:13,913 --> 00:38:15,240
We can't stay here.

581
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,960
There are more incoming!

582
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,360
Any suggestions?

583
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,560
The statues are advancing
on all sides

584
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,338
we don't have the climbing equipment
to reach the Byzantium.

585
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,400
There's no way up,
no way back, no way out.

586
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,000
No pressure, but this is usually
when you have a really good idea.

587
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:33,040
There's always a way out.

588
00:38:36,332 --> 00:38:37,600
There's always a way out.

589
00:38:41,335 --> 00:38:44,960
- <i>Can I speak to the Doctor, please?</i>
- Hello, Angels. What's your problem?

590
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,855
<i>Your power will not
last much longer,</i>

591
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:49,929
<i>and the Angels will be
with you shortly. Sorry, sir.</i>

592
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:51,470
Why are you telling me this?

593
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,000
<i>There's something
the Angels are very keen.</i>

594
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:55,283
Which is?

595
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,144
<i>I died in fear.</i>

596
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:58,880
I'm sorry?

597
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,355
<i>You told me my fear
would keep me alive</i>

598
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,720
<i>but I died afraid,
in pain and alone.</i>

599
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,520
<i>You made me trust you,
and when it mattered, you let me down.</i>

600
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,080
What are they doing?

601
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,200
They're trying to make him angry.

602
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,519
<i>I'm sorry, sir. The Angels were
very keen for you to know that.</i>

603
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,749
Well then, the Angels have made
their second mistake

604
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:22,012
because I'm not going
to let that pass.

605
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,880
You're dead, but I swear to whatever
is left of you, they will be sorrier.

606
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,333
<i>But you're trapped, sir,
and about to die.</i>

607
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:30,620
I'm trapped.
Speaking of traps,

608
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,760
this trap has got
a great big mistake in it.

609
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,560
A great big, whopping mistake!

610
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,991
<i>What mistake, sir?</i>

611
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:38,080
Trust me.

612
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:40,577
Trust me?

613
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:42,200
- Always.
- You lot - trust me?

614
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:48,240
- Sir, two more incoming!
- We have faith, sir.

615
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,200
Then give me your gun.

616
00:39:53,597 --> 00:39:55,960
I'm about to do something
incredibly stupid and dangerous.

617
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,120
When I do... jump.

618
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,680
Jump where?

619
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,614
High as you can. Come on,
leap of faith. On my signal.

620
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,493
- What signal?
- You won't miss it.

621
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:07,165
<i>Sorry, can I ask again?
You mentioned a mistake?</i>

622
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:09,480
Oh, big mistake. Huge.

623
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,200
There's one thing
you never put in a trap,

624
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,782
if you're smart,
if you value your continued existence,

625
00:40:14,902 --> 00:40:16,960
if you have any plans
about seeing tomorrow,

626
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,191
there is one thing you never, ever
put in a trap.

627
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:20,720
<i>And what would that be, sir?</i>

628
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:24,774
Me!

629
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,280
Do not blink...

630
00:41:00,635 --> 00:41:02,182
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

631
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:03,920
It's coming, I can feel it.

632
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,040
If you open your eyes now for more
than a second, you will die.

633
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:11,120
That's like the crack from my bedroom
wall when I was a little girl.

634
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,000
That's extremely very not good.

635
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:15,680
- <i>The power's failing.</i>
- <i>We're surrounded.</i>

636
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,440
In the dark we're finished.

637
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,080
On my count then...
Three, two, one.

638
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:22,400
Fire!

639
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,680
Keep your eyes shut and keep moving.

640
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,072
<i>You have to do this.</i>
It's never going to work.

641
00:41:29,192 --> 00:41:30,440
What else have you got?

642
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,200
- <i>Not leaving without you.</i>
- <i>You are.</i>

643
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,125
<i>Come on!</i>
