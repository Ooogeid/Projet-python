1
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:10,280
No, Amy, it's definitely not
the fifth moon of Sinda Callista.

2
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:12,391
I think I can see a Ryman's.

3
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:28,441
It's saying we're on Earth!
Essex, Colchester.

4
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:39,680
It's taking off again.

5
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:43,800
Can you hear me?

6
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,663
<i>Hello? Hello, please?
Hello?</i>

7
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,720
<i>I need your help.
There's been an accident.</i>

8
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:17,072
<i>Please, help me.</i>

9
00:01:29,058 --> 00:01:29,817
Hello?

10
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:32,320
<i>Please, will you help me?</i>

11
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:35,920
Help you?

12
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:39,500
- What's wrong?
- <i>Something terrible's happened.</i>

13
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:41,560
<i>Please help me.</i>

14
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:03,120
- Craig, what's that on the ceiling?
- What's what on the ceiling? That!

15
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,920
It's coming from upstairs.
Who lives up there again?

16
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:10,200
Just some bloke.

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,560
So what's the plan tonight?
Pizza, booze, telly?

18
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,480
Pizza, booze, telly.

19
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:21,124
What is he doing up there?

20
00:02:27,335 --> 00:02:30,131
- You put the advert up yet?
- Did it today, paper shop window.

21
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,760
"One furnished room available
immediately, shared kitchen,

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,499
"bathroom, with 27-year-old male,
non smoker,

23
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,440
"£400 pcm - per calendar month -
suit young professional."

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,749
Mmm, sounds ideal.
That's your mission in life, Craig.

25
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,120
Find me a man!

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
Otherwise
you'll have to settle for me.

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,756
You'll have to settle for me first.

28
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,845
Oh, Melina again. What?

29
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,621
Right.

30
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,480
But I've kind of got plans.

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,560
- No, nothing important, just Craig.
- Thanks, Soph!

32
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,160
Sorry, you know what I mean!

33
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:03,710
I'll talk to Craig, OK.

34
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,703
Now she's having a Dylan crisis
on top of the Clare crisis.

35
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:08,450
It could be another all-nighter.

36
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,937
I'm sorry, but I really should go.

37
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,443
Do you mind if I go?

38
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:15,240
No, not at all.
No, honestly, course not, go.

39
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,086
- Cos I could stay. We've got plans.
- No, go on.

40
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:20,487
Just pizza.

41
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,280
It's just pizza.

42
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:28,720
Right, I'm going.

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,280
All right, then.
Well, I'll see you soon.

44
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:35,880
All right, and give me a call,
I hope everything's OK.

45
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:37,440
Thanks, sorry.

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,840
Just tell her.

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,760
Just tell her. "I love you."

48
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:06,000
"I love you."

49
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,320
Just:
"Hey, I don't know if you knew..."

50
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:16,759
Every time!

51
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:20,520
I love you.

52
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:27,443
I love you!

53
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,636
Well, that's good, cos I'm
your new lodger.

54
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:35,400
Do you know, this is going
to be easier than I expected!

Transcript : Red Bee Media Ltd

Synchro : Citrøn, Darkevil, Dauphinus,
Delphiki, Imaginos, Jojo

59
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,520
But I only just put the advert up
today, I didn't put my address.

60
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,120
Well, aren't you lucky I came along?
More lucky than you know.

61
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,681
Less of a young professional,

62
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,160
more of an ancient amateur,

63
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,280
but frankly I'm an absolute dream.

64
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,646
Hang on, mate, I don't know
if I want you staying, and

65
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,768
give me back those keys,
you can't have!

66
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:31,240
Quite right. Have some rent.

67
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,480
That's probably quite a lot,
isn't it? Looks like a lot.

68
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,743
Is it a lot? I can never tell.

69
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,912
Don't spend it all on sweets.
Unless you like sweets. I like sweets.

70
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,880
That's how we greet each other
nowadays, isn't it? I'm the Doctor.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,960
Well, they call me the Doctor,
I don't know why.

72
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,120
I call me the Doctor too.
Still don't know why.

73
00:05:58,464 --> 00:05:59,920
Craig Owens. The Doctor?

74
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
- Who lives upstairs?
- Just some bloke.

75
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,488
- What does he look like?
- Normal. He's very quiet.

76
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,000
Usually.

77
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:10,240
Sorry, who are you again?
Hello?!

78
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Excuse me?

79
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:14,419
I suppose that's...

80
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,150
dry rot?

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,040
- Or damp. Or mildew.
- Or none of the above.

82
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,640
I'll get someone to fix it.

83
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm good at fixing rot.
Call me the Rotmeister.

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
No, I'm the Doctor,
don't call me the Rotmeister.

85
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,796
This is the most beautiful parlour
I have ever seen,

86
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,960
you're obviously
a man of impeccable taste.

87
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,800
I can stay, Craig, can't I?
Say I can.

88
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,000
You haven't even seen the room.
Your room.

89
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,686
My room?
Oh, yes, my room, my room.

90
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:39,361
Take me to my room!

91
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:43,912
This is Mark's old room,
he owns the place,

92
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:46,400
moved out about a month ago.
An uncle he'd never even heard of

93
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,960
died and left a load of money.

94
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:49,482
How very convenient.

95
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,120
This'll do just right. In fact...

96
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:01,960
No time to lose. I'll take it.

97
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,415
Ah... you'll want to see
my credentials.

98
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:06,480
There...
National Insurance number...

99
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:08,200
NHS number...

100
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,129
References...

101
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,448
Is that a reference
from the Archbishop of Canterbury?

102
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:14,680
I'm his special favourite.

103
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,760
Are you hungry? I'm hungry.

104
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,314
I haven't got anything in.

105
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,222
You've got everything I need

106
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,357
for an omelette <i>fines herbes</i>!
<i>Pour deux</i>!

107
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,388
So who's the girl on the fridge?

108
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:29,831
My friend. Sophie.

109
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,599
- Girlfriend?
- A friend who is a girl.

110
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,134
There's nothing going on.

111
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:34,990
That's completely normal.
Works for me.

112
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,960
We met at work about a year ago
at the call centre.

113
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,198
Oh, really, a communications
exchange? That could be handy.

114
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:43,738
Firm's going down though. The bosses are
using a totally rubbish business model.

115
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:46,687
I know what they should do,
I got a plan all worked out, but

116
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:50,243
I'm just a phone drone, I can't
go running in saying I know best.

117
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:52,400
Why am I telling you this?
I don't even know you.

118
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,932
I've got one of those faces.

119
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:56,875
People never stop blurting out
their plans while I'm around.

120
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,440
Right, where's your stuff?

121
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,160
Don't worry, it'll materialise,

122
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,560
if all goes to plan.

123
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:12,200
Oh, which one, which one?! No!

124
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,720
Why won't you land?!

125
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,640
Oh, that was incredible!

126
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:25,360
That was absolutely brilliant.
Where did you learn to cook?

127
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:28,280
Paris, in the 18th century.
No, hang on,

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
that's not recent, is it? 17th?

129
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:33,520
No, no, no, 20th. Sorry, I'm not used
to doing them in the right order.

130
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,360
Has anyone ever told you
that you're a bit weird?

131
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,920
They never really stop.
Ever been to Paris, Craig?

132
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,440
Nah, I can't see the point of Paris.

133
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,572
- I'm not much of a traveller.
- I can tell from your sofa.

134
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,780
My sofa? You're starting to look
like it.

135
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,372
Thanks, mate, that's lovely!

136
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,960
No, I like it here.

137
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,440
I'd miss it, I'd miss...

138
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,240
- Those keys?
- What?

139
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:02,297
You're sort of...

140
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:05,600
... fondling them.

141
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:07,702
- I'm holding them.
- Right.

142
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:08,918
Anyway...

143
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,520
these...

144
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,600
these are your keys.

145
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:15,092
I can stay?

146
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:18,729
Yeah, you're weird and you
can cook, it's good enough for me.

147
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,640
Outdoor, front door,

148
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,840
- your door.
- My door. My place. My gaff!

149
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,868
Me with a key.

150
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,575
And listen, Mark and I,
we had an arrangement where

151
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:33,695
if you ever need me out of your
hair, just give me a shout, OK?

152
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:38,560
Why would I want that?

153
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,158
In case you want to bring someone
round. A girlfriend or...

154
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:43,880
a boyfriend?

155
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:46,400
Oh, I will.
I'll shout if that happens.

156
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,920
Yes. Something like...

157
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,840
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS!

158
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:54,120
By the way, that...

159
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,009
the rot.

160
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,749
I've got the strangest feeling
we shouldn't touch it.

161
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:10,795
Earth to Pond, Earth to Pond.

162
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:12,297
Come in, Pond.

163
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,355
Oooh. Sorry!

164
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,200
Could you not wreck
my new earpiece, Pond?

165
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,480
No, I mean, he seems a laugh.

166
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,400
He's a bit weird,
good weird, you know?

167
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:28,520
'And he just happens to have three
grand on him in a paper bag?

168
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,960
Wait, wait. "The Doctor"?!

169
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:34,840
<i>Craig, what if he's a dealer?!</i>

170
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,920
<i>Hello. Stop, please.</i>

171
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,960
<i>Can you hear me? I need your help.</i>

172
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,760
How's the TARDIS coping?

173
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,400
See for yourself.

174
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,717
Ooh, nasty.

175
00:10:56,837 --> 00:11:00,640
She's locked in a materialisation loop,
trying to land again but she can't.

176
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,229
And whatever's stopping her
is upstairs in that flat.

177
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:05,360
So go upstairs and sort it!

178
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,200
<i>Please. My little girl's hurt.</i>

179
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:18,520
I don't know what it is yet!

180
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,412
Anything that can stop the TARDIS
from landing is big, scary big!

181
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,080
Wait... aren't you scared?

182
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:30,999
I'm so sorry, but will you help me?
Please.

183
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,300
Help you?

184
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,880
<i>A bow tie, are you serious?!</i>

185
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:38,414
Hang on a sec.

186
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,800
What? Craig, Craig?

187
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,840
<i>Orange juice, eocenes Arbuckle,
rare tarantula on the table, ooh!</i>

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,497
I can't go up there until I know
what it is and how to deal with it!

189
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:52,617
It is vital that this "man" upstairs
doesn't realise who and what I am.

190
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,120
So no sonicking.

191
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,840
No advanced technology. I can only
use this cos we're on scramble.

192
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:02,640
To anyone else hearing this conversation,
we're talking absolute gibberish.

193
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:04,405
<i>Practical eruption in chicken.</i>

194
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,911
<i>Descartes Lombardy spiral.</i>

195
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,640
All I've got to do is pass
as an ordinary human being.

196
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,680
Simple.
What could possibly go wrong?

197
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,862
<i>Have you seen you?</i>

198
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:16,280
So you're just going to be snide?
No helpful hints?

199
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,120
Hmm, well, here's one...
bow tie, get rid!

200
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:21,975
Bow ties are cool.

201
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:25,760
Come on, Amy, I'm a normal bloke,
tell me what normal blokes do.

202
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,200
They watch telly, they play
football, they go down the pub.

203
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,720
I could do those things!
I don't, but I could!

204
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,080
Hang on. Wait, wait, wait! Amy?!

205
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:42,439
Interesting.

206
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,520
Localised time loop.

207
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:49,637
- What's all that?
- Time distortion.

208
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,959
Whatever's happening upstairs,
is still affecting you.

209
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,880
It's stopped... ish!

210
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,966
- How about your end?
- My end's good.

211
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:16,080
Doesn't sound great,
but nothing to worry about?

212
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:20,160
No, not really! Just keep the zigzag
plotter on full, that'll protect you.

213
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:27,600
- Amy, I said the zigzag plotter!
- I pulled the zigzag plotter!

214
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,817
What, you're standing
with the door behind you?

215
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:33,519
OK, take two steps to your right
and pull it again!

216
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,623
Now, I must not use the sonic.

217
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,971
I've got work to do,
need to pick up a few items.

218
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,680
Don't get comfortable!

219
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:12,520
- Doctor!
- <i>Hello!</i>

220
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,528
How long are you going to be
in there?

221
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,741
Sorry, I like a good soak!

222
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,639
- What the hell was that?
- What did you say?

223
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:28,640
I'm just going to go upstairs,
see if he's OK.

224
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,678
Sorry?

225
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:44,436
What did you say?

226
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:51,680
Yes? Hello?

227
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:52,697
Craig?

228
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:59,319
It's me from downstairs.
I heard a big bang.

229
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:03,080
No choice... it's sonicking time.

230
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,610
Thank you, Craig,
but I don't need your help.

231
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:15,871
- What happened, what's going on?
- Is that my toothbrush?

232
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,691
Correct. You spoke to the man upstairs?
What did he look like?

233
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:21,391
More normal than you do at the moment.
What are you doing?

234
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:23,142
I thought you might be in trouble.

235
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:24,847
Thanks!

236
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:26,422
Well if I ever am,

237
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:30,298
you can come and save me
with my toothbrush.

238
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:40,308
Hello?

239
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,280
Hello! The Doctor.

240
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,542
- Right.
- You must be Sophie.

241
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,739
No, Dom's in Malta, there's
nobody around.

242
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,130
Hang on a sec.

243
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,726
We've got a match today, pub league,
we're one down if you fancy it?

244
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:00,839
Pub league? A drinking competition?

245
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:04,576
No... football... play football?

246
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:09,075
Football! Yes, blokes play football!
I'm good at football, I think.

247
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:11,426
You've saved my life!
I've got somebody.

248
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:12,912
All right, see you down there.

249
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,954
I thought I'd come
early and meet your new flatmate.

250
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:17,574
Do you play, Sophie?

251
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:21,668
Soph just stands on the sidelines,
she's my mascot.

252
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:23,440
I'm your mascot? Mascot?!

253
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:27,400
Not my mascot, it's a football match,
I can't take a date.

254
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:30,400
- I didn't say I was your date.
- Neither did I.

255
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:36,435
Better get dressed.

256
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:43,156
The spare kit's just
in the bottom drawer.

257
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:44,411
Bit of a mess.

258
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,208
- What d'you think?
- You didn't say he was gorgeous!

259
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:52,530
You unlocked the door. How did
you do that? Those are your keys,

260
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,483
you must have left them
last time you came here.

261
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:57,720
Yeah, but I...
How do you know these are my keys?

262
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:00,201
- I've been holding them!
- I have got another set.

263
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:02,680
You've got two sets of keys
to someone else's house?

264
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:04,101
I see!

265
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,001
You must like it here too.

266
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,122
I'm going out,
if I hang about the house all the time,

267
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,440
him upstairs might get suspicious,
notice me.

268
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,320
Football, OK, well done,
that is normal.

269
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,840
Yeah, football, all outdoorsy.

270
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:34,600
Now, football's the one
with the sticks, isn't it?

271
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,958
What are you actually called,
what's your proper name?

272
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:39,273
Just call me the Doctor.

273
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,115
I can't say to these guys, "Hey, this is
my new flatmate, he's called the Doctor."

274
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:43,908
- Why not?
- Cos it's weird.

275
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,827
All right, Craig. Soph.
All right, mate.

276
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,920
Hello, I'm Craig's new flatmate.

277
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:54,354
- I'm called the Doctor.
- All right, Doctor. I'm Sean.

278
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,999
- Where are you strongest?
- Arms.

279
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,760
No, he means, what position?
On the field?

280
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:03,440
Not sure. The front? The side?

281
00:18:04,203 --> 00:18:07,159
- Below?
- Are you any good though?

282
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:09,596
Let's find out!

283
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,120
That's not bad.

284
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,043
Yes. Go!

285
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,960
One two, one two!

286
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:31,040
Go on, Doctor, go on, Doctor!

287
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,559
You're brilliant, you're amazing!

288
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:50,399
Come on, Craig, show them
what you've got!

289
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,679
I love this game!

290
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,400
<i>Please can you help me?</i>

291
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,393
<i>Can you help me, please?</i>

292
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,494
<i>Can you help me?</i>

293
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,412
Hello?

294
00:20:00,245 --> 00:20:02,477
I've lost my mum,
I don't know where she is.

295
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:04,114
Please can you help me?

296
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:05,329
Help you?

297
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,240
You poor thing, what's happened?

298
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,318
Can you help me find her?

299
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,769
You are so on the team!

300
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,800
Next week we've got the Crown
and Anchor, we'll annihilate them!

301
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,440
No violence, not while I'm around,

302
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,255
not today, not ever.
I'm the Doctor, the oncoming storm...

303
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,400
and you meant beat them
in a football match?

304
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,480
Lovely, what sort of time?

305
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:55,360
- It's happening again! Worse!
- What does the scanner say?

306
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:58,544
A lot of nines.

307
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:01,600
Is it good that they're nines?
Tell me it's good!

308
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:04,653
Yes, yes, it's... it's good!

309
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:06,320
Zigzag plotter, zigzag plotter.

310
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,360
Are you there?

311
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:25,880
Yes, hello.

312
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,960
Thank heavens. I thought the TARDIS
had been flung off into the vortex

313
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,480
<i>with you inside it,</i>

314
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,320
<i>lost forever.</i>

315
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:34,240
That could actually happen?

316
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,680
- <i>You have got to get me out of here.</i>
- How are the numbers?

317
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,040
All fives.

318
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:41,680
Fives?

319
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:45,480
Even better.

320
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,052
<i>Still, it means the effect's
almost unbelievably</i>

321
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,880
<i>powerful and dangerous,
but don't worry.</i>

322
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,600
Hang on, OK?

323
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,808
- <i>I've got some rewiring to do.</i>
- Hey! You..."hang on"!

324
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,880
Hello, flatmate.

325
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:07,737
Hey, man.

326
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:11,341
Listen, Sophie's
coming round tonight

327
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:14,760
and I was wondering
if you could give us some space?

328
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:17,690
Oh, don't mind me.
You won't even know I'm here.

329
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:20,640
That's the idea.

330
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:24,286
Yes, perfect!

331
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,508
What a beauty!

332
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,227
- That's got bigger.
- Oh, yeah.

333
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,649
Are we going out?

334
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,770
I've had a bit of a weird day,
can we do pizza-booze-telly?

335
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,440
Great, love it! Wait.

336
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:45,292
No Melina, no crises,
no interruptions.

337
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:48,325
Great. Excellent.

338
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:53,926
I've...

339
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:00,640
I think...

340
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:04,040
Where's this going?

341
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:06,968
I think that we...

342
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,540
... should...

343
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,639
Hello. What?

344
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:20,920
Sorry, don't worry, I wasn't listening,
in a world of my own down there.

345
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,640
- I thought you were going out?
- Just re-connecting all the electrics,

346
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,109
it's a real mess.
Where's the on-switch for this?

347
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:30,280
- He really is on his way out.
- No, I don't mind, if you don't mind.

348
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:32,800
I don't mind, why would I mind?

349
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,937
Then stay, have a drink with us.

350
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:37,684
What, do I have to stay now?

351
00:23:37,804 --> 00:23:39,856
- Do you want to stay?
- I don't mind.

352
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:42,800
Great!

353
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,799
Cos life can seem pointless, Doctor.

354
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,798
Work, weekend, work, weekend.

355
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:49,916
And there's six billion people
on the planet doing pretty much the same.

356
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:52,233
Six billion people?
Watching you two at work,

357
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:54,270
I'm starting to wonder
where they all come from.

358
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,199
- What? What do you mean by that?
- So, the call centre. That's no good?

359
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,150
What do you really want to do?

360
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,070
Don't laugh.
I only ever told Craig about it.

361
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:05,480
I want to work
looking after animals.

362
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,191
Maybe abroad? I saw this
orang-utan sanctuary on telly.

363
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:12,076
- What's stopping you?
- She can't,

364
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:13,960
you need loads of qualifications.

365
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,855
Yeah, true. Plus...

366
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:18,480
it's scary, everyone I know
lives round here.

367
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,885
Craig got offered a job in London,
better money, didn't take it.

368
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:24,840
What's wrong with staying here?
I can't see the point of London.

369
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:29,080
Perhaps you'll just have
to stay here, secure

370
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,464
and a little bit miserable
until the day you drop.

371
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,558
Better than trying and failing, eh?

372
00:24:33,678 --> 00:24:35,760
- You think I'd fail?
- Everybody's got dreams,

373
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,120
very few are going to achieve them,
so why pretend?

374
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:45,420
Perhaps, in the whole universe,
a call centre is where you should be?

375
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,949
- Why saying that? That's horrible.
- Is it true?

376
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,471
Of course it's not. I'm not staying
in a call centre all my life,

377
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:52,086
I can do anything I want!

378
00:24:58,126 --> 00:25:00,020
Oh, my God!
Did you see what he just did?

379
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,360
What's happening? Are you going
to live with monkeys now?

380
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,470
It's a big old world, Sophie.

381
00:25:05,383 --> 00:25:07,720
Work out what's really
keeping you here, eh?

382
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:09,974
I don't know.

383
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,240
Dunno.

384
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,094
So, are you going to be taking off
then, seeing the world?

385
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:24,101
What? Do you think I should?

386
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:25,166
Yeah...

387
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Like the Doctor says,
what's keeping you here?

388
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,800
Yeah, exactly! What?

389
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,699
- Bye.
- See you.

390
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:43,160
See you in a bit.

391
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,810
Right. Shield's up.

392
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,980
Let's scan!

393
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,999
<i>What are you getting?</i>

394
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:00,840
<i>Upstairs.</i>

395
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:03,160
No traces of high technology.
Totally...

396
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:06,139
normal.
No no, no, no, it can't be!

397
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:07,560
It's too normal.

398
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:10,702
Only for you
could too normal be a problem.

399
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:12,720
You said I'd be lost forever.
Just go upstairs.

400
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:16,160
Without knowing, get myself killed,
then you really are lost.

401
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
If I could just

402
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,233
get a look in there...

403
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:20,333
Hold on.

404
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:22,425
Use the data bank,

405
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:25,480
get me the plans of this building,
its history, the layout, everything.

406
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,829
<i>Meanwhile, I shall recruit a spy.</i>

407
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:52,690
The Rotmeister...

408
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:06,579
Craig?

409
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:09,320
Breakfast, it's normal.

410
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:19,880
I told you not to touch it!
What's that?

411
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,320
An unfamiliar
and obviously poisonous substance.

412
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
"I know what would be really clever,

413
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,720
"I'll stick my hand in it!"

414
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:27,600
Come on, Craig, breathe.

415
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:31,840
Come on, Craig, breathe!
Thems are healthy footballer's lungs!

416
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:35,720
Right. Reverse the enzyme decay.

417
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:37,938
Excite the tannin molecules.

418
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:51,110
- I've got to go to work.
- On no account.

419
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:53,395
You need rest.
One more.

420
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,660
It's the planning meeting,
it's important.

421
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,920
You're important.

422
00:28:06,913 --> 00:28:08,800
You're going to be fine, Craig.

423
00:28:24,074 --> 00:28:25,074
What!

424
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,360
Afternoon.

425
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:44,837
I'm so sorry, Michael,

426
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,040
I don't know what happened,
I've got no excuse

427
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,360
I think that's not what my screen
is telling me, Mr Lang.

428
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:54,280
- What are you doing here?
- If that's your attitude, Mr Lang,

429
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,640
please take your custom elsewhere.

430
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,960
No, that's one of my best clients!

431
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
Craig, how are you feeling?
Had some time to kill,

432
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,091
I was curious, never worked in
an office. Never worked in anywhere.

433
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:05,357
You're insane!

434
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,361
Leave off the Doctor,
I love the Doctor.

435
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:09,440
He was brilliant
in the planning meeting.

436
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,672
- You went to the planning meeting?
- I was your representative.

437
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,280
We don't need Mr Lang any more.
Rude Mr Lang.

438
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,432
Here you go,
and I found some custard creams!

439
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:18,874
Sophie, my hero.

440
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:21,640
I went on the web,
applied for a wildlife charity thing.

441
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,280
They said I could always start
as a volunteer straight away.

442
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,569
Should I do it?

443
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:27,139
Great, yeah, good, go for it.

444
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,401
You look awful.
About turn! Bed. Now.

445
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:31,335
Who next? Oh, yes.

446
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:35,200
Hello, Mr Joergensen.

447
00:29:36,198 --> 00:29:38,178
Can you hold?
I have to eat a biscuit.

448
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,406
Have you been upstairs?

449
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Yes?

450
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,880
People who never come back down.
That's very bad.

451
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:32,800
- Hello.
- I can't take this any more.

452
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,120
I want you to go!

453
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,040
- You can have this back an' all.
- What have I done?

454
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,320
- For a start, talking to a cat.
- Lots of people talk to cats.

455
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,080
Everybody loves you, you're better
at football than me, and my job,

456
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,720
and now Sophie's all
"Oh, monkeys, monkeys!"

457
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,720
And then...

458
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,480
there's that!

459
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,760
It's art!
A statement on modern society,

460
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:55,567
"Ain't modern society awful?"

461
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,599
You've been here three days,
the three weirdest days of my life.

462
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,509
Your days will get a lot weirder
if I go!

463
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:03,675
I can't do this any more!

464
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,268
I can't leave this place.
I can't see the point of anywhere else.

465
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:08,506
Madrid, what a dump!
I have to stay.

466
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:10,440
- No, you have to leave!
- I can't go!

467
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,720
Just get out!

468
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,631
Right! Only way! I'm going to show
you something, but ssh, really!

469
00:31:16,897 --> 00:31:19,640
I am going to regret this.
OK, right... First, general background!

470
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:30,120
- You're a...
- Yes.

471
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:32,080
From...

472
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,920
You've got a TARDIS!

473
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,120
Eleventh!

474
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,426
Right... OK,

475
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,140
specific detail!

476
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,862
You saw my ad
in the paper shop window.

477
00:31:48,982 --> 00:31:51,029
Yes, with this right above it.
Which is odd,

478
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:53,560
because Amy hasn't written it yet.
Time travel,

479
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:55,743
- it CAN happen.
- That's a scanner!

480
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:56,880
You used

481
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,960
non-technological technology

482
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,536
of Lammasteen.

483
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:02,040
Shut up!

484
00:32:12,624 --> 00:32:14,241
Please can you help me?

485
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:17,960
Please.

486
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,198
Will you help me?

487
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,720
What's the matter, my love?

488
00:32:22,737 --> 00:32:23,792
Help you?

489
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,800
I am never,

490
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:34,091
ever doing that ever ever again...

491
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,400
- That's Amy Pond!
- Of course, you can understand us now,

492
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:40,680
Got those plans yet?

493
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:44,931
Still searching for them!

494
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:47,462
I've worked it out
with psychic help from a cat.

495
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:48,868
- Cat?
- Yes,

496
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:50,960
He's got a time engine
in the flat upstairs.

497
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,824
<i>He's using innocent people to try
and launch it.</i> Whenever he does,

498
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:56,129
- they get burnt up, hence the stain.
- From the ceiling?

499
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:57,200
Well done.

500
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,786
<i>And you, Miss Pond,
nearly get thrown off into the Vortex.</i>

501
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:01,180
Lovely!

502
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:04,680
People are dying up there?
People are dying.

503
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,480
They're being killed!

504
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,893
Someone's up there.

505
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:23,120
Craig, come on...
someone's dying up there.

506
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,400
It's Sophie.

507
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,040
It's Sophie that's dying up there,
it's Sophie!

508
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:32,720
- Where's Sophie!
- Wait, wait!

509
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,880
Are you upstairs?

510
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,031
- Just going in!
- <i>But you can't be upstairs.</i>

511
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:40,019
- Of course I can be upstairs!
- No! I've got the plans,

512
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:42,280
you cannot be upstairs,
it's a one-storey building.

513
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,636
<i>There is no upstairs!</i>

514
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,086
What?

515
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:55,903
What?

516
00:33:57,721 --> 00:33:58,800
Of course!

517
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:02,560
The time engine isn't IN the flat.

518
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,920
The time engine IS the flat!
Someone's attempt to build a TARDIS.

519
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,270
No, there's always been an upstairs.

520
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,284
- Has there? Think about it!
- Yes.

521
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:13,000
No. I don't...

522
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,159
Perception filter. It's more than
a disguise. It tricks your memory.

523
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:20,079
Oh, my God, Sophie!

524
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:21,872
- Craig!
- It's controlling her.

525
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:23,811
It's willing her
to touch the activator.

526
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,439
It's not going to have her!

527
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:29,840
- Ah! Deadlock seal!
- You've got to do something!

528
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,389
What? Why's it let her go?

529
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:44,000
- <i>You will help me.</i>
- Right! Stop! Crashed ship, let's see.

530
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,032
Hello, I'm Captain Troy Handsome
of International Rescue.

531
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:49,032
Please state
the nature of your emergency.

532
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:51,119
<i>The ship has crashed.
The crew are dead.</i>

533
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:52,480
<i>A pilot is required.</i>

534
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,159
You're the emergency crash program.

535
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
A hologram. You've been luring people up
here so you can try them out.

536
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,640
<i>You will help me,
you will help me....</i>

537
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:01,299
- Craig! Where am I?
- Hush!

538
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:04,280
Human brains aren't strong enough,
they just burn. You're stupid,

539
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,120
you just keep trying.

540
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:08,160
<i>17 people have been tried.</i>

541
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:11,430
<i>6,000,400,026 remain.</i>

542
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,440
- Seriously, what is going on?
- For goodness sake, the top floor

543
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,320
of the building is a space ship,

544
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,360
<i>intent on slaughtering
the population of this planet.</i>

545
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,840
Any questions? No, good.

546
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,068
I have questions.

547
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:22,840
<i>The correct pilot
has now been found.</i>

548
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,640
Yes, I was worried you'd say that.

549
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:26,200
He means you, doesn't he?

550
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:28,280
<i>The correct pilot has been found.</i>

551
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,360
<i>The correct pilot has been found</i>

552
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,480
<i>The correct pilot has been found</i>

553
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:33,920
What's happening?

554
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:36,201
It's pulling me in!
I'm the new pilot!

555
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:37,280
Could you do it?

556
00:35:37,988 --> 00:35:39,600
Could you fly the ship safely?

557
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:41,680
No, I'm way too much for this ship.

558
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:44,025
My hand touches that panel,
the planet doesn't blow up,

559
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:45,845
the whole solar system does.

560
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:50,560
No... worst choice ever,
I promise you. Stop this!

561
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,901
It's getting worse.

562
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:55,760
It doesn't want everyone.
Craig, it didn't want you!

563
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,840
I spoke to him
and he said I couldn't help him!

564
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,800
It didn't want Sophie before today
but now it does. What's changed?

565
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,025
No! I gave her the idea of leaving!
It's a machine that needs to leave,

566
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:07,800
it wants people who want to escape!
And you don't want to leave, Craig,

567
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,000
you're Mr Sofa Man.

568
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:12,880
You can shut down the engine.

569
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,240
Put your hand on the panel
and concentrate

570
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,792
on why you want to stay!

571
00:36:16,912 --> 00:36:18,960
- Craig, no!
- Will it work? Are you sure?

572
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:20,640
- Yes!
- Is that a lie?

573
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:22,160
Of course it's a lie!

574
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,999
It's good enough for me. Geronimo!

575
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,080
Craig, what's keeping you here?
Think about everything

576
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,280
that makes you want to stay here!
Why don't you want to leave?

577
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:39,720
Sophie! And I don't want
to leave Sophie!

578
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:41,759
I can't leave Sophie! I love Sophie!

579
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,519
I love you, too, Craig, you idiot!

580
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,680
- Honestly, do you mean that?
- Of course! Do you mean it?

581
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:54,078
I've always meant it.
Seriously though, do you mean it?

582
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:56,760
<i>What about the monkeys?</i>

583
00:36:56,921 --> 00:36:59,760
Not now, not again!
Craig, the planet's about to burn!

584
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:01,880
For God's sake, kiss the girl!

585
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,439
Kiss the girl!

586
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:18,828
You've done it.

587
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:21,702
You've done it!

588
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,440
<i>Now the screen's just zeros! Now it's
minus ones, minus twos, minus threes...</i>

589
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:27,480
Big yes!

590
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,200
<i>Help me. Help me...</i>

591
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:32,360
Big no.

592
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:35,800
Did we switch it off?

593
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:38,680
Emergency shutdown, it's imploding,
everybody out!

594
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,273
Look at them. Didn't they see that?

595
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:15,515
The whole top floor just vanished.

596
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:18,502
Perception filter.
There never was a top floor.

597
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:34,240
- So have we spoiled our friendship?
- Totally ruined it.

598
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:35,880
And what about the monkeys?

599
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,000
We could save them together,
you know.

600
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:40,034
Do whatever we want.

601
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:42,880
I could see the point of Paris
if you were there with me.

602
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:45,719
First let's destroy
our friendship completely.

603
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,240
What, you're trying to sneak off?

604
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:04,040
Yes, well, you were sort of...

605
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:05,799
busy.

606
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:09,747
I want you to keep these.

607
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,645
Thank you. Cos I might pop back soon,
have another little stay.

608
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,680
No, you won't.
I've been in your head, remember.

609
00:39:17,258 --> 00:39:18,751
But I still want you to keep them.

610
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:21,960
Thank you, Craig.

611
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:23,539
Thank you, Doctor.

612
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,451
Now then.
6,000,400,026 people in the world.

613
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:32,079
That's the number to beat.

614
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,866
Back in time! You need to go to the
paper shop, leave that note for me.

615
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:06,800
Right little matchmaker, aren't you?
Can't you find me a fella?

616
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:09,587
Rectifier's playing up again...
Hold on.

617
00:40:10,252 --> 00:40:12,107
You write the note
and I'll change that will.

618
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,560
- You got a pen?
- Make sure it's a red pen.

619
00:40:47,883 --> 00:40:49,200
<i>There were cracks.</i>

620
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:53,309
<i>Through some we saw silence
and the end of all things.</i>

621
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:55,760
It's the crack in my wall.

622
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,440
Two parts of space and time
that should

623
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,200
never have touched,
pressed together.

624
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:01,273
<i>All through the universe,
rips in the continuum.</i>

625
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:02,560
<i>How could it be here?</i>

626
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:05,560
- How can it be following me?
- I don't know yet, I'm working it out.

627
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:07,428
<i>Some sort of
space-time cataclysm, maybe.</i>

628
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,320
<i>Big enough to put cracks
in the universe.</i>

629
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,400
<i>But what?</i>

630
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:13,720
<i>The universe is cracked.</i>

631
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,360
The Pandorica will open,

632
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,640
silence will fall.

633
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,005
<i>Pandorica...</i>

634
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,960
<i>That's a fairytale!</i>

635
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:25,600
<i>If it is real,
it's here and it's opening.</i>

636
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:27,520
<i>What is it?</i>

637
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,000
<i>A box, a cage a prison.</i>

638
00:41:30,398 --> 00:41:32,760
<i>There was a goblin or a Trickster,</i>

639
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,840
<i>or a warrior, soaked in the blood
of a billion galaxies.</i>

640
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,400
<i>The most feared being
in all the cosmos.</i>

641
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,580
<i>The Pandorica.</i>

642
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:45,440
<i>More than just a fairytale.</i>

643
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,600
<i>It's opening.</i>

644
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,202
Your world has visitors.

645
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,679
<i>Daleks and Cyberships, Sontarans,</i>

646
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,560
<i>Slitheen, Chelonian,
Nestene, Drahvin, Sycorax...</i>

647
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,640
<i>What's in there,
what could justify all this?</i>

648
00:41:57,645 --> 00:41:58,600
<i>What are you?</i>

649
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,759
What could you possibly be?
