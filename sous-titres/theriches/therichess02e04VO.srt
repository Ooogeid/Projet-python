00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,164
<i>Previously on "The Riches"...</i>

2
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:07,211
And where the hell is my best friend,
Doug Rich?

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:10,380
- You can't bribe Pete.
- I have to try.

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:13,412
What did you do with Pete?
You killed him.

5
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:15,602
I hit him, and then.
But he fought back.

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,843
You smashed his skull in with a hammer!

7
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:21,150
- And I feel real bad about that.
- What if someone comes looking for him?

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,873
- You said he didn't have any friends.
- He's got a mother.

9
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:26,788
- I didn't think about his mother.
- What happened to Pete?

10
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:29,710
- Did he take the money?
- He's fine. Everything's all right.

11
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:30,945
- Pete went home.

12
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,079
Look at this. Bayou hills.

13
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:36,399
It's the deal of a lifetime.

14
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:40,373
$150 million,
and you cash in on $13 million.

15
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:41,760
$13 million?

16
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:43,970
All we got to do is be the Riches
for a few months,

17
00:00:44,147 --> 00:00:45,921
the deal closes,
we cash in, check out,

18
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:48,280
and adios. Just like any other con.

19
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:52,010
- What have you got for me?
- Malloy wrapped around my little finger.

20
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:54,612
Bollocks. Wayne Malloy
would never give you that job.

21
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:55,872
He's not stupid.

22
00:00:58,956 --> 00:01:03,001
I want you to tell Wayne
to get me a job at Panco,

23
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,862
or you're going back to prison.

24
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,343
That's our new mail boy?

25
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:11,231
Guess so. I'm scared all the time.

26
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,390
- Of what, darling?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,932
I just got a feeling something
bad's gonna happen.

28
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,511
Holy mother of shit.
It's Eamon Quinn.

29
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:21,471
- I think you ought to leave.
- Little Ginny Dannegan.

30
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,553
It's my fault
that Dale can do this to us.

31
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:28,311
I'm Dahlia Malloy.

32
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:29,610
And...

33
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:31,480
I'm a parole violator.

34
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:38,811
You heard I was cool?

35
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:43,052
- Mark said you were cool.
- Mark who?

36
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:45,032
Mark from the A.A.

37
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,322
Mark from the A-A?

38
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,640
He said that you understand
how life can get real complicated.

39
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:53,881
And,

40
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:56,342
see, my life is real complicated.

41
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:03,090
I didn't check in with my parole Officer

42
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:04,773
before I left Alabama.

43
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:06,740
You got out of jail when?

44
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:09,530
Three months ago.

45
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,701
But I wanted to get
in touch with him. I did.

46
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:16,450
My husband, he's a drinker,

47
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:19,342
and he left me when I was in jail,
and he took my kids.

48
00:02:19,527 --> 00:02:20,483
And...

49
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:24,642
I've been looking for him
ever since here in Louisiana.

50
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:27,590
And I was desperate because my son.

51
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:28,771
He's...

52
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:32,243
he takes a medication
that my husband doesn't accept.

53
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,432
He's in denial
that my child is very, very sick,

54
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,471
- that he has...
- He has cancer.

55
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,831
He has he has a real rare blood disease.

56
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:44,583
It's...

57
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,903
when your immune system
turns on your blood.

58
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:49,360
Called?

59
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:56,471
- I'm so sick of the bullshit.
- It's called hemoblastinoma!

60
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:58,871
- Clark!
- No! Come on.

61
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:02,091
- It's called...
- Parole violator. Outstanding warrant.

62
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:05,442
You can't do this! I'm honest!
I came here of my own free will.

63
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:07,400
You can't do this to me.
I want a lawyer.

64
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,041
You do, now? For what?

65
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:11,750
So he can look up hemoblastinoma?

66
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:14,060
The one thing I hate

67
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,250
is when somebody looks me in the eye

68
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,003
and bullshits me.

69
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,363
Because it disrespects me.

70
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:23,002
- I didn't mean no disrespect.
- Don't even start!

71
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:27,013
I wish one you people
have the guts to look me in the eye

72
00:03:27,198 --> 00:03:29,562
and say, "You know what? I screwed up!"

73
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:33,792
"Not because my kid was sick
or my mother was dying,

74
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:36,000
but because I'm a lowlife

75
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:38,453
and screwing up is what I do!"

76
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:43,620
- "And I'm sorry."
- I am sorry!

77
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,880
It's just what I am.

78
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,721
I wanted to tell you the truth.

79
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,643
I swear to god, on Jesus on the cross.
I wanted to tell you the truth.

80
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:53,172
I was just scared to.

81
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,323
I just want a chance...

82
00:03:58,526 --> 00:03:59,971
to change my life.

83
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:03,040
And I want to stop lying.

84
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,353
It's really

85
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,763
damn hard to stop lying.

86
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,000
And it just it eats up your soul,
and it destroys you,

87
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,921
and it destroys everyone
around you who you love.

88
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:24,810
You got 24 hours,

89
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,730
What's it? 6:42.

90
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:33,442
You got till 6:42 tomorrow

91
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:35,480
to get your skinny ass a real job,

92
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:39,881
real place to live with written proof
and references I can visit in person.

93
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,981
If you can show up with that job
for a month...

94
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:48,483
Maybe I'll... take over your file.

95
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,252
Thank you. You won't regret it.

96
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:54,481
If you don't call me in 24 hours
with a job and a place to live,

97
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:57,903
I'll send your mug shot
out to every cop in Louisiana,

98
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:01,153
and you will be hunted down.

99
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:05,071
- We clear?
- Yes, sir.

<i>Roughly 8% of the 3,000 public-school
teachers in St. Tammany parish</i>

104
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:29,901
<i>leave every year, so hiring 250 to</i>

105
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:32,303
<i>300 new teachers is quite routine.</i>

106
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:35,230
<i>But this year the parish
has a few critical needs.</i>

107
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:47,293
Dahlia, you are a moron.

108
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,073
<i>Gentlemen, this is...</i>

109
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,580
<i>... people for this opportunity...</i>

110
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,882
<i>...considering our relationship
with the mayor's office...</i>

111
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:07,721
- You scared the shit out of me.
- I got to talk to you.

112
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:12,102
I didn't hear you come in last night.

113
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:17,013
I was at Hugh's until almost 1:00.

114
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:19,562
He's getting ready for that
investors'meeting?

115
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,662
And he kind of...

116
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,850
He thinks that Gigi stole his mojo.

117
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:30,713
I have to try and talk him into the idea
that his mojo is actually in the deal.

118
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:33,770
I thought they had investors
for like $150 million.

119
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:37,391
Out on the golf course.
Apparently they haven't signed yet,

120
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:43,520
So I was up all night trying to memorize
55 pages of real-estate bullshit.

121
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,800
I got to go in early
so Aubrey can drill me

122
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:48,440
on the growth-and-conservation
act of 2006.

123
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:50,001
I got to talk to you.

124
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,301
I did something stupid.

125
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:57,841
It came from a good place, so
I think you'll understand, but I'm just...

126
00:06:58,037 --> 00:07:00,802
This parole thing is just hanging over
my head, and I've been thinking I'm

127
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,532
sick of being scared.
There's nothing to be scared of.

128
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:05,263
Can we talk when we get to work?

129
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:08,652
No, I got to talk about it now.
I'm not going to work today.

130
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,752
You're going to work today early
in case something goes wrong.

131
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:15,611
- What?
- This is the setup to the whole deal.

132
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:22,972
We need to do this together,
and I can't do it without you.

133
00:07:24,036 --> 00:07:26,161
There's a security guard out front.
He's real pissed off

134
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:27,922
about Cal's tent and fire.

135
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:29,940
What?

136
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:33,722
I need to talk to you.

137
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:38,460
What the hell is going on?

138
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:43,071
I'm sorry but unauthorized bonfires
are prohibited by homeowner's association.

139
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,140
Cal, what's with the tent?

140
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,342
He doesn't want to live
in the house anymore.

141
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,490
I'm talking to you, Cal.

142
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:55,572
Why are you living
in a tent in the yard?

143
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,660
He thinks the house is
stealing our souls.

144
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:02,255
It's just that rule five
of the homeowner's code,

145
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:04,729
prohibits
unsightly yard structures.

146
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:07,529
You see? You're breaking rule five.
Take down the tent.

147
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,053
Holy shit. He's obeying rule five.

148
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,331
Take the tent down.

149
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:22,770
I am about to nail the biggest deal
of my life, and I do not need this shit

150
00:08:23,057 --> 00:08:26,351
'cause I'm working my ass off, I've put
everything on the line for this family.

151
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:32,451
Thanks, Cap'n Crunch.
We got it from here.

152
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:37,302
What is your problem?

153
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:39,343
Haven't you caused
enough trouble around here?

154
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:42,131
The world does not revolve around you!

155
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:55,643
Just the man I was looking for.
You were right, Doug.

156
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,162
I got in bed last night,
and I did not get in bed alone.

157
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,782
Hey there, sugar tits.

158
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:06,211
Built like a brick shit house.

159
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:10,782
Got in bed with this smoking-hot

160
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:12,260
deal memo.

161
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:16,471
So, the deal talked to you?

162
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,310
$150 million.

163
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:21,932
You were so right.

164
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:26,020
I started to think about just how big
a number $150 million really is.

165
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,791
Felt some action right in my pants.

166
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:32,973
Nothing makes you hard like
knowing you're about to gross more money

167
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,703
the GDP of half a dozen
shit-bag African countries.

168
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:37,180
Am I right?

169
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:40,321
- Just like you said, Doug.
- I never said that.

170
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,631
Nobody steals my mojo.

171
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,832
You do your due diligence
on our investors?

172
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,990
I did, and I'm a little worried
about Minkov.

173
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:51,651
Why? He's in for $40 million.

174
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,963
Exactly he goes squirrelly
and bails on us, we're up shit's creek.

175
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:57,950
He's not gonna bail. His goddamn
ambulance company is being investigated

176
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:01,922
- for misuse of medicare funds.
- Which I'm also a little worried about.

177
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,403
He could be laundering money.

178
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,771
- So?
- So, I'm just saying he's Russian.

179
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:08,932
When we get in there,
don't go all Hugh on him.

180
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:14,021
Don't go all Hugh on him?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

181
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,462
That means don't piss him off.

182
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:19,402
Why would I piss him off?

183
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:22,223
His money's real, and he needs us.

184
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,721
The ambulance company
got a lot of bad press.

185
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,632
They dumped some homeless lady
out on the street.

186
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,093
That's great.

187
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:32,640
We'll pitch him that this deal
will be great press for him,

188
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:34,791
because we're gonna
revitalize the community,

189
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:37,291
create jobs, growth, opportunity.

190
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,293
- He'll be a local hero.
- That's good.

191
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,902
<i>Mr. Minkov is here.
He'd like to see you before the meeting.</i>

192
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:44,222
All right. Come on.

193
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:48,163
Let's go put the screws
to that Russki mother.

194
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:50,790
Let's see what we have here.

195
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,253
So,

196
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:58,260
you've been convicted of a felony?

197
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:01,413
It was just a white-collar thing.

198
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,273
I did some time.
It was just two years in jail.

199
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:11,102
Should I not have checked that? I wanted
to be honest and up front with y'all

200
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,791
'cause my parole
officer will be calling and...

201
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:15,533
Is it gonna be a problem?

202
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,491
It's just...

203
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,163
My boss kind of has a bug up his ass

204
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:21,453
about criminals.

205
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:25,453
I'm not a criminal.
I've been rehabilitated.

206
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:28,383
He worries y'all might
relapse near the cash register.

207
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,633
How am I supposed
to live an honest life

208
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:34,672
if the minute I'm honest
on an application, you won't hire me?!

209
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:36,110
Sorry.

210
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:39,953
You know what?
I don't want to work here anyhow.

211
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:41,160
Know why?

212
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:45,190
'Cause your macchiato's got
too much goddamn foam in it!

213
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,530
There he is.

214
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:53,852
Felix, you son of a bitch.

215
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,320
You give me the tongue,
I'll wring your neck.

216
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,332
You, never stop
being an asshole. Please.

217
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:02,331
Felix, I want you to meet
my partner, Doug Rich.

218
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:05,451
Pleasure.
I heard so much of the famous Doug Rich.

219
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:07,623
I wouldn't believe everything
that Hugh tells you.

220
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:10,341
Hugh nah.
No my partner, Barry Stone.

221
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:13,860
He's stuck in traffic.
He's gonna be here any minute.

222
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,272
Barry Stone?

223
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,031
Yeah. Barry Stone.

224
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:22,861
Where on earth...

225
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,422
Princeton.

226
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:28,580
- Princeton. class of '85.
- Oh, my god.

227
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:32,451
Class of'85,
oh, my god, Barry Stone.

228
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:35,151
All right. Let's get this thing started.

229
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,663
Small world, isn't it?

230
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:50,552
What you doing?

231
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:52,153
Nothing.

232
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,591
- Why aren't you at school?
- I came home.

233
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,800
I'm dropping out, too, I decided.

234
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:00,102
Don't be an idiot.

235
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,700
You love school.

236
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,723
You love, having friends and,

237
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,333
studying,

238
00:13:07,577 --> 00:13:09,540
those stupid standardized tests.

239
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:16,012
I'm not letting you leave.

240
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:24,970
Let's just go somewhere.

241
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:28,763
Except we don't have any money.

242
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:32,720
Let's bump into some housewives at the
mall, make a couple hundred bucks easy.

243
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:35,433
Yeah, I guess.

244
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:40,322
I just,

245
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,230
don't want to steal.

246
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:50,842
That's okay.

247
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,053
We'll do a Molly Brannigan.

248
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:55,940
You always loved
doing Molly Brannigans.

249
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:57,411
In Edenfalls?

250
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,312
in Edenfalls at the mall.

251
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:08,930
What do you mean I'm not in keeping
with your corporate image?

252
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,910
Juggs is a very specific brand.

253
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,300
Thanks, Erin.

254
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:20,991
But the Juggs girl is
wholesome and all-american.

255
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:23,183
She's bubbly and outgoing.

256
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,290
She's the cowgirl next door, and the,

257
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,932
hardened, convicted felon is
way off brand.

258
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:33,461
I'm not a hardened, convicted felon.
I'm the cowgirl next door.

259
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:35,652
Not according to this.

260
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,011
I committed one crime, one.

261
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:40,933
I stole some money on a fake
piece of plastic, I did my time,

262
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:43,470
and you're telling me that
I'm not good enough to flash my tits

263
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:45,663
at some moron eating a hamburger?

264
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:49,983
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm coming in!

265
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:52,241
- Would you keep your hair on?
- We got a situation.

266
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:56,092
One of these guys went to Princeton with
Doug Rich, and he's on his way here.

267
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,853
Wait. I got to talk to you.
I got a serious problem.

268
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:01,683
<i>No. I've got a serious problem.</i>
I've called Sammy,

269
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,650
and he's going through Doug's stuff,
see if he can find anything on this guy.

270
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,491
But I need you to
be here to distract him

271
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:09,783
long enough till
I can figure out who he is.

272
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,922
I'll be in in 10 minutes.

273
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,863
I thought you said
you were on the inside.

274
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:24,443
<i>I am in.</i>

275
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:28,922
I'm in the nerve center.

276
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,160
So, where's Wayne Malloy?

277
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:33,111
You said you were gonna bring him to me.

278
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,162
I am. I am all over his ass.

279
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,821
But you can't even get him
to a goddamn meeting.

280
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:44,513
It's a very high-level meeting
with billionaires and such.

281
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,651
You know what I hate, Dale?

282
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,592
When somebody feeds
me a line of shit.

283
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,933
All right.

284
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:55,451
I'll pull a few strings.
I'll get in.

285
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,052
I'm in the loop.

286
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:01,113
As we all know,
in 2005, Hurricane Katrina

287
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,542
laid wast
to the great city of New Orleans.

288
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:06,342
Whole parts of the city
are still in ruins.

289
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:09,672
Now it's time to rebuild.

290
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:12,640
- Want to talk about our vision, Doug?
- Absolutely.

291
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:17,342
So,

292
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:21,170
what we are planning
is a development that will be a tribute

293
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,881
to its Louisiana heritage.

294
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:25,362
Not just houses and a golf course,

295
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:29,462
but an actual town center
that will be an exact replica

296
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,490
- of the French quarter.
- Except not in New Orleans.

297
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:33,772
Exactly.

298
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:35,531
We are making a new,

299
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:36,633
New Orleans,

300
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:38,083
right here in Duquesne.

301
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,081
It will be called bayou hills

302
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,103
200 acres,

303
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:44,442
of brand-new houses

304
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:48,403
- starting at $1.2 million.
- Excuse me, Doug.

305
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:51,533
You cleared up the problems
with the zoning permits, right?

306
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:52,752
100%, Felix.

307
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:55,622
We got clearance to build on a former
state park.

308
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,880
Pristine real estate.

309
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,941
All we had to do is
make 10% of the homes

310
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:02,752
affordable housing
for the Katrina refugees.

311
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:05,292
Obviously, they'll have their own
parks and pools.

312
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:08,722
The point is we are helping people here
restart their lives.

313
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,402
We're not just making money.

314
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,113
We are revitalizing
an entire community.

315
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:15,270
It's Barry.

316
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:21,533
Excellent. I have some legal documents
that I like everyone just to check out.

317
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:25,410
They're on my desk. I will just
get them. I'll be right back for Barry.

318
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,400
Excuse me one second, gentleman.

319
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:28,953
Thank you.

320
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,572
I'm very sorry.

321
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:33,992
I'm dead. He's coming in.
The guy from Princeton.

322
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:36,180
How well will he know Doug?

323
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:38,623
Let's hope it was a big class.

324
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:41,603
I got to talk to you about something.

325
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:45,480
I'm in kind of a situation,
and I got to find another job.

326
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:47,412
What?

327
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:50,383
I know it sounds bad,
but I'm really trying to get us out

328
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:52,993
from underneath this thing.
If I just get clear of this parole

329
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:54,513
- violation...
- You crazy?

330
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,913
With the biggest deal in our lives
about to blow up in our faces?

331
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,092
You better focus here.

332
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:06,192
This guy can bring us both down,
all right?

333
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:15,622
1,760,000 entries for Barry Stone.

334
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:23,820
Sammy, give your mom everything
you got on Barry Stone.

335
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,820
I can't find anything.

336
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:29,002
What about a yearbook?

337
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,222
I don't see one.

338
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:34,863
What about a newspaper, like a
Princeton newspaper? Keep looking.

339
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:37,670
What the freakin'goddamn hell
are you doing?

340
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,101
Minkov's reaming my ass
in legal technicalities,

341
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:43,693
and Barry Stone is gonna lose his shit
if he doesn't see his old friend, Doug.

342
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:45,483
Get your ass in there
and reconnect.

343
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,191
Here's the Doug-meister.

344
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:04,810
My god. You look completely different.
I'd have never recognized you.

345
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:09,960
Oh, my god. We must be getting old.

346
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:11,601
River of life, man.

347
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:16,583
I might have lost a few hairs,
put on a couple of pounds of...

348
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:20,432
You do not at all,

349
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:23,691
- look like you used to look.
- No.

350
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:27,101
- Didn't you used to be kind of...
- It's a rug, man. Be cool.

351
00:19:28,906 --> 00:19:30,552
So, I'm not completely senile, then?

352
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:35,051
I remember you, 'cause you...

353
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:38,883
The police got you.

354
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:42,061
I do not believe you have
the gall to bring that up.

355
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:45,540
How was I supposed
to know she was just 15?

356
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,753
No one knew. It was she looked 40.

357
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:51,833
At least I wasn't
known as the campus coke dealer.

358
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,483
No, you weren't.

359
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:56,810
I was.

360
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,291
This is boring the shit
out of everyone, so...

361
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,022
It's good to see you again.

362
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:05,110
Excellent.
On with the deal, gentlemen.

363
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,853
Rock'n roll.

364
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:08,022
Onward.

365
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:13,311
Let's do the deal, gentlemen.

366
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:18,251
<i>She wasn't 15, she was...
she was... 18.</i>

367
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:22,373
Absolutely.
I've got no problem with raw fish.

368
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:28,202
There is one thing that I should
tell you that I should clear up.

369
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:34,362
In the recent past, I was convicted
of a crime, and I had to spend some...

370
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,641
Then you know how it is.

371
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:44,121
Thank you.

372
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:45,790
Thank you, Travis.

373
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,092
That's great.

374
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:50,880
I can come by to...

375
00:20:53,526 --> 00:20:55,400
Now isn't such a good time.

376
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:59,492
No, my personal life's
not gonna be a problem.

377
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:00,873
No. I promise.

378
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,952
No. I'll be there right away.

379
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:11,871
So, that about covers financing.

380
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:13,931
Are there any questions?

381
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:20,592
I would like to know
exactly why these deal papers

382
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:24,522
make no mention of applying
for CDBGs or USEDAs.

383
00:21:27,906 --> 00:21:29,801
Doug, it's your arena.

384
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:31,781
Yes.

385
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,440
Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen,

386
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:39,530
but I thought you'd be interested
to know that we have fresh-brewed coffee

387
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:41,553
available in the coffee room.

388
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:44,501
Thank you, Dale.

389
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:47,043
You may go.

390
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:49,423
But it is an excellent idea.

391
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:51,562
Is that the handyman?

392
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:53,950
Yes, he's part of our program
for hiring people

393
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:56,163
of little worth,

394
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,632
and wherewithal.

395
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:00,102
He's... right, though.
There's coffee there,

396
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:04,100
so if we want to break, we can, get nice
brewed coffee with a little roast.

397
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:06,243
Yes.

398
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,220
CDGBs... I'd like
an explanation, please.

399
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,423
Yes. I think that's important.

400
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:17,081
I am so sorry.
Someone's calling me.

401
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:18,952
Terrible.

402
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,521
CDGBs... They don't apply
to parkland.

403
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,672
We can't, make applications.

404
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,580
It's a community-development block grant

405
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:32,823
can only apply
to preexisting communities that,

406
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:35,263
- I think you'll find.
- What about an H.A.P.?

407
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:37,411
You're putting me
through my paces now.

408
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:43,101
H.A.P.S... They are a different kettle
of fish 'cause you've got to be a...

409
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:45,960
501, as you'll know.

410
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,003
501... what?

411
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:49,561
What the hell does that mean?

412
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:51,102
What does it mean?

413
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:52,841
Sounds like a pair of jeans.

414
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:55,303
But it, in fact is,

415
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,221
a registered nonprofit...

416
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:58,910
Not us.

417
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:04,142
You're not a lawyer, are you?

418
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:08,863
No... I'm not a lawyer.

419
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:12,143
- <i>You</i>'re a lawyer.
- No... yes, I am.

420
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:13,863
But I know people who aren't.

421
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:23,643
Wait. You don't cut the head off first.

422
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:27,323
You cut the fin out first.
And then you rip the guts out.

423
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:30,210
- I thought you said you knew fish.
- I do.

424
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:35,750
I find it easier
if I cut the head off first to,

425
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:37,403
get to the guts.

426
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:41,622
You cut the head off first,
the whole fish falls apart. Here.

427
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:44,472
- Don't screw up.
- I won't. I swear.

428
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,293
You've done some time?

429
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:52,360
It was just a white-collar thing...

430
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:53,780
Just two years.

431
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,293
It was maximum-security prison,

432
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,330
very overcrowded,

433
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:03,860
a lot of fights.

434
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:08,710
As a matter of fact,
I knocked somebody's teeth out once

435
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:10,723
with a cafeteria tray.

436
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,592
Been there, done that.

437
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:17,720
You can have the graveyard shift...

438
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:20,910
6:00 to midnight.

439
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:24,402
No benefits, no overtime.
You don't show up you're fired,

440
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:27,740
you call in sick you're fired,
you come late you're fired.

441
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:32,030
- You live near here?
- I'm looking for a place.

442
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:34,981
There's a vacancy in my building.

443
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:39,171
- Guy down the hall from me passed.
- You probably whacked him.

444
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:42,491
Why don't
you just shut your mouth? All right?

445
00:24:43,336 --> 00:24:46,723
Disrespectful mother...
I'm trying to help the lady out here.

446
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:50,662
Welcome to the team.

447
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,943
<i>Ma'am, did you never hear</i>

448
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:59,862
<i>of pretty Molly Brannigan
truth is she left me</i>

449
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:04,540
<i>I'll never be a man again
not a touch on me hide</i>

450
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:07,310
<i>will the summer sun e'er tan again</i>

451
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:13,680
<i>'cause Molly's left me alone to die.</i>

452
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:17,332
Thank you.

453
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:22,033
Just don't make eye contact.

454
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:24,130
Oh, my god.

455
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,080
This is so sad.

456
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:27,803
They're begging.

457
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:34,502
Thanks, bitch.

458
00:25:43,215 --> 00:25:45,683
I'm a little concerned
about our tax liability

459
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:48,101
once the section 8
housing is eliminated.

460
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:51,161
That's a nonissue. We're not gonna
eliminate the affordable housing.

461
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,650
- Let's cut the bullshit, okay?
- This is not bullshit.

462
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:57,612
The city would never give us public land

463
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,760
unless we make 10% of it
affordable housing.

464
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:02,863
- 15% of our funding is from FEMA.
- I know.

465
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:05,740
I read the deal memo, but we had
a verbal understanding, right?

466
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:07,472
What Verbal understanding?

467
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,543
Nobody paying $1 million for a house
is gonna want to live near poor people.

468
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:14,922
The low-income housing
will have its own area.

469
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:16,630
Stop the bullshit.

470
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:18,401
I could show you the blueprints.

471
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,721
I might have forgotten
to mention a minor detail,

472
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,150
which is that you're right, Felix.

473
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:29,913
We had a verbal agreement that the
construction will go in three phases.

474
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:31,352
Phase one...

475
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,992
we build the luxury homes.

476
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:35,730
Phase two...

477
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:38,652
we sell all the luxury homes.

478
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,613
And then the...

479
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:44,923
rich phase-two
homeowners band together and,

480
00:26:45,348 --> 00:26:48,121
rule out phase three.

481
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:51,921
So actually phase three never happens,
'cause you're right, Felix.

482
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:53,612
Nobody's gonna pay a million bucks

483
00:26:53,797 --> 00:26:56,601
to live cheek by jowl
with the phase-three element.

484
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:58,923
You did kind of forget
to mention that.

485
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:02,622
The city will be yelling and screaming.
There'll be lawsuits up the wazoo, but,

486
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:05,233
our legal team
will handle that, right, Doug?

487
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,972
Just wanted to make sure
we're clear on the terms of the deal.

488
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,061
We're clear.

489
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:12,371
Are we...

490
00:27:12,786 --> 00:27:14,913
clear on the terms of the deal?

491
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:18,573
Can you...
guarantee no phase three?

492
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,831
No phase three.

493
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:32,383
- Let's sign the deal.
- All right!

494
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:35,460
I got a couple cases of champagne
on ice in the atrium.

495
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,471
How about we crack them open?

496
00:27:37,765 --> 00:27:39,531
I thought you'd never ask.

497
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:43,102
This guy named Chet
has called for you twice.

498
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,803
He's looking for someone
named Pete Mincey.

499
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:07,911
- Thanks for saving my ass in there.
- You're welcome.

500
00:28:08,096 --> 00:28:09,260
I quit.

501
00:28:12,346 --> 00:28:13,270
Hang on.

502
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:16,061
Just give me a couple minutes.

503
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:22,460
Yes. I know.

504
00:28:22,638 --> 00:28:25,020
I had problems passing the bar exam.

505
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,243
I don't give a shit that you're
not a lawyer.

506
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:30,412
I figured that out a long time
ago, but I didn't care.

507
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:31,802
I liked you.

508
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:35,202
In this whole crazy sick place, you
were the only person who seemed real.

509
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,982
If it's any consolation,
my son thinks I'm an asshole, too.

510
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:41,840
Do you even get what just
happened in that meeting?

511
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:43,611
This is fraud, Doug...

512
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:46,300
Or Wayne, or whatever
the hell you call yourself.

513
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:48,782
And you were using the tragedy
of thousands of people

514
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:51,770
as a cheap trick to make money.
And then you're screwing those people.

515
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:55,072
We're not screwing them.
We will build the affordable housing.

516
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,950
- Don't bullshit me, Wayne!
- I'm not bullshitting you.

517
00:28:58,146 --> 00:29:00,781
We're bullshitting the investors.
That's what you do in a deal. You say

518
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:04,043
whatever you want to say in order
to close the deal, and then you do

519
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:07,013
what you wanted to do in the first place.
That's sales.

520
00:29:07,185 --> 00:29:08,710
That's what you do. You know that.

521
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:10,982
Why should I believe you?

522
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:13,540
'Cause if I don't build it,

523
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:17,110
then you can turn me over to the cops...

524
00:29:19,486 --> 00:29:20,533
And because,

525
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:22,992
I need to believe me.

526
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:28,833
Better come to the party before
Hugh drinks all the champagne.

527
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:39,991
$40, $60, $61, $62,

528
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:43,282
$63, $64, $65... $65.

529
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:47,753
Probably get to $100 if you stop
eating those $5 frozen yogurts.

530
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:55,052
You don't want to do this anymore.
Let's get something to eat.

531
00:29:55,246 --> 00:29:56,560
No. I do.

532
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:58,323
I want to.

533
00:29:58,956 --> 00:30:00,210
Come on.

534
00:30:00,627 --> 00:30:02,651
Like I care what those
buffer assholes think.

535
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:04,741
You never used to.

536
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:15,582
Shit, Di. Come on.

537
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:21,151
I can't do this anymore.

538
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:24,823
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

539
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,142
I want it to be like it always was.

540
00:30:32,508 --> 00:30:34,812
- It can be.
- No, Cal.

541
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:37,230
It can't.

542
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:38,922
Why not?

543
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,151
'Cause I hate it here?

544
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,713
'Cause I like it.

545
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:55,100
I got an English paper due tomorrow.

546
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,503
I got to go home, so...

547
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,000
Let's not do goodbyes, all right?

548
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:08,403
I hate goodbyes.

549
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,842
It's not like
I'm not gonna see you again.

550
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:25,731
He O.D.'d?

551
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:28,753
Right there on the barcalounger.

552
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:31,253
Was watching "Survivor"...
Kind of a,

553
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,693
cruel twist of fate if you ask me.

554
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:37,872
You can keep the chair if you want,
and the toaster oven, too.

555
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:40,881
But I hope you heard me loud and clear.

556
00:31:41,156 --> 00:31:44,452
- No turning tricks here.
- I told you I'm not a hooker.

557
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:47,451
I'm not here to judge.
I just don't want no trouble.

558
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,300
Ain't gonna be no trouble.

559
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:51,270
My application.

560
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:53,601
License.

561
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:58,440
Dahlia Malloy...

562
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:00,221
That's a real pretty name.

563
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:02,420
I always thought so.

564
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:05,433
I hope you're happy here,
Dahlia Malloy.

565
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:07,780
Lance was.

566
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:12,203
Maybe that was just the crack talking?

567
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,320
What makes you hard?

568
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:29,822
- What?
- What turns you on?

569
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,593
What floats your boat?

570
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,083
Hookers? Cars?

571
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:36,223
Underage girls?

572
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:46,032
Drink up. Drink up, there.
Look at all this Champagne I got here.

573
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:48,030
Come on. It's beautiful.

574
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,301
Just a second.

575
00:32:58,737 --> 00:33:00,470
Hugh's having fun, huh?

576
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,161
Hugh likes money.

577
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,370
You will cut him out of the deal.

578
00:33:06,556 --> 00:33:07,521
What?

579
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,423
You'll be so betrayed
when you find out he's been embezzling.

580
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:15,511
What the hell are you talking about?

581
00:33:15,715 --> 00:33:17,952
Relax, Doug. Relax.

582
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:21,642
After he goes to jail,
you and I will split the profits.

583
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:27,360
Just after we,
sprout wings and fly to the moon.

584
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:29,253
Got it.

585
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:33,611
Or...

586
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,712
Maybe I should rip off...

587
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:41,731
... your goddamn rug.

588
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:43,752
Oh, my god.

589
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:47,250
That's a very high-quality toupee
you've got here.

590
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:50,462
You Americans make the best...

591
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:53,150
fakes... ever.

592
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:58,730
You think I couldn't tell you never
went to Princeton, you prick?

593
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:02,243
My partner may be stupid, but I'm not.

594
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:06,642
I don't give shit
who you really are.

595
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:11,151
For me, you're a guy who knows
how to make money, like me.

596
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,852
So you'll set him up,

597
00:34:13,446 --> 00:34:15,450
and we'll split the profits.

598
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:18,252
It's a win-win, okay?

599
00:34:26,237 --> 00:34:27,872
Except for Hugh?

600
00:34:33,596 --> 00:34:35,243
I'll take that as a yes.

601
00:34:48,277 --> 00:34:49,572
This is Dale Malloy.

602
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,953
Quinn said you'd be expecting my call.

603
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:56,010
If we're gonna bring your man in,
I got the numbers you need.

604
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:57,121
<i>All right.</i>

605
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:00,661
<i>This is officer Devereaux,
leave a message.</i>

606
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,960
Hi, officer Devereaux.
This is Dahlia Malloy.

607
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,843
I'm...

608
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:10,511
just leaving you this message
'cause it's, 6:30

609
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,070
and so you don't have to put out
that warrant for my arrest,

610
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,812
because I'm working in the kitchen
at Rudi and Flo's fish shack,

611
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:23,421
and I'm living at 206
Mayfield, apartment 5e.

612
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:26,412
That's all true.

613
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:32,500
I guess I'll be hearing from you.

614
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,492
Where the hell are you?

615
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:50,981
Thank god.

616
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:53,492
Listen,
you know I told you about the...

617
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:55,802
my friend who knew the parole officer?

618
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,352
It's great because...

619
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:01,103
For the love of god, do not tell me

620
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:03,433
that you've been talking
to your parole officer.

621
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:04,732
<i>No, I'm...</i>

622
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:08,932
I just think if we could do,

623
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:11,650
one honest thing,

624
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:15,330
just... one thing that we know
is true, Wayne...

625
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:19,361
Parole is the tip of the iceberg, here.

626
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:21,490
<i>You know that.</i>

627
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:24,521
We are committing a list of crimes here
as long as my goddamn arm.

628
00:36:24,697 --> 00:36:26,961
We do not want to involve the law.

629
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:28,710
Right.

630
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:38,831
How was your day?

631
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,271
Fine.

632
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:46,021
Dale is worming his way
into all the meetings.

633
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,272
<i>Hugh is drunk off his ass.</i>

634
00:36:48,955 --> 00:36:52,972
And I just screwed a whole bunch
of Katrina victims out of their future.

635
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:02,913
I love you.

636
00:37:03,777 --> 00:37:05,263
I love you, too.

637
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:43,743
You should know I have backing
from powerful forces.

638
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:50,771
What I'm saying is you will not survive.

639
00:37:51,056 --> 00:37:54,603
"'and haven't you your own land
to visit,' continued Miss Ivors,

640
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:57,762
that you know nothing
of your own people,

641
00:37:58,196 --> 00:37:59,502
and your own country?'"

642
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:01,721
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

643
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,830
It's from "The dead" by Joyce.

644
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:10,321
You've never heard of Joyce?

645
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:13,101
Of course I have.
She's one of my favorite writers.

646
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:16,523
You got to get educated, Ginny.

647
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:18,922
That's how they keep you down.

648
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:22,110
Like you ever been to third grade.

649
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:24,702
Bachelor of arts in English literature,

650
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:27,180
masters in philosophy,
university of Phoenix.

651
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:28,990
You never been to Phoenix.

652
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:33,611
Phoenix come to me
right there in the state pen.

653
00:38:34,385 --> 00:38:36,592
Such is the power of the Internet.

654
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:39,253
It's a new world.

655
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:42,750
We are living in a skeptical

656
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:45,243
and, if I may use the phrase,

657
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,272
a thought-tormented age.

658
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:50,053
It's beautiful.

659
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:54,402
It's about how we've lost our souls.

660
00:38:56,776 --> 00:38:58,900
You feel that, don't you...

661
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,233
That emptiness...

662
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:06,733
Right here?

663
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:40,130
- I thought you were with Cal.
- I was.

664
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,580
So, where is he?

665
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:46,493
I don't know.
