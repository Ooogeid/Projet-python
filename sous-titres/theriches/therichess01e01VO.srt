1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,051
...most likely to get married.

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,039
Billy Burke to Shannon Flemington.

3
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:07,050
Farmington.

4
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:08,094
And Shannon Farmington.

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,039
It was a threesome.

6
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:12,027
Class clown.

7
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:14,016
Jesse Pinkercrapperson.

8
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:15,046
It's "Pinkerfield."

9
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:17,024
Jesse Pinkercrapperfield.

10
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:20,090
Best wildcat smile.

11
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:23,093
Penny Lynn Puquois du Bois III.

12
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:27,086
I think Jimmy O'Shea is a no show.

13
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,097
No, I think he's a show.

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,083
Most likely to succeed.

15
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:33,013
- Me?
- No.

16
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:34,062
- Him?
- No.

17
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:37,022
- Those guys?
- Dad, no, you're not prepared.

18
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,060
Ed?

19
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,031
Ed Kline?

20
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,020
Class Romeo.

21
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,041
Uh... Jimmy.

22
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:50,002
- Right.
- Right.

23
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,043
Oh, take it easy.

24
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:52,042
Hey, good to see you.

25
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,001
Take it easy, Jimmy.

26
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:54,072
How have you been, okay?

27
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:55,070
Come on, Class Romeo.

28
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:58,082
Let's go find ourselves
some wildcat tail.

29
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:00,042
Okay.

30
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:04,011
Oh, my gosh. Shannon Farmington.

31
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,010
- Remember...
- Jimmy!

32
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:07,030
Yeah.

33
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:09,001
Where's... where's Billy Burke?

34
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:11,023
Uh, Billy and I don't talk.

35
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,090
Restraining order.

36
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:13,050
Shame.

37
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,013
It was against me.

38
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:18,023
Remember Ed Kline?

39
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:21,042
Penny Lynn Puquois du Bois III.

40
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:23,080
Where's your great wildcat smile?

41
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,051
Remember me, Jimmy?

42
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:29,052
Uh... I just--

43
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,081
just wanted to say something.

44
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:40,031
It hasn't been easy for us wildcats...

45
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:43,021
you know?

46
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,092
Some have cried.

47
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:49,020
Some have died.

48
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:51,051
Some fought the bottle.

49
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:53,052
Some the spike.

50
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:55,032
Broken promises,

51
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,033
ungrateful children,

52
00:02:57,045 --> 00:03:00,070
a botched gastric bypass surgery,

53
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,013
and a bad dose of the clap.

54
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:07,021
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to mention that.

55
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,040
But there are stories of redemption here.

56
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,092
Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:16,001
Stories of hope and of triumph.

58
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:20,081
Brad Pensky, Mr. Brad Pensky,

59
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:25,070
he has informed me that his scrap
metal business has finally
come out of chapter 11.

60
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:28,090
That is good news in anyone's book.

61
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:31,021
Joe Grappa.

62
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:35,083
Joe, he is an eBay
power seller of hand towels.

63
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,090
How'd he get to be?

64
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:42,093
And Mary B.--where-- Mary, Mary,
quite contrary.

65
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:45,011
She has come out of a coma, as you know.

66
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:46,031
How long were you in that?

67
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:47,061
Five years.

68
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:49,080
Mary B., she's here today.

69
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:55,033
Give her a round of applause
for taking five years off
with pay and coming back.

70
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,083
This is brilliant.

71
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:06,012
We are America... wildcats.

72
00:04:08,037 --> 00:04:12,041
We're its highs and its lows,

73
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,050
its misfits, its beauty queens,

74
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:17,032
its brain and its brawn,

75
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,002
its master, its blaster, its soul,

76
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,072
and its gluteus maximus.

77
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:28,021
Its youngsters and oldsters,
its confined people.

78
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,041
Hey.

79
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:36,040
Hey, it's getting hot in here.

80
00:04:36,055 --> 00:04:37,033
Shit.

81
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,061
Pull around back.

82
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:40,002
I'll be there in five.

83
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:41,083
Actually, you better make it now.

84
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:47,060
Listen to your wild hearts,
you wildcats,

85
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:53,032
'cause we are the class of 1983.

86
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:56,061
'81. '81!

87
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:30,061
hey, that's... me.

88
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,043
Jimmy O'Shea.

89
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:38,003
You were a hit.

90
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:02,003
The Riches - 101 - Pilot
www.forom.com

91
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:35,031
You think mom'll like the gifts?

92
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:37,092
She's bound to like some of 'em.

93
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,090
So what was that last night, dad?

94
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,071
"Its master and blaster"?

95
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:44,001
I was on a roll, I had them.
You saw that.

96
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,001
They were just there.
They were eating out of the palm of my hand.

97
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,040
But you almost got us busted.

98
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,023
When you're in there,
you just say anything.

99
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:52,032
I could've said master, blaster, cheese,
and chipmunks, it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:53,090
They were with me.

101
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:56,013
Cal, slow down.

102
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,053
Do the rules.

103
00:06:58,055 --> 00:06:59,083
Rule one.

104
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,050
Don't screw up.

105
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:01,052
Rule two.

106
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,062
Seriously, don't screw up.

107
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:03,063
And rule three.

108
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,023
Cash out before you pass out.

109
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,052
Yes.

110
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:08,071
Cal!

111
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,080
Everything in the tv, come on.

112
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:12,073
Hurry up. Move it.

113
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:13,080
Shit.

114
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:21,090
- Whose turn is it?
- Cal.

115
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,042
- Why is it always me?
- 'Cause you broke rule one!

116
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,082
Sammy.

117
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:26,070
We're late for mom.

118
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:27,072
I know, I know.

119
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:29,043
Don't worry.
You're secret squirrel.

120
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:31,040
Everyone, be cool.

121
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:39,091
Hey, baby.

122
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:41,032
Hey.

123
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:42,060
Hey!

124
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:55,030
How you doin'?

125
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,083
You look good.

126
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,082
Put your hands down.

127
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:17,001
Put those right there, little lady.

128
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:20,020
You know, I used to think
you people were like Leprechauns.

129
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:21,011
You mean we're short?

130
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:22,062
No, no.

131
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:24,001
Green then.

132
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:25,011
What?

133
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,043
Why, gypsies.

134
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:27,083
Isn't that defamation, sir?

135
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,073
Travelers.

136
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:33,010
You know, my buddies up in New York,
they still don't think you people exist.

137
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,060
Travelers?

138
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,012
I don't think we know
any travelers, officer.

139
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:38,053
Sajick.

140
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,011
What'd you say?

141
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,002
Well, leerkey sajick.

142
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:47,021
All right, wise guy,
where'd all the gifts come from?

143
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,040
Well, we're going to a wedding, sir.

144
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:54,013
"To Jenny from Ben and Aail."

145
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,016
Which one are you?

146
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:59,027
Ben or Gail?

147
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,003
Gail.

148
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:03,090
Actually, that's my aunt and uncle
from Kentucky, officer.

149
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:05,043
They can't walk.

150
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:08,022
"To Jenny from Kim Wong."

151
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:11,011
Now, whose crippled aunt
might she be?

152
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:14,062
She's the crippled aunt
of dim sum, sir.

153
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,081
What the hell's wrong with him?

154
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:22,040
Epilepsy. Takes one in 20.

155
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,090
Got a spoon, sir?

156
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,053
He--he gets like this
when he's stressed.

157
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:28,061
- Watch it!
- Officer, he can't help it.

158
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,012
It's just a reflex.

159
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:31,090
Like hell.

160
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,033
Go get his medicine.

161
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:34,051
Can you give me
your badge number, sir?

162
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:35,013
My what?

163
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:36,001
Badge number.

164
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:37,091
It's police brutality.
You crossed the line here.

165
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:39,071
No, no, no.
Now, I never touched that kid.

166
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,061
You brutalized him
with your words.

167
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:43,092
Aw, damn it!

168
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:49,020
Holy shit.

169
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:14,052
Your people abandoned you?

170
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,092
You want something for the road?

171
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:24,091
You want something or not?

172
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,002
Don't talk to me.

173
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,091
Bye-bye.

174
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:14,022
What about the gifts?

175
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:16,033
Don't worry, I'm getting it.

176
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,082
Got any gifts?

177
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:24,040
What kind are you looking for?

178
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,010
What kind you got?

179
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:28,011
We got earthenware.

180
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,062
This is nice.

181
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:37,083
What else you got?

182
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:39,092
Depends on what
you're trying to say.

183
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,051
That I missed you.

184
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,062
What if she's still inside?

185
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,053
She got paroled, honey.

186
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,060
They kind of gotta let you out
if you're on parole.

187
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:12,050
Aunt Jessie got paroled,
and she's still inside.

188
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:15,011
Aunt Jessie broke parole.

189
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,040
Mom!

190
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,091
Hey.

191
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:25,032
You know your mom
is classier than that.

192
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:36,043
What do y'all think of my hair?

193
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:40,000
It's different.

194
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,083
You've grown up, girl.

195
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,023
You're beautiful.

196
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,060
That's some real bad hair, ma.

197
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:05,083
And so, my lady, your ship awaits.

198
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,020
Come.

199
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:08,032
The good ship RV.

200
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,043
We have painted it with dust.

201
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:15,040
All aboard, including you,
glum-faced child.

202
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:28,090
What happened, Wayne?

203
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,052
What do you mean, baby?

204
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:34,081
I'm coming back to a heap of trash.

205
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:37,052
I had a lot on my mind.

206
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,043
Where are my dishes?

207
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:40,043
They were rattling.

208
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:41,093
Kept reminding me of you.

209
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:43,060
Oh, so you sold 'em?

210
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:46,022
Well, I mean,
we didn't sell everything, though.

211
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,060
Oh. ***

212
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:48,073
*** of?

213
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,050
If I know.

214
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,051
Open it.

215
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:56,092
Oh, mom's home!

216
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,001
Not the candy corn!

217
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:00,080
Good arm, baby.

218
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:03,001
If you see a state trooper, hit him.

219
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,053
Why are we living in squalor, Wayne?

220
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,080
You can con the hair off a dog!

221
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:12,080
I had an existential crisis,
all right?

222
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:15,042
Oh, is that what you were having with
that piece of trash back there?

223
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:17,032
Baby, it has been two years.

224
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:21,003
Is it my fault she gets all up
in my face with her twins?

225
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,093
You have no idea
how hard this has been.

226
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:26,061
I was the one in jail
for two years, Wayne.

227
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:29,010
All you had to face
was how to be free.

228
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,003
Pussy jail.

229
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,081
You played beauty school
and sat on your ass.

230
00:14:36,098 --> 00:14:38,041
- Yeah.
- Come back here!

231
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:40,090
- No, mom!
- Come back here!

232
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:44,020
I said, don't you leave me.

233
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,091
Screw you, Wayne!

234
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:49,003
Oh, god damn it!

235
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:59,001
Welcome home Dahling!

236
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:06,020
Hell, yeah!

237
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:42,060
Sharp eyes, eyes on the queen.

238
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:47,021
Where is she?

239
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:48,033
There.

240
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:51,082
Mmm, I said sharp eyes.

241
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,083
The ship is gone!

242
00:15:57,028 --> 00:16:00,072
My lady, my queen, ow!

243
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:07,010
Gift for the queen.

244
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:08,070
We had more.

245
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:11,001
We got 'em off
this bride in Greensboro.

246
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,031
"To darling Jen.

247
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:17,001
Some days you'll find this handy,
Joan and Meg."

248
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:19,041
They gave her a ball?

249
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:22,030
Oh, well, I think what
you do is just squeeze it.

250
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,011
Does it talk to you?

251
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:30,011
I think it, like,
relieves your stress or something?

252
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:31,021
Really?

253
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,082
I think so.

254
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:36,031
Relieves your stress
without a single line of bull.

255
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:38,081
I found me a new husband, Wayne.

256
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,010
What else you got here?

257
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:43,070
Oh, my ring.

258
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:48,093
You all right?

259
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:51,051
I'm nervous. Freedom jitters.

260
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:06,060
There are preacher cookies at the tent.

261
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,083
Preacher cookies.

262
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,011
Thanks.

263
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:11,012
Preacher cookie time is here, kids.

264
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:14,023
There are preacher cookies at the tent.

265
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:16,060
I'm not hungry.

266
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:22,003
Di Di, I wanna show you something.

267
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:25,043
Ever since you were a child,
we just-- oh!

268
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:26,020
Have a cookie.

269
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,071
That's disgusting.

270
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:32,023
Oh, you didn't throw
our child out in the rain.

271
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,093
You don't need to take your shirt off.

272
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:43,012
Get your pants off.

273
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,042
Well-- what's taking you so long?

274
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:46,043
It's the heat.

275
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:10,050
Is that it?

276
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:23,062
What do you expect after
two years, six weeks, three days,
eight hours, five minutes?

277
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:27,042
Thirty-two seconds?

278
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:52,052
Well, look at those monkeys
dancing in the rain.

279
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:55,041
You don't wanna be
a monkey no more, Wayne?

280
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,010
Sam's still wearing
Di Di's old dresses.

281
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,072
Yeah.

282
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:19,021
Yeah, he likes them.

283
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:20,081
Go figure.

284
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:23,003
Could be worse.

285
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,023
Yeah.

286
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:29,012
Could be on crack.

287
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,081
We do not want any more
preacher cookies, thank you.

288
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:40,000
Wayne, I need to talk to you!

289
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:45,063
Why, Ginny Danegan.

290
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,092
What a pleasant surprise.

291
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:50,053
Good news, Wayne.

292
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,043
We're gonna have ourselves a wedding.

293
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:54,020
You're gonna marry your brother?

294
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:56,013
This is fantastic news.

295
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,091
I love what you're doing
for inbreeding.

296
00:19:58,006 --> 00:19:59,053
No, smart ass.

297
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:01,001
In the fall.

298
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:03,013
Our boy and your girl.

299
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:05,001
My daughter is a precious gem.

300
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:06,061
She has a mind of her own.

301
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:10,012
Your brother here
is a chromosomal retard.

302
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:12,020
Yeah, well, he likes her.

303
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,062
I don't care if he likes her.
We don't like him.

304
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:17,022
Wow, Dad's looking out for you, huh?

305
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:19,082
I'll come work for you, Mr. Malloy.

306
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:24,051
I can do like real good thievery.

307
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,040
A hundred and fifty years
of sucking off America.

308
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:31,012
What you got, ken,
is a culture of nothing.

309
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:33,080
What does he mean?

310
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:37,012
Think you're better than everybody else,
don't you, Wayne?

311
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:40,012
Why don't you go and shit yourself,
Ginny Danegan?

312
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:42,050
I got powers, asshole!

313
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:45,061
I could mess you up.

314
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:49,091
Why don't you talk some sense into him,
huh, Dahling?

315
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:51,092
You're royalty.

316
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:53,051
Oh, come on now, Ginny.

317
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:56,031
I believe my husband told you
to go on and shit yourself.

318
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:58,082
You can't back out at this, okay?

319
00:20:58,095 --> 00:20:59,073
It's done.

320
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:00,091
Your family promised it.

321
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:03,013
My family ain't promised
nothing to nobody.

322
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:04,083
Dale said it.

323
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:07,012
You got that, your highness?

324
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:21,092
Hey, since when does
Dale make the rules?

325
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,073
Hey, cousin.

326
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:24,082
Hey.

327
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,072
Heard I got promoted?

328
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,682
Oh yeah, by who?

329
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,341
By who? You know by who.

330
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:32,011
Oh. Feel them ribs.

331
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:34,050
They feedin' you in the big house?
You're skinny as an alley cat.

332
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:36,013
Uh-huh. I wanna see Earl.

333
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:39,590
- Let me see you first.
- I'm gonna go see Earl.

334
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:41,420
You haven't changed a bit.

335
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,023
Oh, Earl.

336
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,072
It's Dahlia and Wayne.

337
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,053
Dahlia!

338
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:49,063
She's back from the pen.

339
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,042
The man's not a moron, ma.

340
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:55,040
How are you doing?

341
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:04,012
Uh, daddy asked me to give these
to you as a-- a welcome home gift.

342
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:04,083
Oh, gosh.

343
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:06,043
Thank you, uncle earl.

344
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:08,042
He told you to buy her some earrings?

345
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:10,013
Not in so many words, ma.

346
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:12,002
Man can't speak, remember?

347
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:14,011
I took some initiative.

348
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:16,050
Oh, they're beautiful.

349
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,023
Welcome home, Dahl.

350
00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:22,062
You got my cut?

351
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,010
I am the one with the fingers, Wayne.

352
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,470
You gonna put it in the safe
or wipe your ass with it?

353
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:38,381
Be nice, boys.

354
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:41,590
Something tells me your daddy
never told you the combination.

355
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,041
He told me how to open it, Wayne.

356
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:46,012
What's the combination, Dale?

357
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:47,042
Has it got a 2 in it?

358
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:48,593
Is it one of those numbers
you can count up to?

359
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:50,011
Outside. Outside!

360
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:50,093
Hey.

361
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:53,012
Enough with the damn bell, daddy!

362
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:54,492
Let us get something straight here.

363
00:22:55,008 --> 00:22:57,092
I am the new boss, he is the old boss.

364
00:22:57,097 --> 00:23:00,041
That man don't take a piss
without my help.

365
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:02,010
You look at me while I am talking.

366
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:04,460
What the hell did you promise
Ginny Danegan?

367
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:07,490
That marriage is good
for the whole family.

368
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:11,051
We get in bed with the Danegans,
we are in serious cush.

369
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,493
It is good for all of us.

370
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:14,430
It is not good for me.

371
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:17,370
- I say she marries him.
- I say you marry him.

372
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,051
I had her Wayne.

373
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:24,493
All up in the ass.

374
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:28,000
Who is this, Ginny Danegan?

375
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,040
Your wife.

376
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:30,041
Oh?

377
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:32,492
Yeah, where'd all
this ass-having take place?

378
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:34,030
In my room.

379
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh, your mama's room?

380
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:39,053
Tell you where you had it Dale,
in your dreams.

381
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,071
You lost. I won.

382
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:43,021
Get over it.

383
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:49,011
Shit!

384
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:54,491
Get your goddamn faggot son off of me!

385
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:56,040
Dad!

386
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,081
Sammy, no.

387
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:07,041
- She marries him.
- Enough!

388
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,033
You got it?

389
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:10,061
She marries him.

390
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:20,463
I think we won, huh?

391
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:23,002
come here.

392
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:26,473
So where are we gonna go?

393
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:30,463
Life's a river, kid.

394
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:33,002
You gotta go where it takes you.

395
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:39,353
Cal?

396
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:46,083
Where is Cal?

397
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:51,030
Cal?

398
00:24:52,048 --> 00:24:54,032
Where's my baby? Where's Cal?

399
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:55,070
I'm here, mom.

400
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:57,062
My Cal.

401
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,002
Where are we?

402
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:34,013
Mississippi.

403
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:39,063
Mississippi.

404
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:56,083
Well, if it ain't Wayne Malloy.

405
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:02,032
How are you, Mick?

406
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:04,090
I didn't know there was
any Malloys in these parts.

407
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,032
In Alabama, actually.

408
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,793
- Oh, so you're rovin'.
- Yeah.

409
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,092
We're rovin', too.

410
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:13,043
All the O'Malleys are
down in Florida.

411
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:14,092
Hey, darling.

412
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:17,001
When'd you get paroled?

413
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:18,061
Linda O'Reilly?

414
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:20,061
It's O'Malley, Hon.

415
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:23,050
Jail will rip you up inside, huh?

416
00:27:23,065 --> 00:27:27,472
Whoa, you've been rovin'
pretty good, pumping that premium.

417
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,780
- Yeah, can't complain.
- I'll say you can't.

418
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:32,083
So what you been up to, crankin' paint?

419
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:35,072
- Well, now-
- You wanna come to Tupelo?

420
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:37,791
Got a good livin' there.
Can use a hand.

421
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:40,030
That town's got a butthole
as big as my head.

422
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:42,001
Hey, watch yourself.

423
00:27:42,017 --> 00:27:43,073
Smarten up.

424
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:45,012
Get out of here.

425
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:47,080
I got a little termite thing
going on up there.

426
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:50,020
Best cash I ever made.

427
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,052
Get us some breakfast, baby.

428
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:59,051
So you don't wanna come to Tupelo?

429
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,051
We're going somewhere else.

430
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:19,093
How you doing, partner?
Long time no see.

431
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:21,072
Where you going?

432
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:24,071
- What?
- Where are you going, "somewhere else"?

433
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:26,041
Why don't you mind your
own business, Mick?

434
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:28,031
That's kinda selfish, huh, Wayne?

435
00:28:28,037 --> 00:28:30,043
I mean, you're pumping premium.

436
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:36,030
Now, I offered you Tupelo,
but you got something better.

437
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,013
I want in on it.

438
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,012
- You want in on it?
- I want in on it.

439
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:44,082
- You want it on it?
- I want in on it.

440
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:46,032
You want in on this?

441
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:22,000
Damn, Wayne.

442
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:27,051
Get one of these glue guns and pump
the termites right into the wood.

443
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:29,043
Oh, god.

444
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:31,030
Oh, Wayne.

445
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:32,092
I gave you a 20!

446
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:35,032
C'mon, you gave her a 10, boy.

447
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:39,020
Come on!

448
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:40,071
Wayne!

449
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:43,031
- Wayne, you better tell-
- Go on, go on, go on!

450
00:29:43,036 --> 00:29:44,041
God damn it!

451
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:46,032
- Cal, don't you-
- Get in, cal!

452
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:48,003
No! No!

453
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:49,063
God, you piece of shit!

454
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,030
Dahlia! Dahlia, wait!

455
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,030
Move!

456
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,082
Don't hit her.

457
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,091
What the hell?

458
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,031
God damn it.

459
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:02,080
Where we going, Wayne?

460
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:03,041
What happened to your face?

461
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,031
Where are we goin'?

462
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,042
What did you do, dad?

463
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:06,093
Shut up, all of ya.

464
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:09,042
Look, Dale and I had a disagreement.

465
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,001
I decided to spend a few days away.

466
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:13,021
- They were having a party for me.
- Yeah, well, the party's over.

467
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,031
It is my family, Wayne.

468
00:30:15,037 --> 00:30:16,010
This is your family.

469
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:19,013
- Dad, you're bleeding.
- Get out of the way, Di.

470
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:21,002
You know what?
You got to take me back.

471
00:30:21,008 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm on parole.

472
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:23,011
Take off those earrings.

473
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:25,573
- No, it's my goddamn birthstone!
- Take 'em off!

474
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:37,070
What the hell?

475
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:39,080
Wayne, god damn it! Pull over!

476
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,491
You're crazy.

477
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,072
Dahlia, make him stop!

478
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:44,082
Wayne, you hear me?

479
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:46,033
God, you piece of shit!

480
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:47,050
- Son of a bitch!
- Pull over now!

481
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:50,040
You're crazy! You're in
the wrong lane, asshole!

482
00:30:51,075 --> 00:30:54,021
Dahlia! Dahlia!

483
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:55,362
- He's crazy, dad.
- You're crazy!

484
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:57,040
Pull over, Wayne!

485
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:00,473
Get down! He's got a gun!

486
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:02,080
Stay down, kids. Just stay down.

487
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:05,060
Pull over!

488
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:09,093
Oh, my god!

489
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,020
Stop!

490
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:14,011
Oh, my god! Mick!

491
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:17,092
Is she hurt?

492
00:32:18,007 --> 00:32:19,082
No, she's fine.

493
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:22,013
What about me? Am I hurt?

494
00:32:22,046 --> 00:32:24,083
Uh, yeah, a bit.

495
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:43,093
You got coverage?

496
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:45,070
What?

497
00:32:45,078 --> 00:32:47,080
You got insurance?

498
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:52,050
Just--just-- give me my cell phone.

499
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:54,043
No, just don't move.

500
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:59,070
You got a big piece of wood
sticking in your chest.

501
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:01,062
I'm sorry.

502
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:04,082
Do you have something to say?

503
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:06,070
Go to hell.

504
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:24,063
She's breathing!

505
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:27,023
She's breathing!

506
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:28,072
She's not breathing, ma.

507
00:33:28,078 --> 00:33:31,010
You're breathing for both of you.

508
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:31,021
Cal, strip the car.

509
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:42,022
Pull around the back.

510
00:36:21,028 --> 00:36:22,093
All right, can we go now?

511
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:25,072
- It's a long way back to the woods.
- So?

512
00:36:25,097 --> 00:36:30,040
So, I say we stay the night.

513
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:36,003
You're sleeping out here, huh?

514
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:38,041
Yeah. If you people
wanna wake up with no soul,

515
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:40,053
that's your problem, not mine.

516
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:42,433
Just superstition, Cal.

517
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:45,353
All I think you're gonna wake up
with is pneumonia.

518
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:51,063
What do you think they were like?

519
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:53,060
Who?

520
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:55,050
Them.

521
00:36:57,025 --> 00:36:59,023
They were buffers, Di.

522
00:37:00,057 --> 00:37:03,043
Beginning, middle, end.

523
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:25,081
It scared me every night.

524
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:30,083
What?

525
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:33,011
Waking up without a soul.

526
00:37:33,078 --> 00:37:36,091
Every time the guards
turned down the lights.

527
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:45,021
How long we gonna stay away?

528
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:51,041
It should've been me.

529
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,050
No shit, it should've been you.

530
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,080
But it wasn't you, was it, Wayne?

531
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:11,030
It was me.

532
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:56,000
- Mr. Rich?
- Huh?

533
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:58,062
Is this Mr. Douglas Rich?

534
00:38:59,097 --> 00:39:02,010
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

535
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:06,041
To the master bedroom, ma'am?

536
00:39:06,058 --> 00:39:09,010
No, you can put them down here, in there.

537
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:14,042
Told you we should stick around.

538
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:17,070
Doug?

539
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:20,061
Doug.

540
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:23,092
Hello. I'm Jim. This is my wife, Nina.

541
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:25,022
Hi.

542
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:27,002
Andrea said we should
introduce ourselves.

543
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:28,061
Right.

544
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:32,463
- Which Andrea are we talking about?
- Your realtor.

545
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:35,083
She sold us ours, too.

546
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,051
They look friendly.

547
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:45,063
They're always friendly to your face.

548
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:46,090
Hey, Delilah.

549
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:48,091
Come and meet our new neighbors.

550
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:50,053
Hi there, sweetheart.

551
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:53,012
Oh, I bet you miss your Tampa friends.

552
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,021
My what?

553
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,091
Your friends from Tampa, girl.

554
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:58,022
Tell them about your friends.

555
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,013
I don't have any friends.

556
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:02,001
They're dead.

557
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:05,052
She's brokenhearted.

558
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:07,083
Left behind a special Tampa guy.

559
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:11,041
Well, it was great to meet you,
Doug, but I got to get going,

560
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:12,073
or I'm gonna be late.

561
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:14,030
Jim's never late.

562
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:17,003
He has an 18-hole addiction.

563
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:18,073
She means golf.

564
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:24,053
Well, looks like you got
the habit yourself.

565
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:29,010
Yeah. I'm an 18-hole sinner, Jim.

566
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:32,020
Love the little suckers
like my children.

567
00:40:32,078 --> 00:40:35,080
Well, why don't you come along?

568
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:39,002
Kinda chatty there, ain't you, Wayne?

569
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:40,033
Just shootin' the shit, Hon.

570
00:40:40,048 --> 00:40:42,061
Yes, a little too much shit, if you ask me.

571
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:44,053
Doug's dead.

572
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:48,001
And judging by the conversation
I just had, no one knows him here.

573
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,021
What about the realtor?

574
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:50,063
She never met the man.

575
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:53,000
He bought the place on the internet.

576
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:56,031
We will leave tonight.

577
00:40:56,038 --> 00:41:03,070
But right now, Dougie...
gonna do a little golf.

578
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:09,020
What's he doin' now?

579
00:41:09,038 --> 00:41:12,033
Oh, apparently, he's gonna play golf.

580
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:14,002
Easy par four.

581
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,463
You can even birdie this hole.

582
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:18,060
Oh, who let the riffraff in?

583
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:21,020
I don't know you, do I?

584
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:24,093
Oh, I'm with, uh... you mean,
old sand trap here?

585
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:29,022
Doug, meet hugh panetta, the biggest
asshole east of the Mississippi.

586
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:31,070
You flatter me, Jim.

587
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:34,093
How's that 30 handicap coming along?

588
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:39,013
So what do you do when you're not
pissing on my golf course, Doug?

589
00:41:39,057 --> 00:41:41,063
I'm a lawyer, Hugh.

590
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,083
Liar, huh?

591
00:41:42,096 --> 00:41:44,091
A lawyer.

592
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:47,032
That what I just said?

593
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:51,020
Where'd you go to lie school?

594
00:41:52,018 --> 00:41:59,021
Georgetown, class of '88,
suma cum later, Hugh.

595
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:01,033
Well, it's a small world.

596
00:42:01,038 --> 00:42:04,020
Bill's a liar, Raymond's a liar.

597
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:07,040
I hear liars pull it left.

598
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,010
How do you pull it, Doug?

599
00:42:10,026 --> 00:42:12,001
I'm not your average liar, Hugh.

600
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:13,061
Oh, here we go.

601
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:15,030
Here we go.

602
00:42:15,048 --> 00:42:17,070
What do you say, boys?
A hundred bucks a hole?

603
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:20,011
Hundred bucks sounds great.

604
00:42:28,287 --> 00:42:30,050
That's a hell of a golf shot there.

605
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:31,052
Thank you, Hugh.

606
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:56,053
I'd like to introduce the best man,
Mike Piniella, once again.

607
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:59,073
He and Doug were roommates in college,
and he has a few words of

608
00:42:59,087 --> 00:43:02,083
his own he'd like to add
to this wonderful ceremony.

609
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:07,052
"I came in from the wilderness,"
a creature void of form.

610
00:43:07,077 --> 00:43:11,090
Come in, she said, I'll give you
shelter from the storm.

611
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:14,091
Doug, Cherien,

612
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:50,060
Come on, vein. Come on.

613
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:53,082
That's good.

614
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:57,091
Come on. Don't do it.

615
00:43:57,095 --> 00:44:01,032
Don't do it...

616
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,013
Come on, jesus, don't.

617
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:05,051
Don't do it.

618
00:44:15,037 --> 00:44:17,053
I want it.

619
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:23,061
Shit.

620
00:44:36,025 --> 00:44:37,091
Where is it?

621
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:56,083
No.

622
00:44:59,088 --> 00:45:00,060
Hey, there.

623
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:02,023
Damn it!

624
00:45:02,085 --> 00:45:04,010
Hi, there.

625
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:05,053
You must be Cherien.

626
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:07,071
Oh, god.

627
00:45:07,088 --> 00:45:11,091
Oh, my god, did you hurt your hand?

628
00:45:11,098 --> 00:45:17,042
Shh shh shh, honey. Oh, look at that.

629
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:20,091
You got locked out,
and you hurt your hand.

630
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:23,073
I got locked out, and I hurt my hand.

631
00:45:23,076 --> 00:45:28,091
Oh, shh. It's okay.

632
00:45:29,038 --> 00:45:31,093
There's a little trick I learned.

633
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:35,010
Where, I don't wanna say.

634
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:37,053
Oh, no, no.

635
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,092
No, no, please don't go in there.

636
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:42,023
How bad can it be?

637
00:45:47,006 --> 00:45:50,090
I was looking
for my--my toaster.

638
00:45:57,066 --> 00:46:01,021
You are doing one hell of a job, Dana.

639
00:46:01,085 --> 00:46:03,060
Thank you.

640
00:46:09,028 --> 00:46:12,001
Oh, thank you.

641
00:46:12,026 --> 00:46:17,000
Um... and thank you.

642
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:20,050
What do you say, double
or nothing next week?

643
00:46:21,027 --> 00:46:23,030
Sure.

644
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,052
Hell of a shot on 18, Doug.

645
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:51,012
My name is Dahlia.

646
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:55,083
So not Cherien.

647
00:46:56,027 --> 00:46:58,063
It's my middle name.

648
00:46:59,088 --> 00:47:02,020
Are you scared, Dahlia?

649
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:05,073
Moving to a new place can be hard.

650
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:08,093
Yeah, a little bit.

651
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:18,093
Here, this should get you through.

652
00:47:22,085 --> 00:47:25,070
You're gonna like it here in Edenfalls.

653
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:30,011
Good roads, good schools.

654
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:40,063
Hell, even money grows
on lawn chairs here.

655
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:50,082
Hey, sugarplum.

656
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:53,082
I didn't know, Dale.
I swear I didn't know.

657
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:57,000
Didn't know what?

658
00:47:57,015 --> 00:47:59,010
I'll bring the money back to you.

659
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:01,033
We got--we got a lot of
good stuff here.

660
00:48:01,038 --> 00:48:02,063
I'll bring it back to you.

661
00:48:02,066 --> 00:48:04,032
I'm--I'm gonna make it up
to you, Dale.

662
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,022
It ain't about the money, Dahl.

663
00:48:07,037 --> 00:48:09,023
A trust has been broken.

664
00:48:09,025 --> 00:48:10,080
There is a rift.

665
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,050
I mean, I heard of people
double-crossing each other,

666
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:16,050
but what kind of monster
steals the family bank?

667
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:18,023
Think about it.

668
00:48:18,026 --> 00:48:20,040
That is subhuman behavior.

669
00:48:20,045 --> 00:48:23,373
- Do you hear what I'm telling you?
- I--I know, Dale.

670
00:48:23,408 --> 00:48:25,070
Do you hear what I am telling you?

671
00:48:25,075 --> 00:48:28,003
What can I do?

672
00:48:28,025 --> 00:48:31,080
Well, you could start by leaving him.

673
00:48:32,017 --> 00:48:35,043
- He won't do it again on my honor.
- It's over, Hon.

674
00:48:35,086 --> 00:48:37,031
Your name don't mean much anymore.

675
00:48:37,037 --> 00:48:40,002
No, my name... is shit.

676
00:48:40,027 --> 00:48:42,492
Every family from here
to Canada knows what you did.

677
00:48:43,008 --> 00:48:46,010
So, why don't you just
tell me where you are?

678
00:48:46,045 --> 00:48:49,071
On my honor, I'll be gentle.

679
00:48:49,086 --> 00:48:52,063
You and the kids can wait outside.

680
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:56,032
I can't do that, Dale.

681
00:48:56,075 --> 00:48:59,023
Then we cut you out like a cancer.

682
00:49:00,086 --> 00:49:02,021
Would you like that?

683
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:04,070
No?

684
00:49:26,036 --> 00:49:32,053
This life we're living...
We can't do it anymore.

685
00:49:33,016 --> 00:49:36,033
And what life
do you wanna live, Wayne?

686
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:40,013
I don't know.

687
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:42,593
You should've thought of that
before you took the money, maybe.

688
00:49:43,005 --> 00:49:44,041
Maybe.

689
00:49:44,045 --> 00:49:45,080
Wayne, take it back.

690
00:49:45,086 --> 00:49:46,070
It's over.

691
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:48,061
Let me take it back to him.

692
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:52,021
I'll just say you dropped it
or you got scared to face them
or some shit.

693
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:53,083
And I'll work on him.
Let me work on him.

694
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:55,070
I'll find a way. You know I know how.

695
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:59,070
- Shut up!
- Don't you dare tell me to shut up!

696
00:49:59,085 --> 00:50:01,063
I am barely out of jail!

697
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:04,070
I've broken my parole, and
I'm living in some dead guy's house!

698
00:50:04,078 --> 00:50:11,002
I am not some asshole, you understand?
I am not nothing.

699
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:15,042
I wasn't born to eat his shit!

700
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:19,022
- I wasn't born to follow rules!
- What were you born for, Wayne?

701
00:50:19,037 --> 00:50:21,063
An unconsidered life
is not worth living!

702
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:25,021
Well, I was born to make
my life worth living!

703
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:30,003
And how are you gonna do that,
Wayne? Huh?

704
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:33,090
I love you. I chose you because
you're not nothin'.

705
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:36,090
God, I dreamed of you every night!

706
00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:39,013
What do you wanna do?

707
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:40,082
You wanna pretend to be the dead guy?

708
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:42,023
Is that what you want?

709
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:44,483
You wanna wear his suit,
and you want me to be his dead wife.

710
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:47,041
Yeah?

711
00:50:48,057 --> 00:50:52,053
You ripped me out
of everything that I know.

712
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:56,070
And what do you give me in return?

713
00:50:58,008 --> 00:51:00,071
What life do you want us to live?

714
00:51:12,097 --> 00:51:14,070
We're going home.

715
00:51:14,088 --> 00:51:17,060
- Home?
- She means camp.

716
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:18,070
What about dad?

717
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:20,091
Your dad's staying here.

718
00:51:21,025 --> 00:51:23,031
You're staying here?

719
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:27,071
Well, fine, then I'm staying here, too.

720
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:29,001
Don't be stupid. Go with your mother.

721
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:31,013
No, she doesn't give a shit about me.

722
00:51:31,015 --> 00:51:32,021
I'm staying here.

723
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:33,431
If we're run into
more trouble we'll just find

724
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:34,070
ourselves some more dead buffers.

725
00:51:34,077 --> 00:51:36,002
Stop it, Di Di. Come on, baby.

726
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:40,030
No. I said I'm staying.

727
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:42,033
Don't push me.

728
00:51:42,048 --> 00:51:44,042
I know more than you think.

729
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:28,010
I don't need much, but I need you.

730
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:52,023
Now, who buys a house on the internet?

731
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:53,071
A rich man.

732
00:53:53,075 --> 00:53:55,042
The microwave's cool.

733
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:57,020
Yeah, don't forget all
the dead buffers in the freezer,

734
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:59,032
- they're very, very cool.
- Shut up, cal.

735
00:53:59,096 --> 00:54:01,011
What about his job?

736
00:54:01,026 --> 00:54:02,000
What about it?

737
00:54:02,008 --> 00:54:03,053
Someone's gonna come looking for him.

738
00:54:03,057 --> 00:54:06,012
Maybe he's a spy.
Maybe he's an astronaut.

739
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:08,032
People don't move into nothin', Wayne.

740
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:09,492
People have people.

741
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:13,011
They got bosses, friends, enemies.

742
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:16,072
You're gonna tell me no one's
coming through them doors tomorrow?

743
00:54:17,035 --> 00:54:19,062
I don't know who's coming through
those doors tomorrow.

744
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:21,042
All I know is who's in here today.

745
00:54:21,046 --> 00:54:25,252
- If Dale shows up looking for us,
here's gonna be safer than the road.
- No, no.

746
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:29,010
- Not if we give back the money, no.
- We're not giving back the money.

747
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:34,012
We're not giving back the money.

748
00:54:34,045 --> 00:54:36,070
Oh, come on, ma.

749
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:40,002
We're investing it.

750
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:41,743
In what? Stocks?

751
00:54:41,788 --> 00:54:44,020
Yeah, Cal, we're gonna buy
low to mid cap annuities.

752
00:54:44,028 --> 00:54:47,021
Okay, what are we investing in, dad?

753
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:52,060
We're investing in us.

754
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:55,011
Okay, I'm confused.
I don't get it.

755
00:54:55,018 --> 00:54:57,023
- What's the angle here?
- How are we bleeding them?

756
00:54:57,026 --> 00:54:59,010
- We're not bleeding anyone.
- Oh, we're not?

757
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:01,050
Then what are we doing here, dad?

758
00:55:01,056 --> 00:55:03,052
The American Dream.

759
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,023
What?!

760
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:08,012
We're gonna steal it.

761
00:55:08,026 --> 00:55:10,043
What does that mean, dad?

762
00:55:10,048 --> 00:55:12,081
It means we're gonna live, Cal.

763
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:14,003
We're gonna what?

764
00:55:14,007 --> 00:55:15,062
We're gonna live.

765
00:55:15,066 --> 00:55:17,012
People do it all the time, honey.

766
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:18,011
So we, what?

767
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:20,010
We just live?

768
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:21,013
That's the idea.

769
00:55:21,015 --> 00:55:22,023
Like buffers.

770
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:23,071
Like buffers.

771
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:27,013
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

772
00:55:41,017 --> 00:55:42,040
Hey, Doug.

773
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,011
Connor. Too many lawyers?

774
00:55:44,017 --> 00:55:46,012
Ah, I know.

775
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:47,022
What firm are you with?

776
00:55:47,035 --> 00:55:48,072
I'm not a lawyer, Doug.

777
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:50,011
Developer then.

778
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:52,060
Well, of young minds, I like to think.

779
00:55:52,065 --> 00:55:55,030
I teach modern poetry at LSU.

780
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:58,051
Poetry.

781
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:09,030
"They miss... the whisper
that runs any day in your mind.

782
00:56:09,097 --> 00:56:13,000
Who are you really, wanderer?

783
00:56:14,018 --> 00:56:17,030
And the answer you have to give...

784
00:56:17,037 --> 00:56:21,042
no matter how dark and cold
the world around you is...

785
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,021
maybe I'm a king."

786
00:57:16,025 --> 00:57:21,073
