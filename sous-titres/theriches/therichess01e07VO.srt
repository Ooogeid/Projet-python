1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Mick, look out!

2
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:10,674
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:14,675
You want to pretend
to be the dead guy ?

4
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:17,163
You want to wear his suits,
you want me to be his dead wife ?

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,022
- I know everything.
- You don't know shit.

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,825
I know Wayne Malloy
stole the family bank.

7
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:22,797
I know that you are up
to your eyeballs in shit

8
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,259
if you don't get
that money back.

9
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:26,425
I know none of this
is helping your position here.

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,638
My being here means
you're a dead man, Wayne Malloy.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,650
I think Dale would be
mighty interested in your address.

12
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:35,220
What do you want,
Ginny Dannegan ?

13
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,473
Well, look who it is.

14
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:40,017
Hi, everybody.

15
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,849
- Who is that ?
- This would be Ken.

16
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,721
Di's fiance.

17
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,087
What ?

18
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,892
Why does he have
to stay with us ?

19
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:48,551
Cause, you know,
the fiance always stays

20
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:50,461
with the in-laws in
the run-up to the wedding.

21
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:52,010
- It's tradition.
- I'm not gonna marry him.

22
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,835
Well, it's tradition.
That's all I'm saying.

23
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:54,902
Holy shit.

24
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,884
I'd do anything for you, Delilah.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,913
What kind of monster
steals the family bank ?

26
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,465
- He won't do it again, on my honor.
- It's over.

27
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:03,447
Why don't you just
tell me where you are ?

28
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:05,434
You and the kids
can wait outside.

29
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:08,433
Is that what you think of me, Daddy ?
Can't trust me to run the family ?

30
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:13,021
It's a real big burden,
being responsible for a whole family.

31
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:16,283
Don't feel bad at your daddy
for not picking you.

32
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:20,664
All I ever wanted to do
was make you proud, Daddy.

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,809
And I will carry you
in my heart...

34
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:25,433
till the day that I die.

35
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:14,426
<i>It's 4:30 in the morning.
What do you want ?</i>

36
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:19,385
Is that you ?

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,037
<i>Dale, what is it ?</i>

38
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:24,155
He's dead.

39
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:26,040
<i>My daddy is dead.</i>

40
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,012
What happened ?

41
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,732
He wanted to die.

42
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:41,470
He crawled out to the woods...

43
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:42,809
to die.

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,383
The funeral is this weekend.

45
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:56,016
<i>You gotta be there for the family.</i>

46
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:04,934
I can't.

47
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,143
You have to be there for him.

48
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,138
You gotta sing for him.

49
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,433
Just bring back the money, D.

50
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,754
I'll take care of things from here.

51
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,765
<i>I don't have it.</i>

52
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,582
Who are you, D ?

53
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,012
Are you one of us,

54
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:30,843
<i>or you one of them ?</i>

55
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:12,530
Shit.

56
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,155
Have you reached China yet ?

57
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,295
We've lost the money.
You're not gonna find it.

58
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:29,813
He's dead.

59
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:33,070
He loved us and
we left him like he was nothing.

60
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:34,395
How do you know ?

61
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:35,917
Dale told me.

62
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,391
He said Earl crawled off
in the woods to die.

63
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:39,580
He crawled ?

64
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,072
Look, would you stop digging ?

65
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,286
Dale said if we just
pay back the money...

66
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:46,774
Since when do you
believe a word Dale says ?

67
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:47,919
Damn this.

68
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:50,106
Look, I'm just gonna
go alone, Wayne.

69
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,790
I'm gonna find the money,

70
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,141
I'm gonna take it back,
and make things right again.

71
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,383
You cannot make
things right again.

72
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,948
So you don't want to go
pay your respects to Earl ?

73
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:01,019
This is a chance, Wayne,
to make amends.

74
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,577
They don't want
our goddamn amends.

75
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,477
How can you be so cold ?

76
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:07,228
- He loved you !
- And I loved him.

77
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:08,895
It's over.

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,622
Oh, my God, I cannot talk
to you anymore.

79
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:14,137
Maybe Dale lied,
maybe Earl's not dead.

80
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:17,422
He would never lie
about something like that.

81
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:19,855
- You're so sure ?
- I choose to believe him.

82
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:22,353
I choose to have faith
in the people I love.

83
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:23,641
You love Dale ?

84
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:25,168
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

85
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:26,880
Who do you want me
to love, Wayne ?

86
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,561
You want me
to love our neighbors ?

87
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,065
Your boss ?

88
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:32,924
All the lovely people who come
into my life now call me Cherien.

89
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:34,359
You want me to love them ?

Season 1 - Episode 07
<i>Virgin Territory</i>

95
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:10,282
We never use
any of this shit anyway.

96
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,752
If you don't use it,
then we don't need it.

97
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:16,802
- What is she doing ?
- You gonna hock all that ?

98
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:19,809
Mom, stop.
You can't hock the coffeemaker.

99
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,394
Someone help me, please.

100
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:25,398
You want all
this shit now, don't you ?

101
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,779
You see,
that's what happens.

102
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:29,029
You start to believe
that you actually need it.

103
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:30,174
Baby, calm down.

104
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:31,552
You know what ?

105
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,833
I'm not asking for a single thing
from any one of you.

106
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:37,518
I'm going by myself.

107
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,496
I think she wants
to go to the funeral.

108
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,820
You know how close
she was to Earl and Susan.

109
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,105
They were like her parents.

110
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,471
We can't let her go alone.

111
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,415
Who knows what
they're gonna do to her there.

112
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:49,890
If she goes,

113
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,650
we all go together.

114
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:54,411
- You can't go.
- Why not ?

115
00:06:57,429 --> 00:06:58,604
Shit.

116
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,941
Yeah, Cal's right.
Your mother and I'll go alone.

117
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,179
You can't go, either.
Dale wants to kill you.

118
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:05,011
Dale wants $40,000.

119
00:07:05,118 --> 00:07:07,127
Well, that's a lot
of silverware, Dad.

120
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:08,467
Yeah, well, I'll get it.

121
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:11,036
You're gonna get
40 grand in cash ?

122
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:14,277
Count me in for three.

123
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,038
- Brent still owes me.
- Who's Brent ?

124
00:07:17,134 --> 00:07:18,769
Cal and Brent are
in business together.

125
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,631
Yeah, I'll give him a call.
I'll have the cash here tonight.

126
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:24,721
- What time is it ?
- Oh, who knows ?

127
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,566
Mom stopped all the clocks.

128
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,751
Dahlia, put the bag down.
You're not going anywhere.

129
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,638
All right.

130
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:39,647
If you go...

131
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:41,909
we're all going with you.

132
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,864
Hey, which one's your office ?

133
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:54,138
I'm not telling you.

134
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,188
I want to know
where my dad works.

135
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,546
That one.

136
00:07:57,964 --> 00:07:59,665
No shit. For real ?

137
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,195
Don't steal anything.

138
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,630
Come on.

139
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,156
What do you mean,
"don't steal anything" ?

140
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,364
What the hell is that ?

141
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:13,070
Barbecue at Hugh's.

142
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:27,371
Goddamn small bills.

143
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:30,917
Isn't this what got us
in trouble in the first place ?

144
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,420
Get outta here.

145
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,214
Cal, are you around ?

146
00:08:58,185 --> 00:08:59,743
Come on, dude,
where are you ?

147
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,330
Who are you ?

148
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:34,732
- Um, I was...
- You want something ?

149
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,628
Did you get a good look ?

150
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,555
You want to see
me naked ?

151
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:47,904
Come in.

152
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:49,899
Come on.

153
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:55,615
Sit down.

154
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,537
Now, let me
tell you something.

155
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:03,861
Women...

156
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,184
are smarter than you,

157
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,590
and you gotta respect them.

158
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,070
So when you were
over there in the door

159
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,935
peekin' in on me,

160
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:16,885
you're taking
advantage of my pain

161
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:18,826
for your own pleasure,

162
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:20,589
and that's wrong.

163
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:24,138
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,176
Okay, I didn't mean
to just stare at you.

165
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,938
What are you looking for ?

166
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:31,525
Love.

167
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:33,411
- Love ?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:36,276
Well, then, you gotta ask
yourself a question.

169
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,283
"Who can I count on ?"

170
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,856
"How can I trust ?"

171
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,341
Cause if you can't answer that...

172
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,401
Then you're gonna be all alone.

173
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:58,461
- I thought...
- Bobby!

174
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,265
It's Brent.

175
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:03,797
Lord, I appreciate
your sexual energy and all,

176
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:06,359
but, you know,
you're 17,

177
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:07,958
your Cal's friend.

178
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:11,342
I'm never, ever gonna
have sex with you.

179
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:12,832
You understand that ?

180
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,305
Oh, honey.

181
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,290
I mean, don't get me wrong.
You're cute as a button.

182
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:24,943
If I was gonna do a 17-year-old,
you'd definitely have a shot.

183
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:27,151
But...

184
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,072
it's not meant to be.

185
00:11:36,847 --> 00:11:38,433
Go on. Get out.

186
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:39,800
Get out.

187
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:41,829
Go on.

188
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,697
Ken, you know,
we're going back for the funeral.

189
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,729
You know we're going
back for the funeral.

190
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:13,016
You know we're going
back for the funeral.

191
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,941
Have you seen
this alligator guy ?

192
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,535
He's cool.

193
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:19,892
I gotta talk to you.

194
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:22,571
You know when there's
a traveller funeral, there's often

195
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:23,965
a traveller wedding.

196
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:26,890
Now, your sister Jenny,
she may use this opportunity

197
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,830
to make you marry Di.

198
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:30,567
Really ?
That's great.

199
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:32,557
No, not great.

200
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:33,993
It's bad.

201
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,360
You've got to
tell your sister "no".

202
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:38,163
Why ?

203
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,184
She's too young.

204
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:45,357
She's pretty, sure,

205
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,069
but she's too young.
She's naive,

206
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:49,533
she's gangly,
she doesn't know what's what.

207
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,239
You...

208
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:53,268
You're a man of the world.
You've been around.

209
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,435
You've seen it, you've seen
a horse, you know.

210
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:58,352
You've played the field,
you've been in fields.

211
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:03,149
It's just, you gotta be strong here.
You gotta protect her.

212
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,666
Well, I sure want to.

213
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:07,430
I know you do, so when
your sister Jenny says,

214
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:09,717
"what about the marriage ?",
you're gonna say...

215
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,938
- Yes.
- No.

216
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,879
No. It's a "no" sound.

217
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,437
- Nnnno.
- No.

218
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,551
That's the one.

219
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:16,986
You're gonna say,

220
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:18,708
"I want to wait".

221
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:20,604
I want to wait ?

222
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,119
"I want to wait",
much more positive.

223
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:25,592
- I want to wait.
- I want to wait.

224
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,670
No, that's more of
a "I want to wait ?"

225
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,095
"I want to wait",
you just go down.

226
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:31,560
I want to wait.

227
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:33,911
- I want to wait.
- Yeah.

228
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:39,737
You're the man.

229
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,280
<i>Let's go, baby.</i>

230
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:55,893
<i>Come on.</i>

231
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:58,963
Shit !

232
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:03,922
<i>Honey, if we want to get there,
we gotta get moving.</i>

1
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,542
Don't worry, guys.
Things get rough, I'll protect you.

2
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,022
That brings us comfort, Ken.

3
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:48,294
Don't laugh, honey.

4
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:49,901
We need his protection.

5
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,601
Ken, try not to talk about
living with us, okay?

6
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,888
Right.
Sure thing, mr. Rich.

7
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,917
Let's go.

8
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:02,800
How long are we gonna stay?

9
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:04,536
We get in, we get out.

10
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:30,140
Thank you for coming.

11
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,694
Nice to see you, too, Mick.

12
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,920
Darlin'.

13
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:42,692
Sorry.

14
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,497
Hello there, honey.

15
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,356
I'm so glad you're here.

16
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:54,441
I'm so glad you're here, sweetie.

17
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,314
And you, too, honey.

18
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:59,578
I'm so glad you're here for me.

19
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:01,160
I'm really sorry.

20
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:20,680
- I gotta do this.
- Dad...

21
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:25,874
Stick with didi. Don't waste
your breath. I'm comin' with you.

22
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,927
Love what you've done with the place.

23
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,462
Look at you, you son of a bitch.

24
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:46,170
You dress like the goddamn
president of the United States.

25
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:49,267
- How much that cost you?
- You think I bought it?

26
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:51,802
Such are the limits of your imagination.

27
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:53,460
Whatever.

28
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:56,667
Tell me where you're livin'.

29
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,059
Do you want this or not?

30
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,374
How much you got?

31
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:01,408
I want an oath of protection.

32
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:04,693
Look, I'm sorry.

33
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:07,772
I'm gonna

34
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:10,776
tell you something
right off the bat here,

35
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:12,638
mr. President,

36
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:16,064
whatever you got,

37
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:17,698
we want more.

38
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,687
Haven't you heard?

39
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:24,245
Everyone wants more.

40
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,068
You get the other half when we leave.

41
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:49,028
Okay, I'll give you the oath.

42
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,672
We love you.

43
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:13,155
It's good to have you back,
Wayne Malloy.

44
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:19,617
Thanks for this, Wayne.

45
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:21,478
I love you.

46
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,489
I gotta talk to susan.

47
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:30,211
Dahlia, we agreed.

48
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,386
Let it go.

49
00:19:40,874 --> 00:19:43,831
- Don't even think about it, Cal.
- I'm not an idiot.

50
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:45,974
Congratulations, didi.

51
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,827
On what?

52
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:50,413
Aren't you and Ken gettin'
married tonight?

53
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:55,842
- Who told you that?
- Jenny, I think.

54
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:57,814
Shit.

55
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,473
She must've gotten to Ken.

56
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,884
Got a really bad feeling about all
this wedding stuff, dad.

57
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,176
We gotta get the hell outta here.

58
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,276
Gave you 20 grand?

59
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,342
Without missin' a beat.

60
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:23,689
And that night she saw him,

61
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:26,083
Cal was drivin' a Mercedes, huh?

62
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,508
Yellow, shin', brand-new.

63
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:31,942
Who the hell does he think he is?

64
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,842
The king of Siam.

65
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,360
He betrayed us,

66
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:37,886
- every one of us.
- We're oughta make him eat shit.

67
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,341
Slainte mhath.

68
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,970
I heard you two were havin'
a rough couple of months.

69
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:49,519
I'm real sorry.

70
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:50,958
Couple of years.

71
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,570
- We manage.
- I'm tired of managin'.

72
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:55,784
I would love to help you guys out.

73
00:20:56,993 --> 00:21:00,315
- You deserve a piece of the good life.
- You're damn right.

74
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:02,849
Well,

75
00:21:03,944 --> 00:21:06,213
I got some money now.

76
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,778
There's a lot of insurance out on daddy.

77
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:10,937
I'd love to pass some your way.

78
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:14,879
Twenty-five gs sound like
a nice round number?

79
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,949
Now, I'm not sayin' get rid of Wayne,

80
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:28,952
but if he disappeared,

81
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,783
que sera-sera.

82
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,866
What exactly are you sayin' here, Dale?

83
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:52,326
Hey, Ken. We gotta go.

84
00:21:52,514 --> 00:21:53,624
Can't. I'm losin'.

85
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,813
It's solitaire, Ken.

86
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:56,135
That's why it hurts so much.

87
00:21:56,276 --> 00:21:58,936
Sam will play solitaire
with you in the rv.

88
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,195
Promise?

89
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,440
We're havin' a weddin', Wayne.

90
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,248
Somethin' died, somethin's born.

91
00:22:07,646 --> 00:22:09,633
Somethin' ends, somethin' begins.

92
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:10,775
Dad.

93
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:12,597
Okay, Ken, we're leaving.

94
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:15,022
Now is the time to say your peace.
Tell her what you really think.

95
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,650
Di's counting on you.
We want you to be a man here.

96
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:19,590
I've been thinkin', mr. Rich.

97
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:20,935
You're your own man, Ken.

98
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,564
We're all counting on you
to do the right thing here.

99
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,332
I'm tryin' to do the right thing.

100
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:28,797
Well, now is the time
to say the n-o word.

101
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:42,999
No. A little bit more ballsy there.
"no."

102
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,879
No... no, I mean no.

103
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:49,398
I'm sorry, mr....

104
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,605
but I want to.

105
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,247
I want to marry her.

106
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,038
I've always wanted to.

107
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:58,588
I mean, ever since before my fever.

108
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:01,905
Now, I don't rember much,

109
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:04,619
but I remember her.

110
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:08,953
- Maybe you've...
- No, it's okay, Delilah,

111
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:10,705
'cause I want to,

112
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:14,382
and I'm gonna marry her.

113
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:16,345
Well,

114
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:18,415
the weddin's happenin',

115
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:20,566
and it happens tonight,

116
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,851
or I walk into that camp,
and I start runnin' my mouth.

117
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,923
You'll have about a hundred rvs
parked outside Edenfalls by sundown.

118
00:23:38,755 --> 00:23:41,071
I thought he'd live forever.

119
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:50,130
You shouldn't have left.

120
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,822
You shouldn't have taken that money.

121
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:57,248
That's when all the trouble came.

122
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,047
Susan, I'm sorry for what happened.

123
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,603
I am, I'm sorry.

124
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:02,652
I hugged you in public.

125
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:05,054
What more do you want?

126
00:24:05,272 --> 00:24:06,336
I just...

127
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:09,348
I missed you so much.

128
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,647
I just... I wanted to talk
to you like we used to.

129
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:14,737
Well, it's too late for all that.

130
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:28,866
Why did earl kill himself?

131
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:31,307
You go ask Dale about that.

132
00:24:31,573 --> 00:24:33,169
Why would I ask Dale?

133
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:34,710
'Cause

134
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,706
maybe I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

135
00:24:40,698 --> 00:24:42,247
How you feelin', mama?

136
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:44,062
I need a nap.

137
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:46,268
Well, go take one.

138
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:04,793
My daddy

139
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,062
wanted us to get married

140
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,424
almost as much as I did.

141
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:12,225
Almost as much as you did.

142
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,323
Do you rember that picnic

143
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:19,078
when you followed me
around all day long?

144
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:23,270
I was 14 years old.

145
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:25,797
- That first kiss...
- You stole it.

146
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:27,525
What's wrong with that?

147
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:34,924
I love Wayne.

148
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:37,552
What do you see in him?

149
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:39,445
I see myself.

150
00:25:42,112 --> 00:25:44,255
He asked you to betray who you are.

151
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,322
- Tell me about earl.
- What about him?

152
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,747
How'd he get down in the woods?

153
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,358
He crawled there, I told you.

154
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:02,803
He crawled there on

155
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,463
- his hands and knees?
- I reckon.

156
00:26:08,787 --> 00:26:11,087
- And what about the cuts?
- What cuts?

157
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:13,622
On his hands.

158
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,602
Cuts on his hands and his face.

159
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,808
That must have been painful.

160
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:24,474
What's with all the questions, D?

161
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:25,970
I just want to know what happened.

162
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,151
Well, I wasn't there, now, was I?

163
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,203
Were you?

164
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,801
What?

165
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:46,273
You think I carried him there...

166
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,434
And just left him there to die?

167
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,727
How did he get all them cuts then?

168
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:56,193
Tryin' to crawl home.

169
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:02,933
You really want to know how he died?

170
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:12,512
You really want to know how he died?

171
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:16,122
If he cried or...

172
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,765
Or whimpered?

173
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,175
Is that what you want to hear?

174
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:35,269
You left him there, D.

175
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:39,357
You left him there to suffer and die...

176
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:46,372
Just as much as anybody else.

177
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,257
Dahlia, we got a problem.

178
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,182
What happened?

179
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:15,951
- You're shaking.
- I'm cold.

180
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,180
Baby, we've gotta leave.

181
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:20,402
We gotta grab our little girl,
and we gotta run.

182
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,856
Dale killed earl.

183
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:25,743
- How do you know?
- How?

184
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,043
He pretty much told me.

185
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,053
God! Where the hell is dad?

186
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:40,774
I don't... look, just play along, okay?

187
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:42,788
Dad will come up with something.
He always does.

188
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,048
It doesn't really feel that way, Cal.

189
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:48,998
Don't touch me.
You bitch! God!

190
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:56,984
Just who do you think you are?

191
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:58,995
That's what I want to know.

192
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:02,030
'cause I rember when
you was 14 years old,

193
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:04,603
and you were just
a scrawny little runt.

194
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:08,725
Do you promise yourself
to Delilah Malloy,

195
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,446
in body and in spirit,

196
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:12,049
in heart and in mind,

197
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,099
forever and ever and always?

198
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:25,397
I just wanted to talk.

199
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:26,906
Do you want a drink?

200
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:30,316
Are you sure?

201
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:42,178
You bet.

202
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:44,235
And you, my child,

203
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:46,840
do you promise yourself to
kenneth dannegan,

204
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:48,561
in body and in spirit,

205
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:50,243
in heart and in mind?

206
00:29:50,595 --> 00:29:52,973
Mick, I see where you're heading,

207
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:55,868
but is there any chance
you could kill me later?

208
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:58,866
They're trying to marry off
my little girl, and I just got to...

209
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:00,252
Don't you move.

210
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,174
- I can handle it.
- He's got a gun!

211
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,220
Damn it, Dahlia.

212
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:10,333
Forever and ever, and always?

213
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:16,642
Now you tell me why killed your daddy,

214
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,442
you brutal son of a bitch.

215
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:26,929
No.

216
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:28,713
I can't, I...

217
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:31,560
What the hell is wrong with you people?

218
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,953
Jesus!

219
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:48,083
You're bonded together forever.

220
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:50,172
Well, no, not really.

221
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:53,145
We'll handle it from here, father.

222
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:56,227
Go on.

223
00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:00,393
What are you doin', D?

224
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:01,989
Shut up!

225
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,966
Pack enough clothes for
a good long time. Go on.

226
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:07,813
You're just pushin' me out.

227
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:11,654
Why do you hate me so much?

228
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:14,344
I loved him.
I goddamn worshipped him.

229
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,129
He was even choosing that idiot,

230
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,936
Ginny dannegan, over me.

231
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:21,220
I mean, how much is a man
supposed to take, right?

232
00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:22,362
Zip it up.

233
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:23,785
You zip it up!

234
00:31:26,906 --> 00:31:27,923
Now,

235
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:30,113
you are gonna write a letter,

236
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,756
you're gonna tell everyone what you did,

237
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,387
and you're gonna explain
to them why it is you're leaving.

238
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:40,923
I'm don't want to leave.

239
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:44,435
- I got nowhere to go.
- That's too bad.

240
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,836
Now get a goddamn
piece of paper... now!

241
00:31:51,338 --> 00:31:53,528
Just keep walkin'.
Don't talk to him.

242
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:56,313
Where you live, Wayne?

243
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:57,514
I want to know.

244
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,146
I'm happy to tell you whatever you want.

245
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:00,846
I want to know what you're doin'.

246
00:32:00,997 --> 00:32:02,780
- I want to know what it's like.
- I said,

247
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:04,337
don't talk to him!

248
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:07,200
Aluminum siding, outside of Baton Rouge.

249
00:32:07,364 --> 00:32:09,468
- Aluminum sidin'?
- It's heaven on earth.

250
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:12,206
How dumb do you think we are?

251
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,014
Dumb enough to leave
the scene of an accident.

252
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:22,405
You let me in, you little slut!

253
00:32:22,562 --> 00:32:24,580
God, just leave me alone!

254
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:29,712
You little whore.

255
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:31,808
You ungrateful brat.

256
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:34,038
Do you have any idea what
I could do to your family?

257
00:32:34,123 --> 00:32:35,969
Why don't you just do it
already then, Ginny,

258
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,588
because I can't take it anymore.

259
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:40,153
You want me to tell everybody
where you've been livin',

260
00:32:40,481 --> 00:32:43,282
huh? All about that big,
beautiful house,

261
00:32:43,438 --> 00:32:44,768
and them beautiful cars?

262
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:46,817
And how about that boy?

263
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:49,633
You know, the one that's got
his hands in your pants.

264
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:51,807
Go away.

265
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:54,052
You're not thinkin', Di.

266
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:55,812
What about the cops?

267
00:32:56,797 --> 00:32:59,488
You want me to tell 'em
where your mama's livin'?

268
00:33:00,724 --> 00:33:02,993
About how she's breakin' her parole,

269
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:04,964
huh?

270
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:12,539
What happened?

271
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,697
Mick killed them.

272
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:23,080
My whole family saw it all.
We haven't told anyone...

273
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:24,426
yet.

274
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:28,525
Now, you listen to me.

275
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:32,498
Ken's gonna come up here
in about two minutes,

276
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:34,782
and you're gonna open that door,

277
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:39,139
and then you two are gonna
consummate that weddin'.

278
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:43,399
Ken's dream is gonna come true.

279
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:47,272
After that, I don't give
a shit what you do.

280
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:49,055
You just want me to screw him?

281
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:51,480
Fine. Why don't you just send him
in here right now?

282
00:33:51,652 --> 00:33:54,100
I'll screw him.
I'll screw him right here.

283
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:15,289
Get a pen.

284
00:34:15,872 --> 00:34:16,921
Go on.

285
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,395
Sit down.

286
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:25,396
Now, you write, "dear ma."

287
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,491
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?

288
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:33,009
Write it!

289
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:18,483
I guess we're supposed to...

290
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:22,050
consummate now.

291
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:30,489
I... I'm a virgin.

292
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,944
Can you show me what to do?

293
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:46,165
So why don't you put
that gun down, mick,

294
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:49,372
and we can just sit down,
and we can talk about this.

295
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:51,500
And, you know, the thing is,

296
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,516
I think you want in on it.

297
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:58,709
I think you want in on
my aluminum siding deal.

298
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:02,479
- I've made more money than jesus.
- Shut him up!

299
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:05,185
I can't stand to listen to
any more of his lies!

300
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:07,383
He doesn't give a shit about us!

301
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,999
I want that money, mick.

302
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:11,173
- Give me that.
- Let go of the...

303
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:22,841
You shot me, you asshole.

304
00:36:24,703 --> 00:36:25,704
Oh, god.

305
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:30,903
Oh, god.

306
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,159
This feels like a dream.

307
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:39,375
Will you kiss me?

308
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:41,487
I don't want to, Ken.

309
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:43,349
Don't you love me?

310
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:48,719
You think

311
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:51,794
maybe someday you'll love me?

312
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,789
I barely know what love is.

313
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,155
But I'm pretty sure
I'm never gonna love you.

314
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:13,750
Why are you marrying me then?

315
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:18,310
Your sister's threatening me.

316
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:20,759
She says that if I don't marry you,

317
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:23,361
she's gonna send my mom back to prison.

318
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,257
- No, she won't.
- Yes, she will.

319
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:36,089
Listen to me.

320
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:40,803
I'll never let my sister blackmail you.

321
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,697
You understand?

322
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,875
If you don't want to marry me,

323
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:52,634
if you want to live in Edenfalls,

324
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:54,387
away from here...

325
00:37:58,064 --> 00:37:59,628
I'll protect you.

326
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:03,610
I promise.

327
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,230
My pen ain't got no ink.

328
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,436
Well, get another one.

329
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:31,894
He tortured me.

330
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:35,938
- He hated me.
- Shut up.

331
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,520
I did it for you, I did it for you.

332
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:42,539
You know, I swear,
I swear I need you.

333
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,225
Get down on your knees.

334
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:58,086
I love you, Dahlia.

335
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:05,548
And I would've done it 10 times over
just to see you again.

336
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:28,480
I'm not done.

337
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,854
I am through with this place.

338
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,867
My mama's always on my back.

339
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,107
My pen ain't got no ink.

340
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:10,688
This place is so small.

341
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:20,799
Why won't you listen?

342
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,458
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

343
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:24,116
I'm talkin' about the truth, susan.

344
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:26,095
You shouldn't have taken
the money, Dahlia.

345
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:27,753
What do you...
what money?

346
00:40:27,957 --> 00:40:30,241
I'm talkin' about your son
bein' a murder.

347
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,712
My son

348
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,575
did nothin' wrong.

349
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:38,658
And if you'd been here,
nothin' ever would've happened.

350
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:40,619
You're blaming me

351
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,310
for what your son did
to your husband

352
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,017
You get outta here!

353
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,673
She won't hear it.

354
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:10,732
Let's go, baby.

355
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:13,861
You can't make things right here.

356
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:15,625
Come on.

357
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:28,184
You hurt didi in any way,

358
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:30,954
hurt her family...

359
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:35,068
I ain't your brother no more.

360
00:41:37,336 --> 00:41:39,417
I'll choke you while you sleep.

361
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,875
Honey, get your sister's dress.

362
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,406
Some day, huh?

363
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:39,554
Can I ask you somethin'?

364
00:42:41,374 --> 00:42:43,752
Can you make someone love you?

365
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,323
What did you say about me?

366
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,014
Nothin'.

367
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,829
No, I didn't mean to...

368
00:43:18,344 --> 00:43:20,049
Where do they live?

369
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,819
