1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,790
previously on "the riches".

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,850
what did you do with pete?

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,540
You killed him.

4
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,660
I hit him,and then --but he fought back.

5
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,570
You murdered him!

6
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,850
We said 50/50.

7
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,280
We are in this together.

8
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,300
What happened with pete?

9
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,420
Did he take the money?

10
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,170
Pete's fine.Everything's all right.

11
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,460
Pete went home.

12
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,910
Bayou hills.

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,070
It's the dealof a lifetime,doug.

14
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,310
It's $150 million,and you cash in on $13 million.

15
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,750
Doug,this guy named chetcalled for you twice.

16
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,020
He's trying to findpete mincey.

17
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,190
Eamon quinn!

18
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,380
Free as a bird!

19
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,650
I just think if we could do one 
thing that we know is true,wayne.

20
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,470
Dahlia!Parole is the tipof the iceberg here.

21
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,680
We do not want to involvethe law.

22
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,300
- Parole violation.
- I'm honest!

23
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,410
I came here of my own free will!

24
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,280
You can't do this to me!

25
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,780
I just want a chance!

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,590
If you don't call me in 24 hours 
with a joband a place to live,

27
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,330
you will be hunted down.

28
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,310
Cal,why are you livingin a tent in the yard?

29
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,880
He thinks the houseis stealing our souls.

30
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,740
I'd rather be piss-poorwith my dad than 
$13 million richerwith whoever you are.

31
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,090
I'm not letting you leave,cal.

32
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,640
Aw,shit,di.Come on.

33
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,210
I hate goodbyes.

34
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,070
He used to do this.

35
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,910
He's done this before.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,030
I mean,it's a weird place.

37
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,820
He hasn't done it for a while.

38
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,560
No big deal.

39
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,800
Well,you thinkI don't know my child?

40
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,870
He always calls.

41
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,470
I know,but you were awayfor two years,
and whileyou were away,

42
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,790
he -- don't bring that up!

43
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,300
Don't you dare bring that up!

44
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,730
It's not about you --it's about him!

45
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,750
Look,maybe he's with friends.

46
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
Maybe he's met a girl.

47
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,830
What girl?

48
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,100
Cal don't like buffer girls.

49
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,810
What girl?

50
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,970
Well,maybe he met onehe likes.

51
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,340
We are his parents,okay?

52
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,490
We're his parents.

53
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,080
We don't know where he is.

54
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,160
Hey,baby.

55
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,140
The thunder wake you?

56
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,420
You woke me up.

57
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,440
Oh,I got to take this.

58
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,260
Okay.

59
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,570
Oh,son of a bitch.

60
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,030
Hugh.Hugh,calm down.

61
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,400
Don't worry about it.

62
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,360
Mom?

63
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,650
Yeah?

64
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,220
It's gonna be okay.

65
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,000
Thanks,baby.

66
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,340
Oh,cal,baby,please pick up.

67
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,380
Oh,cal,please pick up,baby.

Ied calling this morning?

72
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,230
Only about a couple hundred times.

73
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,350
Yeah,me too.

74
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,000
Dad,I need to talk to you.

75
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,600
Sure,sammy.What's it about?

76
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
In private.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,670
Can we talk about it later?

78
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,980
No!It's important!

79
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,030
Yeah,I will talk to you later tonight,okay?

80
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,200
Now I have to go to work.

81
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,250
Sorry.I didn't get much sleep.

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,580
Sammy?

83
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,910
Look,cal will be okay.

84
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:22,980
He'll come home.

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,310
You know?He'll turn up.

86
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,020
You know he will.He's a malloy.

87
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,140
I will get you sooner or later.

88
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,260
I know where you live.

89
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,610
Do you,wayne?

90
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm giving you a lift?

91
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,860
No.

92
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm not going in today.

93
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,110
He's got me running all over town,you know.

94
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
- doing stuff.
- Yeah?

95
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,270
- Doing what?
- Just stuff.

96
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,650
You know.

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,830
Don't worry about it.

98
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,860
Okay.

99
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,680
God damn it,cal.

100
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,440
He's not gonna answer,mom.

101
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,960
How do you know?

102
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,760
'Cause he's gone.

103
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,530
He's on the road.

104
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,810
He tell you that?

105
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,240
In so many words,yeah.

106
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,110
Well,then he's okay.

107
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,160
He's fine.

108
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,310
You know,it's like dad said -- he's a malloy.

109
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,370
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

110
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,220
Huh?

111
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,830
I was going out of my mind all night long,

112
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,820
and you didn't think to tell me?

113
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,030
He couldn't take it anymore,mom!

114
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,300
You pushed him away.

115
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,960
I did not push him away.

116
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,810
Yes,you did,mom!

117
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,340
He didn't want to come back,and you knew it!

118
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,470
That big plan -- he didn't sign up for that.

119
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,190
No.

120
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,400
You're okay,though,right?

121
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,240
I'm not cal.

122
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,240
No.

123
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,880
Keep this clean,be straight with me,

124
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,920
and we'll have no problems.

125
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,470
So.

126
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,910
you got a place?

127
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,160
Yeah.

128
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,430
And a job?

129
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,490
Yeah.

130
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,550
Shit!

131
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,700
Expecting someone?

132
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,820
My son.

133
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,490
He's gone.

134
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,290
Well,his father has him.Had him.

135
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,600
But he's taken off and.

136
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,120
ju-- he gonna show up.

137
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,480
I have to,uh,register.

138
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,250
if you're driving.

139
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,670
License and all?

140
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,140
I'm not driving.

141
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,880
I'm taking the bus.

142
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,060
I just keep the key to my first car.

143
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,780
You know,my daddy gave it to me.

144
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,800
He stole it out of a church parking lot.

145
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,660
You know,I should get going.

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,960
Are we done here?

147
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,480
For now.

148
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,000
Shit.

149
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,280
Where are they?

150
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,440
What -- what -- tell him to call me back.

151
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,220
Tell him to call me back!

152
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,110
God damn it.

153
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,390
Morning,hugh.

154
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,660
Trouble with the phone?

155
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,840
We got a minor problem,doug.

156
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,280
- Major minor problem.
- Yeah,minkov.

157
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,460
Ah,minkov's in the bag.

158
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,730
We need zoning variances for 
bayou hills or we're screwed.

159
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,450
Well,let's get zoning variances,then.

160
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,790
They fired graham.

161
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,910
Great.Who's graham?

162
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,360
Graham's the guy at city hall 
took care of all this crap for me.

163
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,510
Went and got himself mixed up 
in a goddamn mayoral scandal.

164
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,080
And now this -- this new guy.

165
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,220
You got -- oh.

166
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,060
Yeah,it's all there.

167
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,050
This new guy's got a bug up his 
ass about doing things by the book.

168
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,070
This is louisiana,doug.

169
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,580
We don't do things by the book!

170
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,720
- Hugh
- I mean,there is no goddamn book!

171
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,470
Look at this junk.

172
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,510
Have you tried talking to him?

173
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,530
Junk.All junk.

174
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,270
I don't want any of this shit.

175
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,000
He won't return my calls.

176
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,740
Well,then you go down city 
hall and you talk to him.

177
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,870
Doug,it's eerie.

178
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,860
Sometimes you seem to know 
what I'm thinking with--

179
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,930
without me even having a thought in my head.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,060
Come on,come on.

181
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,360
We are going down to city hall right now.

182
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,360
Whoa -- we?

183
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,930
People trust you,doug.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,560
And I know how to make things happen.

185
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,100
Good cop,bad cop.

186
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I got to take a piss.

187
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,460
Anything else we need to talk about?

188
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,260
Yes.

189
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,280
Yeah.

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,040
Quick.

191
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,920
- No.
- Okay.

192
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,110
Uh,piss.

193
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,120
Jesus.

194
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,290
Jesus H.Christ!

195
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,980
Why would you do that?

196
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,620
Why would you do that?

197
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,480
Don't kick it!

198
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,440
I spent three hours trying to get 
this thing together this morning.

199
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,380
Now I got to start from scratch.

200
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,680
I have got a lot on my mind,you know?

201
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,020
Domestic strife?

202
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,550
Is your son still living in the backyard?

203
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,230
Jesus.

204
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080

I have been very concernedabout pete myself.

223
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,380
Well,he was at your house 
acouple of days ago,wasn't he?

224
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,470
The gps on his rental.

225
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,700
Yes.

226
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,600
This is exactly my point.

227
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,380
Dropping by to mull overold times.

228
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,960
You know,a surprise visit.

229
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,900
You know how he likes to pullsurprise visits.

230
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,970
I don'T.

231
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,110
Do you rememberwhat he talked about?

232
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,550
Well,we talked about the same 
stories we'vealways talked about.

233
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,380
Did he say where he 
was goingafter he saw you?

234
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,660
going home.

235
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,020
Did he mentionseeing a,uh -- 

236
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,340
seeing a therapist?

237
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,080
No.

238
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,410
He -- he seemedin very good spirits.

239
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,960
Is that a fact?

240
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,220
Well,less a fact,chet,than an impression.

241
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,770
Thank you for your time.

242
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,670
Thank you.

243
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,440
Hey!

244
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,000
Follow me,follow me.

245
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,460
Do you know who that guy was?

246
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,580
Have you seen him before?

247
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,180
He's a P.I.He's looking for pete.

248
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,330
You didn't say anything,did you?

249
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,950
Yeah,I told him you smashed
pete's skull in with a hammer

250
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,510
and that he's buried underthis old lady.

251
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm gonna overlook that remark
for the sake of our partnership.

252
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,260
Do you want me to do anything?

253
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,580
I could follow him.

254
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,640
No,no.

255
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,400
No,just wait and seewhat he does.

256
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,650
All right.

257
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,540
Doug!

258
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,270
Are you ready?

259
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah,ready as I'll ever be.

260
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,510
Let's go.

261
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,990
Hi.

262
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,950
Uh,eden falls security.

263
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,860
Yeah.

264
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,810
Something triggeredthe alarm up at the guardhouse,

265
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,720
like someone tried to opena 
window from the outside

266
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,100
or the alarm wasn'tdeactivated properly.

267
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,230
I should check it out.

268
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,520
Be my guest.

269
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,290
Well -- well,once the ****activated,
it needs the override,so.

270
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,710
- the override?
- Yep.There you go.

271
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,290
Come on.You could havejust told me that.

272
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,520
Or called.

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,190
Y-yeah.

274
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,370

276
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,310
Oh,you want to make sureI was okay?

277
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,470
Yeah,you know,like,unharmed or.

278
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,050

279
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,420

That's my job,ma'am.

283
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,870
Okay,okay.I...

284
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,980
I wanted to see you.

285
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,090
Oh,you want to see me?

286
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,530
Oh,no,no.I didn't -- 

287
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,490
Come on,man.

288
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,140
Lighten up a little bit.

289
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,840
If I were you,I'd want to seewhat 
was going on in all these houses,too.

290
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,680
You ever do that --just go in?

291
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,480
You know,check them out?

292
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,920
My boss would have my ass.

293
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,980
Yeah?

294
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,320
Well,you got the keys.

295
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,040
N-n-n-n-no,no.No?Okay.

296
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,010
Oh,come on.

297
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,400
Holy shit.

298
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,640
Why am I whispering,huh?

299
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,340
Hi,puppy!

300
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,620
Oh,uh,don't -- don't get too close.

301
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,350
It's fine.He just wants a littleattention,huh?

302
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,170
- There you go.
- What --what are you doing?

303
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,320
Oh,relax.

304
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,040
He justwants a little attention.

305
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,940
Does thevariance approval process ever 
move more rapidly,commissioner gillard?

306
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,760
An applicationfor expedited processing 
can be filedwith the mayor's office.

307
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,180
It'll takeat least three months.

308
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,240
Oh,no,no.

309
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,410
Used to take 24 hours.

310
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,300
Yes,well,I'm sure business will be 
conducted differentlyunder the new mayor.

311
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,890
"New mayor"?Meaning?

312
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,540
I don't know,mr.Rich.

313
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,080
You'll have to ask him.

314
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,650
or her.

315
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,640
Her?

316
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,860
Carol phipps.

317
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,550
So farshe's the only candidate.

318
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,440
Are you kidding me?

319
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,770
You can collect the paperwork for 
an expeditedprocessing request

320
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,200
at my office between 11:45 and 3:15.

321
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,980
Good day,gentlemen.

322
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,800
Good day,you prissy son of a bitch.

323
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,800
Who's carol phipps?

324
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,840
Radical.

325
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,830
Radical environmentalist.

326
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,670
Dangerous.

327
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,070
Dangerous ecoterrorist.

328
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,060
Ran a "save the swamp flea"
campaign up lafayette.

329
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,820
Shut down a marina projectI had going in.

330
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,170
Now she's gonna come afterbayou hills.

331
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,320
We could do somethingabout that.

332
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,930
Yeah,what's that?

333
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,760
You're gonna run for mayor.

334
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,860
I don't have timefor that shit.

335
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,880
Oh,no,don't -- oh,my god.

336
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,120
Oh,ma-- Oh,my god.

337
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,470
He shat.

338
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,300
Oh,why did you do that?

339
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,670
- That's great.
- No.That is not great.

340
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,040
Oh,come on.Here,we have toclean it up.

341
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,880
Oh,no.You're on your own,dude.

342
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,780
Dog shit'snot my department.

343
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,740
If you were mayor,everything would be 
a hellof a lot easier to get done.

344
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,690
Think ofthe possibilities.

345
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,430
Those zoning variances --
they're gone,goodbye,adios.

346
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,310
And spend my time hanging 
outwith a bunch of politicians?

347
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,080
No way,doug.

348
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,650
They're liars and crooks.

349
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,430
What about the mojo?

350
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,820
Doug rich,you'recrazier than a shithouse rat.

351
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,800
$150-million crazy.

352
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,630
- Put this here?
- Sure

353
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,650
Can I get winners?

354
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,440
All right.

355
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,290
You're next.

356
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,070
Didn't think that was gonna drop.

357
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,010
You want a chanceto win your money back?

358
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,240
Kind of sexy,dawg.

359
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,520
She smells good,too.

360
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,410
nice technique.

361
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,330
These thingswill kill you.

362
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,920
Might as well be free.

363
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,170
Lips are sealed.

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,880

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,230

I won't be home for a while.

393
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,450
But it's past 11:00.

394
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,450
I'm double-bagging!

395
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,240
Oh,oh,you're double-bagging.

396
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,020
Double-bagging is whenyou have to 
go to more thanone meeting a day

397
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,880
because your lifeis so goddamn stressful.

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,440
Oh,"clients"?Is that what you call us?

405
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,860

But I'm beat.

I'm going home.

410
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,500
Your place is downtown,right?

411
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,760
Yeah.

412
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,630
So,how you getting home?

413
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,280

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,440
I take the bus.

415
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
Which route?

416
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,540

417
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,040

Curious as to howyou know my name.

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,680
Word's outyou're on the road.

425
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,830
Used to work withone of your cousins -- 
kind of recognized you.

426
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,020
So where you headed,cal?

427
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,620
Eh,just hitting the road.

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,780
Ride with us?

429
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,750
That's nice of you.

430
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,860
I think I'm gonna go solofor a while,though.

431
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,180

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,020
Hi,rosaleen.

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,150
Okay,uh,this is it.

438
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,890
there's the bathroom.

439
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,790
And where we're standing is the living room,

440
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,050
the kitchen,and the bedroom.

441
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,860
I'm just gonna goto the bathroom.

442
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,250
Dahlia,where are you?

443
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,370
For god's sake,would you stop calling me?

444
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,350
Why are you whispering?

445
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,270
I'm in a meeting!

446
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,860
What,you're still in a meeting?

447
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,810
I mean,it's midnight.

448
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,380
What,are youtriple-bagging now?

449
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,760

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,420
I'll get home soon.

451
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,080
You don't trust me,huh?

452
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,600
You don'T.

453
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,330
You don't trust me.

454
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,490
You know what?

455
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,390
I'm working my ass offto 
get my shit together,wayne!

456
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,800
And I will get homewhen I goddamn get home!

457
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,240
You lose something?

458
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,550
Part of my job.

459
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,940
Is there any part of my life
that ain't part of your job?

460
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,530
As a matter of fact.

461
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,830
No.

462
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,020
Oh,well,let's have a real 
goodlook,then,shall we?

463
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,010
Let's seewhat we got here.

464
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,620
Oh!Oh,look --frying pan.

Silverware.

468
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,620
Oh,my gosh.

469
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,310
What will we find next?

470
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,480
Maybe what you'rereally interested in 
is the kind of sheetsI got on my bed.

471
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,870
I'm sorry.I just got bad news.

472
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,400
Your son?

473
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,360
Yeah.

474
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,290
He didn't come home.

475
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,030
Sorry.

476
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,190
It's my assholehusband's fault.

477
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,230
For every minuteyou stay angry.

478
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,740
you give up 60 secondsof peace of mind.

479
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,650
Is that right?

480
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,630
You make that up?

481
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,270
No.Read it somewhere.

482
00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,440
But I think about it whenever my headtakes 
my heart to a placeI don't want to be.

483
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,140
I,uh.

484
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,260
I got to go.

485
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,360
Yeah.

486
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,910
Well.

488
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,130
Cal,it's dad.

489
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,360
Look,I know you're workingsome things out,

490
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,010
and maybe it's just nota good time to be at home.

491
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,700
But just if.

492
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,040
look,call your mom,okay?

493
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,460
'Cause she's really worried.

I love you,cal.

495
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,670
Oh,go home.

496

Jesus christ!

497
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,040
Sammy.

498
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,390
What's the matter?

499
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,570
Where's mom?

500
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,810
She's,uh --she's working late.

501
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,640
I saw someone outside.

502
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,880
What were they doing?

503
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,390
He was sneaking aroundand 
looking through the trash.

504
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,240
He took the trash,dad --all of it.

505
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,230
All of it?

506
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,540
It's not a joke.

507
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,440
I'll call security,okay?

508
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,480
Dad?

509
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,660
I found some bloodthe other day.

510
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,910
On the carpet.

511
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,050
I cleaned it up.

512
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,190
I used a towelto clean up the blood,
and I put the towelin the trash.

513
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,840
You think that guytook it?

514
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,590
You've been watchingtoo much "csi," haven't you?

515
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,760
Hey.

516
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,090
Don't worry.

517
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,180
I tell you what -- 
you go backto bed,I'll be right in.

518
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,700
Okay?I'll just call these people.

519
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,660
What?

520
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,970
It's me.

521
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,440
We got a problem.

522
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,130
I know.

523
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,530
He's still at the motel.

524
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,670
Jesus,sammy!

525
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,800
You still up?

526
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,120
What were you looking for?

527
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,210
Nothing.

528
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,350
Well,a-a towel,you know?

529
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,890
To dry something up with.

530
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,150
Sammy,you don't rememberwhich kind of 
towel you used the other night,do you?

531
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,680
To clean up the blood?

532
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,640
Yeah.

533
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,990
We could steal it.

534
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,200
No,then he'd know it's gone.

535
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,590
Then we'll never get rid of him.

536
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,630
Oh,I'll get rid of him.

537
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,710
Just doexactly what I say.

538
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,440
Oh,shit!

539
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,440
Hey.

540
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,260
What's up,sweetie?

541
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,390
If you touch me,I'm gonna kill you.

542
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,950
Yeah,we'll see about that,bitch!

543
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,740
Look,I'll ask youreal nicely -- oh!

544
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,350

He was drunk.

635
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,280

637
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,790
So.

639
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,960
I might jump out,then.

645
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,810
What's the plan,wayne?

646
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,790
I am under as much pressureas you are here.

647
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,640
I know you haveall the answers,

648
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,300
but there's a big difference
between the towel in that room

649
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,670
and the towelthat you're holding.

650
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,230
There's no blood,wayne.

651
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,850
Dad!

652
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,760
Oh,shit!

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,350
What are you doing?

657
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,690
Are we in trouble,dad?

658
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,080
There's a manin that motel room who could 
make thingsreally difficult for us.

659
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,280
He's looking for pete?

660
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,860
And he's convinced himself
that we know where he is.

661
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,760
He could kill the dream,sammy.

662
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,620
Why are you workingwith dale,dad?

663
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,510
I thought he was the enemy.

664
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,140
Well.

665
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,070

666
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,770
Life is complicated,sam.

00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,480

668
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,270
