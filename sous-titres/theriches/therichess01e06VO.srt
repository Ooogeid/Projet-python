1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:01,700
You know,
my buddies up in new york,

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,778
they still don't think
you people exist.

3
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:05,924
We're gonna have
ourselves a wedding...

4
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,343
Our boy and your girl.

5
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:12,131
I am the new boss.
He is the old boss.

6
00:00:12,938 --> 00:00:14,072
Get over it.

7
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,355
So where are we gonna go?

8
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:19,104
Life's a river, kid.

9
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:21,277
You gotta go
where it takes you.

10
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:24,814
Come on!

11
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:27,041
You're in the wrong lane!

12
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:28,285
Mick, look out!

13
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:29,447
Shit!

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,164
Oh, my god!

15
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:33,534
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:38,931
The american dream...

17
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:40,817
We're gonna steal it.

18
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:43,099
Dougy was lookin' for work...

19
00:00:43,236 --> 00:00:44,896
As a lawyer.

20
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:46,959
Ever done in-house?

21
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:49,095
- Hi. Doug Rich.
- Panco team,

22
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:51,554
meet your new legal chief.

23
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:53,973
- Dahlia, what are you doing here?
- I brought you lunch.

24
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:56,817
Isn't that what every good little
housewife's supposed to do?

25
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:59,607
I'm guessin' you're good
at a lot of things.

26
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,879
You know, I could use
someone like that around here.

27
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:03,135
I bet you could.

28
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,186
Been there, done that.

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,771
So how do I find you?

30
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:16,288
I'll pick you up.

31
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,586
8:00 tonight.

32
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:21,309
My being here means
you're a dead man, Wayne Malloy.

33
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:24,100
I think Dale would be mighty
interested in your address.

34
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:27,343
What do you want,
ginny dannegan?

35
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:30,307
Well, look who it is.

36
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:31,868
Hi, everybody.

37
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:33,833
- Who is that?
- This would be ken.

38
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:35,815
Di's fiance.

39
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:36,949
What?!

40
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:43,119
<i>The african lion,
the second-largest of</i>

41
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:48,633
<i>felines after the tiger,
homes in on its prey.</i>

42
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:50,594
<i>It chooses primarily...</i>

43
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:51,878
What is he doing?

44
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,736
Oh, he's watching
an animal show with sam.

45
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,975
You see, apparently,
retards really like animals.

46
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,688
He's not a retard.

47
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,659
- He's just kind of slow.
- You know what, Cal?

48
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,863
This is your fault that
he's here in the first place.

49
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:04,625
I'm not the one who
signed off on your bride price.

50
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,103
"I hereby offer my daughter, Delilah,

51
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:15,338
in marriage to kenneth dannegan
in exchange for a bride price

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,916
- of zero dollars."
- You're on clearance.

53
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,400
Shut up, Cal.
This is not a joke.

54
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:22,165
- They could really hold us to this.
- Ginny didn't give me choice.

55
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,383
You had a choice.
You could've told 'em to go to hell.

56
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,151
No, sweetheart.
Then ginny would rat us out

57
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:27,849
and Dale would find us.
We had no choice.

58
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:30,520
I will figure this out.
Just give me a couple of days.

59
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:33,682
You can watch now.
That zebra's down for the count.

60
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,072
It ain't the lion's fault.

61
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,422
He just needs to kill.

62
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,308
Why does he have to stay with us?

63
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,295
Well, 'cause, you know,
the fiance always stays

64
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:46,184
with the in-laws in
the run-up to the wedding.

65
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:48,035
- It's tradition.
- I'm not gonna marry him.

66
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,753
It's tradition.
That's all I'm saying.

67
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,102
It goes all the way back to
the middle ages in ireland.

68
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:53,802
It's your heritage.

69
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:56,159
You should never have signed
that bride price, Wayne.

70
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:57,634
You shoulda just killed ginny.

71
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,242
Look, if you just let me get
through the arbitration tomorrow,

72
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:02,524
- I will deal with this.
- Arbo what?

73
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,094
It's a legal term, ken.

74
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,482
I better learn it up if
I'm gonna apprentice with you.

75
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,393
Oh, the son-in-law always
apprentices with the father.

76
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:13,910
- It's tradition.
- I can blacktop real good.

77
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:18,508
Look, ken,
this is a major corporation.

78
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,542
These are educated people.
They have law degrees,

79
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:23,847
they got mbas.

80
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,173
An mba is a master's degree
in business administration.

81
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,854
You following me?

82
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,216
A degree is a level of...

83
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:35,774
Just forget it, all right?

84
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:37,729
I guess I could tarpaper the roof.

85
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,908
No, ken, you nitwit.

86
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,573
This is
a multimillion-dollar lawsuit.

87
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,973
Nobody is tarpapering anything.

88
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,388
Are you clear? You're not
coming to work with me tomorrow.

89
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,724
That's not what ginny said.
She said

90
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,072
if she gets mad,
she was gonna tell the cops

91
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,634
about mrs. Malloy
violatin' her parole.

92
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,604
The word's "arbitration," ken.

93
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,803
"arbitration."

94
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:07,347
It means
a polite argument.

95
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,792
You sure are pretty, Delilah.

96
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:12,881
Ken, he's gonna eat a warthog.

97
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,259
Oh, cool.

Season 1 - Episode 06
<i>Reckless Gardening </i>

104
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,494
We can't let this thing go to trial.

105
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:52,370
This woman had her arm eaten
by an alligator in her backyard.

106
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,173
If she waves her stump at a jury,
she'll get 10 million bucks.

107
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:57,605
What's the look?

108
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:59,320
I'm going to Panco tomorrow,
I told you.

109
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,280
Oh, jesus, Dahlia, not tomorrow.

110
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,640
I got enough problems trying
to get in there with ken.

111
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:11,882
No, I just mean,
I really want to try and handle this.

112
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,426
Settle it.

113
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,026
You know, arbitrate like a real lawyer.

114
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:18,166
I'm actually kind of good at this...

115
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:21,370
Negotiating, working the numbers,
working the angles.

116
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,860
But I can help you.

117
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,670
I got Aubrey for that.

118
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:28,730
I mean she's a paralegal.

119
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,798
- She's got a legal education.
- I know what paralegal means!

120
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,751
Except, I didn't go
to school, Wayne.

121
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:39,364
I don't have a law
degree or an MBA.

122
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,153
Did you hear yourself before,
by the way?

123
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:44,327
What am I supposed
to do while you are so busy

124
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,726
working the numbers
and the angles?

125
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:49,145
Sit at home and clip coupons?

126
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,399
You know, as it turns out,

127
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:57,499
I do not know what
a paralegal is, Wayne.

128
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,989
And I don't care!

129
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:00,356
Screw you!

130
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,270
You are turning into
such an asshole, Wayne.

131
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,741
Like you never been
in a street fight or two?

132
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,434
You got traveler blood in you.

133
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:10,902
You can't just walk away from that.

134
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,795
You can't just wake up in the morning
and pretend to be somebody else,

135
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:16,204
like all your traditions
don't matter to you no more.

136
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,066
You are spittin' in
the face of our people,

137
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:19,408
and there will be
consequences.

138
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,344
That is superstious bullshit.

139
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:23,367
Oh, no, baby, it's real.

140
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:27,583
'cause let me tell you,
sooner or later,

141
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:30,207
someone's gonna figure out
who we are.

142
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:31,926
And when this ride ends,

143
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:33,823
it's gonna crash
and burn so hard,

144
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,466
it'll destroy us.

145
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,600
So you wanna go for a ride?

146
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:42,672
But I'm goin' with you.

147
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:47,213
'cause if it ends, ain't none of us
ever gonna see each other again.

148
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:58,312
I have somethin' for you.

149
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,496
Holy shit.

150
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,654
Read the inscription.

151
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:14,559
"to esther, love, frank."

152
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:17,613
Ginny and I stole it off
an old lady in jacksonville.

153
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:19,099
Ginny dressed up like a nurse

154
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,968
and pretended to
take her blood pressure.

155
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,227
Meantime, I snuck into her bedroom

156
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:25,181
and picked her clean.

157
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,577
Money, jewelry...

158
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:29,982
I even stole her false teeth.

159
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,071
That's really touching, ken.

160
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:35,832
I'd do anything for you,
Delilah.

161
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:39,207
Thank you, ken.

162
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,569
If anybody was ever gonna hurt you...

163
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:44,539
I'd kill them.

164
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:46,275
Thanks, ken.

165
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,186
Ken, I really have a lot
of homework to do.

166
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,439
Remember the night
at ginny's weddin'?

167
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:53,065
We were all dancin'.

168
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:57,060
You were in a nightgown,
dancin' by the fire.

169
00:07:57,429 --> 00:07:59,862
The light just lit up your hair.

170
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:05,260
You must've been almost
nine, ten years old.

171
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:09,590
That was the night
I fell in love with you.

172
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:12,808
Yeah, ken...

173
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:16,633
Around here,
we call that pedophilia.

174
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:21,102
You have such a big vocabulary.

175
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:24,485
Good night, ken.

176
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:25,858
Sweet dreams.

177
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,577
You been talkin' to my daddy?

178
00:08:34,677 --> 00:08:37,217
- He don't talk.
- He's been gettin' better,

179
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,608
and you know it.

180
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,014
I heard he's been askin' for you.

181
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,802
I heard ken and didi are engaged.

182
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,597
Is that true?

183
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,542
How did he find her?

184
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:56,246
- Who says he did?
- I heard

185
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:59,613
that daddy wants him
to lead the family

186
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,216
until he can bring Wayne back.

187
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,635
Why would I care about that?

188
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:05,247
'cause until Wayne comes back,

189
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:09,034
you'd have all the power,
and it should be mine.

190
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:17,509
Did you ever really think
your daddy was gonna pick you?

191
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,681
You know what
he thinks you are?

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,731
A sociopath.

193
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:24,767
You ever hear that word?

194
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:28,224
I heard it on
a john Wayne gacy special.

195
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:31,450
Means you got no conscience.

196
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:35,643
It means there's something
wrong with your soul.

197
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,822
Now, earl feels real bad about it,

198
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:40,544
blames himself.

199
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:43,058
But it ain't his fault.
As far as I can remember,

200
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:45,322
you always been evil.

201
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:49,108
You used to rip the legs off
frogs when you was a kid,

202
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:51,418
and then you'd burn 'em.

203
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,558
Go ahead, Dale.

204
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,390
Slit my throat.

205
00:09:57,538 --> 00:10:00,405
Wouldn't that be just like a sociopath?

206
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,585
Ken, once again,

207
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,343
you're my nephew,

208
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:32,031
my name is Doug,
Dahlia's name is Cherien,

209
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:34,099
what you are is an intern...

210
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,836
I thought an intern
was like a doctor,

211
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:37,391
except real good-lookin' and on tv.

212
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:39,391
Don't say anything, honey. Okay?

213
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,455
You just keep nice and quiet.

214
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,038
School bus is here.

215
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:49,732
So I should call you uncle dan.

216
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,247
Just keep it zipped,
for christ's sake.

217
00:10:52,356 --> 00:10:54,802
Say nothing.
Nada.silence.

218
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:05,527
- God damn it.
- Such bullshit.

219
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:47,811
So, you're Doug's nephew
from Jacksonville?

220
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:53,766
Look, I went over
the underwood files

221
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:56,161
last night, and I want to talk
numbers with you 'cause

222
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:58,967
- I think you got a problem...
- Good, great, yes. Cherien.

223
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:03,014
You look like a million bucks.

224
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:05,037
Welcome to team Hugh.

225
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:06,404
Let me show you the ropes.

226
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,902
Hugh, we gotta settle this
before it goes to trial, right?

227
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:11,203
It's import...

228
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:18,656
Ken, get up.

229
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,396
I want you to staple
some things together.

230
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:22,673
Sure thing, mr. Malloy...

231
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:24,395
Dan. Shit.

232
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,602
Wanna know a secret?

233
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:29,570
I never had
a personal assistant before.

234
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,085
My shrink said I should get one.

235
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,292
She said I can't
take care of myself.

236
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:39,011
- You want me to take care of you?
- Well, my secretary couldn't.

237
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:40,748
That's why I fired her ass.

238
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:42,595
Anyway,

239
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:45,957
that's why
you came here, isn't it?

240
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:56,153
Or did you come here so
I could squeeze your tits again?

241
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:00,779
- I want the 40 grand plus benefits.
- Bullshit, Cherien.

242
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,317
Your husband pulls down 200k a year.
You don't need money.

243
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:06,400
I think you want to blow me.

244
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:13,967
You're right. I do.

245
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:15,977
I wanna blow you so bad.

246
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,218
Come on, drop your pants.

247
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:22,954
Come on, drop your pants.
Don't be shy.

248
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:24,538
'cause I wanna take
a picture of your

249
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,536
little ding-dong for
my sexual harassment suit.

250
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:28,990
That way, I'm never
gonna have to work again.

251
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,361
Jesus, you're a bitch.

252
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,655
You wanna tell me
about that job now?

253
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,673
Pick up my dry cleaning,
fill out my insurance forms,

254
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:39,343
and find out how
the hell ducaine med

255
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,610
gets off chargin' $1,500
for a damn colonoscopy.

256
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,077
Well, I don't wanna
do any of that, either.

257
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:46,357
All right.

258
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:49,122
What do you wanna do, Cherien?

259
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:53,086
I wanna "feng shooey" your office.

260
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:56,995
No wonder you're such a miserable
bastard, man. You got no flow.

261
00:13:57,352 --> 00:14:01,138
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your chi is all out of whack.

262
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:04,056
I bet you got insomnia,
nightmares, too.

263
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,504
How do you, uh...

264
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,047
How do you know
about this feng shul?

265
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,130
Had some time on my hands
the past couple of years.

266
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:15,449
I read a lot of Oprah magazines.

267
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,088
All right.

268
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:24,421
You break anything,
I'll wring your goddamn neck.

269
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:56,798
Hugh, I gotta talk to you
about Underwood.

270
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,396
They're gonna be here
in 10 minutes.

271
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,793
Yeah. Make her go away.

272
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,124
I think we should offer two million,
take it or leave it.

273
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,662
What the hell
are you talking about?

274
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:05,585
That's 1 million less than
the old lady got from McDonald's

275
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,033
when she was scalded
by the coffee.

276
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:09,260
And two million more
than I'm gonna pay.

277
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,725
This woman was gardening
in her backyard.

278
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:17,444
An alligator grabbed her arm,
dragged her into a reservoir.

279
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:19,951
- She barely got out with her life.
- So?

280
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,092
God !

281
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,638
I didn't create alligators.

282
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:26,854
I'm not God.

283
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:29,885
No, but you got eight fish
and wildlife citations

284
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,400
warning you not to build
on an alligator habitat.

285
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,097
So maybe she should've thought of that,
before she went outside

286
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,865
and started all
that reckless gardenin'.

287
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:39,202
Some people are morons, Doug.

288
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,654
Don't ever underestimate that.

289
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:46,944
Hartley Underwood is a conniving slut
who got exactly what she deserves.

290
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,690
Well, that's a very
good point, Hugh,

291
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:51,122
but I really don't think a jury
is gonna see it that way.

292
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:52,804
I know, so
tank the bitch.

293
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:54,505
She got her arm ripped off.

294
00:15:54,573 --> 00:15:56,049
How much more tanked
do want her?

295
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,315
What do you want me to do,
rip the other arm off?

296
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:00,037
That's exactly what Stewart said,

297
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:01,882
and Stewart is
collecting unemployment.

298
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,932
I am not giving her
one thin dime.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,645
And if you can't make her go away,
you can kiss your job goodbye.

300
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:11,448
Kimmy !
Latte ! Now !

301
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:26,178
So we got no dirt
on Hartley Underwood?

302
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,952
No, we did a complete background check.
Not even a speeding ticket.

303
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,253
But if there was dirt on her,

304
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:31,533
she could've changed her name.

305
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:32,871
Get down to city hall,

306
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:36,532
get her marriage license, check for
a maiden name, aliases, anything.

307
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,912
There's got to be something.

308
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:41,208
Easy.

309
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:53,225
Let me just start
by saying how truly,

310
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:55,295
deeply, profoundly

311
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:58,544
sorry we are,
for this...

312
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:01,159
really terrible,
unforeseen,

313
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:02,573
- devastating...
- Doug.

314
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,431
I don't have time
to shovel bullshit.

315
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,123
Absolutely.
Neither do I.

316
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:09,226
In fact, I am keenly
aware that time

317
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:12,870
is the only thing that
separates us from...

318
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:14,693
the wilderness.

319
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:16,890
I mean, hell, Ann,
we are the wilderness.

320
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:18,300
You know, when you think about it,

321
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,146
because man vs nature,

322
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:23,139
that really is a false dichotomy.

323
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:25,504
Oh, dichotomy, my ass.
I nearly died.

324
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,103
Look at my hospital file.

325
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:30,068
Jesus, God.

326
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:33,559
Now, I don't think any of us
wants this to come to trial, do we?

327
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:38,848
So, really, it's just a question of the
amount of money we're gonna settle on.

328
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,171
I'm sure you got a figure in mind.

329
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,905
Well, Ann, you can't put
a price on suffering.

330
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:47,475
But you can try.

331
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:52,304
Let's just each of us write down a
number on a piece of paper and compare.

332
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:56,035
I think you'll find that our numbers
are very close together.

333
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,976
Size or distance?

334
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,662
What the hell is this?

335
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:09,835
That'd be a zero, Ann.

336
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,253
What possible justification
can you have

337
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,768
for offering my client nothing?

338
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:20,025
I stapled my pants.

339
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,781
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

340
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:30,095
Would you get
the hell out of here?

341
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,407
But I wanna apprentice.

342
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:33,170
Go to my house.

343
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,974
Apprentice there.

344
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,423
M. Rich...

345
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:40,339
She changed her name

346
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,143
from Mary Louise Blodgett.

347
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:45,320
The old Mary Louise
got busted shoplifting :

348
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,435
1993, $2,000 worth of items,
mostly clothing.

349
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,395
You see how brilliant you are?

350
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:00,607
Socio what?

351
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,808
It means a person
who ain't got a conscience.

352
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:05,079
I...

353
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:07,129
didn't mean...

354
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:09,289
It's okay, honey.

355
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:11,529
Don't you tire yourself out.

356
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,470
Maybe you was one of them,

357
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:15,643
socio things.

358
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,201
You were tough.

359
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:20,276
Even when you were
a baby, I swear,

360
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:24,006
you once bit me
so hard on the arm,

361
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:25,810
the tears came.

362
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:28,871
You had such sharp teeth.

363
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:32,699
That's what your daddy was trying
to say to you, ain't it, hon?

364
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:34,917
You're a survivor, Dale.

365
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,721
And that's a good thing.

366
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,303
Is that what you think
of me, Daddy?

367
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:45,379
You think
I'm a sociopath?

368
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,016
You can't trust me
to run the family?

369
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:49,657
Can't help...

370
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:53,591
The doctor said for you
not to stress your vocal cords.

371
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:57,882
He was just trying to say
he worries about you, that's all.

372
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:00,177
Daddy,

373
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:01,935
all I wanna know is,

374
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:04,300
is did you talk
to Ginny Dannegan

375
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:06,872
about who's gonna be
the next leader?

376
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,223
All right.
That's enough.

377
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:11,654
He's gonna get overexcited.

378
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:15,548
Now, who told you?

379
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:16,737
So, he did choose Wayne.

380
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:21,241
It was just they've always had
this special connection.

381
00:20:21,415 --> 00:20:23,815
It wasn't personal.

382
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:26,221
Don't take it
the wrong way, baby.

383
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,490
It's a real big burden,

384
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,483
being responsible
for a whole family.

385
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:35,535
Don't feel bad with your daddy
for not picking you.

386
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:41,091
Your special connection
has always been with me.

387
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,435
Oh, shit.

388
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:16,857
Cops are out.

389
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:19,932
It turns out M. Griswold
really was a coke dealer.

390
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:22,453
The cops busted him right
in the college counseling office.

391
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:24,462
Now they're doing a sweep
of the entire school.

392
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,280
Now, how are we gonna
flush the weed, huh?

393
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,456
Delilah.

394
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:33,506
Forgot your lunch.

395
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:37,648
Thanks, Ken.

396
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,318
I've seen you at Delilah's.

397
00:21:41,412 --> 00:21:42,601
I'm Ken.

398
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,108
- I'm Didi's...
- Uncle.

399
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,022
Uncle Ken...

400
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,846
is my uncle.

401
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,987
Right...

402
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:52,983
And Doug is my uncle,

403
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,948
and Doug is her dad...

404
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:59,174
So, we're also brothers.

405
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:02,377
I guess our daddy married our...

406
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:03,881
his half-sister.

407
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:09,978
I'm also her fiance.

408
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,441
Okay. Uncle ken, can I talk
to you for a second?

409
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,628
I think that boy thinks
he is your boyfriend.

410
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:17,097
This is all part
of our cover, ok?

411
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,069
Aren't you supposed to be
with my dad today?

412
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,790
He got a hair 'cross his fanny
cause I messed up his stapler.

413
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:25,172
You know that this is
all some big test, right?

414
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,059
To see what you're made of?

415
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:29,634
- Is that so?
- Absolutely.

416
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:31,797
Well, I can pass
any test he can set.

417
00:22:31,865 --> 00:22:33,546
You should do that.

418
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,539
See you at home, Didi.

419
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:46,884
Your uncle gave you this?

420
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:49,891
He got it from a vending machine
at the halfway house.

421
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:52,985
What?

422
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,934
Shit.

423
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:57,025
Shit !

424
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:01,364
Ken, I realized that...

425
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:03,219
I forgot to...

426
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,763
thank you...

427
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:07,645
for bringing me my lunch.

428
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,326
It was very nice of you.

429
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:12,951
Okay. That's all.

430
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,243
Well, I hope the sandwich
didn't get too smushed.

431
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,714
I think it'll be fine.

432
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:20,899
Well...

433
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:24,016
- See you, Didi.
- Bye.

434
00:23:30,855 --> 00:23:32,345
Not so fast.

435
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:34,928
Let's see that purse,
little lady.

436
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:44,578
I'm short 800 bucks.

437
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,615
In my office, now.

438
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:54,449
I wanna know why
you're really here,

439
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:57,006
and don't give me any of that
cockamie shit about feng shui.

440
00:23:57,057 --> 00:23:58,779
What'd you really
come here for?

441
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:01,155
I wanna screw you.

442
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,232
We should do.

443
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:06,295
- I wanna see your arm.
- No, no, no, no, you don't.

444
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,436
No, you wanna get it on
over there by the moose.

445
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:09,543
- Come on!
- Kimmy,

446
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,975
get me the Ducaine police.
I want to report a robbery.

447
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:13,805
That's all right, Kimmy.
I'll handle it.

448
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,415
What do you want?

449
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:23,367
Pills?

450
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:26,060
Went me to hook you up
with some oxy,

451
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:27,536
a little meth?

452
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,964
Wanna shoot up?

453
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:36,929
Hard to ask, isn't it?

454
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:40,244
Sometimes that's the worst part,

455
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:42,568
how degraded you can get.

456
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,406
I want to know
how you did it,

457
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,524
how you got clean.

458
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,820
Cause you did, didn't you?

459
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,510
Tell me how you stopped using.

460
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,046
Oh, my God.

461
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:03,812
I get it. I get it.

462
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,706
Oh, God. You want...

463
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,713
you wanna quit for Doug,

464
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:12,098
and you want me to help you.

465
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:16,372
Ain't that romantic?

466
00:25:16,454 --> 00:25:18,409
Don't you dare laugh at me !

467
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:19,994
Okay, okay, okay. Jesus.

468
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,468
Was it A.A.?

469
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,942
Get your fingernails out of my balls.

470
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:26,361
You tell me how you got off pills !

471
00:25:26,362 --> 00:25:27,490
I don't know.
I don't know.

472
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:29,169
You're a lying son of a bitch !

473
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:31,878
God is my judge, I do not know.

474
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:35,546
It was the nineties.
My dealer o.d.'d. I just...

475
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,268
I stopped. I don't know.

476
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:47,024
You're the craziest bitch
I ever met.

477
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:50,621
What does that mean
"we've all done things we regret"?

478
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,504
I just mean that everyone
has things in their past

479
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:54,829
that they wish were different.

480
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,459
For Panco, this could be
some of our locations.

481
00:25:58,143 --> 00:26:00,657
For Mary Louise Blodgett,
that could be

482
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:02,563
- felony grand theft.
- What?

483
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:03,805
Oh, you know.

484
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:06,948
One Gucci dress,
one leopard print belt,

485
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:10,386
three bras, five pairs
of ladies' underwear...

486
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:14,987
And $627 worth
of assorted sex toys.

487
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:19,090
Does that ring a bell or
a buzzer, Ms. Blodgett?

488
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:20,232
You asshole.

489
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:23,055
- Give me that.
- No, that would be stealing.

490
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,273
I assume you are aware of
your client's felony conviction in 1993

491
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,022
under the name of
Mary Louise Blodgett.

492
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:30,365
That was 15 years ago.

493
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,834
So my client was a little light-fingered
when she was younger.

494
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:34,982
How is this relevant?

495
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:38,028
Well, just from my experience, it really
affects how the jury sees you,

496
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,258
you know, uh...

497
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:40,762
the peers in the community.

498
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:43,003
I was going
through a really hard time,

499
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,995
and it was my first divorce.

500
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,621
And you must tell that
to the judge.

501
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:48,959
And when we go to the trial,
you gonna wear that suit?

502
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,456
Nice suit. Looks good.

503
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:52,373
Is that a thousand bucks or so?

504
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:53,712
Got the receipt?

505
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,689
Oh, I win a cookie.

506
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,618
You stole that jacket?

507
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:03,298
- Old habits die hard.
- I lost my arm !

508
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:06,359
An alligator dragged me
into a swamp !

509
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:09,257
I am under a great deal of stress.

510
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:12,110
It is terrible when a client violates
your trust, isn't it, Ann?

511
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:13,764
You, goddamn lawyers,
are all alike.

512
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,978
This is a despicable tactic.

513
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,663
- You will not intimidate my client.
- Just make it go away !

514
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:21,319
- I don't care what it takes !
- Now, honey, you don't mean that.

515
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,489
You're getting overemotional.

516
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:24,749
But I must say,
we are prepared to discuss

517
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,130
how to make it go away.

518
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:30,033
We'll be in touch when my client
is feeling a little more rational.

519
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:34,867
- Did I mention my prescription?
- It's all right, Di. It's okay.

520
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,311
Shit !

521
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,464
You are a genius.

522
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:50,294
Who knew the gimp
was a shoplifter?

523
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,434
Well,

524
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:53,423
yeah, don't get excited.

525
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,482
And she'll want something.
She'll be back.

526
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:56,875
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

527
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,576
Well, you do. You said you weren't
gonna give her one thin dime.

528
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:02,134
Oh, what are you, nuts?
I was just shittin' you, pal.

529
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,982
I got a paper trail comin' out
of my ass on this thing.

530
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,265
I knew I was gonna be
out a million easy.

531
00:28:07,374 --> 00:28:10,654
It's just that I got a little cash flow
problem right now.

532
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,538
I thought you were
worth 150 millions?

533
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:14,713
On paper.

534
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:16,463
Real money?

535
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:18,595
Housing market's in the toilet.

536
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:19,911
I'm mortgaged to my eyeballs.

537
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:22,437
I was shittin' a brick
I was gonna have to file Chapter 11.

538
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:25,819
But now I got time
to raise some funds.

539
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,662
Look at me.

540
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:31,563
Look in my eyes.

541
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:36,749
You are the best goddamn
lawyer I ever met.

542
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:41,812
Hey, hey, where the hell you think
you're going, little lady?

543
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:43,999
Oh, this place ain't right
for my employment needs.

544
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,976
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Hold on a minute.

545
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:47,733
Doug, Doug,
if you don't mind,

546
00:28:47,815 --> 00:28:49,277
gonna have
a little tete-a-tete.

547
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,412
Sure.

548
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,372
Who the hell took my gold pen?

549
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:56,213
My grandma gave me that pen
when I graduated high school.

550
00:28:57,214 --> 00:28:58,854
I can help you.
Just so you know,

551
00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:01,000
I'd never dream of menoning

552
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:02,921
that little incident to Doug.

553
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:04,479
It's just between you and me.

554
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,350
See, cause I'm guessing
that, uh... that, uh...

555
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:12,391
Doug don't know you're
still popping pills, does he?

556
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:14,182
You're a real bastard.

557
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:16,315
No wonder
you have nightmares.

558
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,577
See there? You see, nothing
a little raise couldn't cure.

559
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:22,944
Give me a minute.

560
00:29:24,273 --> 00:29:25,844
You have a good meeting?

561
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:28,004
Knocked them down
over a million.

562
00:29:28,485 --> 00:29:30,358
- She cried.
- She did?

563
00:29:30,754 --> 00:29:33,775
Oh, baby.
You're a real good lawyer, huh?

564
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,307
You got her good.

565
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:43,015
Oh, sorry.

566
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,850
Interrupt the romance.

567
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:47,869
A little petty cash.

568
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:48,983
For?

569
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:50,193
Expenses.

570
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,638
Come on. I hear Johnny Walker
calling our name.

571
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:01,983
So...

572
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,623
where shall we go?

573
00:30:03,787 --> 00:30:04,867
Club.

574
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,327
Oh, hi, Dan.

575
00:30:08,628 --> 00:30:09,967
Doug.

576
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:13,082
Hey, I'll come with you.

577
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:15,282
And you might be?

578
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:16,389
Doug.

579
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:20,920
Your name is also Doug.

580
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:24,569
There can be more
than one Doug.

581
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:27,097
Gulf war.

582
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:28,984
He was captured and...

583
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,364
shot.

584
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,833
Can we take separate cars?

585
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:35,459
No problem. I got a...
colonic later anyway.

586
00:30:35,554 --> 00:30:37,003
I'll meet you at the club.

587
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,095
God bless America, Doug.

588
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:51,057
Can I ask you a question,
M. Malloy?

589
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,274
Sure, Ken.

590
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:55,417
Were you a virgin when
you married Mrs. Malloy?

591
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:57,643
Jesus.

592
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,459
Well, I take it
you're still a virgin.

593
00:31:00,582 --> 00:31:02,659
If you don't count
self-pleasuring.

594
00:31:05,016 --> 00:31:07,476
I want to ask your professional
opinion about something.

595
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:09,633
Can we get a body in here?

596
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:11,833
Sure.

597
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:15,939
Look.

598
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,683
You're right.

599
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:23,723
Should I just wait in here?

600
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:37,379
I'm gonna take this one, too.
You were right about it.

601
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,843
Sure do make your titties look nice.

602
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:45,763
I guess I'll have to take all this, too.

603
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:48,731
Would you give me one of them shirts?
I'll take one in every color.

604
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:50,041
Oh, hell, I'll wear that.

605
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:52,457
You want me to put this
on your credit card?

606
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,991
My boss is payin'.

607
00:31:58,923 --> 00:32:00,412
I got me,

608
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,553
one of them expense accounts.

609
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:06,377
I should really change jobs.

610
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:08,981
These people don't give me jack shit.

611
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:13,315
You lost your pills.

612
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,426
You want 'em?

613
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,414
There you go.

614
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:33,960
Official membership form.

615
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:38,288
Once the paperwork clears, you're
a member of edenfalls country club.

616
00:32:39,473 --> 00:32:41,162
Welcome to the world of social

617
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,821
cachet and influence.

618
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:44,821
You're gonna make so many connections,

619
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:47,894
you won't even mind paying 175,000.

620
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:50,586
175,000...

621
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:51,784
dollars?

622
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:54,646
Take a second on the house.
That's what I did.

623
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,297
Welcome to the inside.

624
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,375
Wanna know a secret?
I'm gonna tell you my secret.

625
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:02,533
The secret of my success:

626
00:33:03,489 --> 00:33:05,389
trust no one.

627
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,257
You gonna make it in this world,
you gotta make it alone.

628
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:09,817
I don't have a lot of friends.

629
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,013
You got a lot of friends?

630
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,189
- Not really.
- Yeah, me, neither.

631
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:14,585
I don't have any friends.

632
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,749
I'm a lonely mother.

633
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:19,986
Why do you think that is, Doug?

634
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:23,323
Probably 'cause you're an asshole.

635
00:33:29,836 --> 00:33:32,323
How come you don't have
any friends, Doug?

636
00:33:33,285 --> 00:33:34,317
I...

637
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:35,695
I don't know.

638
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,129
Moved around a lot when I was kid

639
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,695
and never got in the habit.

640
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,405
I feel you.

641
00:33:44,962 --> 00:33:46,158
You trust anyone?

642
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,707
You trust Cherien?

643
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:54,510
Yes, I trust Cherien.

644
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,011
Lucky bastard.

645
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,826
I trusted my ex-wife.

646
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:05,169
The bitch poisoned
my kids' minds against me.

647
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,045
What's your secret, Doug?

648
00:34:07,163 --> 00:34:09,344
How do you keep a marriage
from falling apart?

649
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:18,522
Twelve of us, Doug.

650
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,833
So poor, I swear to god,

651
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:23,050
we only have one light bulb.

652
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,622
You'd had to unscrew it

653
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:26,070
and take it with you

654
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:28,468
when you went in to the next room.

655
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:29,782
Shit.

656
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:32,331
I would lie awake at night,

657
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,428
my whole family asleep
in the bunk beds,

658
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,750
and I'd have a vision of a day

659
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,425
I'd be so rich, I wouldn't ever
have to see any one

660
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,075
of those filthy dickwads again.

661
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:45,586
I never told anybody that.

662
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:48,371
Everybody thinks I grew up rich.

663
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:51,503
My mother left me when I was four

664
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:52,978
after my dad died.

665
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:54,691
Let it out, man.
Let it all out.

666
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:56,802
- I've never told anyone that.
- Let it all out.

667
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:58,608
- Come on.
- I tell everyone she's dead.

668
00:34:58,726 --> 00:35:00,356
She is dead to you.

669
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:02,300
I was brought up by jesuits,

670
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:04,423
and then bandits,

671
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,435
a pack of bandits.

672
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,341
Never think about your mama?

673
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:10,523
- I don't know.
- Maybe she's here.

674
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,133
Maybe she's right here in edenfalls.

675
00:35:13,549 --> 00:35:15,438
- Ever think about that?
- No.

676
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,203
Daddy, Di got arrested.

677
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:42,804
Is this the one you were after?

678
00:35:45,325 --> 00:35:47,437
After the first hour,
I started to see colors,

679
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,061
and then I saw the face of a lion.

680
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:50,621
- I said I was sorry. - Dad, hey.

681
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:54,609
Where have you been?
I've been calling you for hours.

682
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,521
I just think you could
give me back the pen.

683
00:35:58,674 --> 00:35:59,765
I think you owe me that.

684
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:02,991
Just go over there and sit down.

685
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:07,937
Okay, where is she?

686
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:09,990
They locked her in a cell,
and they won't let us see her.

687
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:11,832
See the woman behind the desk?

688
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:16,307
Okay, she took Di's fingerprints.

689
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:19,095
They're gonna give her
a permanent record, okay?

690
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:20,420
Shit.

691
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:22,503
If they run her record
through the database,

692
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:24,980
they're gonna come up with
the real Doug Rich's license.

693
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:26,646
Doug Rich is all over the internet.

694
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,933
You know how much time
you can do for identity theft?

695
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:31,244
- Vehicular manslaughter?
- Okay, Cal.

696
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:32,980
She will not get a permanent record.

697
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:35,308
Parole violation, practicing law
without a license.

698
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,220
I said I will deal with this.

699
00:36:37,337 --> 00:36:39,480
I don't want to go to a foster home.

700
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:42,811
You will not go to foster care,
okay, Sammy? I promise.

701
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:45,533
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you.

702
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,031
I'll never let them take you away.

703
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:50,482
Nobody is gonna split up this family.

704
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:53,673
Are you...

705
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,169
are you drunk?

706
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:56,957
A little bit.

707
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:58,135
Shit, dad.

708
00:36:58,265 --> 00:36:59,825
I'll take care of this.

709
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:04,329
Are you the one that booked
my daughter, ma'am?

710
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,883
Because I'm sure you're familiar

711
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,053
with Malloy

712
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,583
versus the state of Louisiana.

713
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:14,937
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

714
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:18,515
The prohibition of marijuana use...

715
00:37:18,996 --> 00:37:20,896
Hi, what do you want, baby?

716
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:23,447
What?

717
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,787
Are you all right?
Mom's on her way.

718
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:28,417
Excuse me.

719
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:32,065
When you were out there,
did you see my husband?

720
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:35,369
- What'd you do?
- Seven unpaid parking tickets.

721
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:38,014
- Dad.
- God forbid, Richard should have

722
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,425
to interrupt his conference call
to bail his wife

723
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:41,516
out of jail.

724
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,615
- What a colossal dick.
- Dad.

725
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,022
- I didn't know you smoked pot.
- It wasn't mine.

726
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,347
It was Ken...

727
00:37:48,629 --> 00:37:50,901
Some kid hid it on Ken,
and I had to take it from him,

728
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:54,127
because there's no way he could've done
this without blowin' us all to hell.

729
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:56,567
So you threw yourself on the grenade?

730
00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:59,628
Aw, baby girl, I'm so sorry.

731
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,452
I never wanted any of this to happen.

732
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:06,123
I love you so much.

733
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:08,258
I know that, dad.

734
00:38:08,756 --> 00:38:10,855
I love you more than all the world.

735
00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:14,410
All I want is for you to be able

736
00:38:15,008 --> 00:38:17,272
to do anything you want to do.

737
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:19,583
For the love of god, dad,
go find the bathroom

738
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:21,219
and splash some water on your face.

739
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:22,345
Okay, honey.

740
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:25,008
- I love you.
- I know.

741
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:30,570
Richard's never in his life
told our girls he loves them.

742
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:52,877
Right in here, ma'am.

743
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:56,689
He was a tall man.

744
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,067
- Who was?
- My assailant.

745
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:02,293
The fella who stole my purse.

746
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:10,301
He was a tall, thin man.

747
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:11,955
Dark hair,

748
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:13,838
bushy eyebrows...

749
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,679
- Eyebrows.
- Small eyes.

750
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:17,315
- Small...
- Crooked teeth.

751
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:19,162
Okay, hang on, hang on.

752
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,314
Gotta get these in.

753
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,469
You know, you want this to be good?

754
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,464
Was it sunny?

755
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:38,410
Mom!

756
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:40,568
Hey, baby.

757
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,203
So dad's here.
He's fillin' out some paperwork.

758
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:46,918
Shit.

759
00:39:50,117 --> 00:39:51,384
Hello, officer.

760
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:55,161
I can't tell you how
sorry I am about all this.

761
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:56,756
I...

762
00:39:57,372 --> 00:40:00,046
I have the 800 cash

763
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,257
for your clean
and sober program,

764
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:06,699
and there is also a little something
there for your police retirement fund.

765
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:08,986
I'll take you to her.

766
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:11,531
I think she's learned her lesson.

767
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:14,305
And it seemed like
he was kind of retarded.

768
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:18,469
Retarded?
Why didn't you say he was retarded?

769
00:40:20,271 --> 00:40:24,576
It happened outside the station
just 15 minutes ago.

770
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:33,757
The eyes are a bit weird.

771
00:40:35,857 --> 00:40:37,218
You have a go.

772
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,816
I got started.

773
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:44,531
His wife is here.
She posted bail.

774
00:40:44,772 --> 00:40:46,871
Time passes slow in there, don't it?

775
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:50,683
It's like it stands still.

776
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:57,292
My friend Kay,

777
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,388
she used to sing to me
to make the time go.

778
00:41:01,022 --> 00:41:03,262
- You know what she'd sing?
- What?

779
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:27,268
We'd look up,

780
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:29,286
and what do you know?

781
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:31,464
Five minutes'd be gone.

782
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:34,749
That's how you break the day up,

783
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,596
in little pieces like that.

784
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,549
Well, I ain't heard that song
since I was a little girl.

785
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:45,140
Paperwork's done, free as a bird.

786
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,723
Not you.

787
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:49,667
Tell Richard I won't forget this.

788
00:41:50,494 --> 00:41:51,983
It's okay, baby.

789
00:41:54,818 --> 00:41:55,862
Dad!

790
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,489
- Whe were you?
K- Where's ken?

791
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:00,864
He walked home about 15 minutes ago.

792
00:42:03,165 --> 00:42:07,072
You'll be glad to know we feel no need
to put this on her permanent record.

793
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:10,028
You know, with you all being so
willing to enroll her in our program,

794
00:42:10,168 --> 00:42:12,420
there's plenty of hope
for her to be rehabilitated.

795
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,549
Thank you so much.

796
00:42:15,047 --> 00:42:17,675
Mr. Rich seems a little stressed,

797
00:42:18,006 --> 00:42:19,930
if you don't mind my saying.

798
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,147
<i>Support Group
555-4568</i>

799
00:42:24,164 --> 00:42:25,408
Thank you.

800
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:28,358
Baby,

801
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:30,927
you were magnificent in there.

802
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:33,584
Totally smooth, calm.

803
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,331
Above it all,

804
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,756
like a queen.

805
00:42:36,909 --> 00:42:38,164
I can't do this.

806
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,014
I can't do this anymore.

807
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:43,266
I can't do this anymore.

808
00:42:44,368 --> 00:42:46,456
It's okay.

809
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,711
Honey, stop humming.

810
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,845
<i>That was wonderful.

811
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:05,602
<i>Lars Mortensen and the alpine cloggers.

812
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:08,453
<i>You know we certainly can't get enough
of the folk dances here.

813
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:10,411
<i>Next up, the Kriek sisters.

814
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:12,206
<i>Please don't go away.

815
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:13,355
Hey, daddy,

816
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:16,961
the nurse called.
Says she's gonna be a little late.

817
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:20,383
What the hell are you watchin'?

818
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:22,247
Day nurse put this on?

819
00:43:22,951 --> 00:43:23,972
Lame-ass

820
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,883
polka shit.

821
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,055
You must be sick as hell of
ein' cooped up in here all day.

822
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:37,721
You must be dyin' for some fresh air.

823
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:43,728
No. Don't tire yourself out.

824
00:43:44,895 --> 00:43:45,916
I got you.

825
00:43:54,746 --> 00:43:56,059
It's cold tonight.

826
00:43:56,822 --> 00:43:58,663
Look at them stars, daddy.

827
00:43:59,356 --> 00:44:02,229
How come you can see the stars
better when it's cold?

828
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:03,766
When I was a kid, I used to

829
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:05,794
think that stars were made of ice.

830
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,126
Do you rember that?

831
00:44:07,284 --> 00:44:08,422
We'd go camping,

832
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:10,944
and you'd let me
pretend we were indians.

833
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:12,645
You gave us indian names.

834
00:44:12,973 --> 00:44:15,477
You were big elk.
Remember what you used to call me?

835
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,662
That's right.

836
00:44:16,902 --> 00:44:18,192
I was little bear.

837
00:44:30,012 --> 00:44:31,442
We'd set up our tent,

838
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:35,600
and you'd tell me
stories about the ridge runner.

839
00:44:38,436 --> 00:44:40,301
Crazy indian who lost his tribe

840
00:44:40,453 --> 00:44:42,119
and he would haunt these woods,

841
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:43,867
scalping little boys.

842
00:44:45,873 --> 00:44:47,679
And after you went to sleep...

843
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:53,846
I would lie there so scared.

844
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:56,122
I never made a sound

845
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:00,368
'cause I wanted you
to think that I was so brave.

846
00:45:07,188 --> 00:45:10,379
All I ever wanted to do
was to make you proud, daddy.

847
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:15,448
I'll always be your brave little indian.

848
00:45:24,817 --> 00:45:26,377
I love you, daddy.

849
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:31,855
And I will carry you in my heart

850
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,799
till the day that I die.

851
00:45:36,465 --> 00:45:37,520
Good-bye.
