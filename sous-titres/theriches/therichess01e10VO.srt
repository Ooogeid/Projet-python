00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,026
<i>Previously on the Riches...</i>

2
00:00:03,278 --> 00:00:04,749
Do you really think dad has a plan?

3
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:07,186
He stole the money, ma lost the money,

4
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:10,254
and now we're here
in a dead guy's house.

5
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:12,734
Doug Rich was a litigator.

6
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:16,012
You have to be the worst
lawyer in the world.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,912
I am. And you, you're fired.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,860
The new guy doesn't know anything!

9
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:21,916
You want to be a partner?

10
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:24,921
- That's what I went to law school for.
- Okay, man, in the meantime,

11
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:27,233
- you need to invite me to a dinner.
- A dinner?

12
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:29,296
I check out your house,your friends,

13
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:31,566
your family, see if you're
partnership material.

14
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:36,003
This is Chunky K.
She was my cellie in prison.

15
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:38,398
Man, this whole maid
thing is weirding me out.

16
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:40,588
If I don't work for you,
I gotta work for somebody.

17
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:44,046
I want you to think of three adjectives
that describe Doug and Cherien,

18
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:46,906
and if I like your adjectives, I知
gonna make Doug here a partner.

19
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,199
If I don't, he's out on the street.

20
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:53,321
- Jesus Christ!
- Shut that goddamn door!

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,549
You want to make me a partner

22
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,777
- right now, right here?
- Why the hell not?

23
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:00,407
Maybe later. I wanted to be a partner.

24
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:02,971
Something about it makes
me sick to my stomach.

25
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:05,282
Oh, we're turning into buffers, baby.

26
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:07,972
- You want some?
- No.

27
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:10,157
If you decide you do want some,

28
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,469
I値l just leave it right there for you.

29
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:15,326
- Don't.
- So stop me then.

30
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,909
Why didn't you come to bed last night?

31
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:45,136
What's the matter with you?

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,540
I saw the little baggy your
friend K passed you last night,

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,902
- the one with the white powder in it.
- She left it here.

34
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:56,567
I just can't take the
lying. That's what I can't take.

35
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,055
I'm not lying, Wayne. I
told you, I知 off that shit.

36
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:03,378
Really? 'cause after you went to
sleep, I went around the house,

37
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:07,946
and I found about 15 bottles of
tranquilizer hidden all over the place.

38
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:10,593
You must be the most tranquil
person on the goddamn planet.

39
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:14,754
Has it ever crossed your mind I
might need it to get off the meth?

40
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:18,410
Well, why didn't you tell me?

41
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:22,011
Because maybe I did not
think you would understand.

42
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,482
I bet Hugh understands.

43
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:26,255
- You do it with him, too?
- Oh, my God. Jesus.

44
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,987
Isn't it enough that I知 not
takin' the shit anymore, huh?

45
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:30,302
What do you want from me?

46
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:33,568
Mom, dad, I need someone
to sign my permission slip!

47
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,216
Science museum, huh?

48
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:40,166
Don't you need to get to work?

49
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:43,472
I don't know. Probably.

50
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:46,372
- Dad, are you gonna quit your job?
- I don't know.

51
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,387
- I don't know.
- Is that why you were sleeping on

52
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:56,811
the floor in my room last
night, because you're gonna quit?

53
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:58,879
I think that's between him and mom.

54
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,319
No, no it's not about
mom. I was just thinking,

55
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:04,072
life is too short to work for assholes.

56
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:06,028
Remember that.

57
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,016
Calm down. There's a million
buffer jobs out there.

58
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:11,764
Is that you're looking
for a cashier interview.

59
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:15,155
Sammy, there is no way that anybody
need involves with that minimum wage.

60
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:16,401
Okay? Just forget that.

61
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,717
Would you relax? I'm Doug Rich.

62
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,079
I'm a high-profile lawyer, okay?

63
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:22,550
I've settled two major cases.

64
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:25,006
Hell, I知 a member of
Edenfalls Country Club,

65
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:26,946
and your mom's still
got the job at Panco.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,402
Dahlia, you're gonna be late!

67
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,152
Coming!

68
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:29,170
Hey, I was gonna flush it!

69
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:32,033
I was gonna flush it! I was! I swear!

70
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,159
I was gonna flush it!

71
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:36,382
How big a supply is
this? A month? A week?

72
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,631
No, you gotta believe
me, I was gonna flush it!

73
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,766
If you are gonna do this
shit, I知 gonna do it too?

74
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,656
No, I値l go and flush it, Wayne...

75
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,163
Now I believe you.

76
00:04:58,483 --> 00:04:59,491
God!

<i>This Is Your Brain on Drugs</i>

84
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:27,371
Are you crazy?

85
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:31,501
I mean, are you tryin' to kill yourself?

86
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,458
I don't know. Are you?

87
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,120
Of all the assaholic things you have
ever done, this is the most assaholic.

88
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,811
Are you aware of how
much of this shit you did?

89
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:44,019
I am so sorry. I forgot to
read the crank head痴 handbook.

90
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:47,054
Oh, yeah, it burns!

91
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,214
That's right! That shit is lethal,
Wayne! You better get to work

92
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:52,326
'cause I think I quit.

93
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,487
Jesus Christ.

94
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:59,305
If you let the kids see you like this,

95
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:00,978
I知 gonna rip your nuts off.

96
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:02,759
I can't tell if I'm
enjoying your reaction

97
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,457
because it's actually gratifying

98
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,379
or 'cause the meth is kickin' in.

99
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,739
Mortgage, four grand a month.

100
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:21,784
Uh, Rosemere Academy...

101
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:23,762
is $500 a month.

102
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:26,965
Edenfalls Country Club
is $1,000 a month.

103
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,396
Temple membership, water,
electric, telephone...

104
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:32,189
Sam, will you stop, okay?
He's not gonna quit.

105
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:33,344
He might.

106
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,513
Somethin' went down with
him and mom at that party.

107
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:38,049
why are we gettin' a bill from
Mountain View Nursing Home

108
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,644
for $4,700 a month?

109
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:41,065
Must be where Cherien's mother is.

110
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:43,784
I mean, he was never gonna make it in
the corporate world anyway. God knows

111
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:46,359
- mom's not gonna hang on to a job.
- So what are we gonna do?

112
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,071
What we always do, move somewhere else.

113
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,446
And what? Go back to stealin' wallets
and rippin' off car stereos?

114
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:53,547
Maybe you can wear a mustache this time.

115
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:55,981
You see, that sounds really fun to me.

116
00:06:56,087 --> 00:07:00,486
Okay, does Mom make
$14,723.51 per month?

117
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,389
'cause that's what we're gonna need.

118
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,984
That's after taxes, buddy.
You gotta add 35 percent.

119
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:09,266
Okay, do not go upstairs.
Your Dad has food poisoning.

120
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:12,959
Mom, do you make $19,876.74...

121
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,690
Do not go upstairs, okay?

122
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:06,088
Where's Doug? Hey, Doug.

123
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,862
Hey, it's me. Oh. Are you there?

124
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,953
I know you're there. I just want to
make sure you're still alive, huh?

125
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,015
No... Oh, he had bad clams.

126
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,346
Would you call me, you asshole?

127
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:20,215
- So Doug's not comin' in?
- Who the hell cares?

128
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,141
Hugh does. He called from Reno.
The REIT is gonna be here

129
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,039
at 9:00 for the closing, and he needs
Doug to answer any questions.

130
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:28,089
- The REIT?
- The Real Estate Investment Trust?

131
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:31,196
They're buying that office tower.
Hugh left the papers on his desk.

132
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:34,390
Okay, um, well, I'll handle that. Now,

133
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:36,830
Kimmie, you know how to
work the Google thing, huh?

134
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:38,900
Can you find out what a
person's supposed to do

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,970
if another person does a
whole shitload of meth?

136
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,554
Is it the one where you pack
their head in ice? Huh?

137
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:48,710
I'm... I'm givin' an anti-drug
talk at my kids' school.

138
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,594
My monthly expenses are...

139
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:57,678
$19,000!

140
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,705
- Hi, this is the Riches, we're not here
- Nineteen...

141
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:03,567
- at the moment, so leave a message.
- thousand... dollars!

142
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:07,678
- I've got to get a job.
- Wayne?

143
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:11,434
Wayne? Wayne. Pick up the goddamn phone.

144
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:13,727
Wayne, it's me. Pick up the phone.

145
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:15,755
No, I understand you got a
hiring freeze, Craig.

146
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,401
It's not just the hiring freeze, Doug.
We specialize in tax law.

147
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,052
We can't use a securities litigator.

148
00:09:20,152 --> 00:09:23,854
"extreme euphoria, anxiety,
aggressiveness, hostility,

149
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:27,229
paranoia, mania,
excessive talkativeness."

150
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:29,607
it doesn't say what to do, but...

151
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:31,332
check out the symptoms of a overdose.

152
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:34,437
heart damage, kidney failure,
hallucinations,

153
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:38,150
stroke, heart attack."
that ought to scare the kids, huh?

154
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:43,582
You better go in there.
They're gonna have questions.

155
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:46,957
Okay. Call Doug.
You read him that list of symptoms

156
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:49,786
'cause he's gonna have to do
the drug talk for the kids.

157
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:54,546
Doug? Doug, Cherien wanted me to
read you these symptoms:

158
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:59,458
"aggressiveness, hostility, paranoia,
excessive talkativeness,

159
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,361
- rapid breathing."
- shit.

160
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:03,637
"extreme sex drive,

161
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:06,265
sweating, heart palpitations."

162
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:11,620
These here... All right,

163
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,634
so I'm gonna, uh,

164
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:15,461
notarize this stuff.

165
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,068
Uh, Panetta said we should talk
to head of legal

166
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:20,308
- before we sign.
- Well, the head of legal

167
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:22,558
kicked it upstairs... to me.

168
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:26,914
$19,000. I mean, how
the hell did I get here?

169
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:30,256
<i>I hear ya, and that's before you're
blowing 45 grand a year on college.

170
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:32,649
Forty-five grand. I mean,
how the hell did you pay it?

171
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,876
- <i>Took out a 2nd and a 3rd mortgage.</i>
- God damn it.

172
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:38,104
<i>Look, Doug, I wish we had an
opening here, but the truth is,

173
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,302
-<i> even if we did have one...</i>
- Look, I know,

174
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:41,944
I'm not a defense litigator, but...

175
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:44,428
<i>I hate to sound harsh, but
we need someone younger.

176
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:47,519
- Shouldn't we read them first?
- Sure.

177
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,654
Whatever blows your hair back.

178
00:10:56,965 --> 00:10:59,363
<i>- Don't need anyone right now.
- Not now. No.

179
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:01,665
God!

180
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:11,874
"We'd like to thank you for giving us
the opportunity to meet with us..."

181
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:13,868
Hayden-Javitz!

182
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:17,345
"We're so sorry you haven't accepted
this position. Should you ever rec..."

183
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:22,431
Hayden-Javitz?

184
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:25,343
And just to put your kid through 1 year
of college costs $45,000,

185
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:27,556
and I didn't even go to college.

186
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:31,037
Of course, I went to college.
I went to...

187
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:35,105
Georgetown university to
do my college degree,

188
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:38,345
and then I went to har...
Princeton university,

189
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,392
and I studied law. Again,

190
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,884
I have done a lot of
extracurricular activities.  was...

191
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:45,509
I was in an eating club,
where we ate a lot of food.

192
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:48,057
That's the thing you do there.
And I was Prince Dauntless

193
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:50,360
in "once upon a time on a mattress".
I was a very

194
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,120
excellent leading man.
Dear God, you may ask,

195
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,817
why put that on my resume?
I ask why I put it on my resume,

196
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:58,175
but it's on the resume to
show you who I am.

197
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,207
- If I could just talk to mr. Javitz...
- Fine!

198
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:03,403
I'll call the managing partner,
and I'll ask if he'll see you, okay?

199
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,782
Just please have a seat. I will.

200
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:16,435
I have a mr. Rich out here in the lobby

201
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:18,199
with a file of wrinkled-up papers,

202
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,042
saying he wants to meet you.

203
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,913
Wayne, where the hell are you?

204
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:26,696
do you have any idea how much
your mothers' nursing home costs?

205
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:29,203
My mother's been dead for 32 years.

206
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,362
Mr. Rich, our managing partner said

207
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,869
he'd be delighted to see you.

208
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:40,964
I have Doug Rich for you.

209
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,935
Stewart.

210
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:50,346
- Holy shit!
- I know. What are the odds?

211
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,990
Last time I saw you, you were all blurry

212
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,508
'cause one of Panco's
security goons was macin' me.

213
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,299
No hard feelings, man.

214
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,090
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

215
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:04,395
you got my job, I got yours.

216
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,992
What goes around comes around.

217
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:10,274
That is... Well, that is really big

218
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,267
that is really really big,y'know?

219
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,201
- I fired you, man.
- Nah.

220
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:17,617
That was Hugh's thing.
Survival of the fittest.

221
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:19,355
Well, talk about darwinian.

222
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:21,722
You know how much it costs
to send your kids to college?

223
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,393
It never ends, huh?

224
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:25,479
Friggin' gerbil wheel.

225
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:26,934
A sickness.

226
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:29,479
We americans never
feel like we have enough.

227
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,517
- Why do you think that is, Doug?
- I don't know.

228
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,943
You think it has to do with
our goddamn puritan work ethic,

229
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:36,219
- Workin' and workin' and workin'?
- Absolutely.

230
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:38,067
You know, it all goes
back to that psychotic

231
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:39,974
dickhead myles standish.
You know he...

232
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,702
You know he was only 4'11"?

233
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:45,180
I mean, you know, a major puritan,

234
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:47,570
and 400 years later,
we're still dealing with his

235
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,479
short guy complex.

236
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,397
We gotta stop the madness, huh? We gotta

237
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:55,060
- say, "I have enough."
- I have enough, yeah.

238
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:58,139
You know what isn't enough,
though, Doug?

239
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:01,104
Your new job here...

240
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,218
As a janitor.

241
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,424
Yeah, a janitor.

242
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,356
You lousy prick.

243
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:11,969
Nobody fires my ass.

244
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:13,995
Now get the hell out of my office.

245
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,576
You little shit!

246
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,767
- Security!
- Hey, get off me!

247
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:20,289
Hey, he is a total fraud!

248
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:23,362
Look at the pictures in his office!
They're not even his kids!

249
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:26,277
That's my resume.

250
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:36,573
I am...

251
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,805
unclear on item 15

252
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:41,512
sub a.

253
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:49,092
Excuse me.

254
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,861
- Where are you?
- Do you know how much we pay for hbo?

255
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:58,929
Okay, Wayne,
do not give me this shit about hbo.

256
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,607
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm here.

257
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:03,897
- I've had a wake-up call, Dahlia.
- Where are you?

258
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,571
We don't need any of this shit.

259
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,739
It is time to say, "enough."

260
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:10,155
Wayne, will you just tell me,
are you having chest pains?

261
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:13,674
And where'd you put all the goddamn
pills? Did you throw 'em all out?

262
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:15,792
Did you throw out the ones
underneath the garden gnome?

263
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,740
'Cause if you didn't, would you
please take five of 'em?

264
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:19,733
Fine, but we gotta cut out hbo.

265
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,674
We've gotta stop drinking those lattes.

266
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,929
We've gotta stop using
the cell phones and the internet

267
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,096
and the cable, and we gotta reus

268
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:29,903
e paper towels, 'cause you know what?

269
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:33,208
Nobody wants Doug Rich.

270
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:37,132
He's an old, sleazy, washed-up nothing.

271
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:40,073
But that's okay 'cause
we don't need any of this shit.

272
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,398
The pilgrims didn't
even have paper towels.

273
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:46,976
What'd you have, squanto sitting
on the edge of plymouth rock,

274
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:48,897
watching hbo, for God sakes,

275
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:51,123
or paying a nursing home

276
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,325
$4,700 a month?

277
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:54,709
Jesus christ!

278
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:58,736
Shit!

279
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:02,539
$2,300 for a single room?

280
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,920
What are you, the ritz-carlton?

281
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:06,437
- You pay a premium for privacy.
- She doesn't like privacy.

282
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:07,753
She likes lots of people.

283
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,428
I mean, she... She's lonely.

284
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:11,950
Mom is very, very

285
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,510
lonely.

286
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:15,662
You know,
the search for individual freedom,

287
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,762
which, and I'm quoting mom here,
has led to

288
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:19,912
a culture of alienation and anomy,

289
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,228
which ironically leads
us to spend more and more money,

290
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,651
trying to fill the howling, aching,

291
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,337
empty...

292
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,032
Are you... Are you answering e-mails?

293
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:31,248
I'm multitasking, mr.
Rich. What do you want?

294
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:33,181
I wanna know what the
hell this medical charges

295
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:35,211
of 1thousand and 500h and 82

296
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,458
We had to put dr. Morgenstern on oxygen.

297
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,546
I'm paying for her doctor's
medical bills as well?

298
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:41,360
your mother in law is doctor

299
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:44,445
is doctor Morgenster
and she needs oxygen

300
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,499
So you're charging
her to breathe now.

301
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:49,182
Well, that's illegal.
She doesn't want to live like that.

302
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:51,816
I mean, hooked up to an oxygen tank,
what kind of life is that?

303
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,779
Tell her it'd be okay if she lets go,

304
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,591
you know? Tell her to let go.
Tell her to go towards the light.

305
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,823
They love that. Tell her... Hello?

306
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,603
I just need

307
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:06,198
a little clearing up on article 41.

308
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:09,550
Okay, you know what? I don't give
a good goddamn about article 41, buddy.

309
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:13,967
I have to say,

310
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,477
I think we've been really
good sports about the

311
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,609
lack of clarity in these documents.

312
00:17:21,046 --> 00:17:22,888
Okay. I'm sorry.

313
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,319
Sorry.

314
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:27,574
I have a relative with
some addiction problems.

315
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,577
Oh, I'm sorry.

316
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:35,882
Shit.

317
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:37,946
Let's look at article 41.

318
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,949
You know, uh, ahem... I, uh...

319
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,069
I hope this doesn't cross the line, but

320
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,635
you've seemed quite
upset all morning, and

321
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,401
I just want to say

322
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,166
my son's had some addiction issues.

323
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:55,157
He's been in and out of rehab.

324
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:56,855
Well, I just mean that I...

325
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:59,964
I know how it can rip your guts out.

326
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:14,310
Can you not read the sign?

327
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:19,418
It says, "no solicitors."

328
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:21,359
I can read.

329
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:24,008
I just thought you might like to know
that your

330
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,392
roof is looking a little tired.

331
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:27,351
Please don't make me call security.

332
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:30,454
I also do house paintin' and haulin'.

333
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,993
I've already billed my services
to some of your neighbors,

334
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:35,612
your backdoor neighbor in 1405?

335
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,128
- Doug Rich?
- No, no, that's not his name.

336
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:39,935
A fella with a beard, three kids,

337
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,770
- big ol' mercedes benz in the driveway.
- Yeah, that's Doug Rich.

338
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,016
That's his name?
Are you sure about that?

339
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:46,788
Well, I think I would remember his name.

340
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,111
That prick screwed
me out of $10 million.

341
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:50,894
$10 million?

342
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:54,477
Doug Rich screwed
you out of $10 million?

343
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:57,197
You were robbed. That is...

344
00:18:57,326 --> 00:19:00,188
That is a gross overcharge
for aluminum siding.

345
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,514
Do I look like someone
who uses aluminum sidin'?

346
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:04,945
He's a lawyer.

347
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,980
That shit-suckin' bastard.

348
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:13,253
Would you care for a fresh latte, Dale?

349
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:18,314
We do not euthanize our patients, sir.

350
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,801
Read our mission statement.

351
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,015
I am just trying to understand,
what is this charge

352
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,429
for $279.50 for "miscellaneous"?

353
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:26,628
Miscellaneous is the cappuccino cart.

354
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,441
She bought a cappuccino cart?

355
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,647
We have a cappuccino cart.
It's one of our perks.

356
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,211
Dear God, you must be peeling
the old bat off the ceiling.

357
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:36,154
I mean,why can't she just rip
some bark off a tree and chew it?

358
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:37,999
That's probably what squanto used to do.

359
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,296
It didn't cost him a dime.

360
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:40,593
Bark is a natural stimulant.

361
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,716
You want your
mother-in-law to chew bark?

362
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,314
Okay. You tell her.

363
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,733
Front desk, visitor for dr. Morgenstern.

364
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,695
No, no, no, not now.
I don't want to scare her.

365
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:52,356
Look, she's elderly and
obviously overcaffeinated,

366
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:53,772
you know? This is just a recipe

367
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:54,980
for cardiac arrest.

368
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,684
She doesn't want to see me.

369
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:05,968
She hates lawyers.

370
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,207
I mean, mom has had
it with the litigious society.

371
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,396
Chances are she won't
even rember you, mr. Rich.

372
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:12,097
We had to move her to ward c.

373
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:16,417
Dr. Morgenstern, hon?

374
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:19,863
Your son-in-law is here.

375
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:27,772
mother?

376
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,719
Hi, it's Doug.

377
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:33,091
I've had some work done.

378
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:35,660
Mom?

379
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:39,479
Sometimes you have to speak up a little.

380
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,314
Hi, mom, it's Doug.

381
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:45,364
You remember?

382
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,379
Who?

383
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:52,511
I'm Doug Rich.

384
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:53,915
I'm Doug Rich.

385
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,440
I think... I think you're...

386
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:57,361
You're marvin o'keefe, sir.

387
00:20:57,443 --> 00:20:58,895
I'm Doug Rich.

388
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,936
What is this,spartacus? I'm Doug Rich.

389
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:03,423
Do not antagonize mr. O'keefe.

390
00:21:03,464 --> 00:21:04,930
You lousy sack of shit!

391
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:06,561
I'm Doug Rich!

392
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:09,209
Maybe you are Doug Rich.

393
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:11,379
Is that why I'm not getting any jobs?

394
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:13,479
You're causing me to be unemployed.

395
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,376
You're causing the supply of Doug Rich

396
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:17,581
to greatly exceed
the demand for Doug Rich.

397
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:21,364
That's it.

398
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,039
Why is there no air in here?

399
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,256
Come on, ma, we're getting out of here.

400
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:29,344
she's not covered without
a day release form.

401
00:21:29,473 --> 00:21:30,904
We're going.

402
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,200
Thank you, Doug.

403
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:38,928
This is great.

404
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,532
This is a great idea.

405
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:42,585
This is a great idea.

406
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:44,987
We're just gonna get some air.

407
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:47,714
God!

408
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,990
You all right there, ma?

409
00:21:53,783 --> 00:21:55,437
Isn't this fun, ma?

410
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:58,867
I'll put that. Here we go.

411
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:02,067
Gotta get some air.
I bet you like this air.

412
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:04,363
This is real air, ma.

413
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,184
Gotcha. I gotcha.

414
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,604
I gotcha.

415
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:11,938
Okay, this is fun, huh?

416
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,859
Down.

417
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:16,351
Now, ma, watch your head there.

418
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,442
Back you go.

419
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:19,656
Not so far back.

420
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:21,451
You have to go here.

421
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,046
It's like a ride.

422
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,343
Here we go. Okay.

423
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:36,263
- I made some calls.
- What?

424
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,002
Yeah, yeah, excellent plan.

425
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,873
- Where's Cherien?
- Cherien?

426
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,711
Look, what kind of
doctor are you, anyway?

427
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:52,245
Tell me all about that.

428
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,321
- Where is Cherien?
- No, no, no.

429
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:56,269
We'll go to the park, what about that?

430
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,561
Do you want to go to the park?
We could feed the ducks.

431
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,657
Where is Cherien?

432
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,733
All right! I'll take you to Cherien!

433
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:02,953
But...

434
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:06,660
She's changed.
She's changed an awful lot.

435
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:08,519
More than me.

436
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,602
And now,

437
00:23:14,954 --> 00:23:17,546
he's livin' with some skank
in little rock

438
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,024
with maroon hair...

439
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,422
And "Satan" tattooed on her neck.

440
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,252
Hey, hold that thought.

441
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:31,574
- ...any of the stuff, just lattes.
- Where the hell have you been?

442
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,713
I've got a surprise for you in the car.

443
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,858
What happened to your suit?

444
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:36,187
There was a minor altercation,
but it's good.

445
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:38,615
Really cleared things up.
Everything is totally clear now.

446
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,653
It is a bad sign. It is a very bad sign.

447
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:41,807
No, it's great sign.

448
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:43,437
Because everything finally makes sense.

449
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,174
Everything is not supposed
to make sense.

450
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,085
If it makes sense and
everything's beautiful.

451
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:48,427
Everything is beautiful.

452
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,301
You see, now you're tweakin', all right?

453
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:51,855
This is very dangerous, Wayne.

454
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,374
All this is just symptoms, okay?

455
00:23:53,503 --> 00:23:55,564
These are symptoms.
Euphoria,aggression,

456
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:57,326
heart palpitations, extreme sex drive,

457
00:23:57,378 --> 00:23:58,810
all these things you're
feeling right now.

458
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,721
Pretty soon, you're gonna crash,
you're gonna get suicidally depressed,

459
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,119
then maybe
you're gonna feel like

460
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,842
there's bugs crawling
all over your skin.

461
00:24:05,874 --> 00:24:08,290
I'm so glad you're back.
I was all worried.

462
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:12,752
I once ate bad herring,
and I had the trots for a week.

463
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:15,208
God, that means so much.

464
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:17,976
Some many people don't give
a sheet about Doug Rich.

465
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:20,110
Okay, that's enough.

466
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:22,374
Okay, that's enough. That's enough.

467
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:24,098
Sorry.

468
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:25,780
I'm experiencing extreme sex drive.

469
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,399
Go in your office now!

470
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:30,707
Okay. Now, what are you doing?

471
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,812
Are you trying to blow
this whole thing to hell?

472
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:34,618
How do you like it, watching someone you

473
00:24:34,794 --> 00:24:36,190
love self-destruct?

474
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,157
This is your brain on drugs.

475
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,061
I feel so close to you now.

476
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:43,829
Now there's no more bullshit, no lying.

477
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,792
Could you just put
your pants back on, please?

478
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:48,371
I can't. This is extreme sex drive.

479
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,417
- I love you.
- Wayne, this is the meth talking.

480
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,890
You know what's happening right now?

481
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:54,649
You're getting a big release of
dopamine in your prefrontal cortex.

482
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:56,222
- That makes two of us.
- Get off me.

483
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:57,648
Get a grip on yourself!

484
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:59,706
I am not using.

485
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:01,396
Yeah? I'm supposed to believe that?

486
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,362
My God. Why?
Do I look like you right now?

487
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:04,414
Is that what you think?

488
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:06,668
You think I'm all runnin' around
with the crazy eyes,

489
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:08,593
humpin' the secretary,
rantin' about squanto?

490
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:10,974
No, I'm trying to keep
a goddamn job together!

491
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,873
I'm trying to keep this together, Wayne!

492
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:16,112
- Do I seem like I'm using?
- Why would I think that?

493
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:19,365
- Did Hugh give you pills?
- No, Wayne. No, he did not.

494
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,004
Yeah, but he knew! You told him!

495
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:23,631
Everybody knew, Wayne.
It was goddamn obvious.

496
00:25:23,761 --> 00:25:25,985
I never lied, okay. Are you gettin' me?

497
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,330
You were the only
person who did not know

498
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:30,398
because you were too
busy lying to yourself

499
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,939
because, Wayne, that is what you do!

500
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,368
You stuff everything down, Wayne.

501
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:42,366
You try and make everything look pretty.

502
00:25:42,678 --> 00:25:45,491
I think that's why you dragged us
here to Edenfalls, so we could live

503
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:48,481
in this glittery,
and pretend to be happy.

504
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:52,906
You want me to be happy, huh?

505
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,860
Then let me do drugs.

506
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:05,713
I thought we were in this together.

507
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,614
Did you drive here?

508
00:26:13,663 --> 00:26:15,338
Your mother's in the car.

509
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:18,606
No, don't go out there. No.

510
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,373
I liberated her from the nursing home.

511
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:22,767
Look, she's completely senile.

512
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:24,497
You gotta go down
and say you're Cherien.

513
00:26:24,562 --> 00:26:26,737
She won't go until she
knows that Cherien is...

514
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,855
Shush!

515
00:26:28,183 --> 00:26:29,185
Be quiet.

516
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:31,667
Stay here.

517
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:33,370
Do not move.

518
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:35,479
I'm gonna go deal with the old lady.

519
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:45,551
He had an allergic reaction.

520
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,185
To his pants?

521
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:53,689
Just don't let him leave the office.

522
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,977
You could go buff...

523
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,027
Buff or ecru.

524
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:00,921
Or you could even go oatmeal.

525
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:03,714
And you can do the whole thing for 500?

526
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:07,209
Seein' as you're a preferred customer.

527
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:11,273
So, Doug Rich is

528
00:27:11,436 --> 00:27:14,638
a lawyer for a real estate company, huh?

529
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,290
Shoes!

530
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:19,288
I'm sorry.

531
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:20,670
Sorry.

532
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:23,282
And his

533
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:26,379
real estate company
screwed you out of $10 million?

534
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:29,365
That's right, because of a
legal action I filed against them.

535
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,637
Why'd you file a legal action?

536
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:33,497
Because they caused me
irreparable harm and loss of limb.

537
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:36,072
Loss of limb?

538
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:38,972
No, not my foot.
I broke that on the stair.

539
00:27:39,063 --> 00:27:41,496
It is still clearly attached to
my body. You know what?

540
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,913
I don't care to discuss it.

541
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:45,059
Please use the stain remover sparingly.

542
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:54,033
It was your arm, wasn't it?

543
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,882
I believe I just said that
I didn't care to discuss it.

544
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:59,313
And now you're ruinin' my shag.
You know what?

545
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:02,343
My paint's fine. I do not need
new paint. You are free to go.

546
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,949
And if you don't get those stains
off my carpet, I will sue your ass.

547
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:21,337
Jesus christ.

548
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:25,520
Hi, ma. Hi.

549
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:26,818
Hi.

550
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:30,050
Oh, my goodness, look at you.
Don't you look fine?

551
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:31,441
Now,

552
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,250
you might not even recognize me.

553
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:35,540
It's been a long time since
we've seen each other.

554
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:38,362
I've had an extreme makeover, okay?

555
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,656
I gonna take you back to
the nursing home, honey.

556
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:53,046
here we go.

557
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:54,913
All right.

558
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:56,973
All right.

559
00:28:59,315 --> 00:29:00,473
Oh, boy.

560
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:04,500
Well,

561
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,743
I have had a personal setback today.

562
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:16,106
Thanks for that.

563
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:28,059
Doug's gone crazy.

564
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:30,907
I think he might have fried his brain.

565
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,112
Your hand is warm.

566
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,413
Nice and warm.

567
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,858
Kind of nice havin' a mama,

568
00:29:51,215 --> 00:29:52,967
even a bullshit one like you.

569
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:01,078
I'm just kind of freaked out, you know?

570
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,512
I'm scared he might jump off
a building when he crashes, or

571
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:06,690
try and drink himself to
death because, you know,

572
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:08,962
that's what you do when
you try and numb the crash.

573
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:14,088
Oh, my God, this is so wrong.

574
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:17,689
I don't know what I'm doin'.

575
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:21,549
I'm not supposed to be
the strong one. I'm not.

576
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:25,897
You're not Cherien.

577
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:40,448
I'm sorry, Doug, but since you're here,

578
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,897
the reit has some questions
about the documents.

579
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:44,746
- What?
- They're kind of waiting.

580
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:45,816
Fine.

581
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:49,904
Well, of course, I'm Cherien.

582
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,072
You know?

583
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,905
Don't you recognize your own daughter?

584
00:30:52,969 --> 00:30:54,738
You really are senile, ma.

585
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:57,041
You're not Cherien,

586
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:05,087
I'll have a grande mochaccino.

587
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:09,612
I got to get you back to
the nursing home, honey.

588
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:11,008
I have to pee.

589
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:13,457
Okay, well, you can pee
at the nursing home, huh?

590
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,869
I have to pee.

591
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:16,913
I have to pee!

592
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:18,276
Okay, okay, okay. Don't pee now.

593
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:21,066
I'll take you to my house.
You can pee there, okay? Okay?

594
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,917
You're not Cherien.

595
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:29,842
Cherien's a bitch.

596
00:31:39,988 --> 00:31:41,067
Oh. There's,

597
00:31:41,618 --> 00:31:43,430
There's no provision
in these contracts

598
00:31:43,646 --> 00:31:46,063
for our offer to be
contingent on inspection.

599
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:48,918
You....

600
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,827
You are the head of legal, right?

601
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:54,060
Am I?

602
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,812
Is that who I am?

603
00:31:59,511 --> 00:32:01,587
I'm not sure what's real anymore.

604
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,728
I don't think the bugs are.

605
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,875
You know,

606
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:09,887
we run and we run and we run

607
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,441
we think we're getting closer
to what we want, but,

608
00:32:12,591 --> 00:32:14,478
really,we're just trying
to pay the 19,000

609
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:17,655
$19,876.74 a month.

610
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:19,073
I feel you.

611
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:22,301
Try being divorced, double everything.

612
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,313
Try being divorced twice.

613
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:25,673
Is that who we are?

614
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,733
Is that what's gonna be on my tombstone?

615
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,324
"here lies a guy who came up with"

616
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:31,926
"19,876.74 a month"?

617
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:34,454
I grew up in a jesuit orphanage.

618
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,587
Is this what the brothers
educated me for?

619
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:46,367
I don't even remember what
I was supposed to want...

620
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:53,890
If I don't have Dahlia.

621
00:33:09,675 --> 00:33:12,671
Okay, hold on 'cause
we are almost there.

622
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,720
Just in here. Hi! We're home!

623
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:17,811
She's senile.

624
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:20,694
You're not Cherien.

625
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:22,900
She's mostly senile.

626
00:33:23,243 --> 00:33:24,367
It's Cherien's mom.

627
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,499
But I thought she was in a nursing home.

628
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:29,247
Yeah, your dad set her free.

629
00:33:29,444 --> 00:33:30,828
Hey, grandma.

630
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:31,910
Yeah.

631
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:33,914
Grandma's gonna go pee-pee,

632
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,177
and then we're gonna go back to
the nice nursing home real fast.

633
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:38,008
See, I thought both our
grandmas were dead.

634
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,090
There you go.

635
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:40,733
It's a miracle.

636
00:33:48,172 --> 00:33:50,107
- Wayne?
- <i>Cherien, it's Kimmie.</i>

637
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:52,656
<i>Doug walked out of the office.
I couldn't stop him,

638
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,778
- <i>and he was wearing his pants.</i>
- Oh, jesus christ.

639
00:33:57,922 --> 00:34:01,198
Oh, Wayne, please don't
do anything stupid, honey.

640
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,692
Wayne! Aw, shit.

641
00:34:05,765 --> 00:34:06,993
Dad didn't come home, did he?

642
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:09,618
- I thought dad was at work, mom.
- Told you he was gonna quit.

643
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:11,529
Okay, now you listen to me.

644
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,256
You do not do anything stupid, okay?

645
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:17,481
Don't get in any fights, please,
and do not drive anywhere.

646
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,883
Mom, I think grandma
fell in the bathroom!

647
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,124
Bless me father for I have sinned.
It has been...

648
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,848
Twenty

649
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:34,627
Twenty Two...

650
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:35,638
Twenty Two Years...

651
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:37,095
Since my last confession,

652
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:40,946
and I have done a shitload of meth.

653
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:45,241
Uh, my name is Doug.

654
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,734
my name is Wayne.

655
00:34:52,817 --> 00:34:54,159
Wayne Malloy.

656
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,592
Okay, let's get you in your wheelchair.

657
00:34:57,766 --> 00:34:58,836
Careful there.

658
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,259
Let's get you back to the nursing
home, sweetheart, okay?

659
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:02,564
You're not Cherien.

660
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:04,240
No, I'm know, sweetheart.

661
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,957
I made some calls.

662
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:07,463
Okay. Who'd you call?

663
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,410
Did you call the nursing home?

664
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:12,522
They're not gonna believe you,
sweetheart. I mean,

665
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:14,602
you know, you're a senile old lady.

666
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:17,907
- Who'd you call?
- She didn't call the cops, did she?

667
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:19,915
You're not Cherien.

668
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:26,492
Her doing meth,

669
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,936
it's because I failed her.

670
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:31,299
That's why I came here.

671
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,536
I thought if I could build her a castle,

672
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:36,773
a whole new life here in Edenfalls,

673
00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:39,488
then... Then I'd make it up to her.

674
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:43,807
What a crock of shit.

675
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:48,593
If want to rip off my skin.

676
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:53,109
I want to drink so much,
I can't even rember who I am.

677
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,315
I want to die.

678
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,228
I want more meth.

679
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:03,723
God, you must think I'm such an asshole.

680
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:06,002
No, of course not.

681
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:09,290
You're in a lot of pain.
It's the human condition.

682
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,090
We're all flawed, Wayne.

683
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:15,939
I mean.

684
00:36:16,563 --> 00:36:17,575
Th-thanks.

685
00:36:17,627 --> 00:36:18,951
I understand how you feel.

686
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,928
I'm having something of
an existential crisis myself.

687
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,232
You're an existentialist priest?

688
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:27,844
I'm quitting the priesthood.
Next week is my last week.

689
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,487
I don't believe in God anymore.

690
00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:33,307
Whoa, what bad timing.

691
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:36,180
Stains are all scrubbed out now, ma'am,

692
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,500
so I'll just be on my way.

693
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,236
Okay, thank you.

694
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:44,784
Look, I'm sorry if I bit
your head off earlier.

695
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:49,946
Oh, it's a sensitive topic,
ma'am. I can see that.

696
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:53,578
So Doug Rich, he really screwed
you over on that paint job, huh?

697
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:55,794
He can suck shit in hell for all I care.

698
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:00,851
That's Everett.

699
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:02,494
He's my husband.

700
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:08,113
So you must really hate him, huh?

701
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:10,714
- Your husband?
- Doug Rich.

702
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:17,841
Yeah. Do you?

703
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:21,722
He screwed you out of $10 million.
You must hate his guts.

704
00:37:21,836 --> 00:37:23,043
You probably want to kill him.

705
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,350
No, I wouldn't dream of killin' him.
That would be awful.

706
00:37:28,464 --> 00:37:31,471
I did once think of running him over
when he was mowing his lawn,

707
00:37:31,544 --> 00:37:35,353
but I was very angry that day, and
I would never really do that, of course.

708
00:37:35,457 --> 00:37:37,319
Yeah. The thing about killin'

709
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:39,556
is, uh...

710
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:44,457
My daddy passed recently,

711
00:37:45,174 --> 00:37:48,005
and I realized that
once a person is dead...

712
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:51,969
Things are always up in the air.

713
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:54,851
It's like time stands still
since the day they died.

714
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:58,940
Plus, they come to you
when you're asleep.

715
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:01,240
My arm does that.

716
00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:03,924
When I dream of it, it's still attached.

717
00:38:08,897 --> 00:38:09,937
Can I touch it?

718
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:15,223
I'm sorry.
I just... I'm kind of mechanical,

719
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:18,240
and I ain't never seen
no mechanical arm before.

720
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,474
You wouldn't be disgusted?

721
00:38:39,573 --> 00:38:41,258
That's some solid craftsmanship.

722
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:51,809
They didn't scrimp on them joints.

723
00:38:52,611 --> 00:38:55,212
I hope you weren't
shocked by what I said

724
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:58,417
about, you know, killin' Doug.
I didn't mean it.

725
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,883
I just have very strong
feelings, that's all I meant.

726
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,713
Yeah, I know how it is.
I've felt like that sometimes.

727
00:39:09,384 --> 00:39:10,966
Would you like to stay for supper?

728
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:21,912
- Keep thinking about squanto.
- Yeah.

729
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:24,139
What an asshole.

730
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,730
Upwardly mobile son of a bitch,

731
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:28,395
spoke fluent english,

732
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,860
- played everybody.
- Mm-hmm.

733
00:39:55,252 --> 00:39:57,853
You know, I kind of
always wanted a grandma.

734
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,767
No. No, don't do that.
We're taking her back tomorrow.

735
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:03,278
I know that.
I'm just saying, she's just...

736
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,589
kind of easy to talk to.

737
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:07,798
She even held my hand
there for a second.

738
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:09,739
So, you guys... You
talked to her about us?

739
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:12,138
- That's great, Didi.
- Calm down, Cal.

740
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,340
She doesn't even
understand anything, okay?

741
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:16,634
I'll have a grande mochaccino.

742
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:20,282
- Mom, grandma wants
another mochaccino. - Ma!

743
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:22,916
Geez, I just fixed you one.

744
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,807
Wayne? Where the hell are you?

745
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,942
I can't drive.

746
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:49,018
Father jeff took the bus.

747
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,925
I want to die.

748
00:40:54,598 --> 00:40:56,247
It's gonna go away after a while.

749
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,244
Is this how you felt?

750
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,641
I'm so sorry.

751
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:20,090
I was so ashamed, Wayne...

752
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:23,632
But I couldn't tell you.

753
00:41:29,304 --> 00:41:31,628
I wanted to make
you this beautiful life.

754
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,910
But it's not real.

755
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:52,045
Come on, let's go.

756
00:41:57,497 --> 00:41:59,314
- You don't want your shoes?
- No.

757
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:07,211
- You know, my buttons
are falling off. - What?

758
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,026
- My buttons are fall... - Okay, okay.
Let me see, let me see, let me see.

759
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:16,620
You scared the shit out of me today.

760
00:42:19,228 --> 00:42:21,136
All I could picture was you lying dead

761
00:42:21,214 --> 00:42:23,719
in some hospital
somewhere from an overdose.

762
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,520
Hey, are we big enough for this life?

763
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:35,909
Are we big enough for this crazy
world we found ourself in?

764
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:37,360
'Cause I don't know.

765
00:42:39,216 --> 00:42:41,033
I've messed up your whole life.

766
00:42:45,472 --> 00:42:46,718
Yeah, you have.

767
00:42:48,185 --> 00:42:50,080
But, baby...

768
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:56,232
all I ever wanted was
a messed-up life with you.

769
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:03,241
Without you...

770
00:43:07,966 --> 00:43:10,250
I can't do my buttons.

771
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:24,118
- Should we go home?
- You're so pathetic. Come on.

772
