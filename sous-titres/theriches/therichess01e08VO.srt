<i>Previously on The Riches...

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:05,290
Do you really think dad has a plan?

3
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:06,979
He stole the money,

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,164
ma lost the money,

5
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:11,396
and now we're here
in a dead guy's house.

6
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:13,942
What kind of monster steals
the family bank?

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,100
We're gonna get caught, Di.

8
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:18,071
How'd y'all get in the front gate?

9
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:19,396
We live here.

10
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:20,662
Hi, Doug Rich.

11
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:22,997
Welcome to Panco, Doug.

12
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:24,997
I hope your time here is fruitful.

13
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,407
Dahlia, what are you doing here?

14
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:30,199
Hugh offered me a job.
I'm gonna take him up on it.

15
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:34,382
How do you do?

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:36,060
I'm mrs. Doug Rich.

17
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:42,112
Just bring back the money, Di.

18
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,330
Dale wants $40,000.

19
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:47,888
That's a lot of silverware, dad.

20
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:49,870
Goddamn small bills.

21
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:52,955
Isn't this what got us
in trouble in the first place?

22
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,544
How long are we gonna stay?

23
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:56,180
We get in, we get out.

24
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,751
I want an oath of protection.

25
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:31,722
The car's right outside.
Come on. Let's go.

26
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,668
Dad, these people have been
staring at us.

27
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,912
No, honey. It's just your imagination.
Hey, take your coat.

28
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,868
Why can't we just park
the rv at our house?

29
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,735
They won't let it through
the gate, buddy. It's too ugly.

30
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:47,101
It's our home.

31
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:48,649
Not anymore.

32
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,021
This is a bad idea.

33
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:52,907
What do you mean?
Rvs there, there, there, over there.

34
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:54,449
We're gonna blend right in.

35
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:56,320
They're gonna break in
the minute we leave.

36
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,539
Maybe they're nice.

37
00:01:57,732 --> 00:01:59,234
Or maybe they're just like us.

38
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:03,468
- We got history. We got culture.
- Good morning.

39
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:05,344
Community.

40
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,852
You mean, we used to, right?

41
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,135
No, sweetheart.

42
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,704
We got it whether
we're with travelers or not.

43
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,154
I said hey.

44
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:18,054
What are you, deaf?

45
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:21,081
No, I'm not deaf, but
I sometimes get a buzzing in my ears.

46
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:22,207
Does that count?

47
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:24,323
What she's trying to say
is there's a fee.

48
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,223
Oh, Jesus Christ, I knew it.

49
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,023
You know what?

50
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:30,615
You ain't got no right
chargin' me no fee, buddy boy.

51
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,321
True. We have no right,

52
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,632
but it's 200 bucks.

53
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:36,743
That'll cover the first week.

54
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:39,288
We'll keep an eye on it for you guys.

55
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:40,942
Don't you pay 'em, Wayne.

56
00:02:41,147 --> 00:02:42,508
Completely reasonable.

57
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,892
Oh, my God.

58
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,518
Thanks. You have nothin'
to worry about.

59
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,612
Come on. We got to get back to work.

60
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:54,926
Screw work.

61
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,237
We've been gone two days.

62
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:59,999
Yeah, let's not mention
the other little thing.

63
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,076
What, you mean the money we stole?

64
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:04,504
Jesus, sam, he just said not
to mention it.

65
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:16,801
Stay calm, baby.

66
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,123
Well, what's wrong, Kimmie?

67
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:24,505
Hugh's gone crazy.

68
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:25,977
He's crazy.

69
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:29,631
He thinks someone robbed him,
stole $40,000 from his safe.

70
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:33,073
He's not letting anyone leave
until he finds who it was.

71
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:36,827
Your name?

72
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,853
What's your real name, Tony?

73
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:44,471
It's Tony.

74
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:45,750
It is.

75
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:47,333
Shit.

76
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:50,602
Where the hell have you been?

82
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,245
Been gone two days,

83
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:20,805
same as the money.

84
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:22,235
What money?

85
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:24,968
The 40 grand in my safe.

86
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:26,915
Ring a bell?

87
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:28,264
You saying you suspect us?

88
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,458
I suspect everybody who works for me,

89
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,355
everybody who had access to Panco

90
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:34,950
on the day of the crime.

91
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,624
Hugh, as your counsel,
I must warn you

92
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,510
that forcing your employees
to undertake a lie detector test

93
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,879
is completely illegal.

94
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:46,146
Potential liability is enormous.

95
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,967
It's scientifically useless.
Am I right?

96
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:50,962
Where the hell have you been
for the last two days?

97
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:52,903
Food poisoning.

98
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,216
Bullshit.

99
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,187
No, it's true. He had a bad shrimp.

100
00:04:57,084 --> 00:05:00,098
You're the head of legal, Doug.
You don't disappear

101
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:02,538
'cause you ate a bad shrimp.

102
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:05,072
Now, you're gonna tell me
where you were,

103
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,518
and you're gonna tell me the truth.

104
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:10,029
I'm gonna get it out of you
one way or another.

105
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,301
Reynaldo, you can go.

106
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,101
- Whatever the hell your name is.
- He's not done.

107
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:16,655
He's done.

108
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:18,188
You, too, Cherien.

109
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:19,513
No, I'm stayin'.

110
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:22,876
Get the hell out.

111
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:30,114
Okay, Doug, you're on the hot seat.

112
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:40,946
I was in florida,

113
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,740
in Boca Raton,

114
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:46,575
working on a new investor for you.

115
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,564
An investor.

116
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,838
A big one,

117
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,428
one to help you with
your current cash flow situation.

118
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:58,382
So who took the money?

119
00:05:58,745 --> 00:06:01,115
I don't frigging know.

120
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:04,892
Why didn't you just tell me
you had an investor, Doug?

121
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:07,343
Because I was trying to keep it quiet

122
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,489
because it was supposed to be

123
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,528
your end-of-the-quarter surprise.

124
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,278
Who is he?

125
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,665
Well, that was part of the surprise.

126
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,964
It is a very delicate

127
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:26,999
personal relationship,

128
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:30,788
and the deal is not quite closed yet.

129
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:32,055
Excuse me.

130
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:36,014
Well, you better close that deal, Doug.

131
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,102
You better close it.

132
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,425
How much you got him on the line for?

133
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:41,668
What's he in for?

134
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,070
A hundred grand?

135
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,510
Two? Three hundred?

136
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:46,761
Four?

137
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,204
500,000?

138
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:49,670
I had no choice.

139
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,719
You signed us up for $500,000?

140
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:54,238
What was I supposed to do?

141
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,138
I hate those machines.
They creep me out.

142
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:58,156
What, you think
it's gonna steal your soul?

143
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:01,096
People pass polygraphs
all the goddamn time.

144
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:02,856
Who? What people?

145
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:05,648
In the movies.

146
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:13,550
He would've had me at "Doug Rich."

147
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:16,037
My God. Where are we gonna
find half a million dollars?

148
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,357
I said I will find an investor.
I will just have to find that investor.

149
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,515
What? To invest in this shithole?

150
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:23,685
Honey,

151
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,089
we are con men,

152
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:28,019
remember?

153
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:31,971
We do fake investors.
We don't do real investors.

154
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:35,472
Where are you gonna find a boca man?

155
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,047
All right team.

156
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:46,419
Listen up.

157
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:49,387
We're thinkin' of doing
a big store with Panco as the front.

158
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,195
So we need to find a mark
that's rich, greedy, and stupid enough

159
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,840
to wanna drop a load
without thinking twice.

160
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:56,752
What about Jim and Nina?

161
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,893
Don't they have
a lot of money from alpacas?

162
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:00,969
Cupcake, I love Nina.

163
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,998
Guys, I got one.

164
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:07,050
Averil Utrell, age 79.
She's a recent widow.

165
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,473
Her husband was some Rich oil guy,

166
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:11,449
and it turns out
she's giving all her money

167
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,346
to animal shelters
and music stuff.

168
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:15,915
No, we don't do little old ladies.

169
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:18,349
Di, did you burn your moral compass?

170
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,047
Look, why don't we just try
pullin' a rag on

171
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,619
an apple down
by the train station?

172
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:26,272
That's a good idea but we don't know
shit about the store market, do we?

173
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:27,656
Next?

174
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:30,067
Come on, family.
Lots of easy marks around.

175
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:32,565
Yeah, except they can't know us,
they can't be too smart,

176
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:35,251
and they gotta be greedy as shit.
You're makin' it difficult.

177
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,969
Rudy Blue.

178
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:41,583
Perfect.

179
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:45,459
- The baseball player?
- Yeah. He loaded.

180
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,125
Ain't he still in jail?

181
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:48,545
Not anymore.

182
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:56,457
Okay, Rudy Blue is quite possibly
the coolest guy in the world.

183
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:58,334
Speak up, Cal. I can't hear you.

184
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:00,537
He's the most badass
baseball player of all time.

185
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:01,782
He had sex with a hooker girl

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
during of the seventh inning stretch
a world series game.

187
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:05,732
When baseball was baseball.

188
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,923
And he got busted havin' sex
with a 17-year-old girl.

189
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:10,735
Okay, he says they were just friends.

190
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,034
Her dad found them naked in a hot tub.

191
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:15,303
Okay, he's got a shitload
of cash, right?

192
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:18,447
First day out of the big house,
he bought a Ferrari 612 scaglietti.

193
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:19,802
250 gs.

194
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:21,643
That's a man with somethin' to prove.

195
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,519
And money to lose.

196
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,396
He invested in shrimp boats,

197
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:26,727
bana farms,

198
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,284
and Rudy's chili and fries.

199
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:30,967
A guaranteed loser.

200
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:32,769
Hi, I'm rudy, and,

201
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,162
I'm a sexaholic.

202
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:37,009
Hi, Rudy.

203
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,323
Okay, and we have newcomers.
Please introduce yourself.

204
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,853
First names only.

205
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:45,349
Hi. I'm Mel,

206
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,666
and I'm a... sexaholic.

207
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,965
Hi, Mel.

208
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:51,507
Thank you, Mel.

209
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:52,809
And,

210
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:55,290
would you like to introduce yourself?

211
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,645
Hi. My name's Cherien.

212
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,108
And I...

213
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,181
I'm just so goddamn horny.

214
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,691
Hi, y'all.

215
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:14,556
Hi, Cherien.

216
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,770
All right, settle down now.
Settle down.

217
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:27,453
So there I was in the cockpit,

218
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:28,920
workin' my magic.

219
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:30,228
Wait a minute,

220
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:33,691
you gave a handjob to a pilot
while he was on duty?

221
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,894
It's not like no one else
was flying the plane

222
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:38,815
'cause, you know,
the co-pilot was there, too.

223
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,501
Luckily, I'm ambidextrous.

224
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:45,776
I guess that makes you a member
of the mile-high club.

225
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:48,333
Look who's talking,
mr. "I like 'em young."

226
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,787
Come on.
Don't remind me of that fact.

227
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:54,039
Come on, Rudy.
You don't have to be ashamed.

228
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,353
Everybody still loves you.

229
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:56,968
They don't.

230
00:10:57,262 --> 00:10:58,628
Not after that girl, they don't.

231
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:00,100
That little slut?

232
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,369
Whole world knows she set you up.

233
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:06,803
My ex-wife has everyone convinced
that I'm just a dumbass, horny loser.

234
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,480
A horny loser?

235
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,101
You're a baseball legend.

236
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,403
You are.

237
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:14,849
Yeah, I guess. I...

238
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,491
Who do you think built
Rudy's chili and fries?

239
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,849
That was my idea,

240
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:22,207
my hard work, my business savvy,

241
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:25,333
and that damn judge,
he just gave her everything.

242
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:27,888
Well, it's your name on the sign.

243
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,636
- He gave her that, too.
- They did?

244
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:30,950
My own name.

245
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:32,791
She took everything.

246
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:35,876
Well, you still got your health...

247
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:40,588
And your money, right?

248
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,465
Yeah, I still got that.

249
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,204
But my family,

250
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:49,515
my teammates, my self-respect...

251
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:51,192
&I respect you.

252
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,224
- Shit.
- What? Is there a problem?

253
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:02,300
It's my ex,

254
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,669
makin' my life miserable.

255
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,382
Do you have kids?

256
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:07,737
Just Sammy,

257
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,783
who that bastard is trying to take away.

258
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:13,047
Posey did the same thing to me.

259
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,425
You got to fight him, Cherien.
Fight him.

260
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,090
Yeah. Everybody's saying, you know,

261
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:20,234
he's so smart, and
he's making money hand over fist.

262
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,363
He fights me on every penny.

263
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,368
I mean, he's doing a huge deal right now

264
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:27,693
that I happen to know is going to make
him even richer than he already is,

265
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:29,946
and he still wants to cut my alimony.

266
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:31,441
What does this guy do anyway?

267
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,212
Real estate developer.

268
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,441
We got married real young.

269
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:38,044
No, he couldn't deal with my problem.

270
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,671
I mean, can I help it if my needs
are more than he can handle?

271
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:44,489
Because I...

272
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,536
Controlling my lust...

273
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:48,788
Is a daily...

274
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,433
Hourly struggle.

275
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:58,474
I mean, temptation is everywhere.

276
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,048
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,614
I'm just finding this whole
abstinence thing

278
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:11,016
very, very challenging.

279
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:14,195
Cherien, I... I understand.
Me, too.

280
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,962
Guess I better call a cab.

281
00:13:22,314 --> 00:13:25,434
Got to go pick up the kid
from the dickhead.

282
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:29,765
Well, I can give you a ride.

283
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:31,571
Really?

284
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,835
I mean, you think it's safe
for us 'cause

285
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:37,934
I don't want to do nothin'
to trip us up.

286
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,359
We're both in the program, Cherien.
I just want to be your friend.

287
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:43,540
There's still so much to discuss.

288
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,394
Sammy falls asleep real easy.

289
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,567
I love kids.

290
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,799
Let's go.

291
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:05,379
Sam, mama's home!

292
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,455
I'm here to pick you up!

293
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,226
Hello to you, too.

294
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:10,657
Who's your friend?

295
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,258
None of your damn business.

296
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:13,484
Hey, mom,

297
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:14,856
I missed you.

298
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,962
Sam... antha,

299
00:14:19,694 --> 00:14:20,703
hi.

300
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:24,110
So this is my little girl.

301
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:27,207
And you better go get
your stuff, honey, cause

302
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,435
nice mr. Blue's gonna give us
a ride home.

303
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,226
Hey, I know you.

304
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:32,692
You're Rudy Blue.

305
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,194
You used to play for the Cubs.

306
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:35,977
And the A's and Royals and Rangers...

307
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:38,134
And the Mariners and the Angels
and the Braves.

308
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:41,026
My God. I am a huge fan.

309
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:44,686
Sammy and I, we order Rudy's chili
and fries probably three times a week.

310
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:46,023
Great, great. Thanks.

311
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,676
Rudy Blue in my own house

312
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,600
with my ex-wife.

313
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,268
Don't you listen to him, Rudy.

314
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,673
He's just tryin' to kiss your ass.

315
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,995
Where's my video?
You better find it because

316
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:58,426
I'm gonna burn this place down.

317
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:01,546
Instead of subjecting our guest
to your insanity,

318
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:05,054
perhaps we should deal with
our problems in private.

319
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,697
- Will you wait for me?
- Sure.

320
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:10,750
I'll just be a little bitty minute.

321
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:16,424
So sorry about this.
Help yourself to a drink.

322
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,239
Drinks in the kitchen.
Mi casa su casa.

323
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,280
Great. Thanks.

324
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,553
<i>You lost our Hawaii video?

325
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,054
<i>What do you care?

326
00:15:41,336 --> 00:15:42,661
<i>I'm naked in it!

327
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,045
<i>What do you think?

328
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,708
<i>You afraid I'm gonna put it
on the internet?

329
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:49,493
<i>Who would want to see you naked?

330
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,645
<i>Screw you!
You'd do it just to piss me off!

331
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,182
<i>Fine. Take it.

332
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,607
<i>You have it?

333
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:56,225
<i>I don't want it anyway.

334
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,559
<i>Just stop blogging about my sex drive.

335
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:04,620
Jesus Christ.

336
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:07,025
Are you really a baseball player?

337
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,394
Yeah. Well, I used to be.

338
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:11,581
My daddy is gonna buy a baseball team.

339
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:13,265
He is, huh?

340
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:16,373
Well, you know, baseball teams cost
an awful lot of money.

341
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:17,522
I know.

342
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:21,217
Once his new deal closes,
he's gonna be richer than God.

343
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:23,327
It's a secret, though.

344
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,864
I can't even tell mom.

345
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:28,074
<i>Hey, free country.
I can write whatever i want.

346
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:29,494
<i>Enough Cherien.

347
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,816
<i>One more stunt like that,
I'll sue your ass.

348
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:34,368
I am so sorry, Rudy, but

349
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:37,605
Doug and I still have a few things
to fight about like cats and dogs.

350
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,969
It may take a while.
Can I call you in the morning?

351
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,248
Thank you so much.

352
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,885
So what do you guys think?
Is he a gut guy or a research guy?

353
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,187
Gut guy.

354
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:03,730
You, guys, if he does even
a little bit of research on Doug Rich...

355
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,701
- He's gonna...
- He's gonna find Doug Rich,

356
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,047
a respectable lawyer, working
for a respectable real estate firm.

357
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:10,170
I don't understand why
we can't just call the guy.

358
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:12,639
No, baby, you never,
ever call the mark.

359
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:14,908
He's gotta call us.
We can't call him.

360
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:17,027
Gotta set the bait.
See, if he takes it,

361
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,301
then calls, he's the right guy,
and if he doesn't...

362
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,452
Then he's the wrong guy.
Never was the right guy.

363
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:24,560
And I think he's gonna call.
I think Rudy's the man.

364
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:25,795
You know...

365
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,862
Eat that.

366
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,727
Listen, he's just out of jail.

367
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:31,965
The man's got a lot to prove to people
that he's still worth something.

368
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:35,266
Yeah, and as much as
he wants into mom's pants,

369
00:17:35,934 --> 00:17:37,705
I think he wants in on this gig

370
00:17:38,174 --> 00:17:39,276
a little bit more.

371
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,065
I don't know, dad. It's a long shot.

372
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:43,458
We need children of little faith.

373
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:51,351
- Could be.
- No way.

374
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:52,475
Come on.

375
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:53,601
Come on.

376
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:05,678
I can do lunch.

377
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,599
No. Yeah, I know it.

378
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:10,364
I will meet you there.

379
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,469
I'll meet you there for lunch.

380
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,682
All right, I stand corrected.

381
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:21,345
My boobies are gettin' credit
for this one, I'm telling you.

382
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:23,714
You're pretty sly, Rudy,

383
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,901
snagging one of my business cards.

384
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,693
Well, I just thought we had
a few things in common.

385
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:31,378
Seems you know baseball, you know...

386
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:37,679
I don't know how to tell you this,
slugger, but she is

387
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:39,263
a nut case.

388
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,462
Well, she seemed pretty sweet to me.

389
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,473
If she wants you to do something,
you do it,

390
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,661
then she'll turn around,
she'll bite your head off,

391
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:46,794
you know?

392
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:48,045
The sex...

393
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,306
Sex was dangerous.

394
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:52,972
Really?

395
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:54,919
Different positions.

396
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,408
She loved to try out

397
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:00,095
many different positions, and she's...

398
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:04,194
She's doubled-jointed,

399
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:05,947
and I'm not,

400
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,856
So it was a challenge.

401
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:11,316
I shouldn't be talking about this.

402
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:13,643
But aside from the sex,

403
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:15,816
you know, everything else
was a catastrophe.

404
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,168
I mean, she lies like a rug,
she spends like sailor.

405
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:20,026
God, I know exactly what you mean.

406
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,689
My ex-wife, she takes so
much money from me.

407
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,137
I can't even live off
the interest anymore.

408
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:28,269
Must have been making the wrong
investments, my friend.

409
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,457
Is that why you asked me to lunch?

410
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:38,316
Well, you know, I heard
you had something going.

411
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:41,042
You're into real estate, right?

412
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,754
I love the land, Rudy.

413
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,253
So what exactly is this deal?

414
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:49,361
Did she tell you about Edenfalls too?

415
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:51,765
It wasn't Cherien. It was...

416
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:53,912
You don't need to cover for her.
She does this.

417
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:56,662
She thinks I'm gonna make a killing,
and she wants in on it.

418
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,099
And, sure, it's a good investment,
but it's closed.

419
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:01,483
Sorry.

420
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,524
How closed?

421
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:08,632
It's a tricky investment, Rudy.

422
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:11,353
You know, I can't open it
to inexperienced investors.

423
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:13,641
I've analyzed
a profitable opportunity.

424
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,189
We got to move fast.

425
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:19,347
I used to assess knuckle balls
in less than a second.

426
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:21,136
That fast enough for you?

427
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:22,866
Less than a second?

428
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:25,130
Come on.

429
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:34,267
The spotted crawfish.

430
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:36,483
The what?

431
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:39,533
It's an endangered species that lives
on a piece of prime real estate

432
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:41,275
about 60 miles north of here.

433
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,699
215 acres,

434
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:45,738
beautiful, lush, green land
just begging for concrete.

435
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:47,183
Sad sack who owns it

436
00:20:47,348 --> 00:20:49,553
is stuck with it for the last 30 years.

437
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:51,148
Point being?

438
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:53,154
Point being that in last 30 years,

439
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,163
the little spotters have gone crazy,
screwing all over the place.

440
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:59,171
Fish and wildlife no longer
need to protect them.

441
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:02,359
So now, the land could be developed.

442
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,118
They're lifting the restrictions
on monday.

443
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:10,179
How do you know that?

444
00:21:10,472 --> 00:21:12,208
Got someone on the inside.

445
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:13,804
How inside?

446
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:16,818
Under secretary of the interior inside.

447
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:21,465
So mr. S. Sack, who owns the land,
is now quite a happy man.

448
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:25,201
I bet he is. He's gonna be in
some serious cash on monday.

449
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:27,125
What?

450
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:28,849
He doesn't know about monday,

451
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,248
and on saturday, he's gonna sell
his land to me and my investors.

452
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,459
You make me one of those investors,
and I swear to God,

453
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:45,462
you can call it Rudy Blue
estates if you want to.

454
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,437
Cal, you're on the inside.
Di, you're on the inside.

455
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:55,308
Sammy, you're on the inside, too.

456
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,666
- Dad, who's on the outside?
- Does anybody else think

457
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:01,558
that the inside-outside problem is
just about the smallest one we have?

458
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,386
I hate doing this nympho routine.

459
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:07,196
- Don't laugh.
- I'm sorry.

460
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:10,291
It's just, I'm feelin' him up,
I'm all over him. It don't feel good,

461
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:13,357
and he's just about to put the moves
on me, and I can't really blame him.

462
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,359
Did you hear any of that? Okay, good.

463
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,479
Well, rub his back, and
remind him you're in the program.

464
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:22,081
I really need to figure something out
here. So we're gonna get some guy

465
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:25,645
to sell a bunch of fake land to you and
rudy and a bunch of other guys, right?

466
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,313
- Investors.
- Investors, yes. So the question is,

467
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:30,490
who are the investors? Who's the guy?

468
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:32,423
Who is anyone involved in this plan?

469
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:33,976
Who are the shills, dad?

470
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:36,153
This is a big operation.

471
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:37,635
We don't know any shills here.

472
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:40,505
The only people we know here
are the pool guy and Nina.

473
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,931
We got a pool guy?

474
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:45,128
What about the people
from the trailer park?

475
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:47,690
They would need the money.

476
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:50,981
- They're completely unskilled.
- They took 200 bucks off your dad.

477
00:22:51,081 --> 00:22:54,450
They live in a trailer park, you guys.
They have to act like millionaires.

478
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:56,968
- We act like millionaires.
- I will check them out,

479
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,703
but we gotta make it on saturday
'cause the office's empty.

480
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,553
It's not. Hugh works there on saturdays.

481
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:04,220
- We gotta get him out of there somehow.
- This is insane, dad.

482
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:06,570
- Why?
- Because we can't do this.

483
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:09,427
I mean, half a million dollars?
We don't even know what that means.

484
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:11,354
Look, the biggest thing
that we've ever done

485
00:23:11,454 --> 00:23:14,996
is sell bogus condos out of
that strip mall on myrtle beach.

486
00:23:15,112 --> 00:23:17,442
That was just a couple grand
for finders fees.

487
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,796
- We live in this house.
- I know, mom, but

488
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:25,225
people like us,
we don't make that kind of money.

489
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:27,858
People make money like this

490
00:23:27,993 --> 00:23:30,632
- all the time.
- But we don't know what we're doing.

491
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:33,362
I mean,

492
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:36,501
we're totally in over our heads here.
You know that.

493
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,062
So what?

494
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:41,625
We didn't know what we were doing
when we first came here.

495
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,323
Your dad needs our help, okay?
So we're gonna help him.

496
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,925
If he don't get this money, he's gonna
lose his job, and if he loses his job,

497
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:52,373
you're gonna lose this
sweet life you like so much.

498
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,955
So either we go or we stay,
but if we stay,

499
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,862
you gotta roll with it.

500
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,468
What the hell is that smell?

501
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:18,395
Oh, the rug cleaners were here.
They were spot testing.

502
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:20,533
They're gonna clean
the whole office tomorrow.

503
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:23,783
- Tomorrow's saturday, I gotta work.
- Well, you have to work at home.

504
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:26,672
No, I'm gonna work here,
Cherien, like I always do.

505
00:24:28,068 --> 00:24:30,225
Sure they can just work around you.

506
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,267
I don't think the chemicals'll be
too bad. What do they got goin' here?

507
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:35,140
"mono-tetrachloride,

508
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,336
sodium ozone phosphate, nitric

509
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:41,284
gastro-hydraulic-mercury."

510
00:24:42,323 --> 00:24:44,287
Ah, should be fine.

511
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:46,252
I'll let them know you'll be here.

512
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:53,357
Acting?

513
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:56,650
- What kind of acting?
- Are there gonna be cameras?

514
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:58,995
- I don't want cameras.
- Shut up, gerard.

515
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,690
There will be no cameras, gerard.

516
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:05,529
For the sum of $1,000 apiece,

517
00:25:06,145 --> 00:25:08,688
you'll be acting in a theatrical event.

518
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:11,461
You will be acting in a traing seminar.

519
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:14,081
- Like for emergencies?
- Like for emergencies.

520
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:19,032
Like for investments,
like for an emergency investment.

521
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,141
no questions asked.

522
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:22,470
No taxes,

523
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:23,780
no withholding,

524
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,602
no questions asked.

525
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:31,051
- Is that last part clear?
- Fine, but what's in it for us?

526
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:35,231
Money, gerard. Christ.

527
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,660
Look, how do we know
you'll come through?

528
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:42,393
Air force one.

529
00:25:42,493 --> 00:25:44,707
Keep it as collateral.

530
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:47,635
But no test drives, okay? It's on fumes.

531
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:49,756
Hang on.

532
00:25:50,736 --> 00:25:53,529
Excuse me, gentlemen, lady.

533
00:26:00,256 --> 00:26:01,335
What is it?

534
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:08,565
Holy crap!

535
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,915
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

536
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,053
My throat's closing up.

537
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:17,946
Should never have hired
those shithead rug cleaners.

538
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:25,037
What are you lookin' at?

539
00:26:40,368 --> 00:26:41,581
How are the investors?

540
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:45,511
A little scary, actually,
one of them particularly.

541
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,669
But mr. Blue called. Your friend,

542
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:50,943
he's worried about a losing streak,

543
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:55,122
so you better go round there and rub
his thighs and turn them into a fire.

544
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,542
Rudy, thank you so much for meeting me,

545
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,469
'cause I was shoppin', and

546
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,454
I almost pulled the store clerk into
the dressing room and made him...

547
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:03,860
You know... God!

548
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:07,597
Man, I really feel like
I can talk to you, you know?

549
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:09,669
And I feel like
I can talk you, too, Cherien.

550
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:12,999
Great, 'cause I need your help.
I haven't had sex in 14 hours.

551
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,466
It makes me kind of jittery, you know.

552
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:18,664
- Anyway, how are you?
- I'm good. Good.

553
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,821
I had lunch with Doug.

554
00:27:21,148 --> 00:27:22,574
My Doug?

555
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:24,829
We're gonna do
a little business deal together.

556
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:28,005
No, no. I do not know how
I feel about my boyfriend and

557
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,590
- my ex-husband doing deals together.
- Wait, I'm not your boyfriend, Cherien,

558
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:33,343
you know.

559
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:35,037
I mean, well, I would be.

560
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,774
I'm tempted. I'm really tempted.

561
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,085
Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right.

562
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,839
I keep forgetting. I forget we're
in program. We're program.

563
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:46,767
We don't... We don't think
about each other that way no more.

564
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:48,289
Right.

565
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,967
We've grown.

566
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:55,137
- It's a door we choose not to open.
- Right.

567
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,434
So, I figured it would be okay
to invest a little money with Doug.

568
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:01,704
Sure.

569
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,632
And... And... And here's the thing.

570
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:06,980
The thing is, I'd really like you to

571
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,352
come to the meeting with me.

572
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:13,474
What meeting?

573
00:28:13,762 --> 00:28:16,189
This little investor thing.

574
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,273
Truth is, uh...

575
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:24,221
My ex-wife made
all the big money decisions.

576
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,744
I tell people that she didn't, but

577
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:30,616
she really did.
She was very good at it, and...

578
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:33,804
Well, let's just say since the divorce,

579
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,117
I haven't exactly been hitting
them out of the park, you know?

580
00:28:37,228 --> 00:28:39,925
I even tried not changing
my socks for a while, but

581
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:45,935
anyway, I was thinking if
I had another smart,

582
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:48,940
really pretty woman
sittin' next to me...

583
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,045
Y'all don't need me.

584
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:57,300
A man of your accomplishments,
your achievements,

585
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,900
everything you've done on the field

586
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:02,790
and off,

587
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,273
you don't need anyone.

588
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:13,149
But I gotta say, there's nothin'
that turns me on more

589
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,865
than an accomplished, money-makin' man.

590
00:29:17,618 --> 00:29:19,082
Now, that's the truth.

591
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:22,473
So, rudy...

592
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:27,075
I would be so, so

593
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:29,117
honored...

594
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:31,178
To be with you.

595
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:36,089
Yes, rudy. Yes, I will go
to your meeting with you.

596
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:47,213
Pack this stuff up, everything in boxes.
Move this thing out here.

597
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:50,372
Okay, I want this table to the right,
this table around to the left.

598
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,992
- Whose left? His left?
- No, gerard, his left.

599
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:54,590
Just that way.

600
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:57,133
This one comes round here,
this one forms a line like this.

601
00:29:57,248 --> 00:30:00,098
Gonna create an amphitheater here.
This is opera.

602
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:02,294
Look, don't question me.
I am the director,

603
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,925
- and you guys are the actors, okay?
- Okay, honey,

604
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,679
you got a little vein poppin'
in your neck. You need to breathe.

605
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:11,100
Look, our test client is gonna be here
in an hour. You're just gonna sit quiet

606
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,570
- and playing millionaires.
- She's playing a millionaire?

607
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,238
- Shut the hell up, gerard.
- Okay, would you be quiet, please?

608
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:18,459
My stylist is gonna come,
you'll get nice clothes,

609
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,956
and you're gonna look like millionaires.
- She probably once blew a millionaire.

610
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:25,038
I love where we're going here,
but it's not helping.

611
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,737
this is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna be

612
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:32,204
mr. Balsam, heir to the balsam fortune.

613
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,592
Got it? Who are you?

614
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:38,155
- Nope.
- Mr. Balsam.

615
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:42,181
Fred, you're gonna be mr. Marsho,
all right?

616
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:44,434
- Of the marsho hedge fund.
- Marsho.

617
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,072
What's a hedge fund?

618
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,826
You know, when you keep
something in a hedge?

619
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,505
Well, imagine a fund in a hedge.

620
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:56,935
Imelda, I want you
to be signora Boiva, right?

621
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,248
Ceo of Argentina transmobile.

622
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,312
- How's your spanish?
- Oh, it's perfecto. Gracias, papito.

623
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:08,473
That's easy for you to say.
Uh, Cal, what you gonna be?

624
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:13,075
Dieter platter, german internet genius.

625
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:15,325
Yeah, a very quiet genius. Okay.

626
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,196
Olin. Where's Olin?

627
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:20,003
Olin, snap out of it!

628
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:22,604
You don't have to yell.

629
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:24,992
Olin, this is important.
You're a key player here.

630
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:27,833
You're mr. Abbott,
and you are the seller.

631
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:31,069
Aw, jesus, Wayne,
he is drunk off his ass.

632
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:34,440
- Olin, this is 9:00 in the morning.
- Just give me some coffee.I'll be fine.

633
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:37,079
No, he won't be. He's on a bender

634
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:40,083
- He's gonna wreck our whole show.
- What the hell do you care?

635
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:42,144
I care because I'm a professional.

636
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,186
A professional gas station attendant.

637
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:47,364
I'm a musician, you two-bit whore!

638
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:53,000
Mr. Blue just called. He's on his way.
He'll be here at 10:00.

639
00:31:56,241 --> 00:31:58,176
Okay, everybody,
remember what I'm saying.

640
00:31:58,311 --> 00:32:00,696
Do this, work things out,
help me here, okay?

641
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,029
Everybody help me.

642
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:04,880
Put those in there. And, sweetheart,
please don't steal anything.

643
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:07,018
- It won't fit down your tube top.
- All right.

644
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:09,657
Olin, snap out of it!

645
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:12,546
You do not have to yell.

646
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:18,253
- Take those off, try these.
- You are lookin' good, olin.

647
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,298
- I think I need more concealer shit.
- He's good, isn't he?

648
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:23,126
Oh, yeah, he's the best.

649
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:25,222
Okay, imelda, honey,
you got to come out.

650
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:26,898
- He's gonna be here any minute.
- No,

651
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,306
- they're gonna laugh at me.
- No one will laugh at you.

652
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:32,640
Okay, the thing to rember,
at the right time,

653
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,671
do not forget to
take out your cell phones.

654
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:37,366
Ferrari, 2 o'clock.

655
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:39,581
- He's here!
- All right, places, come on, people

656
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:43,819
- Imelda, come out!
- All right, keep your hair on.

657
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:50,079
You say anything,
I'll rip your friggin' head off.

658
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,301
Imelda, tattoo.

659
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,274
Rudy, good to see you.

660
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:07,393
So you want in on this after all?

661
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:11,110
Yeah, well, I'm thinkin' yeah,
yeah, probably. I, uh...

662
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:15,204
Abbott's here. He is so glad
to be unloading this land.

663
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,110
You sure you want to do this?

664
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,751
Because i will happily put in
another 500 grand for your share.

665
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,813
Hello, rudy. Sorry I'm late.

666
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:25,951
What are you doing here?
This is invitation only.

667
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,877
I was invited.

668
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:29,803
Right, rudy?

669
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:35,205
Hey, you are bringing a date
to a limited partnership offering?

670
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,229
He's not my date. He is my sponsor.

671
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:43,256
Mr. Abbott is getting very impatient.
He says he has a 2:00 charity function.

672
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:45,009
Thank you, Di... Helen.

673
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:48,553
This way.

674
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,540
You know, I'd really like it if
she could be here, if you don't mind.

675
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:56,257
I promised I'd look after her. You know,
she's horny as a toad, that one.

676
00:33:56,392 --> 00:33:59,165
Well, it's your funeral. You've got a...

677
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,116
So, mr. Abbott,

678
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:06,863
I think you'll find the price of three

679
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,269
million dollars is more than fair,

680
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:12,874
and I strongly suspect that
you will find it very difficult

681
00:34:12,997 --> 00:34:15,077
to get that price from any other buyer,

682
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,618
especially considering

683
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:19,103
that your land has endangered species

684
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,741
zoning restrictions,

685
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:26,364
and that no development
is possible upon your land.

686
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:30,303
I know the development is one
of the things you were hoping for.

687
00:34:33,746 --> 00:34:37,213
That development was one of your hopes.

688
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:43,413
- Mr. Abbott!
- Yes, yes, I had hoped

689
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:44,822
to develop...

690
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:48,328
- Alas.
- Alas, yes.

691
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:51,690
So, therefore...

692
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,969
As environmentally,
socially conscious, aware people,

693
00:34:57,103 --> 00:35:00,012
we believe that your land
would be perfect

694
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,381
for a bird sanctuary,

695
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:06,349
named after yourself,
the abbott aviary habitat.

696
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:09,720
And not only that,
we will build a visitors center

697
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:13,108
for this bird sanctuary,
which will be called the abbot

698
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:16,636
aviary habitat visitors center.

699
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:19,178
Whoever can say that
quickly will win an award.

700
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:21,335
This is the idea, this is the scope

701
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:23,592
of what we wanna do
with your beautiful land,

702
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:27,827
We will buy your land for twice
what you paid for it in 1974.

703
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:31,583
So, mr. Abbott, what do you say?

704
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:34,762
Well,

705
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,231
I... yes, I might as well sell.

706
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,695
Excellent.

707
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:43,526
Now, if you could just
sign the contract.

708
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:50,615
You look so rich.

709
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:55,507
There you go. It's all yours.

710
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:58,992
Thank you, mr. Abbott.
You just follow helen here.

711
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:00,915
This way, mr. Abbott.

712
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:04,681
- Hey, can I just ask one thing?
- I'm afraid we have notime to question.

713
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:08,311
- Thank you, and...
- Aren't you rudy blue?

714
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,391
Yep, that's me.

715
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:14,146
Shit the bed, I thought so.
I thought that you...

716
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,701
You know, I got to tell you,
you are my favorite player of all time.

717
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,646
- Thank you.
- Enough of that, mr. Abbott.

718
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:22,075
But, my God, man,

719
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:25,617
and I say this from my heart,

720
00:36:25,752 --> 00:36:29,874
you have got to lay off
that underage pussy.

721
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:33,404
Baby.

722
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,557
Hey, look, can't I just stay and watch?

723
00:36:39,673 --> 00:36:42,273
Look, you just sold three millions
dollars with the land, buddy.

724
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:44,214
You don't stand around
and watch after that.

725
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:47,719
I know, but if I can get
his autograph, I can sell it on ebay.

726
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:51,147
This will cover the autograph.

727
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:55,366
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

728
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:59,813
say goodbye to the abbott
aviary habitat visitors center,

729
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:03,437
and say hello to Edenfalls II.

730
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:05,940
Edenfalls II...

731
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:08,907
144 luxury homes

732
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,869
in a garden setting

733
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,607
with a gated community around you.

734
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:16,400
Gated, of course,
to keep out the riffraff.

735
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:19,595
A safe, secure community,

736
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,428
a safe, secure investment.

737
00:37:22,602 --> 00:37:25,260
And you're sure the protection
is gonna be lifted on monday.

738
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:26,493
I'm sure as sure.

739
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:29,325
I happen to have some photos
of mr. Undersecretary

740
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,135
underneath his secretary,

741
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:34,217
and so we are assured of his assurance.

742
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:35,431
I'm in.

743
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:37,896
Sounds good.

744
00:37:38,012 --> 00:37:40,417
Very good. Now, if you
could just turn to the red folder,

745
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:43,115
the limited partnership
agreement and sign that,

746
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,022
that would be wonderful.

747
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:52,750
Baby?

748
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:04,057
- Is there a problem?
- No. Rudy? There's no problem.

749
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:07,530
There's no problem, is there?

750
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:13,116
It's extortion. It's illegal.

751
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:17,007
- It's only a little illegal.
- Yeah, but it's illegal.

752
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:21,205
I just got out of jail.
I... I can't do stuff like this.

753
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:25,040
If we've done that,
then if you could please

754
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:29,605
and transfer the money
into the Panco account.

755
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:41,133
Please make the transaction.

756
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,315
Yes, please, wire the money.

757
00:38:46,431 --> 00:38:48,839
No, I don't understand why
this is so difficult for you.

758
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:53,365
Thank you. 6-6-5-9-6-5.

759
00:38:56,851 --> 00:39:00,646
Please sign. Please.

760
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,944
Banco rio dinero?

761
00:39:15,524 --> 00:39:18,914
Transfer 500,000 to Panco, inc.

762
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:22,631
Yes, 1-1-3-5-6.

763
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,172
Gracias.

764
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:30,328
"rudy blue."

765
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,105
Thank you so much.

766
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:37,166
Nobody move.

767
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:39,188
Robert Chin, FBI.

768
00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:42,577
You are all under arrest for conspiracy
to commit real estate fraud.

769
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:43,929
Who is this? What's going on?

770
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:46,683
- You didn't tell me there'd be cops.
- Everyone calm down.

771
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:48,357
Agent chin, We can work something out.

772
00:39:48,457 --> 00:39:50,105
Yeah. I've got it all on tape

773
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:52,047
You are all looking at 30 to life.

774
00:39:52,644 --> 00:39:54,974
What did you get me into?
I'll be deported!

775
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:57,091
- I'll go to jail!
- Sit down! Back! Get back!

776
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:59,674
You wont take me to jail!

777
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:07,182
Jesus, he's dead.

778
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,438
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Holy crap.

779
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:14,907
- You killed an fbi agent.
- I didn't mean to. I... I panicked.

780
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:17,907
- Forget it. We're out of here.
- No, no, no. God! Help me.

781
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:21,586
You can help us.
Come back. Just help us here.

782
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:24,234
Rudy, you'll help us.
No. This is gonna go viral.

783
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,141
No one has to know you were ever here.

784
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:28,238
- He got all on tape.
- We'll destroy the tape.

785
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,319
- We'll destroy the body.
- Are you insane?

786
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:32,690
We won't destroy the body.
No, no, destroy it.

787
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,645
No, baby, don't go, please. I need you.

788
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:37,603
- What if one of them tells?
- No they can't,

789
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:41,015
- they're accessories to murder
- Accessories to... Holy mother of shit!

790
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:44,194
- Listen, I want my money back.
- You can't get the money back.

791
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,718
It's in Panco already. But it's a very
good investment. 32% over two years.

792
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:49,527
I'm a silent partner, you understand?

793
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:51,859
For all you know, I'm still in prison.

794
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:56,540
- Oh, jesus, I could go back to prison.
- Rudy, I love you.

795
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:59,063
Oh, stay away from me, both of you!

796
00:40:59,178 --> 00:41:01,085
Rudy, rudy. Call me.

797
00:41:01,201 --> 00:41:04,071
- It's not as bad as it seems.
- Get away!

798
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,969
You died so well.

799
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:22,529
Very good, bob.

800
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:24,859
That is the end of
the emergency training program,

801
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:27,305
and I think we really learned
something here today.

802
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:29,039
- That was so great.
- Very good.

803
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:32,313
How was it? I thought maybe
I came in a little early, and

804
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,682
I think I could have been stronger
on that second line.

805
00:41:34,798 --> 00:41:37,298
It was very good. It was... It was real.

806
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,260
It was very precise.
You were in the moment.

807
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,362
Your intentions were good.
That's the main thing.

808
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:43,777
- Something for yourself.
- These seminars are so great.

809
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,678
I don't get a lot of opportunities
to practice my craft.

810
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,935
- So you all can come next week?
- Uh, that would be?

811
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,782
Cats. I play Bustopher Jones,

812
00:41:52,921 --> 00:41:55,213
community playhouse on lake street
this saturday night.

813
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:58,371
- All right, great.
- Oh, hey, bob.

814
00:41:58,506 --> 00:42:01,934
Next week with the pool,
a little less chlorine.

815
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:03,764
Sure thing, mrs. Rich.

816
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:05,421
Hey, thanks.

817
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,986
Oh my God!

818
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:13,858
Holy shit.

819
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:17,016
We just made half a million dollars.

820
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:19,018
Panco just made half a million dollars.

821
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:21,909
We didn't make a thing. That's great.

822
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:25,183
Good for Panco. We were really good.

823
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:27,533
- I was really good.
- No, I was better.

824
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:30,076
- But I was good.
- I did a lot of stuff.

825
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:38,835
Next time we should keep the money.

826
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:40,376
You think?

827
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:42,302
Well,

828
00:42:43,824 --> 00:42:46,328
I wouldn't have to pretend
to be a lawyer.

829
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:51,759
You wouldn't have to pretend to do
whatever it is he wants you to do.

830
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:53,858
Well...

831
00:42:56,517 --> 00:42:58,289
You got a job.

832
00:42:58,982 --> 00:43:00,523
I got a job.

833
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:04,164
The kids are in school.

834
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:08,344
We live here now.

835
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,636
We do?

836
00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:12,774
Yeah.

837
00:43:19,092 --> 00:43:21,096
So what do we do now?

838
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:25,025
- I thought you knew.
- No.

839
00:43:26,122 --> 00:43:27,798
Do you know?

840
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,689
Rudy blue, rudy blue is your guy.

841
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:33,596
It did take two days,

842
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:37,468
but, ultimately, I persuaded him
that real estate is a solid investment.

843
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:41,243
You got rudy blue
to invest $500,000 in Panco.

844
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:44,114
Yes, but he wants to remain anonymous.

845
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:47,215
No publicity.
He's actually a very shy man.

846
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:49,083
I think he's becoming a recluse.

847
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,260
How'd you talk him into it, Doug?

848
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:54,495
I just persuaded him
that trust is an important thing.

849
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,537
That he should trust me.

850
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,293
You could sell the hair off a dog,
couldn't you?

851
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:02,411
You know, maybe I...

852
00:44:02,585 --> 00:44:05,589
Maybe I should make you a partner.
What the hell?!

853
00:44:05,705 --> 00:44:07,438
There's another one!

854
00:44:08,845 --> 00:44:12,023
- Looks like a blood stain.
- Oh, my gosh.

855
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,088
Those rug cleaners. I don't know
what they used, but it did not work.

856
00:44:16,203 --> 00:44:19,054
You should see over by my desk.
Hellacious mess.

857
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,868
You were right, Hugh. I never
should have hired them shitheads.

858
00:44:31,812 --> 00:44:34,701
All right then, back to work.

859
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:50,735
