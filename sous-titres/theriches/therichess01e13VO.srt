00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:03,603
<i>Previously on The Riches...

2
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,136
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:10,779
You want to pretend to be the dead guy?

4
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:12,960
You want to wear his suits,
and you want me to be his dead wife?

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,908
Do you really think dad has a plan?

6
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:17,364
He stole the money, ma lost the money,

7
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:20,050
and now we're here
in a dead guy's house.

8
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,390
Y'all aren't in the
witness protection program, are you?

9
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,054
'cause I've been thinking about it,
and it just doesn't quite make sense.

10
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:26,991
I don't want to put you on the spot.

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,193
What is going on?

12
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:31,542
You're my friend, Nina.

13
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:33,071
I would never lie to you about that.

14
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:35,956
I went to taos, did some spirit shit,
cleaned myself right out.

15
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:39,494
- And there you met, uh...
- That's Geegee, and she's a dancer.

16
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,073
A miracle happened.

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,236
I fell in love, and I married her.

18
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:48,972
We have a lot to talk about, my friend.

19
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:52,259
Dad, we have to do somethin'. Dale came
here for us. He's not goin' anywhere.

20
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,741
Dale seems to have
been here for a while now.

21
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:57,111
He could've blown our cover
at any point, and he didn't.

22
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:58,778
- Why is that?
- He's Dale.

23
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:00,355
He's workin' an angle.
I don't know.

24
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:03,276
Doug is a republican.
His best friend is Pete.

25
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,445
Pete's a mortgage broker from dallas.
He's e-mailed twice about a golf trip.

26
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,614
Hi. Is, uh, Doug here?

27
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,551
Doug who?

28
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:15,755
Guess you're probably surprised
to see me here, Wayne.

29
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,579
You and I both know
you're not Doug Rich,

30
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:22,572
though everyone here
seems to think you are.

31
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:24,364
Who are you?

32
00:01:24,527 --> 00:01:27,254
And where the hell is
my best friend Doug Rich?

33
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:34,529
Who are you?

34
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,054
Look, don't get upset.

35
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,760
I thought you were my guardian angel.

36
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:40,754
There's a rational
explanation for all of this.

37
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,188
Hey, there, little fella.

38
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:15,029
Come on, davey, quit playin' around.

39
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:22,301
- Is that a real gun?
- Is it?

40
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:29,248
Where's Doug?!

41
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:35,986
There you are.

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,200
Now, what's all this I hear
about you shootin' folks with guns?

43
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,022
Now, you go back to my
office and wait till I get there.

44
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,797
Don't go postal on me now.

45
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:48,228
Oh! Got you where it counts.

46
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,085
Well, he's a good kid, really.

47
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,812
- Who the hell is he?
- He's geegee's.

48
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,126
It's a long story.
Hugh Panetta.

49
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:01,536
Hugh Panetta, Pete Mintzy,
an old friend.

50
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,198
He's a little depressed,
a little unstable.

51
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,844
Seems like a freak.

52
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,627
Good luck.

53
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:15,756
- I'm not your friend.
- I understand how you feel.

54
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:18,817
You fraud.
You told me you were a shrink.

55
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,618
- I wanted to help you.
- I don't want your help. I want Doug.

56
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:22,732
All right.

57
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,168
Can you just give me 30 seconds?

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,884
- Are you out of your freakin' mind?
- I gotta clean myself up.

59
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:30,306
It looks like someone's hit
me with a bat, for God's sakes.

60
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,093
Just wait.
I'll be right here.

61
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:44,528
Baby, I'll be there soon.

62
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:47,788
- Nina just came over for some tea and
- Pete's here. He knows.

63
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,818
<i>Skaal krush.

64
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:51,495
<i>Skaal krush.

65
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:52,712
<i>Skaal krush.

66
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,280
I am not some jackass
you can all push around.

67
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,590
I'm not waiting on any...

68
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:59,891
What's wrong with this guy? I got a kid
here! He doesn't need to hear this shit!

69
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,372
It's all right.
I'm... It's under control.

70
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:10,578
Do you want to know who I am?

71
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,135
Don't give me that montpierre shit,

72
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:14,774
or I will go in there and
tell everyone you're an impostor.

73
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,636
I'm gene.
Gene morrongiello.

74
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:20,158
I'm a lawyer, just like Doug.

75
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,040
He contacted me a few months ago.
He asked me to do this.

76
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,304
- He asked you to pretend to be him?
- Yes!

77
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,799
I know how it sounds.

78
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,958
Go do his job, live in his house.

79
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,702
I had a million questions,

80
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:34,221
but he paid me to keep
those questions to myself.

81
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:37,751
- Why?
- I don't know.

82
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:41,328
Pete, I just don't know.
Life is a mystery.

83
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:42,894
But what it comes down to,

84
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:46,777
was that a man, a human being,
need help.

85
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,209
Prove it.

86
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:49,593
Which part?

87
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,145
How do I know you're gene moron...
Or whatever your name is?

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,018
- I need to talk to him.
- I don't know where he is.

89
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,063
- You said you knew!
- I mean metaphysically.

90
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,378
- I know where he's at.
- You're lying.

91
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:13,791
You know where he is,
and you're not telling me.

92
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:17,462
Either that, or something's wrong,
and I better call the police.

93
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:22,192
Jesus, Pete, I'm not
supposed to tell you this.

94
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:25,106
Doug told me not to.

95
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:27,687
He's in hiding.

96
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,763
I don't know where he is,
but I know how to contact him.

97
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,343
and I will take you to him.

<i>Waiting for Dogot</i>

105
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:17,470
Get your brother and sister and get out.
Pete's back. Skaal krush.

106
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:24,087
- What are you holdin' there, Dahlia?
- Oh, nothin'.

107
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:27,220
- Shit. I'm sorry, Nina.
- Honey, I don't need your "sorry."

108
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,258
doesn't take a rocket scientist
to know somethin's up.

109
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,862
Look me in the eye
and tell me what it is.

110
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:35,284
- I can't.
- Are you in trouble?

111
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:37,772
- Well, let me help.
- You can't, okay?

112
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,885
Best thing you can do is
just walk out the door right now and

113
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:44,175
pretend like you don't know me.
Pretend... Everything's all right.

114
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,380
All right?

115
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,603
Nina, I love you.
Get out.

116
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:00,672
- Which is your car? You can follow me.
- What do you take me for,

117
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,744
- a complete idiot? I'm going with you.
- I'm just trying to be helpful.

118
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:07,107
Why do we have to go back to your house
anyway? Why can't we call Doug now?

119
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:09,630
That is the important question.

120
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:12,096
I've got to make the
call from the home phone.

121
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,666
If I don't, it's a signal
to Doug that there is a problem.

122
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:17,545
If I leave a coded message
for Doug from my home phone,

123
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:21,159
he will know it is clear,
and he will call me back, okay?

124
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,272
And then I can talk to him?

125
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,786
That's the other important question.
Doug expressly wished

126
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,243
- that no one talk to him on the phone
in case it's tapped. - Forget this.

127
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:36,601
I'm going to the police.
No, don't freak out on me here

128
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,972
because then we go and meet him.
That's what you wanted

129
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,729
to look him in the eye.
That's what you said.

130
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:48,221
Gene, there's somethin' about you.

131
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:54,136
Jesus Christ!
What the hell?!

132
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:06,774
I am so sorry about that.

133
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:13,662
That's not a problem,
sir, don't worry about it.

134
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,312
No problem?
I scraped up your whole rear end.

135
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:18,922
- Just get his insurance information.
- Listen to the man.

136
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,209
I'm Greg, Greg Buffer.
How you doin' there? How's your neck?

137
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:26,374
We gotta go, Greg,
so, uh,

138
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:29,629
- don't worry about the damages.
- Well, I can't let you go without

139
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:33,016
payin' you for that rear end.
That would be un-american.

140
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:37,161
- Oh, darn it. I thought I had
some cash. - I said it'll be all right.

141
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:39,912
Jeez, your associate's
a little uppity here.

142
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:43,167
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm a handyman by trade.

143
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:46,410
How about I come over,
take a gander at your house,

144
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:50,242
and we'll see how I can help.
We'll barter, know what I mean?

145
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:54,139
Well, we're in a bit of a hurry here.
Now is not a good time.

146
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:58,377
Well, then, I will come by tonight,
and we'll work out our arrangement here.

147
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,191
- I'll take a bottled mochaccino.
- Maybe later, mama.

148
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:09,662
- Ain't you sleepy?
It's time for your nap. - I'm thirsty.

149
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:12,675
- I made some calls.
- Well, there's water in your room.

150
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:15,485
- Hello!
- I'm thirsty!

151
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:18,557
Jesus, mama!

152
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:20,941
Louise?

153
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:27,693
- We have a visitor. - Well, what
happened to you there, sweetheart?

154
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:34,029
Pete knows everything.

155
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,836
- He knows everything?
- I mean, the whole arrangement.

156
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:42,818
- Our whole arrangement.
- Whole enchilada, everything.

157
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:46,984
I mean, I told him Doug
gave us specific instructions

158
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:49,348
he's not to be contacted,

159
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:52,489
ever,
by anyone.

160
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,045
Great.
Way to go, Gene.

161
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:03,390
Louise, the man was understandably
about to contact the police.

162
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:04,891
It is okay.

163
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:07,668
I understand.
He wanted to see his friend.

164
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,034
He loves his friend.
It is understandable, and,

165
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:14,008
- Pete, honey, we're on your side.
- You tricked me.

166
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,794
- You toyed with me.
You were never on my side. - Yeah.

167
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,053
Go get the number, please.

168
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:21,795
Pete, sweetheart,

169
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,821
I'm so sorry we lied
to you, okay?

170
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,105
I know you're stressed,
and what you need is a beer.

171
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:30,556
- I don't drink beer.
- What you need is a wine cooler, okay?

172
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:00,391
- I was just...
- You don't have to explain.

173
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:04,165
I know you don't trust us,
and I wouldn't trust us, either.

174
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:11,194
- It's real tasty.
- I like...

175
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,505
I like raspberry.

176
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,500
Yeah, well, we only got wild berry mist.

177
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,451
- Go ahead. It's good.
- Come on, Pete,

178
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:20,291
you don't want any
of that wild berry shit.

179
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,645
- Yeah, I don't care.
- I'll fix you a glenlivet.

180
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,802
I said, I don't give a shit!

181
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:27,307
Now, find the number and call my friend!

182
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:28,709
Okay, Pete, I have the number.

183
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,038
Phone's just charging
up an extra couple of minutes.

184
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:33,249
Won't take me any longer
to make you a drink.

185
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:43,198
- Why is this always your plan?
- Because it works.

186
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,900
He would be out for a couple of hours,
which would give us enough time to

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,893
grab our shit, cover our tracks,
and get the hell out of here.

188
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:51,408
We are not giving up.
We are not cutting and running.

189
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,440
Oh, yeah?
What are you proposing?

190
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:55,582
I have another plan.

191
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:56,786
What is it?

192
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,812
What is your plan?

193
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,751
It's developing now.

194
00:12:02,946 --> 00:12:04,781
It's germinating.
Just...

195
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:07,934
I can cool this guy.
You give me enough time, I can cool him.

196
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,755
- Don't go for the roofie yet.
- Wayne,

197
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:13,278
he wants to see his friend.
He wants to see dead Doug.

198
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,394
How are you gonna give him that?

199
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:20,203
- Phone's ready!
- I don't need the blow-by-blow.

200
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:24,130
Yes, you do. You need to absolutely
understand what is gonna happen here.

201
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,196
I am gonna call into a voicemail system.

202
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:30,749
You cannot talk.
You cannot make a sound.

203
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,980
If he even suspects that
someone else is in the room,

204
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,821
he will not call back.
He will not make contact with us.

205
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,185
Do you understand? There's an important
set of rules that have to happen here.

206
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,200
Now, can you do this?

207
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,587
Now, there is a code.

208
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,601
The code is a song...

209
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:52,122
that I must sing into the phone.
It's what Doug wanted.

210
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:55,505
Absolute silence.
I will make the call.

211
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:06,967
aaaaaa-mazing grace...

212
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:11,481
how sweet the sound...

213
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:19,622
that saved a wretch like meeee...

214
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:27,919
I once was lost...
but now am found...

215
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:36,157
was blind, but now can see...

216
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:43,138
What happens now?

217
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,249
Now we wait.

218
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:58,167
So how long do we wait?
How long does it take for Doug to,

219
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:00,020
- you know...
- Make contact?

220
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,078
Well, it depends.

221
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:05,773
'cause one time,

222
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:09,394
it only took him an hour
to call us back. Right, honey?

223
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:12,905
True, though,
another time, he almost took two days.

224
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:15,173
Look, I like you guys.

225
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:18,405
I'm a trusting person.
It's my nature.

226
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:20,508
I mean, I'm a messed-up person, but I...

227
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,542
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't say that about yourself.

228
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:26,529
You're not a messed-up per...
We're all messed up.

229
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,937
Well, what's wrong with being trusting?

230
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:31,208
I, myself, am the exact same way.

231
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:33,646
Now, Gene here, he doesn't trust a soul.

232
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:35,822
You tell me somethin',

233
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,815
you open your heart to me,
I'm right there.

234
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:42,858
You and me are a lot alike, Pete.

235
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:47,289
So...

236
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,613
how long do we wait?

237
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:52,650
It's like when you love someone,
and you...

238
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,793
go out on a limb with them,

239
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:59,289
and then, they take you to heaven,
or they take you to hell...

240
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:04,565
- And sometimes you can't tell the
difference. - Yeah...

241
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:07,394
but how long do we wait?!

242
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,632
We don't know, Pete.
Your guess is as good as ours.

243
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:15,098
If he doesn't make contact tonight,
I'm calling the authorities.

244
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,455
If he doesn't call tonight,
I'm calling the authorities,

245
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:19,782
and we will get them to call you.

246
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:21,805
- Call me?
- At your hotel.

247
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,083
Oh, Pete's not goin' anywhere, Gene.

248
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:31,126
No, Pete's here till the bitter end.

249
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:32,959
Ain't you, Pete?

250
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,728
- Are you hungry, Pete?
- As a matter of fact, I am, Louise.

251
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:43,389
Well, okay.

252
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:56,379
Do you play scrabble?

253
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:58,523
I... don't.

254
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,480
Hey, why are you foldin' those?
We're not even taking 'em.

255
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,185
- It's important, Cal.
- What's important?

256
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:08,778
How we leave things behind.

257
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:14,886
Hey, Sam, what are you doin'?
We need your help.

258
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,490
- I have to finish my homework.
- Sam,

259
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:18,672
this is it, okay?
Skaal krush.

260
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,338
I'm not going anywhere.

261
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:22,986
I'm a conscientious objector.

262
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:24,546
You're a what?

263
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,625
You don't get to be a
conscientious objector.

264
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,578
You didn't talk to
him about this yet, did you?

265
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:31,798
I can't do it, Cal.

266
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:34,160
I mean, look, he works
on this thing every single day.

267
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:36,414
- You have to talk to him.
- We can't leave this here.

268
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:39,092
We have to paint over it.
He's not gonna listen to me.

269
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:41,159
- I need your help.
- It's gonna crush him, Cal.

270
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,364
We don't have a choice.

271
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,529
You don't know that.
I mean, there's still hope.

272
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,842
Dad's got a plan.

273
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,778
No, there is no plan.
He has no plan.

274
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,036
He just finished singing
"amazing grace" to a dead guy

275
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,092
and as far as I get it,

276
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,863
we're now waiting for
the dead guy to call us back.

277
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:56,960
- Mom knows what's going on.
- Mom's got a fridge full of roofies, d.

278
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,851
Come on,
how sophisticated a plan is that?

279
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,540
What in this situation is hopeful, Di?

280
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:05,523
I have a right to hope, Cal.

281
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:07,763
You can't take that away from me.

282
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:19,803
- Biscuit?
- I don't like biscuits.

283
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:22,847
Louise, the man doesn't like biscuits.
Do we have any bread or crackers?

284
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:25,248
I don't eat carbs.
I'm on a diet.

285
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:28,173
I usually just have a protein shake.
I guess I should've told you that.

286
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,005
What about just
havin' some mac and cheese?

287
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,516
Mac and cheese?
Mac and cheese, it's all carbs.

288
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,739
Don't you know the difference
between proteins and carbs?

289
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:36,530
What the hell, Pete?
Live a little.

290
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:40,003
I would like a protein shake
or some kind of protein substitute.

291
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:42,357
We don't have protein substitute.

292
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:45,522
This is a biscuit.
Goddamn eat one.

293
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:51,920
Jesus, no wonder Doug's in hiding.

294
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:30,731
I made it.

295
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,379
It's a part of me now.

296
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:35,886
I'll tell you a secret, lamar.

297
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:38,866
Things, people,

298
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:43,528
they're around a
lot longer than we think.

299
00:18:44,214 --> 00:18:46,584
Life takes from you.

300
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,915
It's taking right now,

301
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,364
yet it's still there...

302
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,420
Underneath.

303
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,919
I hate to wait.
Sometimes, I...

304
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:01,054
feel like that's
all I do is

305
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:04,455
wait for something that'll never come.

306
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,646
Oh, it'll come,

307
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:07,966
what we're all waitin' for.

308
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:09,631
She means death, Pete.

309
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:12,406
Why are you telling me death will come?

310
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,036
I'm not waiting for death.

311
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,675
- Well, don't take it personally.
- No, no, no, but, you know,

312
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,769
all I said
was that I hate to wait,

313
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:22,291
and you tell me
I'm gonna die?

314
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,693
She's putting it in perspective.

315
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:26,285
Waiting's not so bad when
you compare it with death,

316
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,628
that kind of thing...
Things like that.

317
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:32,051
- You ever read the bible, Pete?
- The bible? Yeah.

318
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:33,491
Not every word, but...

319
00:20:33,643 --> 00:20:35,344
The bible talks a lot about waitin'.

320
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,760
There's this one line that says,

321
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:40,441
"those who wait shall
inherit the earth."

322
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:43,186
very famous line.
Very powerful line.

323
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,567
And I believe it to mean patience pays.

324
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:49,194
I thought it was "the meek."

325
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:51,303
what about the meek?

326
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,250
Who inherit the earth.

327
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,450
No, the meek inherit shit, Pete.

328
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:02,215
The meek never inherited nothin'.

329
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:06,362
You been a victim of a crime, louise?

330
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:08,766
I've been victimized.

331
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:13,840
Twelve times,
I've been mugged in my life,

332
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,705
which made me realize,

333
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:20,473
there are two kinds
of people in this world...

334
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:22,725
Victims...

335
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,321
And there are criminals.

336
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:30,664
What about the people who watch?

337
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,112
What about people who try to help?

338
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:36,784
What about the people

339
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,869
who do the cpr?

340
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:48,760
- Pete, what's wrong?
- People in your life...

341
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,400
You think you'd know them.

342
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,309
- You count on them.
- I know.

343
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,628
I know.

344
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,065
You count on certain rules to live by,

345
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:03,881
a certain order to depend upon.

346
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:06,244
"how could Doug do
that?" you ask yourself.

347
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,699
"who leaves a house?

348
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:09,244
Who leaves your life?"

349
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,130
and, I mean,
wherever Doug and Cherien are right now,

350
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,057
no one knows them there.

351
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:17,966
No one cares about them.

352
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:29,743
Without an identity.

353
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:33,529
I just miss 'em so much.

354
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:36,024
Oh, shh, Pete. It's okay.

355
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:38,331
Look, Pete, wherever they are,

356
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:40,552
you've got to believe
they're happy there.

357
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,294
Like you can speak for Doug.

358
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:46,461
People are mysterious, louise.

359
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:49,121
- I think for Doug...
- You don't know Doug,

360
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:51,364
gene, so don't speak for him.

361
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:55,916
I think for Doug, the difference between
who he was and who he wanted to be

362
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,885
was maybe more than he could bear.

363
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,448
Pete, are you okay there, sweetheart?

364
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,559
No. Just, um...

365
00:23:08,823 --> 00:23:10,824
We have a bathroom.

366
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:12,429
For the love of God, Pete,

367
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,135
go relieve yourself. I mean,

368
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:16,669
what are me and louise gonna do?
Hightail it up in the hills

369
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:18,211
the three minutes you're in the john?

370
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:19,832
We're gonna be right here, sweetheart.

371
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,667
It's okay. You can pee.

372
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:25,320
I'm so crazy.

373
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:27,291
Of course, I can pee.

374
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:29,892
Back, kitchen, take a right.

375
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,369
I'll just be a minute.

376
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,641
- What the hell are you trying to do?
- It is over.

377
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,512
I am through torturing this poor man.
I'm goin' for the roofies.

378
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,719
No, it is not over.
You've got to think big here.

379
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,545
Oh, no, no, no.
I am tired of thinking big.

380
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,595
It is time to think small.

381
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:53,435
Oh, would you snap out of it?

382
00:23:53,537 --> 00:23:54,561
No, no, no, no, no.

383
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,792
No, I've got it.

384
00:23:58,614 --> 00:23:59,943
What? What are you talkin' about?

385
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,701
Go get Cal.
Get him to dial the house phone.

386
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,693
It's him.

387
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:55,064
What did she say?

388
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:56,958
I'm supposed to follow
dad and be his shill.

389
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,098
Okay, great, but what's the plan, Cal?

390
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:00,843
I don't know, Di. I'm followin' orders.

391
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,307
Well, maybe we don't have to leave,

392
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:03,793
and I don't have to pull
all this shit to the rv.

393
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:06,145
No, don't start thinkin' like that.
You remember what happened in Houston.

394
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:08,324
We got to be ready to leave on a dime.

395
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:09,616
Hi, there.

396
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,321
Hi.

397
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:14,593
A lot of garbage.

398
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,199
Yeah. Yeah, we really love garbage.

399
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,990
- It's a bad habit, I guess.
- Not even garbage day.

400
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:25,918
- What happened in houston?
- Nothin' happened in houston, ma'am.

401
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:27,348
The oil refineries.

402
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:29,825
Babies.

403
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:31,118
All right.

404
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:32,728
Let's get this shit to the rv.

405
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:35,205
- Oh, what rv?
- Listen, kiddies,

406
00:25:35,306 --> 00:25:36,748
I've seen your rv.

407
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:38,380
I know where it's parked.

408
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:41,735
So I can either call security
and get into this whole takin'

409
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:44,674
-out-the-garbage-on-non-
garbage-day business...

410
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:47,060
Or I can come with you and help.

411
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:51,665
Can you handle her? I got to go.

412
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,052
Damn it, you should have
let me pick up the phone.

413
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:01,214
Don't you understand? We made contact.

414
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:02,903
Three rings is a code.

415
00:26:02,982 --> 00:26:04,761
Three rings means he's ready,

416
00:26:05,053 --> 00:26:06,100
do you understand?

417
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,377
Okay, you want to do this?

418
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,501
Well, it's just...

419
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,134
It... It's... Do you want to do this?

420
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:13,791
Do you want to go and meet your friend?

421
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:14,903
We're driving?

422
00:26:15,017 --> 00:26:16,019
You want to walk?

423
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:17,302
Well, it's just...

424
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:19,654
It's dark out,

425
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,187
and I really... I hardly know you.

426
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:23,820
that's the point.

427
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:28,465
You hardly know Doug, we hardly know
you. Anyone hardly knows anyone.

428
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,363
What louise means is just relax

429
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:33,700
and trust us.

430
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:35,473
For God's sake, we trust you.

431
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,893
You're right.

432
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,066
- I'm being silly again.
- Yeah, you are.

433
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:43,732
I mean, you peed in the toilet,
we're all still here, ain't we?

434
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,226
- You're right.
- Come on. Doug's waiting.

435
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,090
Where are you taking me?

436
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:01,017
Doug will only meet in a remote spot.

437
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:16,765
Shit.

438
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:19,805
Hey, there, mrs...

439
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:21,409
Rich?

440
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:22,620
Can I come in?

441
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:27,630
I wasn't really askin'.

442
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:29,361
I was just bein' polite.

443
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:32,288
Well, come on in, then.

444
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,238
- You want a beer?
- Sure. Thanks.

445
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:58,759
Look at you,

446
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,687
livin' in this fancy house,

447
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:02,656
but you can't give up
your travelin' tricks.

448
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,565
I don't know what you're
talkin' about, Dale.

449
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,344
Come on. What did you slip in there?

450
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:08,850
Go on and have a little sip.

451
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,482
You don't want to get on my bad side.

452
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:12,804
- What do you want from us?
- They kicked me out,

453
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:14,577
our family.

454
00:28:15,787 --> 00:28:16,871
Took all my money.

455
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:19,264
All they left me was
daddy's pickup truck.

456
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:21,065
Aw. You look like
you're doin' fine to me.

457
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:23,204
Fine is far from it, sweetheart.

458
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,851
Well, what do you want from us, Dale?

459
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:27,454
You know what I want from you, d.

460
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:32,437
But aside from that,

461
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,125
I'll take a piece of your pie.

462
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:37,363
I mean, seriously,

463
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:39,853
what is your angle?

464
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,753
- There's no angle, Dale.
- Bullshit.

465
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:43,344
What is the con?

466
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,300
I mean, I got part of it figured out.

467
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:47,187
Fake name, phony I.d.

468
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:49,383
But this house?

469
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:51,944
How did you score this friggin' place?

470
00:28:52,057 --> 00:28:53,830
And the lawyer gig?

471
00:28:53,957 --> 00:28:55,575
How is Wayne spinnin' that?

472
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:56,800
Well, why don't you ask him?

473
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:59,037
That is what I'm plannin' to do,

474
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,613
mrs. Rich.

475
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:03,288
He's...

476
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:04,484
Busy.

477
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:07,102
He ain't gonna be back for a while.

478
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:08,552
I got all night.

479
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:11,295
Do you want me to use a coaster?

480
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:19,542
Doug, it's me! It's Pete!

481
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,876
Doug, where are you?

482
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,859
Doug! It's me! It's Pete Mintzy!

483
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:34,980
Where are you?!

484
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,133
Who sent you, Pete?

485
00:29:41,243 --> 00:29:43,594
W- what are you talking about?

486
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,155
So how you been, mrs. Rich?

487
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:50,183
- What, you're not talkin' to me now?
- Just tryin' to live my life here, Dale

488
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:51,929
And I am tryin' to be neighborly.

489
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,842
Well, neighbors come and neighbors go.

490
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:55,418
So why don't you go 'cause I told you

491
00:29:55,474 --> 00:29:57,275
Wayne is not gonna
be back here for a while.

492
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:59,572
And I told you, I am willin' to wait.

493
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:02,996
I know what you are.

494
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:05,506
I know why you're here.

495
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,443
I- I'm Pete.

496
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:09,018
Pete Mintzy.

497
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:18,971
You tell me who sent you,

498
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,336
or I will put a bullet in your skull.

499
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,171
Gene, I-I swear to you.

500
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:24,973
I have no idea what
you're talkin' about.

501
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:26,020
Just tell me!

502
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,146
Please don't hurt me.

503
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:30,117
Please don't hurt me.

504
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:14,815
Look!

505
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:18,677
Look, it's from Doug! He's saying
I'm innocent! Look at that!

506
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:24,604
Doug, it's me! It's Pete!

507
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,158
Where are you?!

508
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,850
Where are you?!

509
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:41,267
He's gone.

510
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:44,904
Gone?

511
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:46,334
He's afraid.

512
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:54,520
What are you doin'?

513
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,607
Gonna call the cops

514
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:57,110
to say I got intruders in my house.

515
00:31:57,189 --> 00:32:00,432
Your jailbird ass is gonna
call the cops on me?

516
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:02,728
You bet.

517
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:05,757
I'm mrs. Douglas Rich.

518
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:08,256
I'm married to mr. Douglas Rich.

519
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:10,328
I ain't afraid of local cops. Are you?

520
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,121
All right.

521
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,733
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

522
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:18,688
I don't mean you any harm.

523
00:32:19,362 --> 00:32:21,659
I think what y'all got
goin' here is beautiful.

524
00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:25,073
This Edenfalls, it's a heaven on earth.

525
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,910
You're wrong, Dale.

526
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,333
It ain't heaven on earth.

527
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:34,970
Will you go, please?

528
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:37,618
Well, not without a hug, cousin.

529
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,172
You tell that husband of
yours I'll be back around.

530
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,464
You okay? No broken bones?

531
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:05,499
What did you mean, who sent me?

532
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:07,722
What the hell is going on here?

533
00:33:08,794 --> 00:33:10,712
I understand you're upset.

534
00:33:12,018 --> 00:33:13,243
I will explain.

535
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:15,089
I trust you now.

536
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:17,233
Your friend Doug,

537
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:19,440
he witnessed a murder,

538
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:23,006
a brutal execution that
no one should have to see.

539
00:33:23,222 --> 00:33:25,320
He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

540
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,842
but he wanted to do the right thing,

541
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,571
so he went to the police.

542
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:31,760
But the trouble was,
it was an inside job.

543
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,317
Some bad cops wanted him gone, so

544
00:33:34,408 --> 00:33:36,938
Doug and Cherien, they went on the run.

545
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:39,433
This is where I come in.

546
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:43,476
Through contacts, they hired me

547
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:45,854
to make the world believe that I

548
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:47,619
was Doug Rich

549
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,555
to lure these bastards in,

550
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,103
so I could give them what they deserve.

551
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:56,417
It's what I do.

552
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:01,009
I'm what they call a mechanic, Pete.

553
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:04,401
I'm a trained killer.

554
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:08,736
It's my job.

555
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:12,901
I have to travel ready for anything.

556
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:18,164
Sometimes the weapon'll
get pretty basic.

557
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:22,962
It's a job.

558
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:27,550
Now, I know

559
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,309
the truth is difficult to swallow.

560
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:31,983
Sometimes truth is
stranger than fiction.

561
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:33,910
Doug's life is in danger.

562
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,372
He has to remain hidden
from everyone, even from you.

563
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:39,652
You understand?

564
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,270
Do you understand?

565
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:45,845
Now, I'm gonna put you in this car

566
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:48,800
and drive you back to your car,
and then you go north,

567
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:51,403
and you forget this ever happened.

568
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:55,330
And you wait for Doug to contact
you in his own sweet time.

569
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,269
Now, can you do that, Pete?

570
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:01,167
Good man.

571
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:14,636
What is that?

572
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:18,055
Shit.

573
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:20,307
- Nothing. Let's go.
- Are you bleeding?

574
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:21,714
No. It's...

575
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:23,656
Don't...

576
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:24,768
It doesn't matter.

577
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,213
It's a water gun.

578
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:38,012
It's a goddamn water gun,

579
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,067
you goddamn liar!

580
00:35:40,996 --> 00:35:43,220
You lunatic! What have you done?

581
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:54,901
Wow, look what the cat dragged in.

582
00:35:58,912 --> 00:35:59,981
It almost worked.

583
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,078
Almost does not count, Wayne.

584
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:03,233
Where...

585
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,893
Lisa?

586
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:07,595
Hi, sweetheart. It's your Lisa.

587
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,819
Come on. You want a little wine cooler?

588
00:36:12,056 --> 00:36:13,731
I don't like w... Er.

589
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:16,208
Oh. Yeah, you do. You do.

590
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,192
You like it, okay.

591
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,146
we got about an hour.

592
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:26,144
Oh, thank you so much, Nina.
I got it from here, okay?

593
00:36:26,397 --> 00:36:27,706
Nonsense.

594
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:31,548
Look, Nina, this is all
just kind of private,

595
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,967
So was my sex life till a week ago.

596
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,121
You know,

597
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:39,105
I have no idea what all of this is.
It's, uh...

598
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,424
- So this is where y'all live.
- No.

599
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:47,520
No, Nina. We live in the house
next door to you. You know that.

600
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:49,843
- I mean, this is where you come from.
- No,

601
00:36:50,097 --> 00:36:51,926
Nina, we come from tampa.

602
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,446
I just...

603
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:57,119
I have no idea who's been in here.
It's just, uh...

604
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:58,935
No, don't touch that!

605
00:37:10,123 --> 00:37:11,883
You people are really somethin'.

606
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,839
Nina, this is not what you think.

607
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:15,767
I'm sure of it.

608
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:17,723
I just mean that it...

609
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:20,987
It's not what it looks like, okay?

610
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:23,239
Nothin's what it looks like, hon.

611
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:12,864
Wayne, Cal, we got to go!

612
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:19,141
It's Hugh.

613
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,788
We don't have time for Hugh.

614
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:23,254
I got to answer.
He's calling in the middle of the night.

615
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,025
Hey, hey, man,

616
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:26,405
can we talk?

617
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,374
What... Hugh, it is four in the morning.

618
00:38:29,485 --> 00:38:31,287
Don't tell me no, Doug.

619
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:34,591
Please don't tell me no, Doug.

620
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,039
She kicked me out.

621
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:39,981
She locked the doors on me.

622
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,656
Wayne, we got to go!

623
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:44,709
Uh, we had this fight.
I said some stuff.

624
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:46,314
I called her names.

625
00:38:47,018 --> 00:38:48,608
I hurt her real bad, and...

626
00:38:48,721 --> 00:38:49,727
Dad!

627
00:38:50,317 --> 00:38:53,087
Pete is not dead. He is asleep.
We do not have all day.

628
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:56,171
She said I was the saddest
person she ever met.

629
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,213
Said I had no heart.

630
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,811
She didn't mean that.

631
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:02,948
She was upset.

632
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:04,435
We're headin' out.

633
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:06,079
She'll come back.

634
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:07,193
I don't know.

635
00:39:07,373 --> 00:39:10,008
Hey, man, can you come over?

636
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,292
I need you.

637
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:14,319
I mean, I'm sittin' here,
tellin' you I need you.

638
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:18,281
You're my best friend in the world.

639
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,681
you're my only friend

640
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:23,841
in the... In the world.

641
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,005
I'm on my way.

642
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:08,666
Are you both okay?

643
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:11,862
Oh, dear lord,

644
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:13,900
what happened to you?

645
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,670
I won't ask.

646
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:22,682
I won't tell.

647
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:23,887
I know.

648
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,035
I just wish...

649
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:27,636
Wish I could come with you.

650
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:29,111
Nah, you're better off here.

651
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:31,974
Am I?

652
00:40:32,575 --> 00:40:34,129
Just wish I had the guts.

653
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:36,348
You do have the guts.

654
00:40:38,465 --> 00:40:39,602
We got to go, ma.

655
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:41,876
I'll be here

656
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:44,893
if you ever need a helping hand.

657
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:57,087
I'll be here.

658
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,508
Mr. Rich?

659
00:41:18,996 --> 00:41:20,245
mrs. Rich?

660
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:22,069
Is everything okay up there?

661
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,703
Please help me!

662
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:26,590
Please! Somebody help me!

663
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:29,101
Somebody open the door!

664
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,254
Please help me!

665
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:34,765
God!

666
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:41,835
You're...

667
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,069
That guy in the truck.

668
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:48,703
I'm a handyman.

669
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:50,009
Where we gonna go, mexico?

670
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:52,148
- I vote canada.
- It's too far, Di. Come on.

671
00:41:52,351 --> 00:41:53,398
What do you say, baby?

672
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:55,391
Wherever we go, we got to go right now.

673
00:41:55,706 --> 00:41:56,945
Mexico, it is.

674
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:59,354
Sorry, Di Di.
I could do with a margarita.

675
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:00,613
Oh, whatever.

676
00:42:14,754 --> 00:42:15,801
So this, uh,

677
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:17,985
Doug and Cherien,

678
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:19,764
the Riches?

679
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:22,838
You've known them for years?

680
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:24,223
They're real?

681
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:26,632
Or they were.

682
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:28,873
And these people,

683
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:30,089
whoever they are...

684
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:33,252
They took over their lives.

685
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:38,105
Information like that, you could really
hold over somebody's head.

686
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:42,051
You could use that to
get some serious green.

687
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:44,134
You mean blackmail them?

688
00:42:44,517 --> 00:42:45,800
Are you out of your mind?

689
00:42:45,924 --> 00:42:48,750
I don't want money. I want my friends.

690
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:50,968

and have those two arrested.

692
00:42:52,442 --> 00:42:55,133
I have to find out what
they've done with my friends.

693
00:42:55,345 --> 00:42:56,347
Oh, my God!

694
00:42:56,505 --> 00:42:58,712

What's wrong with me?

695
00:42:58,948 --> 00:43:00,896
They're getting away as we speak.

696
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:03,419

697
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:05,467
Ain't no worry about that.

698
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:08,620
Distributor cap's gone.

699
00:43:08,845 --> 00:43:09,847
Shit.

700
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,942
Great. What the hell are
we gonna do, you guys?

701
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:13,011
That's got to be Dale.

702
00:43:13,078 --> 00:43:14,407
That guy's probably awake by now.

703
00:43:14,474 --> 00:43:16,161
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

710
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:51,391
to the police.

00:43:52,438 --> 00:43:54,229
What, are you gonna walk, Pete?

712
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,145
I mean, I'm just a handyman, but

713
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,308
it seems to me that
the right thing to do here is to help,

714
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:02,245
so let me drive you.

715
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:05,206

716
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,802
