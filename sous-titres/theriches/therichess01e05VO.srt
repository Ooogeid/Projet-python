00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:04,632
Travelers?

3
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:06,519
I don't think
we know any traverlers.

4
00:00:06,619 --> 00:00:10,065
You know, my buddies up in new york,
they still don't think you people exist.

5
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:12,164
We're gonna have
ourselves a wedding.

6
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:14,303
Our boy and your girl.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,227
I am the new boss.
He is the old boss.

8
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:20,299
Get over it.

9
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:25,409
Life's a river, kid.

10
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,662
You gotta go where it takes you.

11
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:31,101
Come on!

12
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:33,336
You're in the wrong lane!

13
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,705
Mick, look out!

14
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:35,758
Shit!

15
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:39,746
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,867
You want to pretend
to be the dead guy?

17
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:48,007
You want to wear his suits and
you want me to be his dead wife.

18
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,435
Hello.

19
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:52,058
Dougy was lookin' for work...

20
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,329
As a lawyer.

21
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:55,190
You ever done in-house?

22
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:57,960
Panco team, meet your...

23
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,124
new legal chief.

24
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,930
Aubrey's a five-star paralegal,
wants to be a lawyer, too.

25
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:05,142
School? Who want to learn
a bunch of buffer bullshit?

26
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:08,170
School is the cornerstone
of buffer society.

27
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:09,414
Kids okay?

28
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:11,245
<i>Didi's screwin' around

29
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:13,705

that neighborhood kid.</i>

30
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:15,989
The American Dream...

31
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,981
we're gonna steal it.

32
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:20,000
So, how do I find you?

33
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,373
I'll pick you up.

34
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,182
Who followed you?

35
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:27,444
There he goes, Dale.

36
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:31,168
Now we ain't gonna
be able to follow him.

37
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:09,050
Doug. Doug,
are you okay?

38
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,803
What are you doing out here?

39
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,748
Came out for some air.

40
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:19,175
I must have dozed off.

41
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,352
Couldn't sleep.

42
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,672
Stress, huh?

43
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:25,284
Eat raw eggs and run.
That's what I do.

44
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:30,698
I'm a fraud.

45
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:39,122
It's edenfalls, Doug.

46
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,318
We're all frauds,
one way or another.

47
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,976
I got to run.
Class at 9 :00.

48
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,536
Eggs, exercise.

49
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:58,757
It's morning!
It's supposed to be quiet!

50
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,336
Asshole.

<i>The Big Floss</i>

57
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:49,332
- Pardon.
- I cannot understand you, freak.

58
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:52,163
- Sam, take the turkey.
- Non! Non! Non!

59
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,672
- Why are you speaking french?
- 'cause he's a freak.

60
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:57,571
My teacher said I could benefit
from total immersion.

61
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:59,882
In the pool maybe.
Okay?

62
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:02,019
You want me to make you
a little sandwich, baby?

63
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:03,419
Ma, we got it, okay?

64
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:05,896
Baby, I'm gonna be late tonight.
I got this meeting with

65
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,691
Beaufort-Simpson, Et Al.

66
00:05:07,864 --> 00:05:10,060
- Who's Et Al?
- Don't know yet.

67
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:11,447
You kids ready?
I gotta go.

68
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:13,259
Well, I could find out who he is.

69
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,996
No, I'll be okay on this one, baby.

70
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:17,885
Well, that's good 'cause
I got a real busy day.

71
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:19,917
Yeah. Haven't you got
that dentist appointment?

72
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,436
Cherien has a dentist appointment.
I don't wanna take that.

73
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,819
It's better than doin' nothin'.

74
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,894
Do you think I got nothin'to do?

75
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,502
Y'all think I have nothin' to do?

76
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,909
Hell, you know,
maybe I should just get a job.

77
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,219
Baby, you got a job.

78
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,222
You're the housewife.
You do it very well.

79
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:40,744
Allons-y.

80
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:43,537
Come on, Pierre.

81
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:45,572
Bye, mom.

82
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:49,522
Why don't you unpack
those boxes in the garage?

83
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,265
Are you comin', dad?

84
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:56,441
A housewife?

85
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:58,204
I'm a housewife?

86
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,571
Now, what is that?

87
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,385
That is ugly is what that is.

88
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,737
Oh, hi.

89
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,954
Is all that for me?

90
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:15,770
'cause we're new here,
so that'd be a lot of stuff,

91
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,463
unless, of course,
it was piling up,

92
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,256
which it might have been, 'cause people
send a lot of junk mail, don't they?

93
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,640
Hello, mr. Butternuts.

94
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,799
You like your job?

95
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:35,386
I don't have a job.

96
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:39,423
I'm just a lonely housewife,
all alone.

97
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,732
I was in the slammer once.

98
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,910
Do you hear that?

99
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:48,913
I was in prison.

100
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:52,015
I was in the women's prison!

101
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,006
Yeah, don't be
so friendly next time.

102
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:58,279
Chatty cathy'll clip your strings...

103
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,013
Bitch.

104
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,812
Oh, my god.
I'm going crazy.

105
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,530
- Mr. Rich?
- Good morning, Aubrey.

106
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:10,278
Mr. Rich,
the Beaufort-Simpson meeting--

107
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,629
I'm gonna stop you right there.

108
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,520
We've been working
together for a while now.

109
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,621
- Four days.
- I think you should call me Wayne.

110
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:16,806
No, Doug.
Doug's better.

111
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,429
Doug, the Beaufort-Simpson
meeting has been moved up an hour.

112
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:21,573
- Fabulous.
- Before that, we should probably cover

113
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,624
the fallbrook irrigation
district v. Bradley,

114
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,236
ingress, egress over
easement entitlements and

115
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,318
the back-up on legal takings
under the fifth.

116
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,313
Fabulous.

117
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,859
Laptops, cell phones, ipods.

118
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:40,826
- We could be in some goodkushhere.
- Forget it, Cal. We're buffers now.

119
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:43,275
Please. Dad can spout
that as long as he likes.

120
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,760
You know we ain't
never gonna be like them.

121
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:50,016
Don't you think
you should answer that, Cal?

122
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:52,424
I know it's tammy.

123
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:55,428
- Go play with your buffer friends.
- Yeah, maybe I will.

124
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,246
Oh, him?

125
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,963
Got yourself a buffer boyfriend.

126
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,198
Yeah. At least
he answers the phone.

127
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:07,549
Now, you want
your mockingbirdpaper, dummy?

128
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:15,641
How you doin'?

129
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,713
- I'm sorry.
- It's cool.

130
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:28,181
I wouldn't talk to
my sister's friends, either.

131
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,317
Oh, really?

132
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,995
You forgot your geometry
homework!

133
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,564
One second.

134
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:39,746
- Man, he is so cute.
- You're such a dick.

135
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,609
What's up, dude?
Listen.

136
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,260
A bunch of us are going
to the Père Lachaise friday night.

137
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:51,043
It's a bar on lemoyne,
south of town from here.

138
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:54,455
A bar? What's getting you in,
your good looks?

139
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:55,881
Nice.

140
00:08:56,652 --> 00:08:58,501
It's a fake I.D.

141
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:02,199
You call this a fake I.D.?

142
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:06,669
"private property is seized
from criminals."

143
00:09:27,852 --> 00:09:29,797
Yes, mr... Doug.

144
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,093
Panco didn't seize
this land from criminals, did we?

145
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:36,707
- I don't believe so.
- No, of course not.

146
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:40,887
We seized it from honest, law-abiding,
poverty-stricken, semi-homeless people.

147
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,082
Yes.

148
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,547
And then we...

149
00:09:44,624 --> 00:09:46,435
Built three mini malls
and a skating rink.

150
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,018
- A skating rink?
- Hugh's wife of the time...

151
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:53,369
Number three, I believe...
Used to be with the ice capades.

152
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:54,496
Wonderful.

153
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:57,963
So following up on that, and for
your own instructional purposes.

154
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:00,525
why don't you tell me
in 25 words or less how you would

155
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,182
defend Panco in this case.

156
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:05,238
We pay them just compensation.

157
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:06,817
They don't seem to agree.

158
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,379
We've brought in new jobs,

159
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:12,269
property values in the area
have gone up 85 percent.

160
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,277
We made money

161
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:20,895
not only for ourselves,
but also for the people,

162
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,014
who, without us,

163
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,597
would be nowhere.

164
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:26,481
Actually, that's where
they are right now.

165
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:29,813
Whatever. It's our accomplishment,
and they should be grateful.

166
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:32,797
Aubrey, you're brilliant.
You're a godsend. You're...

167
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:34,492
The wind beneath your wings?

168
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:35,937
No, not quite that.

169
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:40,024
How do you do?

170
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:44,897
I'm mrs. Doug Rich
of mr. And mrs. Doug Rich.

171
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:47,305
- He is the mister, and I'm the...
- The Cherien.

172
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,961
Could you excuse us a moment?

173
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:55,411
You do know that dudzik, hiltzik, and

174
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,414
strauss
will be here at quarter two?

175
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:58,994
The composers?

176
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,085
- The attorneys for Beaufort-Simpson.
- Of course, right.

177
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:09,833
- Dahlia, what are you doing here?
- I brought you lunch?

178
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:13,088
Isn't that what every good little
housewife's supposed to do?

179
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:17,330
Turkey,

180
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,006
jell-o,

181
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:20,480
pop-tarts.

182
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,436
- Okay, I get the point.
- No, you don't.

183
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:27,784
- I do not wanna do this.
- Okay, then don't.

184
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:30,791
Screw you!

185
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,783
I'm wasting my time, sitting around
in that big ol' stupid house.

186
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,383
There are things that I could do.

187
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,291
Entrepreneur review?

188
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,449
You always want us to be legit, right?

189
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,419
I could start a billy bob
barbecue franchise.

190
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,083
I could sell vitamins from home.

191
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:53,951
- You know, start a hedge fund.
- All wonderful ideas.

192
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,688
They are shit ideas.

193
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:02,025
All shit ideas then.
This is really not a good time.

194
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,935
I got a really big
Eminent Domain meeting.

195
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:04,986
What?

196
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,946
Eminent Domain. It's how
you steal people's property...

197
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,114
- Because you want to.
- That's what you're doin' here?

198
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:12,770
Well, if that's what you're doing,

199
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,793
then what do we have to stop
being travelers for?

200
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,538
- I know this is hard for you.
- No,

201
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:20,085
- don't you tell me what is hard for me.
- I have a lot of work right now.

202
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,665
Hugh is expecting me
to be a lawyer.

203
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:26,383
Well. I wouldn't want to get in
the way of what Hugh wants you to do.

204
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,668
I'll just go take
my dentist appointment.

205
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,615
Matter of fact, I think I do feel
a toothache coming on.

206
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:35,569
- Yeah, I do.
- Dahlia?

207
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:37,476
It's Cherien.

208
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:41,001
You want me to be somebody different,
better get my name right.

209
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,632
You brought him lunch?

210
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,847
Yeah, I'm good at that.

211
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:56,237
I'm guessing you're good
at a lot of things.

212
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,876
You know, I could use someone
like that around here.

213
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,475
I bet you could.

214
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:03,402
Have a nice day, Hugh.

215
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:22,294
Can I help you?

216
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:27,196
Oh... I don't know.
Um, no.

217
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,614
Oh, do you have an appointment?

218
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,562
We have so been lookin'
forward to meetin' you.

219
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:54,239
Dr. Dibadeaux won't be long.

220
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:57,706
Come this way.
My name is Lorraine.

221
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:06,663
- Mrs. Rich, Isaac Dibadeaux.
- Hi.

222
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:11,344
Hi. Sorry to have you waiting here.
I had someone in my office.

223
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:20,127
- You don't need to lie back.
- I don't?

224
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,420
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

225
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:32,483
No. I've seen it happen many times.

226
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,642
So sorry mr. Strauss
couldn't be here today.

227
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,464
- There is no Strauss.
- He's dead to us.

228
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:39,630
Good.

229
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,605
Well, it must be clear
to your client,

230
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,908
- Beaufort-Simpson...
- Clients... Beaufort-Simpson, et al.

231
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,507
Bunch of damn freeloaders,
pissin' in the gutter,

232
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:50,260
holdin' up a tin can
at every stoplight.

233
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:53,207
"I'm a homeless vietnam vet.
Please help."

234
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,727
are they actually?

235
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,000
Back to your point, Doug.

236
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:02,047
Trained at university
of Florida, huh?

237
00:15:02,182 --> 00:15:03,992
University of Florida.

238
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:07,440
It's a big school.

239
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,522
Yeah, it's large.
Quite large.

240
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:13,152
- But good.
- Yeah.

241
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,053
Well, it must be clear to your clients,

242
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:20,653
Beaufort-Simpson and al,

243
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:22,860
that they have received

244
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:25,518
just and adequate compensation
for their properties.

245
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:28,543
- Practically gave 'em my right nut.
- Your left, and we'll settle.

246
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,469
- You lousy piece of...
- Gentlemen.

247
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,087
Gentlemen, please.

248
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:37,017
Clearly, you were
very well-liked in Tampa.

249
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:39,975
Yeah. Yes, I was.

250
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:46,744
You know, your credentials,
experience, references,

251
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,518
interview seems hardly necessary.

252
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,406
Interview?

253
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:54,777
What, like a job interview?

254
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:58,851
Yeah, that's... That's what
you're here for, isn't it?

255
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:08,275
- You know, as vietnam vets...
- They aren't...

256
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:11,356
Vietnam vets.

257
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:14,972
- Thank you, Aubrey.
- You're welcome, mr. Rich.

258
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:23,862
But if they were
to become vietnam vets,

259
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,130
if we went back in,

260
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,216
they would realize
that Eminent Domain

261
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:34,660
is a powerful tool that has developed
this country all the way up to here

262
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:37,464
And it has created
military installations,

263
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:40,315
highways, byways, airports.

264
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,791
- Guantanamo bay is...
- You bulldozed their homes.

265
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:45,940
Hovels is more like it.

266
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,246
I don't see any byways next
to your skating rink.

267
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:50,422
- No, but we're gonna build one.
- A byway?

268
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:53,678
Oh, screw your goddamn byways.
Haven't you read calder v. Bull?

269
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:59,415
Yeah, have you read
Hester v. Strapling?

270
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:03,695
Have you read
Monkey v. Chestnut?

271
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,399
Jiggle v. Craphousen?

272
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,050
Roaster v. Blowme?

273
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,349
Ratzen v. Catzen?

274
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,121
He's insane.

275
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:16,646
You forgotten that the bright
line rule applies to this case?

276
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:19,281
Mr. Rich, what about
the fifth amendment's takings clause?

277
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,383
Or did you think our clients
were in a position

278
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:23,079
to purchase allodial title
to their land?

279
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:24,165
Allodial.

280
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:27,663
How do you ignore justice O'Connor
inhawaii housing authority v. Midkiff?

281
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:31,092
Or thurgood marshall Inloretto v.
Teleprompter manhattan catv corp?

282
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:33,769
- Berman v. Parker.
- Village of euclid v. Ambler realty.

283
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:37,630
Of course, in the end, it all
comes down Toruckelshaus v. Monsanto,

284
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:38,906
doesn't it?

285
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:42,111
- Well, mr. Rich, doesn't it?
- Hell, no.

286
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,328
Doesn't boil down to that at all,
does it, Doug?

287
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:55,026
Is he dead?

288
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:02,961
Narcolepsy?

289
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,597
Totally freak case, Hugh.
I don't know where it came from.

290
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,446
Though my grandmother
had it, you know.

291
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:09,870
She once went right out,
right in a cake.

292
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,667
But it's not hereditary,
so I don't know what that is.

293
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,574
But, uh, will never
happen again, I promise.

294
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,855
If it does,
don't bother waking up.

295
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,230
I'll get my files later.

296
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:35,965
Where's the beer?

297
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:38,125
- Beats me.
- I don't know.

298
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:41,429
Where's the beer? There was
beer here. Did you drink it?

299
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:42,943
- No.
- No.

300
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,156
- Did you drink it?
- I don't even like your beer.

301
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,182
Where's Sam?

302
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:51,084
He's at his French
study group right now.

303
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,854
- Our children are drinking the beer.
- So?

304
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:55,497
- Well...
- Oh, my god.

305
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:56,618
What?

306
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,428
Dad had to pull a sleeper.

307
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,351
Thank you, Cal.
It happened.

308
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:03,823
I'm not proud of it.
We can move on now.

309
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,168
So the rest
of us have to go straight.

310
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:08,383
Meanwhile, you're pulling
the lamest of the lame?

311
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,736
Okay, that's enough.
It's not that big of a deal.

312
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:12,984
- Di, he had to pull a sleeper.
- So what?

313
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,761
It's like dad always
taught us, you know?

314
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,406
If all else fails, you close your eyes,
you put your head down.

315
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:19,261
Anyone call you on it?

316
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,764
Shit, Wayne, I mean,
you could blow it for everyone.

317
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,326
You think you're gonna get fired?

318
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:24,987
We can make money
some other way, guys.

319
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,424
That's great 'cause
he couldn't handle the lawyer thing,

320
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:29,353
and now we're even
more screwed than we were...

321
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:31,475
- All right, enough, all of you.
- All right.

322
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,205
Kids are just trying
to be helpful.

323
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,309
Yeah. Well,
it's not helping me.

324
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,617
- Look, if he gets fired.
- We have nowhere to go, okay?

325
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:42,067
- What do you mean, stop?
- Will you just settle down!

326
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,725
Everybody's gonna be fine, and
we're gonna have money because...

327
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:47,996
I got a job today.

328
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,729
- A job?
- As what?

329
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,314
As a well-trained,
well-liked,

330
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:55,714
board-certified
dental hygienist.

331
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:04,060
Do you know,
if you put that on your head,

332
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:06,570
it might make your headache
go away faster.

333
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,166
How do I look?

334
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:11,416
I must say, there's something
about a woman in uniform.

335
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,022
I know.

336
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,219
You know,

337
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:18,819
I never thought I was gonna get excited
about looking in people's mouths, but

338
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,920
I really think I can do this, Wayne.
You know, I really do.

339
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,118
And I can do the lawyer thing.

340
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,318
Oh, I know you can, baby.

341
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,763
No, don't just say that.
Don't just humor me.

342
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,031
Tomorrow, I will get on top of this.
I'll figure it out.

343
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:37,252
Are you asking me
if I still believe in you?

344
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:39,117
'cause you know I do?

345
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:42,514
I think this calls for a little
dental hygienist sex.

346
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:45,228
The only thing I rember about
the dentist is a world of hurt.

347
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,018
That's what I'm talking about.

348
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:50,856
Oh, baby.

349
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,176
- What?
- I can't.

350
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:53,303
Why?

351
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:54,872
Headache.

352
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,873
I'll clean your teeth.

353
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:04,177
- Come on.
- This is not sexy at all.

354
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:05,986
You only get one set.

355
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,270
Are you gonna do anything?

356
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:24,415
Sure.

357
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:26,608
I sure am.

358
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,693
What are you doing?

359
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:38,903
Uh, you just be quiet there, Junior.

360
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:42,080
Is that your real name? Junior?

361
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,963
Of course, it's my real name.

362
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:46,883
And and are these your real teeth?

363
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,914
Yeah, they're my real teeth.

364
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:51,555
Um, just checkin'.
It's my job.

365
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:57,001
Okay, comin' in.

366
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:00,859
Shouldn't you turn it on?

367
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:06,575
You're one of those who thinks
it's only workin' if it hurts.

368
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:10,016
How's that?

369
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:12,527
You like that?
Oh, you like that, huh?

370
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:14,424
Yeah, you want more?

371
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:16,658
You want a little more?
A little more than that?

372
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,501
How's that?

373
00:22:20,277 --> 00:22:22,511
Bad, bad boy, Junior.

374
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:24,486
Oh, you like that.

375
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,093
You dirty, dirty little man.

376
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,563
<i>Moo goo gal pan.</i>

377
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:34,586
<i>Moo goo gal pan.</i>

378
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:36,390
<i>Moo goo gal pan.</i>

379
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:37,962
<i>Moo goo gal pan.</i>

380
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:39,814
<i>Moo goo gal pan.</i>

381
00:22:41,522 --> 00:22:42,793
<i>Moo goo gal pan.</i>

382
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:46,327
If you say it often enough,

383
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,550
it doesn't sound right.

384
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:51,371
By the way, Doug,

385
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,458
the name "Wayne" ?

386
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,315
Is there anything
you wanna tell me?

387
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:57,873
It's, um, a nickname.

388
00:22:58,827 --> 00:22:59,879
You mean like :

389
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:01,383
William, Billy,

390
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,132
Joseph, Joey,

391
00:23:03,624 --> 00:23:04,662
Doug...

392
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:06,261
Wayne.

393
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:15,107
Where's the new
Beaufort-Simpson strategy ?

394
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:17,847
Almost got it, Hugh. I've got
Aubrey looking into those lawyers,

395
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,118
see if she can find any...

396
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,567
irregularities.

397
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,978
Aubrey is a paralegal, Doug,

398
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:26,531
draggin' her ass through the second year
of community night school.

399
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:29,996
And from what I understand, she's from a
somewhat disadvantaged, absent father,

400
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:32,424
crackhead mom, no money,
broken home kind of background.

401
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:35,657
So my guess is her undergraduate
bona fides ain't so hot, either.

402
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:37,340
Where'd you go, Gal ? State ?

403
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,660
- Yes.
- Thought so.

404
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:42,954
Good night.

405
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,419
By the way, Doug...

406
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:49,517
you got 48 hours.

407
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:22,345
Dr. Dibadeaux ?

408
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,629
Please, it's Isaac.

409
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:30,369
I just wanted to thank you...

410
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,782
I just wanted to thank you
for hiring me.

411
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:35,398
Good first day, huh ?

412
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:37,493
Yeah. It was interesting.

413
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:39,724
Different.

414
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,230
You're not a...

415
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,342
great hygienist, are you ?

416
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:48,237
But I like you.

417
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:50,831
You do ?

418
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,392
I'm gonna get better.

419
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:58,946
I mean, I'm gonna get more comfortable
with the patients and...

420
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:01,295
instruments.

421
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:05,839
Are you okay ?

422
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:10,152
Oh, you ain't.

423
00:25:10,986 --> 00:25:12,585
I'm grieving, Cherien.

424
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:16,187
This is grief.

425
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:19,877
My wife passed away
two months ago.

426
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:27,185
So much...

427
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:29,585
effort building a practice.

428
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:34,549
Working long hours, saturdays.

429
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:38,289
Ruth hated that.

430
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:43,050
I told her I had to,

431
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:46,670
that it was important,
you know ?

432
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:51,902
All that time.

433
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:56,576
Well, I'm sure it was important.

434
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:58,557
She was in pain, so...

435
00:25:59,947 --> 00:26:02,215
people say it was a blessing.

436
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,023
They tell me it gets better with time.

437
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,320
Well, ...

438
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:14,376
if you hurt, you hurt.

439
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:19,298
And those people,
what do they know ?

440
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:21,288
Ain't no blessing.

441
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:27,023
You're here alone now, ain't you ?

442
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:31,123
That's just the fact of it.

443
00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:34,321
And time ?

444
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:38,134
What, you're just gonna forget her ?

445
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,675
You've been alone,

446
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:50,251
haven't you ?

447
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,705
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:00,391
I shouldn't do this.

449
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,372
Go along.

450
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,354
I'll see you tomorrow.

451
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,905
You didn't even want
to give the exercise a try ?

452
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:02,938
All I need is coffee.

453
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:04,933
If you say so.

454
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:08,179
Hey, listen, I can't stay.
I gotta run. I got a class at 9:00.

455
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,003
- LSU ?
- No.

456
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:12,603
Deansborough,
guest lecturer.

457
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,493
They don't pay much, but I like it,
you know. The students are smart,

458
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,544
they know what they're talking about.
They're not afraid to give it to you.

459
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:19,730
Give what to you ?

460
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,291
Their thoughts, their answers,
their participation.

461
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:26,192
Answers ?

462
00:28:26,442 --> 00:28:28,969
-  Just stop, okay.
- Come on, Di. I mean, you have him over

463
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,612
for dinner, he meets the parents.
Isn't that what buffers do ?

464
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,148
Don't you have to
run away or something ?

465
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:34,906
Cal, I want you to do
something for me, all right ?

466
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:36,579
Di's got herself a boyfriend.
She's too nervous to ask

467
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,115
- if he can come over for dinner.
- Oh, sure, bring him along.

468
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:40,797
Dad, no. I don't wanna
do that. I feel...

469
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:42,045
Bring him along.
We'll have a party.

470
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,823
I want you to get on the internet
and find out everything you can

471
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,158
about Deansborough University.

472
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:48,046
No, can do.
I'm gonna be late for school.

473
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:50,651
I don't care. Do it.
I'll write you a note.

474
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Take that and rinse real good.

475
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,695
Now...

476
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:37,280
My name...

477
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,852
is Doug...

478
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:40,656
Rich...

479
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,688
And I am your guest lecturer
for today.

480
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:46,857
And my specialty

481
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,221
is attorney-client relations.

482
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:52,426
So I will be teaching you
how to speak to your clients.

483
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:53,566
First clue :

484
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:54,982
speak english.

485
00:29:55,364 --> 00:29:56,649
Always helps.

486
00:29:56,854 --> 00:30:02,020
Now, we have a test case here, which is
Roquefort-Plimpton, et Al V. Blatco.

487
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:13,576
So for the purposes of this,
you have to imagine

488
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,132
I know nothing about the law.

489
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:17,672
I mean, really nothing.

490
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:20,069
If I like your responses,
we have cookies.

491
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,518
Any questions ?

492
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,281
That was rhetorical.

493
00:30:50,226 --> 00:30:54,968
Economic rejuvenation is a justifiable
public use to exercise Eminent Domain.

494
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:57,128
And in english that would be...

495
00:30:57,285 --> 00:30:58,515
That was english.

496
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:00,101
Big-word english.
No cookie.

497
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:03,172
What he means is just making money
is enough to allow the fat cats

498
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:07,641
- to take the little cats' houses.
- Good answer. One for Ms. Cardillo.

499
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:11,493
But that's not enough, or
Roquefort-Plimpton wouldn't have a case.

500
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:13,540
Not a good answer.
Cookie back.

501
00:31:14,114 --> 00:31:17,243
- They don't have a case.
- One for Mr. Cypher.

502
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:18,583
I don't agree.

503
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,820
- They do have a case.
- Because ?

504
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:23,812
The mini mall's a wash,
the skating rink's ambiguous.

505
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,601
The economic rejuvenation
must be a public benefit,

506
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:28,837
and that benefit
must be clearly defined.

507
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,229
So to a client,
you would say...

508
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:35,857
Blatco needs to specify what the public
is getting out of that skating rink.

509
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:38,633
Cookie.

510
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:39,836
Cookie.

511
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:42,781
A cookie to you.
Hey.

512
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:00,462
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey. What's going on ?

513
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:02,540
Uh, this is Brent.

514
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:04,587
Hi...

515
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:05,899
Mrs. Rich.

516
00:32:06,022 --> 00:32:07,859
Oh, you can just leave it at "hi".

517
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:09,937
I don't like that "Mrs." too much.

518
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,481
What you got going on ?

519
00:32:11,604 --> 00:32:12,807
A little prank.

520
00:32:13,287 --> 00:32:16,048
It's nothing big. It's...
It's no big deal. It's little.

521
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:17,496
- It's little ?
- It's little.

522
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:20,011
All right, you make sure
it stays that way, cupcake.

523
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:22,745
I'm going upstairs to change.

524
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:30,129
What you looking at ?

525
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:32,808
Nothin'.

526
00:32:33,942 --> 00:32:35,172
Nothin' at all.

527
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,579
Well done.

528
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,135
Thank you.
You are all very intelligent.

529
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:45,557
Don't do crack.

530
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,262
Ms. Cardillo, last one...

531
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:50,683
One for the road ?

532
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,461
Thank you.

533
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:05,990
You've got crap-tasting beer,
Wayne Malloy,

534
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:08,396
you slime-suckin' piece of shit.

535
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:16,714
You're always workin' now,
aren't you, Wayne ?

536
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,641
What ?

537
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:23,612
You ever think about time,

538
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:27,179
about what you're doing with it.

539
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:30,037
Dahlia, what are you talking about ?

540
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,136
Ginny Dannegan.

541
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:48,692
What a pleasure it is
to see you again.

542
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:51,520
That was real nice,

543
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:54,048
drinkin' all that beer
with that baby in your belly.

544
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:56,723
Yeah, I enjoyed the pop-tarts, too.

545
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:58,721
Listen, you come in my house again,

546
00:33:58,816 --> 00:34:01,331
I will shove those pop-tarts
so far up your ass.

547
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,424
Come on.

548
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:05,302
Hey, how's little Sammy
enjoying his french lessons ?

549
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:08,070
Kind of goes along with
the rest of his personality, don't it ?

550
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,637
- How do you know about Sam ?
- I know everything about all of you.

551
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,660
When you work,
when you sleep,

552
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:15,653
who brushes their teeth,
who don't.

553
00:34:15,776 --> 00:34:18,285
- You touch my kids...
- Oh, you spit on yourself.

554
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:20,034
I'm gonna kill you !

555
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:24,005
Enough !

556
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:26,376
And you keep your paws off me !

557
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:29,127
You think this fancy suit
can cover up what you are ?

558
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,535
What exactly might that be ?

559
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,778
Disrespecting our lives,
stealing money from your own family,

560
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,295
foregoing the code.

561
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:38,025
"The hand of one is the hand of all."
You forget about that ?

562
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:39,364
We didn't forget nothing.

563
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:42,235
No, you being here is such
a wonderful reminder of that.

564
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:45,900
My being here means
you're a dead man, Wayne Malloy.

565
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:49,419
I think Dale would be
mighty interested in your address.

566
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,524
Course, I haven't given it to him...

567
00:34:51,747 --> 00:34:52,772
Yet.

568
00:34:52,977 --> 00:34:55,779
What do you want,
Ginny Dannegan ?

569
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:05,742
Sorry to interrupt.
I've got to talk to my son, Cal.

570
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:07,286
Something awful has happened.

571
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:10,458
Don't mind us.
Stay seated or standing. Whatever.

572
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:12,583
His little dog got killed.

573
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:14,446
It was run over
by a big ol' 16-wheeler.

574
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:15,960
A tragic accident,
heartbreaking.

575
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:19,231
Got to tell him now cause, you know you
can't come home with that kind of news.

576
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:22,333
Thank you so much for
your understanding. Thank you.

577
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:28,359
She said she followed you home
the other night from some diner ?

578
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:31,330
Look, stop. If you hadn't brought
us here in the first place,

579
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:32,682
none of this would've happened.

580
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:34,620
Shut up ! I'm crying into
my beer now, Cal.

581
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:36,591
He's just trying to give
you a decent life.

582
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:40,595
A decent life ? We had a decent life.
We had a decent life in the RV.

583
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,566
- We were doing fine.
- You let her find us.

584
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,728
What did I always tell you ?
Don't get caught.

585
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,779
Only shithead travelers
get caught, Cal.

586
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:50,938
You are in the shithead
box right now.

587
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:53,780
- How could you break a cardinal rule ?
- I'm sorry.

588
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:56,486
You know what we've had to do ?
Do you know

589
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:58,550
what you have opened us up to ?

590
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:01,386
Cause that could've been Dale.
Hell, it could still be Dale,

591
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,634
and I think you know
that he wants to kill your dad.

592
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:05,022
I said I'm sorry.

593
00:36:05,195 --> 00:36:07,969
Okay ? I am. I'm sorry.
What do you want?

594
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,445
Oh, I want that I didn't raise
a son so goddamn stupid.

595
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:14,867
It's too late for that though, huh ?

596
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:20,265
Everything was simpler in the RV.

597
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:25,014
You miss it, don't you ?

598
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,904
- You want my stash ?
- How much you got ?

599
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:42,405
10, 11, 12, 13.

600
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,114
Thirteen ?

601
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:45,658
Jesus, Ken.

602
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:48,425
You've been saving that up
since you been about what ?

603
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:50,339
- Five ?
- It doesn't matter.

604
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,826
You're my sister,
and I want you to have it.

605
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:57,104
So, you gonna take it ?

606
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:58,728
Yeah, Ken.

607
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:02,227
Put the money in the bag,
and then put the bag in the car.

608
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,137
Does this thing work ?

609
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,641
Oh, Lorraine.

610
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:38,468
They're saying
some awful things, Cherien,

611
00:37:39,346 --> 00:37:41,227
but I don't believe them.

612
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,986
I think it must have been
a heart attack or...

613
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:49,362
maybe a stroke.

614
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:52,611
Did they work on him ?
Did they, you know...

615
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:54,483
zap him ?

616
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,500
Heart attack or stroke.

617
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:15,317
Aw, shit, Dr. Dibadeaux...

618
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:17,475
Isaac.

619
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,568
Man, I'm so sorry
about your wife.

620
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:26,507
I know how you felt.

621
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,370
I know what it is to miss people.

622
00:38:35,784 --> 00:38:36,791
No.

623
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:39,639
No, I don't think our clients would find
that remotely acceptable.

624
00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:42,584
Increased compensation is
what they are looking for.

625
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:45,372
And when we get to court,
I don't think the judge is gonna be...

626
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:47,559
Oh, I don't think
we'll be going to court

627
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,334
because you guys are nothing
but a pair of crackers.

628
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,547
Even you, and you're black.

629
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:57,627
Now, Aubrey here, who is an excellent
paralegal, has discovered that you guys

630
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,909
are not only waiting
for a percentage of a settlement,

631
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,663
but that you're also on a retainer.

632
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:05,795
I think you're bleeding your clients.

633
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:10,840
If it isn't bad enough that they've got
their homes stolen by this asshole,

634
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:14,171
you guys are draing the rest of
their income on a bogus lawsuit.

635
00:39:14,303 --> 00:39:16,948
- Damn right, and I might add...
- Shut up, Hugh.

636
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:19,612
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised
if they took you to court

637
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:24,268
for misrepresentation, negligence,
dereliction of duty...

638
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,306
- Malfeasance.
- Him, too.

639
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,932
Won't fly, Mr. Rich.

640
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,411
- Our clients were fully informed.
- And they fully accept our contract.

641
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:34,271
How accepting will they be when
they're spending every day in court

642
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:36,265
instead of taking their kids

643
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,134
to the Ducaine boys and girls
community skating rink ?

644
00:39:43,835 --> 00:39:44,911
What ?

645
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,350
A clearly defined public asset

646
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:51,653
often skated in

647
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:53,880
by Mr. Eminent Domain.

648
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:03,255
If I haven't told you this before,

649
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:06,686
I love it when
you call me an asshole.

650
00:40:13,675 --> 00:40:15,991
- What are you doing here?
- Hugh offered me a job, and

651
00:40:16,086 --> 00:40:17,727
I'm gonna take him up on it.

652
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:20,253
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby.
You've got a job.

653
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:21,633
No, I quit.

654
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,923
Something happen ?

655
00:40:23,223 --> 00:40:25,997
Oh, yeah.
I wanna work for Hugh.

656
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,771
I don't know what Hugh said,
but he is full of crap.

657
00:40:28,837 --> 00:40:31,024
Yeah. Now, Wayne, come on,
let me out of the office.

658
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,997
Dahlia, I don't think
this is a good idea.

659
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:36,679
What do you think
is a good idea, Wayne ?

660
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:41,356
You think being a fancy lawyer
is a good idea ?

661
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,366
Me cleaning people's teeth ?

662
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:45,287
Is that why we quit
being travelers ?

663
00:40:46,414 --> 00:40:47,882
Don't blow this, Dahlia.

664
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,342
The dentist guy, he likes you.

665
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,924
You said it yourself.

666
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,113
Well...

667
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,912
The dentist guy is dead.

668
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:01,590
He's lying on the floor right now
with a bottle of pills in his hand.

669
00:41:03,782 --> 00:41:05,927
All he wanted was his wife,

670
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:07,622
and she died.

671
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:09,395
And time...

672
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:11,846
And that ran out.

673
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:15,406
Don't you get it?

674
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:20,149
Life is shit, Wayne.

675
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:23,665
And it hurts.

676
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:27,972
And it tears at us.

677
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:32,052
And we can't change it.

678
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,822
All you can do is be together.

679
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:41,214
We are together.

680
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,344
We are not.

681
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,011
Just like we weren't together
when I was away.

682
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:59,219
Were you better without me then ?

683
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:02,554
Were you ?

684
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:03,925
No.

685
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:07,452
But you're better
without me now.

686
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:14,264
I lived without you
for two years...

687
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:20,116
But I'm not better
without you.

688
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,785
I don't wanna be.

689
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,648
I don't.

690
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,760
Neither do I.

691
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:49,046
It's very excellent pizza,
Mrs. Rich.

692
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:52,076
You picked a good night.

693
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,975
Not really.

694
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,821
What mrs. Rich means is
she would've cooked a lovely meal.

695
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:01,087
If I had known
you were coming.

696
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:19,284
Look, if no one else
is gonna get it...

697
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:20,591
I'll go.

698
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,795
- Do you like anchovies ?
- No way. Never.

699
00:43:28,945 --> 00:43:30,262
Me, neither.

700
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:31,916
Shut up, Sam.

701
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:37,766
Well, look who it is.

702
00:43:38,796 --> 00:43:40,245
Hi, everybody.

703
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,475
Oh, shit.

704
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,085
Dahlia,

705
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:44,411
Didi,

706
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:46,564
Cal, Sam.

707
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:49,625
Who's that ?

708
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,668
That'd be Eric.

709
00:43:51,888 --> 00:43:53,569
Di's boyfriend.

710
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:55,044
Who is that ?

711
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:57,285
This would be Ken.

712
00:43:58,064 --> 00:44:00,100
Di's fiance.

713
00:44:01,193 --> 00:44:02,369
What ?

714
00:44:05,303 --> 00:44:06,669
So, Ken,

715
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,460
got any bags ?

716
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:09,936
What ?!

717
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,454
I left it on the front step.

718
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:15,969
Allow me.

719
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:15,239
