1
00:00:01,121 --> 00:00:02,200
<i>I'm Wayne Malloy.</i>

2
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:04,196
<i>My family and I are travelers.</i>

3
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:07,941
<i>Our kind has been living
in this country for 150 years.</i>

4
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:11,644
<i>We're not listed in the phonebook,
we don't have social security numbers.</i>

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,908
<i>We live off the grid.</i>

6
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,997
<i>Some call us gypsies,
others call us thieves,</i>

7
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:19,091
<i>most though,
don't even know we exist.</i>

8
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:21,962
<i>I've got three kids :
a boy, a girl,</i>

9
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:24,112
<i>and, uh...</i>

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,627
<i>My wife Dahlia is just out of jail,
on parole.</i>

11
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:30,087
<i>We took her home
to the traveler camp.</i>

12
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:33,053
<i>The family gave her a warm welcome.</i>

13
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:36,693
<i>I, on the other hand,
got a different type of welcome.</i>

14
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:39,031
I am the new boss.
He is the old boss.

15
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:41,230
Get over it.

16
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:44,663
<i>Sometimes, it takes a beating to
make you realize it's time to move on.</i>

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,307
So where are we gonna go ?

18
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:50,024
Life's a river, kid.

19
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:52,649
You gotta go where it takes you.

20
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:55,212
<i>So, with a loan from the family bank,</i>

21
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:59,459
<i>I packed up the RV and went out
in search of something better.</i>

22
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:02,234
<i>It wasn't that long
before the family tried to stop us.</i>

23
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:04,265
You're in the wrong lane, asshole !

24
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,500
Mick, look out !

25
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,178
Shit ! Stop !
Oh, my God, no !

26
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:14,123
<i>Unfortunately, they stopped
someone else instead, and then they ran.</i>

27
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,222
<i>Knowing that
we couldn't go back to our old home,</i>

28
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,285
<i>we decided to visit their new home,
Edenfalls, as the Riches.</i>

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,440
Welcome to Panco.

30
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:35,845
Doug Rich.
Meet your new team.

31
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:39,143
Panco team,
meet your new legal chief.

32
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:42,226
Aubrey's a five-star paralegal,
who wants to be a lawyer, too.

33
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:43,921
She's the hardest worker I've got.

34
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:47,255
- Would you like to take a stab at this?
- I am not a lawyer, Mr. Rich.

35
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:48,980
The Rosemere Academy,

36
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:51,677
fifteen-hundred a month,
eighteen a year.

37
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:53,929
Our school is currently full,
Mrs. Rich.

38
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:56,662
They're ain't nobody gonna tell me
I don't care about my kids.

39
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,802
- They're not gonna let us in.
- Yeah, they will.

40
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,482
We can't leave her.
Her bird is missing.

41
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:04,382
Ms. Fedley is an adult.
I'm sure she can manage.

42
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:05,745
Just give me the bird.

43
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:07,904
- Yell "over here".
- Over here !

44
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:09,273
I want to repay you.

45
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,968
There's nothing
you could do, Jane.

46
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,744
Um, Cherien...

47
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:14,671
I got the kids into Rosemere.

48
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:17,118
You know those little pills
you gave me yesterday ?

49
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:20,294
I was just wondering
if just you have like a few more.

50
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:21,756
Did you tell her where we are ?

51
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,066
Yeah, Di. I gave her the address
'cause I'm that dumb.

52
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:25,450
So how do I find you?

53
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,113
I'll pick you up.
8:00 tonight.

54
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:43,424
Hey. Look what I got.

55
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:44,914
Pink wine.

56
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:49,603
Kids okay ?

57
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:51,885
Sam's asleep.

58
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:54,708
Didi's screwin' around on the guitar.

59
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,760
Cal must be out with
a neighborhood kid, according to Didi.

60
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,660
Cal's hangin' out with buffers ?

61
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:01,452
That's what she says.

62
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,651
Shit.

63
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,830
How do you know you're pregnant ?

64
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:18,657
I just know.

65
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,880
We've been gone a week.
What do you mean, you just know ?

66
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:24,438
It happened before that.

67
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:25,998
Why didn't you tell me ?

68
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:28,480
God, you're acting
like you don't believe me.

69
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:30,530
I believe you, Tammy. I'm just...

70
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,724
No, you seem like you don't.

71
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,007
I'm tryin' to make sense of it.

72
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,641
Why else would I come
all the way out here ?

73
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:41,744
What if Dale comes after me ?

74
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:43,823
He won't.

75
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:46,578
They're never gonna know
where we are, okay ?

76
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:50,288
Come here.

77
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:59,808
- You want to get out of here ?
- No, wait a minute.

78
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,425
Tell me again
about the swimming pool.

79
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:05,845
It's a swimming pool.

80
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,969
It's heated, it's got a slide.

81
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:10,499
A slide, huh ?

82
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,541
Why do you keep lookin' outside ?

83
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:33,332
Who followed you ?

84
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,776
Is Dale outside ?

85
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,512
You set me up.

86
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:54,483
Shit.

87
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,257
Shit.

88
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:05,984
Shit.

89
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:11,681
Why didn't you get
that thing on a bun ?

90
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,567
How many times
I got to tell you, Ma?

91
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:16,072
White bread is worse
for you than heroin.

92
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:19,134
911.
What is your emergency?

93
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:21,133
He's been gone a long time.

94
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:22,964
Maybe he's taking a dump.

95
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,466
The car's still there.

96
00:05:25,636 --> 00:05:28,151
He ain't gonna go
no place without that car.

97
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,254
Somethin' is up.

98
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,198
Shit.

99
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,740
Shit.

100
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,177
Evenin', officer.

101
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,447
You from around here, son ?

102
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,806
No, sir.

103
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,624
Just passing through.

104
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:18,013
Yeah, we got us a report of some
unsavory activity goin' on around here.

105
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,815
Well, what kind of unsavory activity ?

106
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,259
Prostitution.

107
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:25,561
She's my ma.

108
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,922
I've seen stranger.

109
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:30,944
I ain't no whore.

110
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:33,068
Son of a bitch.

111
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,241
Hey, you watch your mouth,
dickhead.

112
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:36,581
Spread 'em.

113
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,448
Well, now, what do we have here ?

114
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:46,734
What name you goin' by today, son ?

115
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:49,651
Luther ray ?
Bodie ? Bud ?

116
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,173
There he goes, Dale.

117
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,026
Now, we ain't gonna be
able to follow him.

118
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,475
Shut up, Ma.

119
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:02,747
Or you like Armando ?
Does that work for you ?

120
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,643
- It works for me.
- That's a pretty good one.

121
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:05,744
Thanks.

122
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:08,147
Maybe them buffers
got the right idea.

123
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,214
They should do have
some strange pets though.

124
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,521
No shit.

125
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:15,762
Oh, baby, look.

126
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,932
Look at that.
What happened?

127
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,694
Oh, there are mosquitoes.

128
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:22,461
Scratched myself raw.

129
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:24,905
I haven't noticed them
so much lately.

130
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:27,744
- Oh, come back, baby.
- No, I'm tired.

131
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:30,054
- It's so nice out here.
- No, it's real hot.

132
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,338
Come and talk to me.

133
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,430
I'm gonna take a shower.

134
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:37,729
I'm gonna take a shower.

Been There, Done That</i>

141
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,583
Mum?

142
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
Trixie ?

143
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,813
Someone stole her.

144
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,522
Who would want her ?

145
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,263
I didn't know
this place was zoned for llamas.

146
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:35,389
Alpacas.

147
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,013
If you got more than an acre,
you can keep anything you want.

148
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,189
Jim chose Alpacas.

149
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:42,174
They're the Cadillac
of camelids, Doug.

150
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:43,841
Jim used to be an engineer.

151
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:46,275
So, now you're...

152
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,275
An Alpaca engineer.

153
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:51,717
Raising alpacas has allowed me
to walk away from a corporate career

154
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:54,779
and all the stress and bullcrap
that went along with it.

155
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:58,789
- I love it.
- So you breed them for their m-e-a-t ?

156
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,470
Oh, god, no.

157
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,575
This is an investment
you can hug, Doug.

158
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,460
It's all about breeding stock.

159
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,085
Alpacas are hot.
Everyone wants one.

160
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:11,479
In three years, our Alpaca portfolio
has quadrupled in value.

161
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:12,655
On paper.

162
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:16,947
In reality, old "hercules"
hasn't impregnated a single bitch.

163
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,518
And to think you paid
$20,000 for him.

164
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:21,728
Give him time.

165
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:24,024
Us own fellows don't
respond to all the pressure.

166
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,857
Exactly what I was saying.

167
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:32,846
We haven't had sex in five years.

168
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:35,231
Really ?

169
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:38,933
Well...

170
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:43,370
Nice mug.

171
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,776
Thank you.
I made it myself.

172
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:48,878
Is that an eggplant ?

173
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,909
Okay, here we go,

174
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:57,650
one picture,
just for the school day.

175
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:59,239
- Dad, stop.
- Just for the files.

176
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:00,814
Look up, look up, look up...

177
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,522
That's gotta do.
That's gotta do.

178
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,739
Cal, will I ever get you
to look up ?

179
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:06,803
And thank you for the finger.

180
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:08,617
This is a momentous day.

181
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,120
Monumentally lame.

182
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,088
You will never regret an education.

183
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:13,756
I mean, only the educated are free.

184
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:15,193
This isn't exactly free, Dad.

185
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:16,874
So the deal is,

186
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:20,255
I have to make a lunch
for each of you every day.

187
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:22,817
- And a snack.
- Or we could just buy lunch.

188
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,929
No. No, I can do this.

189
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:26,854
Little baggy.

190
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:28,207
Little Sammy.

191
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,680
You want a snack too, huh ?

192
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,807
- Bye, Mam.
- Bye, baby.

193
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:37,915
Bye, baby.

194
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,494
Don't call me "baby".

195
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:40,840
Bye, baby.

196
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:42,188
Make it a great day.

197
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:44,362
- Could you be more annoying?
- I'm not annoying.

198
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:46,132
I'm taking a photograph...
a video.

199
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:48,105
Bad enough
that he's going to school.

200
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,868
It's amazing that
I can work this thing.

201
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,187
You got that right.

202
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,051
Gotta go.

203
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,691
So what are you gonna do today ?

204
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,786
Be a buffer wife. Isn't that
what I'm supposed to do here ?

205
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,691
We're gonna be late for school.

206
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:10,877
You just don't want me to screw
things up for you, do you Wayne.

207
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:12,841
Dad, we're gonna be late.

208
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:15,916
Bye. Have a great day.

209
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,773
Make a lot of money.

210
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:36,504
<i>Who is this ?</i>

211
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,046
You called me.
What do you want?

212
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,411
<i>Tell Doug I know where he is.</i>

213
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:44,588
No, there is no Doug, okay ?

214
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,105
There is no Doug.

215
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:49,558
You got the wrong number.
You gotta stop calling here, okay ?

216
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,679
You understand ? Just stop calling here.
There's no Doug !

217
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:07,923
- Hi.
- Hi, Nina.

218
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,547
- Can I come in?
- Well, sure, honey.

219
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,832
You cookin' ?

220
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,249
Chicken tortilla soup.
I'm making it for the party tomorrow.

221
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:18,234
Y'all are comin', aren't you ?

222
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:22,942
Well, good, 'cause we burns
throw a hell of a party.

223
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,951
How do you cook every day ?

224
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:29,850
I mean, do you like it ?

225
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,209
Well, we have to eat, don't we ?

226
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:41,193
- So what's wrong, hon ?
- Nothing.

227
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,457
It doesn't look like
nothing from here.

228
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:47,437
Well, Nina...

229
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:51,584
Do you know those little pills
we like to share?

230
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,115
Do you think...

231
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,480
people like us,

232
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,872
who like little pills like that, ...

233
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:02,554
have a little problem ?

234
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,487
You mean like a drug problem ?

235
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:08,856
Maybe.

236
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,747
Oh, honey.

237
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,275
It's not a drug problem.

238
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:19,007
Those are prescription pills.

239
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,309
Cause sometimes...

240
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:28,872
I feel like I really need
something to get by.

241
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:30,280
Of course, you do. We all do.

242
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:32,974
Everybody needs something
to get by every now and then.

243
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:36,398
Alcee Stringer,
down the street,

244
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:39,979
all she does is eat broccoli
and exercise all day.

245
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:44,702
And Boyd Harrelson,
he's addicted to animal porn.

246
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,230
We have to watch
our Alpacas at night.

247
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:50,950
And Gunner Mowbrey's wife

248
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:54,240
left him for their best friend's
17-year-old son.

249
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:55,875
Oh, man, that's terrible.

250
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,559
In her defense,
he was a mature seventeen.

251
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,922
Anyway, what's a little pill or two?

252
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,249
I mean, life's hard, Dahlia.

253
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:05,915
We all just do the best we can.

254
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:08,293
Amen.

255
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,824
I always say, as long as nobody's toes
get stepped on, who gives a damn ?

256
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:15,122
And Jim don't care?

257
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,560
Jim wouldn't notice
if I had a sex change operation.

258
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:30,811
He's too busy
with those shitty alpacas.

259
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,673
White widow, great shit.

260
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,772
Neighborhood kid sells it.

261
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,909
I love you, Nina.

262
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:01,749
I love you, too.

263
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:39,700
- Who is it ?
- Hi,

264
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,712
we're the welcoming committee
from temple beth el.

265
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:44,805
Uh, y'all got the wrong house.

266
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,649
I don't know anyone named beth.

267
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:48,788
May we come in ?

268
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,234
I'm real busy right now.

269
00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:00,127
Oh, we'll make it quick, hon.

270
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:09,178
Cherien, I'm Helen Weiner.

271
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,401
We spoke on the phone.
I handled your membership.

272
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,562
My membership ?

273
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:18,750
For the temple.
We got your check.

274
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,128
Oh, right.
The temple.

275
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:25,889
We just wanted to fill you in,

276
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:28,844
give you a chance to join
a chavurah with the temple.

277
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,751
There are a lot of
goyim around this area.

278
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,028
This is a great way
to meet other jewish families.

279
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,779
Jewish families ?

280
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:39,751
Well, it's not temple.

281
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:43,838
But there are about
of 800 of us here.

282
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:49,503
We're jewish.

283
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:53,193
- Yes, we know.
- We're jewish, yeah.

284
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,681
That's an interesting
necklace, cherien.

285
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,064
It looks like a cross.

286
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:03,329
Well, actually... You...

287
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:06,911
You're looking at it sideways.
It's a "x."

288
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,901
You know, it's like one of them

289
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:14,874
"x marks the jew" necklaces
from wal-mart.

290
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:18,152
Wal-mart ?

291
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,869
Okay. Thank you for stopping by.

292
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,111
Okay, I gotta clean my house.

293
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:30,631
Okay. Bye-bye.

294
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,008
We are jewish now.

295
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:41,746
Jesus.

296
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:49,306
Good morning, tuesdays.

297
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,263
- Kimmie.
- Good morning, mr. Rich.

298
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,170
Love that color on you.
Aubrey, how's it going ?

299
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:56,629
Mr. Panetta just nixed
my summer vacation.

300
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,126
Apparently, I haven't
served my full two years.

301
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:03,361
I just bought the tickets.
Four days, five nights, costa rica.

302
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:06,541
- Right. He can do this ?
- Why don't you ask him ?

303
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:08,636
He's in your office.

304
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,898
- What's he doing in my office ?
- I have no idea.

305
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:25,616
- Bright and early.
- Yep. Catching the worm.

306
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,883
Afraid not.
That worm's long gone.

307
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:29,845
I'm always in at six.

308
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,104
So, Doug, got a little matter
I need you to handle.

309
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:39,167
Little pr thing, no big deal.
Right up your alley.

310
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:40,664
Panco sucks !

311
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,360
Where's the other lawyer ?

312
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:51,351
The other gentleman
no longer works here for a reason.

313
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:53,117
I would like to say to you

314
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:57,465
that Panco hears and
understands your grievances,

315
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:01,675
and we are working
to get a quick resolution

316
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,173
to your concerns.

317
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:06,925
If you could now please disperse
and go home, I think we could all get-

318
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,663
This is just another bunch
of Panetta's bullshit.

319
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,584
- Where is Panetta anyway ?
- Mr. Panetta-

320
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,293
We've already told you how to
resolve this. Buy back our homes.

321
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,291
That's the only resolution
that works for us.

322
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:19,062
- Buy back your homes ?
- Why would we buy back your homes ?

323
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:21,677
Because you knowingly
built halcyon trails on the site of a

324
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,985
former military
practice bombing range.

325
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:26,195
There's unexploded ordnance
all over the place.

326
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:29,799
- Ordnance ?
- Bombs, rockets, charges, mines.

327
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,554
Don't forget my dog.

328
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,536
Carol's dog went missing.

329
00:19:33,643 --> 00:19:35,049
And all they found was a leash

330
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,950
and an awfully suspicious
crater out by her doghouse.

331
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:40,565
- Sir, what is your name ?
- Martin Chambers,

332
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:43,385
president of homeowners
against Panco. Ask Panetta !

333
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:46,046
- He knows my name really well.
- Mr. Chambers,

334
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:51,208
we're not interested in people,
or pets blowing up.

335
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:55,551
I mean, I mean, we are completely
against anyone blowing up.

336
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:57,700
I mean, even a little bit.

337
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,945
But you know, sometimes...

338
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,779
sometimes in your life...

339
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:13,541
Shit just happens,

340
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:15,466
you know ?
You know it does.

341
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,803
I mean, you're just going along,
living your own life,

342
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:19,964
living in your house,
just money your own business,

343
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:21,599
suddenly, kapow !

344
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:23,677
Your whole life explodes.

345
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,876
Just like in, uh--

346
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:29,403
well, but then,
what are you gonna do ?

347
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:31,014
You gonna give up ?

348
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:33,659
You gonna just call it a day ?

349
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:41,339
No. No, that's not
what we do.

350
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:43,793
No, we rally.

351
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:47,168
We-- we turn it all around.

352
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:50,520
Because we're americans.

353
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:54,344
We take those grenades and
we turn them in into lemonade,

354
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:58,641
because that's what
distinguishes us from sand crabs.

355
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:01,799
We keep going.

356
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:07,963
And I ask this of you because
I ask nothing less of myself.

357
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:15,386
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

358
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,824
- Hey, how'd it go ?
- Swell.

359
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,188
How long have you been
dealing with these people anyway ?

360
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:27,428
They're all a bunch
of nutcases. I'll back'em down.

361
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:31,565
Thanks for coverin'.
I can't stand that Chambers asshole.

362
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:36,432
I just got off the phone
with Jolinda's Attorney.

363
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:41,166
Your ex-wife.

364
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,429
Apparently, she plans
to start garnishing your wages,

365
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:45,106
unless you make good
on the payments.

366
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:47,820
How long you been
holdin'out on her ?

367
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,665
Oh, I get it, Doug. Believe me,
I get it. Got an ex-wife of my own.

368
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,819
Couple of'em, actually.

369
00:21:58,106 --> 00:22:01,088
Nothin' I'd like more than
to stiff' em on alimony

370
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,703
and child support. But

371
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,525
I don't like trouble, and I don't want
anyone snoopin' around my business,

372
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:11,785
so take care of that,
won't you ?

373
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:15,885
Oh, the attorney didn't have
your address, but...

374
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,928
it's only a matter
of time before he gets it.

375
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:20,534
My ex-wife.

376
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:23,230
They always find you.

377
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:26,435
What do you think,

378
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,008
that Fitzgerald was trying
to say about society ?

379
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:39,500
I don't know.
I don't relate.

380
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:42,299
Well, that aside,
do you think that

381
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:45,901
Fitzgerald was trying to present
a positive portrait of the Rich ?

382
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:48,652
Okay, well, clearly,
fitzgerald was

383
00:22:48,787 --> 00:22:53,571
preoccupied with money and
social status in all of his novels.

384
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,123
So the question, people, is,

385
00:22:57,285 --> 00:23:00,887
do you think that the buchans
ever really accept gatsby ?

386
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,823
- Delilah, have you read this book ?
- It's didi.

387
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:08,588
And, yes. But, no, I don't think
that they ever accepted him

388
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:11,932
'cause he wasn't born
like them. Rich.

389
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,977
You know, he had all that money, and
he threw all those parties and stuff,

390
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,481
but when it really
comes down to it,

391
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,465
people just wanna
stick to their own kind.

392
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:22,465
But gatsby had money.
Why wasn't he happy ?

393
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,653
Well, all the money in the world
couldn't buy him what he really want.

394
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:27,829
the girl.

395
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,283
You know,
money isn't everything.

396
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,577
I guess

397
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:36,195
he just never really
figured that out.

398
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:39,528
Good. Didi,
that's very good.

399
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:45,675
Aubrey. Aubrey...

400
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,704
I want you to do
a little research for me.

401
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:50,173
I'm already working on
the Halcyon trail thing for you.

402
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:52,876
Forget about that for the moment.
This is important.

403
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,275
I want you to find out

404
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:59,130
everything you can,
about this woman's

405
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:01,343
- divorce
- Jolinda Rich ? Who's she ?

406
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,389
Doug's ex-wife.

407
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:06,066
My ex-wife.

408
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:13,295
When I'm nervous, I refer
to mysel in the third person.

409
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,304
So I'm looking for
Douglas Rich versus Jolinda Rich ?

410
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:17,692
Yes. No.

411
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:22,056
Howard Douglas Rich

412
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:25,413
versus Jolinda Rich. Yes.

413
00:24:26,953 --> 00:24:29,210
So am I looking for anything specific ?
I mean,

414
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:30,947
this was your divorce, right ?

415
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:33,562
Yes, but it was traumatic,

416
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,320
so I've just blanked
everything out.

417
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:38,058
Whatever.

418
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:41,138
Oh, and, Aubrey, Aubrey.
Also,

419
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:46,528
find out everything you can
about this pensacola divorce attorney.

420
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,388
- Randall prutt the third ?
- Yeah, everything you can.

421
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:04,075
Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't report you to the cops

422
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,514
for stealing my wheels.

423
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:08,331
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Is that a good reason ?

424
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:10,593
I saw you return
the car last night.

425
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,321
Look, wait.

426
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,187
Oh, you think you're hot shit,
don't you ?

427
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:18,024
So, hot shit...

428
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,756
Can you break
into anything else ?

429
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:28,201
What'd you have in mind ?

430
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:29,728
An ex-wife ?

431
00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:36,915
- He has an ex-wife ?
- No, it's not-

432
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:40,727
- Oh, god, it's over. We are screwed.
- No, no. You're panicking.

433
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:44,414
I'm being realistic.
We have gotta get out of here now.

434
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:46,556
- Look, baby-
- Don't touch me.

435
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:50,336
I told you this would happen.
I told you this would happen !

436
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:52,494
That woman on the phone,
she knows where we are.

437
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:56,152
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does. She called today.

438
00:25:56,953 --> 00:26:00,011
You told me not
to answer the phone.

439
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:01,698
What's she gonna do
when she shows up,

440
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:03,866
and she finds you impersonating
her ex-husband,

441
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:07,215
and us living in this house,
stealing all of his stuff ?

442
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,597
Calm down.
I am not going back to prison.

443
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:12,141
- No, you are not going back to prison.
- That's right,

444
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:15,431
'cause if anyone's going back to prison
this time, it is gonna be you.

445
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:21,027
And that way, you get to feel what
it's like to be scared and alone.

446
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:26,306
Is that why you started using ?

447
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:30,533
Those tracks on your arms,
they're not mosquito bites, are they ?

448
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:43,068
Don't you think we got bigger things
to think about right now ?

449
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:46,778
Like how come,
once again, I listened to you

450
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:48,561
and this has all turned to shit.

451
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,374
I wanna know if you're getting high.
I want the truth.

452
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:53,048
You want the truth ?

453
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:58,097
The truth is I'm pretty sure
I can't trust you anymore.

454
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:01,364
That is the truth.

455
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,502
That is the goddamn truth.

456
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,746
<i>- Aubrey,
- Yeah ?</i>

457
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,113
tell Hugh I'll be unavailable today
'cause I'll be in the field.

458
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,676
<i>Where are you going ?</i>

459
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:19,556
<i>- You know the field ?
- Yeah.</i>

460
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:21,168
Well, I'll be in it.

461
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,982
Okay, you can reach me
on the cell phone.

462
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:26,635
- Where are you going ?
- Don't even start. You need me.

463
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:31,026
- How much you got there ?
- Seventeen grand.

464
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:33,594
Cash advance on some
of Doug's plastic.

465
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:35,472
What about the lawyer guy ?

466
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:38,125
Aubrey's done some research.

467
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:42,428
Seems he isn't exactly big potatoes.
Works out of an office in pensacola.

468
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:44,881
Works solo.

469
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:46,468
Member of the local turf club,

470
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:49,280
got suspended once for
some kind of financial impropriety.

471
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:52,146
- Gambler.
- I think.

472
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:57,022
- Still, I could be wrong.
- I know.

473
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:01,308
Okay. I'm struggling here.
Why do you wanna break into the school ?

474
00:28:01,423 --> 00:28:03,534
Believe me.
There's nothing here worth anything.

475
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,165
See, that's where
you're wrong, man.

476
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:07,536
The school computers
are the key to our futures.

477
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:09,034
You get us inside that building,

478
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:11,079
my buddy lane here
will take care of the rest.

479
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:12,703
- Got an alarm system ?
- Yeah.

480
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:14,611
Video surveillance,
motion sensors ?

481
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:16,118
- Hell, no.
- Oh, shit.

482
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:18,998
- This is gonna be a piece of cake.
- How do you know all of this ?

483
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,091
Prison.

484
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:43,220
I'm not using.

485
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:56,193
Personally, I don't get these guys
with money who think

486
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:59,148
they can just walk away
from their responsibilities.

487
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:01,837
But it makes us
a good living, don't it, jeff ?

488
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:05,527
Well, it certainly helps pay
for some of those trips to tahiti.

489
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,869
Sorry, I'm late, darling.
Sorry.

490
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:11,604
- How do you do ?
- Randall Prutt,

491
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,029
may I present
Julia Gardner-Jones.

492
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,281
- It's nice to meet you, ma'am.
- Nice to meet you.

493
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:16,474
So sorry about all of this.

494
00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:18,560
You buy a Maserati
and what you don't know

495
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:21,569
is how long it spends
in the garage getting tuned up.

496
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:23,789
I mean, what is it,
a bloody cello ?

497
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:27,374
Anyway, down to business.

498
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,551
Now, the good news is,
is that our client

499
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,142
has agreed to give
Jolinda the sum total

500
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:37,303
of his liquid assets,
which is here.

501
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,059
And how much would that be ?

502
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,086
$17,000.

503
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:49,126
- 17,000 ?
- Yeah.

504
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,719
The bastard owes 75.

505
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,185
Holy shit.

506
00:29:57,304 --> 00:29:59,436
I mean, this is a down
payment, of course.

507
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:03,665
17,000. The rest will be paid
in six months or so.

508
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:08,801
Probably less time.

509
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:13,888
Last time I checked, your client
had half a million dollars in assets.

510
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,754
Then it disappeared
along with Doug,

511
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:18,778
and the trail went cold.

512
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,399
So where's he hiding
the extra 483 grand ?

513
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:24,315
Stocks ? Real estate ?

514
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:28,345
Are you implyin' that our client
has some sort of secret investment ?

515
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:30,101
And how is he payin' you ?

516
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:33,163
Or are you flyin' to
Tahiti on your charm ?

517
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:35,858
We are not at liberty to discuss this.
It's a total violation-

518
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:38,043
to hell with
attorney-client privilege.

519
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:40,720
I'm guessin' that our Doug

520
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:43,908
has sucked his money away
in some golden goose,

521
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:46,971
and you're gettin' the benefit
of one or two eggs.

522
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,452
That's the first time I've heard royal
rhapsody referred to as a golden goose.

523
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:56,532
Darling ?
Royal rhapsody, huh ?

524
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:58,536
Is that a racehorse ?

525
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,936
Oh, my golly gosh.

526
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:02,359
We have to go.

527
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,696
We have to catch
a flight to Monte-Carlo.

528
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:07,271
I know a thing or two
about horses racin', you know, and-

529
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,709
Oh, well, horses are fine for
a couple of thousand here or there.

530
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,608
Very sorry about this situation.
Look, just call me on the mobile.

531
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:16,542
We don't take off till 3 :00.

532
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:18,040
So sorry.

533
00:31:18,685 --> 00:31:20,072
Thanks awfully.

534
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:50,717
We just moved in.

535
00:31:52,198 --> 00:31:53,702
It's very nice.

536
00:31:56,736 --> 00:31:59,942
We- we haven't really
had a chance to unpack or

537
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:03,461
really do anything at all.

538
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:08,158
It's cool.

539
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:14,273
Shit. It's almost 3:00.

540
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:16,243
What do we do now?

541
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,592
I mean, he doesn't have to dig very
deep to find out we're full of shit.

542
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:23,766
Damn.

543
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:25,933
I thought I could smell his greed.

544
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:28,702
Maybe your instincts are
off like last time.

545
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:32,425
The credit card scam was a bad idea.

546
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:35,484
I never liked it, I told you,
and you didn't listen,

547
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:37,837
because you're too busy
being turned on by the risk.

548
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:40,872
- It was no big deal.
- No, not until they busted me.

549
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,187
I trusted you.

550
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:45,941
I trusted your instincts.

551
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,904
I don't know what I can do about that.
I cannot do anything about that.

552
00:32:48,905 --> 00:32:52,675
- I can't give you the two years back.
- I'm not talkin' about two years.

553
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:54,083
Screw them.

554
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,078
I'm talkin' about right now

555
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:58,542
and how you do not trust me at all.

556
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:01,060
Because you keep getting
high and lying about it.

557
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:03,054
My god. Jesus!

558
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,948
You wanna go there?!

559
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,121
Do you?!

560
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,836
I started using speed in prison,

561
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:15,326
and it turns out,
I really, really liked it.

562
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:17,821
- I knew it was bad--
- it wasn't that bad.

563
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,455
Prison wasn't that bad.

564
00:33:19,768 --> 00:33:22,225
What was bad was
the way I felt about you.

565
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:30,469
Do you have any idea

566
00:33:31,298 --> 00:33:34,990
what it is like to hate the personn,
you love the most in the world.

567
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:39,344
And all you can do to escape
feeling that way

568
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:41,621
is getting amped.

569
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,260
This is part of who I am now,

570
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:48,403
no matter where we live,

571
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:50,938
no matter who I'm pretending to be.

572
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:56,371
I have not

573
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:59,078
shot crystal meth
since I left prison.

574
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:06,910
It's him.

575
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:14,112
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

576
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,231
We're in the bloody plane.

577
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:18,578
All right, we'll be there
in five minutes.

578
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:22,138
That's an f.

579
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:26,902
- "a" minor.
- "a" minor.

580
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:48,752
Weird.

581
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,517
Alpacas.

582
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:04,684
I'll be damned.

583
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:07,733
- I can only imagine what--
- Can the shit, julia.

584
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:10,534
There are no secrets
in the age of Google.

585
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:12,982
Royal rhapsody is an Alpaca,

586
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,760
sold for $600,000 at auction in 2003.

587
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:19,201
Now his whole line is ready to breed.

588
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:21,250
What's your point, Randy?

589
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:24,747
What if I had a way
to satisfy your fee

590
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:26,882
and my client's judgment

591
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:28,368
in cash,

592
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:32,779
not even a little money left ever
for you guys to put in your pockets?

593
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:34,961
You're heroes, I'm a hero,

594
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:38,293
y'all spend a few extra weeks
on the beach in Monte Carlo.

595
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:40,171
We're listening.

596
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,455
I can tell you guys aren't stupid,

597
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,426
so I'm assuming

598
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:46,928
Doug's planning to pay
you with a very

599
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:48,657
special Alpaca.

600
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:53,069
Hercules is worth more to us
than a few weeks on the beach.

601
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:56,844
He's the last herdshire
of his generation

602
00:35:56,969 --> 00:35:58,752
that Doug is willing to part with.

603
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:00,089
And he's not for sale.

604
00:36:00,246 --> 00:36:01,630
Everything's for sale.

605
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:03,328
Everything's for sale

606
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:05,987
You see,

607
00:36:06,508 --> 00:36:07,541
my wife,

608
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,014
is an animal lover,

609
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,525
and her birthday is
comin' up next month,

610
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,732
and I think she'd just love
little ol' Hercules.

611
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,672
I'll give you

612
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:19,798
80 gs.

613
00:36:20,698 --> 00:36:22,200
You've got to be joking.

614
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:24,492
I mean, his stud fee alone is 5,000.

615
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:26,033
Per squirt.

616
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:30,719
And if the filly's feeling frisky
and he gets off twice

617
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,565
- it's double.
- Ninety, then.

618
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:33,691
He's not for sale.

619
00:36:33,801 --> 00:36:35,318
I'd rather sell julia.

620
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:38,213
Come on, folks.

621
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,637
We all know this is the best way.

622
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:42,452
This way, we all get off fat.

623
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,243
And you know very well

624
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:46,214
that if I come after your client,

625
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:48,686
you may not be able to hold on
to that Alpaca anyway.

626
00:36:48,818 --> 00:36:51,009
You must be aware that
this is all highly unethical.

627
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:53,168
I don't get win if you made
this kind of proposal.

628
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:54,372
you could be...

629
00:36:58,084 --> 00:36:59,570
- Disbarred.
- Disbarred.

630
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:02,668
You mean, we could
all be disbarred,

631
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:05,092
which is why
I'm not worried about it.

632
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:07,423
I know that you'll perform
to the letter.

633
00:37:08,455 --> 00:37:09,550
One hundred

634
00:37:09,902 --> 00:37:11,153
and twenty grand,

635
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,312
and that's it.

636
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:19,536
And only because

637
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:21,914
I love my wife.

638
00:37:56,114 --> 00:37:58,265
You don't have to give her all of it.

639
00:37:59,203 --> 00:38:03,294
What do we do when Prutt figures out
that Hercules is shooting blanks?

640
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:06,220
What's he gonna do, call the cops?

641
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:15,366
Be careful.

642
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:32,583
God damn it, Wayne.

643
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,476
I wish I could offer you
more than money.

644
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:44,728
You can.

645
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,605
I can?

646
00:38:46,762 --> 00:38:48,342
I want an apology

647
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,648
from him

648
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,025
in his own words

649
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:55,739
That could be a little hard
to get right now.

650
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,509
I won't accept this money
without an apology.

651
00:38:58,681 --> 00:38:59,948
He owes it to me.

652
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:02,779
Well...

653
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:11,502
I'll see if I can get him
on the phone.

654
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,177
What are you doing?

655
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:17,650
What are you doing?

656
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:20,348
I'm sitting here with Jolinda.

657
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,170
<i>Yes, she's got the money.</i>

658
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:24,353
But she woud like to talk to you.

659
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:25,995
Are you crazy?

660
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:31,343
I actually think
this could help, Doug.

661
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,628
I have no idea what
you're talking about

662
00:39:34,753 --> 00:39:37,100
'cause there's no way
she's gonna believe I'm Doug.

663
00:39:37,905 --> 00:39:39,454
He feels horrible.

664
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:40,627
What?

665
00:39:40,705 --> 00:39:42,911
And he's deeply, deeply sorry.

666
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:44,178
Bullshit.

667
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,353
She's not buying it, Doug.

668
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,388
Well, the woman is pissed off,

669
00:39:54,622 --> 00:39:57,337
and I do not blame her
being married to that bastard.

670
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,253
Ask me, I'm glad he's dead.

671
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:01,224
Okay, Doug, I hear you.

672
00:40:02,906 --> 00:40:05,158
He says he has deep regrets.

673
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:07,318
And,

674
00:40:09,897 --> 00:40:12,494
That he was having
a big ol' mid-life cris,

675
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:13,745
and...

676
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,048
He had a horrible mid-life cris.

677
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:20,410
He gained 80 pounds
and lost all his hair.

678
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:23,195
He's gained a lot of weight,
and he's gone bald.

679
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:26,073
I don't give a shit about his hair.

680
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:28,913
Tell him our house was foreclosed on

681
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:30,806
and my electricity was shut off.

682
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:34,537
His children spent a month
in a homeless shelter.

683
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,954
How does he feel about that?

684
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:38,346
What an asshole.

685
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,569
<i>Did you get that?</i>

686
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:49,673
Tell her he missed his kids more
than he could bear.

687
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:54,335
He says

688
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:56,830
he missed his kids.

689
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:59,169
He sure didn't act like it.

690
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:02,236
Tell her,

691
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,166
they're the only thing
give his life meaning.

692
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,749
And most of the time...

693
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:14,988
He not even really sure
who he is anymore.

694
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:23,206
Tell her anything.

695
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:31,045
He says he's sorry,
he hurt you.

696
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,280
<i>that you're the last person
he wanted to hurt.</i>

697
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:49,693
He's crying.

698
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,913
Crying?

699
00:41:51,586 --> 00:41:53,009
Like a baby.

700
00:41:56,831 --> 00:41:59,428
I'm sorry Doug, what was that,
I didn't get that.

701
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:01,321
I didn't say anything.

702
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:09,433
I think Doug would wish
he could be different.

703
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:11,937
I wish he would
have done it different.

704
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:15,089
And I think
he would ask for forgiveness.

705
00:42:21,955 --> 00:42:24,177
I think may be
we all need to be asking

706
00:42:24,317 --> 00:42:27,619
for little forgiveness
right about now, baby.

707
00:42:29,074 --> 00:42:30,153
I know.

708
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:31,764
I know.

709
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:36,549
<i>I hate you.</i>

710
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:40,132
<i>But it's much than I hate you.</i>

711
00:42:41,149 --> 00:42:43,089
I love our kids even more.

712
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,707
And I'm grateful for that.

713
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:31,354
You're right.

714
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:36,657
About the credit card thing.

715
00:43:38,895 --> 00:43:40,584
He wasn't thinking of anyone.

716
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:44,048
Anything else.

717
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:50,193
It's turn on by the risk.

718
00:43:54,934 --> 00:43:55,982
Sorry.

719
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,612
I'm very, very sorry.

720
00:44:04,248 --> 00:44:05,468
I'm sorry too.

721
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:27,567
Come on up.

722
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:30,602
Hey, help me to close the windows.

723
00:44:33,923 --> 00:44:34,925
Shit.

724
00:44:35,238 --> 00:44:36,677
How are we getting
in there now?

725
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,429
Break the glass.

726
00:44:38,664 --> 00:44:40,933
No, no, children not to worry.

727
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:42,450
This...

728
00:44:42,673 --> 00:44:43,894
called "bumping".

729
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,972
Come on ???.

730
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:49,122
That was too...

731
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:51,717
How freakin' cool is this?

732
00:44:59,189 --> 00:45:01,771
Would you look, The Riches are here.

733
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:05,573
Let me get you a Pomegranate Martini.

734
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:06,754
There are wonderful.

735
00:45:06,942 --> 00:45:08,553
I had three already.

736
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,649
So Jim, how's enginering.

737
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:11,979
Hey neighbors.

738
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,867
You got here before we all take exctasy
and dive naked into the pool.

739
00:45:15,976 --> 00:45:16,977
Seriously?

740
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,314
It's happened.

741
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:22,664
Well, excuse me boys,
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

742
00:45:23,352 --> 00:45:24,354
Come on.

743
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:25,926
I want you to meet some people.

744
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:28,398
I've got something for you.

745
00:45:30,596 --> 00:45:31,629
What's this?

746
00:45:32,293 --> 00:45:33,999
A consolation price.

747
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:36,721
Sold out that dead Alpaca of yours.

748
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:38,645
25,000$

749
00:46:04,773 --> 00:46:06,228
Been there, done that.

750
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:24,596
Come on, let's get a drink.

751
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:28,245
I'm surprise you show your face

752
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,809

playing hookie all day, body.

753
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:32,235
Yeah, you got me, Hugh.

754
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:35,693
You're fired, Doug.

755
00:46:43,573 --> 00:46:44,902
I'm just kidding.

756
00:46:46,357 --> 00:46:47,359
See.

757
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,816
Come on I need another drink.

758
00:46:59,467 --> 00:47:02,299
Okay my man, you now have
an A minus in calculus.

759
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:03,551
Nice.

760
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:05,021
I wanna know something.

761
00:47:05,177 --> 00:47:06,476
What's so great about Princeton.

762
00:47:06,648 --> 00:47:09,417
It's Ivy League man,  in about
a million miles away from my dad.

763
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:12,993
Let's get Avy Vincent
a D in litterature,

764
00:47:13,086 --> 00:47:14,213
she'll totally shit herself.

765
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:16,721
- For sure.
- No. Don't do that.

766
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:19,500
It'll just call the attention
on yourselves if you get caught.

767
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:21,992
You two should go
on a business, though.

768
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,330
What do you mean?

769
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:26,082
It seems that lot of kids
have been looking for good grades.

770
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:27,460
Don't you think?

771
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:30,018
You're a lot smarter
than you look my friend.

772
00:47:30,206 --> 00:47:31,238
Thank you.

773
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:01,075
Come baby.

774
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,600
You come?

775
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,482
By the way,

776
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:11,938
