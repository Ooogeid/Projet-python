<I>Previously on The Riches...</I>

2
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:10,304
- I'm sorry.
- You wanna pretend to be the dead guy?

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:12,989
You want to wear his suits,
and you want me to be his dead wife?

4
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:14,734
Do you really think dad has a plan?

5
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:17,218
He stole the money, ma lost the money,

6
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:19,840
and now we're here
in a dead guy's house.

7
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,955
How'd you get in the front gate?
We live here.

8
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,404
Come and meet our new neighbors.

9
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:25,065
Hi, Nina.
Can I come in?

10
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:26,964
- Well, sure, honey.
- Doug Rich...

11
00:00:27,386 --> 00:00:30,130
was a securities lawyer,
whatever that is.

12
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:32,497
This is not my specialty.

13
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:34,783
I'm a securities lawyer.

14
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:37,148
With your experience,
it should be a piece of cake.

15
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,999
Doug is a republican,
his best friend is Pete.

16
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:43,161
Pete's a mortgage broker from Dallas.
He's e-mailed twice about a golf trip.

17
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:45,591
Why are we gettin' a bill
from Mountain View Nursing Home

18
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:48,858
- for $4,700 a month?
- It's must be where Cherien's mother is

19
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,454
Come on, ma.
We're getting out of here.

20
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:52,944
It's Cherien's mom.

21
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:54,714
She likes it here.

22
00:00:57,615 --> 00:00:59,271
Can you not read the sign?

23
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:01,759
I've already availed my services
to some of your neighbors,

24
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:03,256
Y-your backdoor neighbor.

25
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,408
- Doug Rich?
- That's his name?

26
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:07,718
So Doug Rich, he really
screwed you over on that paint.

27
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,243
He can suck shit in hell for all I care.

28
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:13,338
Hugh's not back yet.

29
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,381
What do you mean, he's not back yet?
W-Where is he? What's he doing?

30
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:20,303
- Hugh, where are you?
- Somewhere in the desert, I'm guessin'.

31
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:22,517
As of this moment,

32
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:24,754
I am in control here.

33
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:31,441
Shit!

34
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,981
Yeah, I just got an e-mail from,
uh, Pete.

35
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:46,446
You remember him.

36
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:49,638
Yeah, he wants to come
visit his friend Doug.

37
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,882
- When did he e-mail?
- Who e-mailed?

38
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:53,298
- Pete.
- Pete who?

39
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,451
Pete, Doug's best friend,
best man at our wedding?

40
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,141
- Oh, that Pete.
- Wants to come visit.

41
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,816
Look, e-mail him back
that both Cherien and I have...

42
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:02,375
the flu.
No, make it bubonic plague.

43
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:03,545
Bubonic plague?

44
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:06,096
Well, he's unlikely to come over
if we got bubonic plague.

45
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:08,349
You know what, that's dumb, honey.
Say it's hepatitis.

46
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:10,830
Hepatis, and tell him
it's more contagious than mono.

47
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,032
- You're late.
- No, I'm not.

48
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:15,703
- It's 10:30.
- It's only a couple of hours.

49
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:18,082
- Well, he's back.
- Hugh?

50
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,164
Whoa, five days gone,
and he waltzes in with no warning?

51
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:24,699
Yep, and he does not waltz in alone.

52
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:26,735
Doug...

53
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,172
great to see you.

54
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,244
Cherien...

55
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:33,752
great to see you.

56
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:35,748
Where the hell have you been?

57
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:39,244
Aubrey, could you
please give us a minute?

58
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,499
Thank you.

59
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,144
I need a break.

60
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:47,939
I really did after
that dinner party of yours.

61
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:49,552
Got a little wild there,

62
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,295
but I feel good now.

63
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:54,309
- I feel real good.
- Obviously.

64
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:56,431
Hugh, five days, we were worried.

65
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:58,695
Oh, no, there's no need for that.
Old Hugh's not...

66
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:01,667
fallin' down any rabbit hole.
No, I went to Taos,

67
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:05,352
did some spirit shit.
Some of that sweat lodge, naked men,

68
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,954
banging on drums thing.

69
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:08,953
Cleaned myself right up.

70
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:10,722
And there you met a...

71
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:12,657
Gymnast.

72
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:15,354
That's GeeGee, and she's a dancer.

73
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:19,134
After Taos,

74
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,842
I felt so clean, uh...

75
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:22,629
And kinda gay.

76
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,878
Kind of freaked me out,
went right to Vegas.

77
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:27,704
A miracle happened.

78
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:29,400
I fell in love.

79
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:31,513
I really fell in love.

80
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,440
And, in part, because of the...

81
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,835
inspirational nature
of your relationship...

82
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:38,743
I married her.

83
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:41,058
Oh, I did.
Looky there. Look it.

84
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:44,129
- You don't fool around, do you?
- I trust my instincts, Doug.

85
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,586
I always have.

86
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:47,026
Oh, a tiny thing...

87
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,992
I neglected to have her sign a pre-nup,

88
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,724
- so fix that, will you?
- A pre-nup?

89
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,232
I learned the hard way.
Everything needs to be in writing, okay?

90
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:58,478
And have it wrapped up
by saturday before the party.

91
00:03:58,578 --> 00:03:59,638
What party?

92
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,219
My wedding reception.

93
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,257
Well, look at you, all clean.

94
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:41,789
Is that how you like it, Dale, clean?

95
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,074
No, ma'am, I certainly do not.

96
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:47,030
You've been playing with my arm,
haven't you?

97
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,170
Haven't you?

98
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:57,996
- I like it.
- Oh, you like it?

99
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,153
- I like that you like it.
- You do?

100
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:07,762
Oh, shit.

101
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:10,312
Oh, hi, darlin'.

102
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:13,249
I was just checkin' the rat traps.

103
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:14,797
It looked good.

104
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,740
Your lucky charms are on the table.

105
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,306
I'll be in in a second.

106
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,232
Stop.

107
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,528
Oh, you're bad.

108
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:26,424
Aw, you have no idea.

109
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,594
I just...
I don't understand. I don't...

110
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:53,781
What is a pre-nup?

111
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,582
Well...

112
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:59,740
it's a kind of contract thing that
buffers make before they tie the knot

113
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,196
because, basically,
they don't trust each other.

114
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:04,725
Then why would they get married?

115
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:07,548
- It's a different way of thinking, baby
- I don't understand.

116
00:06:07,654 --> 00:06:10,442
How can you have a pre-nup
if you already nupped?

117
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:12,259
Then it's a post-nup.

118
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,044
And why would she sign that?

119
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:17,479
I mean, she got him
right where she wants him.

120
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:19,269
Damn.

121
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:22,111
Okay, we got a problem
with your pal Pete.

122
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:23,957
Yeah? We're sick, we got hepatitis.

123
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:25,923
Yeah, he's sorry about that,
feels real bad.

124
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:28,207
The thing is, he's gonna be in town,
and he really wants to see

125
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:29,507
his old buddy Doug.

126
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,373
- He's coming anyway.
- He's comin' anyway.

127
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,176
Shit, Wayne.

<i>It's a Wonderful Lie</i>

135
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:02,341
So what are we supposed to do, Wayne,

136
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,278
when he shows up here lookin'
for Doug and Cherien Rich?

137
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,382
- Yeah, how did he even get the address?
- Doug must've given it to him.

138
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:08,890
We could go hide out.

139
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,927
We could stay in the
RV for a couple of days.

140
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:13,352
- Why don't we just leave?
- I don't want to leave.

141
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:15,714
I don't want to sleep
in the RV anymore, dad.

142
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,674
- What time is he coming?
- Sometime tomorrow.

143
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,655
You know what, we'll just
tell him the Riches have moved.

144
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,833
We have no idea where they've gone.
We're real sorry. See you later.

145
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:26,225
No, I say we tell him
nothing about the Riches.

146
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:29,742
We aren't the Riches, we don't know
the Riches, we never met the Riches.

147
00:07:29,842 --> 00:07:32,836
When he shows up,
we just tell him we're the...

148
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:34,873
the Montpierre family.

149
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:37,124
Wayne and Dahlia Montpierre.

150
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,289
Dad, that's retarded.

151
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,636
- I'm with her.
- Sounds a lot like a sleeper.

152
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:42,004
No, it can work.

153
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:45,794
Just e-mail him back, tell him the fever
has broken, come around about five,

154
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,726
Right. We are gonna de-Rich this house.

155
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,421
- I have to pee.
- Oh, God in heaven.

156
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:05,393
Hi.
Shit

157
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:16,188
Hi, this is... Shit!

158
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:23,654
Hi.
Leave a message.

159
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,911
No, Geegee, it's not a pre-nup.
It's a post-nup,

160
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,139
as in after nuptials.

161
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:38,515
I know what it is...
Bullshit.

162
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,054
I assure you,
this is a very normal legal document.

163
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:46,003
A post-nup is a typical
thing you sign if you haven't

164
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:48,733
- signed a pre-nup.
- All right, if that's the way he feels,

165
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:52,426
then we should just call the whole
thing off. I don't want anything of his.

166
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:56,011
I'm... I'm... I'm a college graduate.
I can take care of myself.

167
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:58,853
- I'm sure you can.
- I need a coke.

168
00:08:59,564 --> 00:09:03,332
- Huh. That didn't go too well, huh?
- Doug!

169
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:06,951
From what I just saw,

170
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,003
my bride doesn't look happy.

171
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:13,508
- She didn't buy the offer?
- I don't think that's the problem.

172
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,592
Not even the part about
the dance scholarship in her name?

173
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,515
I really like your vest.

174
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,555
Thanks.

175
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,027
You know, it's not what you guys think.

176
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,468
I'm not a gold digger.

177
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,793
I put myself through college
by pole dancin'. So what?

178
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:41,250
- I don't need to justify myself to you
or anybody else. - No, you don't.

179
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:45,648
She feels that if you're doubting
the strength of the union so early,

180
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:48,712
- perhaps it's best
if you just walk away. - What?

181
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:52,512
- She has a point.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

182
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:53,657
I love her.

183
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:56,273
I don't want to walk away.
I don't want to walk away.

184
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:59,143
I just don't want her walkin'
away with half of Panco, either.

185
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:05,441
On the off, off, off, remote
chance that something does go sour.

186
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,479
I've been honest with Hugh,
told him I want more from my life.

187
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:12,563
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothin', honey.

188
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,027
- Everyone wants more.
- Even you,

189
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:20,576
- working at a nice place like this,
classy as you are? - Yeah, even me.

190
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,427
With you marrying Hugh,

191
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:28,726
I figure I might move out
of bein' a personal assistant.

192
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:33,544
- Maybe be a sales associate.
- I think you'd be real good at that.

193
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:38,622
- You carry yourself with real
authority, you know. - I do? - Yeah.

194
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:41,875
- Thanks.
- That's somethin' I've been working on.

195
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:44,053
Yeah, well, I'm workin' on...

196
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,120
I'm workin' on some things, too.

197
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:52,278
- She's brought me love, Doug.
I'm a changed man. - Really?

198
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:55,396
I took a long, hard look
at my life over the last five days.

199
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:58,062
I realized I was missin' somethin'.

200
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:02,042
- I was lonely.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:03,738
Now, you and Cherien,

202
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,628
You got somethin' there.
It's...

203
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,686
- Call it love, call it chemistry.
Why shouldn't I have that? - No reason.

204
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:18,652
- I figured you weren't ever
gonna hand over Cherien. - What?

205
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,420
And then I met Geegee, and

206
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:26,040
she has made me
a different person.

207
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:28,531
I'm a kinder, gentler person.

208
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,359
So, fix that, will you?

209
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:40,436
I got to call the caterer.
She wants a white wedding

210
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,908
and I'm gonna give it
to her, by God.

211
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,467
Kimmie, where's the goddamn
latte I asked for?! I need my caffeine!

212
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:51,520
Please.

213
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,793
Do you think Hugh really loves me,

214
00:11:55,736 --> 00:12:00,261
- or am I just a little Vegas toy?
- I think he loves you.

215
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:05,170
- But, I mean, it's up to you
to decide what you are. - Yeah.

216
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:10,355
Would you tell me if he didn't love me?

217
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:16,146
Yeah, if I was you, I wouldn't.
It'd be easier to lie.

218
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:21,144
- It's always easier to lie.
- Excuse me, Cherien.

219
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:23,999
Dr. Cal just phoned.
It's almost five.

220
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:26,127
Aw, shit.

221
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:29,696
- Bye.
- Bye.

222
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,783
- His car's out front.
- He just pulled up

223
00:12:43,836 --> 00:12:46,234
- but he's not gettin' out of the car.
- What's he doin'?

224
00:12:46,368 --> 00:12:49,520
- Who knows?
- Okay, everybody ready?

225
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:53,762
Oh, shit.

226
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:09,722
Hello.

227
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,648
Uh, hi.

228
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:13,829
Is, uh, Doug here?

229
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:16,497
Doug. Doug who?

230
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:19,885
Doug Rich.

231
00:13:21,777 --> 00:13:24,565
No. Uh, no Doug Rich.

232
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:34,275
- Montpierre?
- Yes, I'm Wayne,

233
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,861
and my wife, Dahlia...
Oh, here she is.

234
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:40,658
- Darling, this is Pete...
- Mintzy. Pete Mintzy.

235
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:43,353
Hi. How do you do?
I'm Dahlia Montpierre.

236
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,656
He's looking for his friend

237
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:48,173
- whose name is... I am sorry.
- Doug Rich.

238
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:51,124
He e-mailed me he was sick.
That's...

239
00:13:51,312 --> 00:13:54,133
- why I brought him the soup.
- Well, that's nice of you.

240
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:56,800
- May I...
- Yeah. There.

241
00:13:56,948 --> 00:14:00,153
His friend used our
house as his home address.

242
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:02,625
- And you've lived here...
- Little while now.

243
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,925
- That's strange.
- Now, honey, is this something

244
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,723
we should be concerned about?

245
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:10,086
This Doug Rich person who
seems to know where we live,

246
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,914
and, pardon me, but is he involved
in any kind of criminal element?

247
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:17,022
- Because we do have children
to consider. - No, certainly not.

248
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:18,624
Are you sure? Because...

249
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,005
Dahlia is right. We have children.

250
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:27,465
- Hi, mom. Hi, dad.
- Hey, we're goin' to the park

251
00:14:27,593 --> 00:14:29,634
shoot some hoops with
the other neighborhood kids.

252
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:32,913
- Okay. Well, be back before dark.
- Sure. - Take care.

253
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:36,665
Hey, mom, uh...
I just put the lasagna in the oven.

254
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,055
- Want to know if there's
anything else I could do.

255
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:41,955
- No sweetheart. Go on upstairs
and finish your homework. - Okay.

256
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:46,361
They're good kids.
I'm so sorry we couldn't help you.

257
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,630
The front door was open, so...
Oh, I'm sorry,

258
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:53,189
- I didn't know you had company.
- I was just going.

259
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:56,734
- The Montpierres have been more
than kind. - Uh-huh, the Montpierres.

260
00:14:56,954 --> 00:15:01,147
That is...
Oh, thank you for your generosity, and

261
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:03,935
and thank you so much for my tray,
bringin' that back

262
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:05,766
and your
understanding, Nina.

263
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,915
Well, you're entirely welcome, Dahlia...

264
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:12,218
...Montpierre.

265
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:17,538
- So, Pete, I am sorry this is a
dead end. - Yeah, so sorry, Pete.

266
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:20,184
I never thought Doug would
pull something like this.

267
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:23,939
I mean, my best friend,
and he's avoiding me?

268
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:27,712
I guess I'm just gonna have to
try and track down his ex-wife Jolinda.

269
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,693
Pete!

270
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:33,323
It's almost 6:00, cocktail hour

271
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,202
We can't let you head
out on the open road

272
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:37,290
without having a cocktail,
for God sakes. - Yeah.

273
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:41,155
- Come and have a cocktail.
- Are you sure? - Southern hospitality.

274
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,606
So, is Jolinda Rich from Tampa?

275
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:50,353
I think so.
I only met her once.

276
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:58,273
- Got it.
- Told you he was good.

277
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:01,255
Reception here is really awful.

278
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:03,633
If you'd like to try a
phone, there's one in the kitchen.

279
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,997
There might be more privacy.

280
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,845
Okay, thank you.

281
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:09,566
That was fast.
It's on the counter.

282
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:11,302
Oh, I think I hear grandma.

283
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,380
Hello?
Is this Jolinda?

284
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:30,782
Jolinda Rich?

285
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:32,348
Who's this speaking?

286
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:35,668
Uh, this is pete mintzy from tampa.

287
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,741
I'm a friend of your ex-husband's.

288
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,369
Oh, yeah, I remember you, pete.

289
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:41,460
Uh, good.

290
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:48,011
Um, listen, I'm looking for Doug.

291
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:49,894
Oh, well, join the club.

292
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:52,216
I ain't seen him since he ran out on us.

293
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:53,357
Well...

294
00:16:56,184 --> 00:16:58,741
Um, sent me his new
address in Edenfalls.

295
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:00,888
He's been e-mailing me since he moved,

296
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,577
but when I showed up here,
it

297
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:05,706
turns out to be completely
the wrong place.

298
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,492
- So, I'm wondering...
- Let me stop you right there, pete.

299
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,143
you don't get it, do you?

300
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:12,468
What do you mean?

301
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:14,457
The only one reason why

302
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:16,592
Doug doesn't want to
talk to someone is because

303
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:18,196
he don't want to.

304
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:19,463
All right?

305
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:21,492
That's just how it is.

306
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,395
No, no, you don't understand.
We're really great friends.

307
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,096
I was best man at his wedding.

308
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:28,313
Uh, you know, the second one.

309
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:30,677
I hate to be the one to
tell you this, pete, but

310
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:33,125
Doug Rich was no real friend of yours.

311
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,976
I don't know what you're talking about.

312
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,914
We were golf buddies.

313
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:41,741
We went fishing together.
Don't tell me he wasn't my friend.

314
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:43,983
I paid for his bachelor party,
for God's sakes.

315
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:46,725
Okay. Well, I'm sure you did,
and I'm sure you paid for a lot of

316
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,715
- things, pete.
- Well, look, you know what?

317
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:50,891
You clearly have your
own issues with Doug,

318
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:53,389
but don't confuse those
with my situation, all right?

319
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,480
Maybe you don't know the Doug I know,

320
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:00,468
You know, maybe that's why he left you.

321
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,140
You know what, pete?

322
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:04,605
Let me just tell you a
few things about Doug here.

323
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:07,768
The house was foreclosed on because
of him. They shut off the electricity,

324
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,715
shut off the phone, shut off the gas.

325
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,970
I had to move me and the kids into a
homeless shelter for a month, all right?

326
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,581
He did not like you.

327
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,849
He used to call you "pete the patsy." he
used to laugh at you behind your back.

328
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,738
You know, he only let you hang
out because he felt sorry for you,

329
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,800
all right? So you are better
off without him. You hear me?

330
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:26,410
Move on with your life, forget
all about Doug Rich.

331
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:29,307
Doug Rich is a dick, all right?

332
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:30,536
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,436
Hey, kids, stop it!

334
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:34,779
I got to go.
My kids are killin' each other.

335
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,034
Okay? All right.

336
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:37,732
Goodbye.

337
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:39,369
God damn it.

338
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,014
So how'd it go?

339
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:00,668
Doug Rich...

340
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:05,096
Is the biggest asshole in the universe.

341
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:07,624
I know you.

342
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:10,204
Poor mama.
Completely senile.

343
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:12,841
Loves crackers.
Have another cracker there, mama.

344
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,316
How did she get in here?

345
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,342
I don't know.
It's, uh, bath time, right?

346
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:21,750
- Come on, grandma.
- Was Jolinda any help?

347
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:24,477
You know, ma, it turns out

348
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:27,972
that Doug Rich is the
biggest asshole in the universe.

349
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:29,550
I'm so sorry.

350
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:30,978
Really, I'm so sorry, pete.

351
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,489
Maybe it was for the best you
couldn't find Doug, but

352
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,128
- terrific to meet you.
- I need to talk to leif.

353
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:38,280
- Leif?
- Like a tree leaf?

354
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,978
Leif is my shrink.
He's norwegian.

355
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:43,333
I know you.

356
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:49,228
Grandma, you smell so good. Let's go to
the mall or something. How about that?

357
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:51,995
I'll take a large cinnabun.

358
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,435
Leif, it's pete.

359
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:56,330
- I am in cris.
- You're not Cherien.

360
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,649
I don't give a shit if you
are on vacation at the kea lani.

361
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:02,899
Something really major just went down,

362
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:06,201
and we need to process.
Call me as soon as you get this.

363
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,538
You norwegian sack of shit!

364
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:11,661
Okay, pete.

365
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:13,781
Well, I am so sorry I
couldn't be of more help

366
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:16,045
in finding Doug, but
you have a good trip back.

367
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:18,567
I was a joke to Doug!
He didn't even like me!

368
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:20,391
All those years,

369
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,866
all those nights,

370
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,456
driving around...

371
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:26,564
I'm hot!

372
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:30,504
Talking all night.

373
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:33,178
My best friend.

374
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:35,721
I'm really sorry.

375
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,422
My throat's closing up.

376
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:40,011
I can't breathe.

377
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:44,023
I gotta talk to leif.
He knows how to talk me down.

378
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:47,431
I'm gonna go talk to Nina.

379
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:56,689
So, when you call leif, does
he call back real quick?

380
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:00,272
Within a couple of days.

381
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:08,639
As it turns out...

382
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:11,909
I'm a shrink.

383
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:25,966
Dahlia montpierre?

384
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,271
Yeah.
I know, it's weird.
I know,

385
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:30,828
- it's strange. It's just...
- You can say that.

386
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,839
Well, Nina, see,

387
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:40,297
- the thing...pretending...
- You know, Dahlia,

388
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:42,596
for a while now,
I've been noticing that things

389
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:45,347
don't
quite add up with you folks.

390
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:51,242
I mean, the money in
the lawn chair thing.

391
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,667
Who keeps that much cash around?

392
00:21:55,362 --> 00:21:57,497
Or the way you were a
dental hygienist one minute

393
00:21:57,544 --> 00:21:59,440
and something completely
different the next.

394
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,819
Or how you got your kids into
Rosemere in the middle of the year,

395
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,978
and nobody does that.

396
00:22:08,385 --> 00:22:10,133
Yeah, I've been noticing things.

397
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:12,441
A whole bunch of things.

398
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,799
So, I've been thinkin' about it,

399
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,092
and I finally figured it out.

400
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:24,617
Y'all are in the witness
protection program.

401
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:28,837
What?
Jesus.

402
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:36,022
I knew it.
I knew it!

403
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,209
Don't worry about me.
My lips are sealed.

404
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,813
I won't tell Jim or wes or...

405
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,792
I mean, even though Jim thought
y'all were strange from the get.

406
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:45,195
So,

407
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:48,174
who is that pete guy?

408
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,280
- Okay, look.
- It's okay. Shh shh.

409
00:22:54,617 --> 00:22:55,907
I get it.

410
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,063
I get it.

411
00:23:02,162 --> 00:23:03,171
Well,

412
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,570
thank you for not blowin'
our cover with him.

413
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,183
you're the only one who knows.

414
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,881
That means the world to me.

415
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,459
Thanks.

416
00:23:22,095 --> 00:23:23,667
Got you covered.

417
00:23:34,283 --> 00:23:36,089
I have intimacy issues.

418
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:38,283
- Intimacy.
- That's what leif says.

419
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:42,769
He thinks I'm...

420
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,151
Anxious about...

421
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:49,591
my penis.

422
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,324
Your penis?

423
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:54,417
About...

424
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,338
Having it amputated.

425
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,659
So you're having your penis amputated?

426
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:06,184
God, no, man, are you insane?

427
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,619
It's a primal fear.

428
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:10,027
Yes, of course.

429
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,955
Th... That's what I'm talking about.

430
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:16,754
Yeah, I'm talking about trust because...

431
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:23,124
He cut my dick off.

432
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,743
So he cut your dick off.

433
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:29,068
My... My metaphorical dick, of course.

434
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:32,755
Your metaphorical dick,
of course. Thank God.

435
00:24:32,932 --> 00:24:35,978
And I wish I could tell him

436
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:37,795
what it feels like.

437
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:40,155
I am not a joke, Wayne.

438
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:46,047
That cock shit mother thinks
he can go around mocking me?

439
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:48,550
I want to hurt him, Wayne.

440
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:54,200
I want to hurt him like he hurt me.

441
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,021
Do it.

442
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:00,409
Really?

443
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:01,767
Absolutely.

444
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:03,698
Absolutely.

445
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:08,990
You don't have to take
that Doug Rich shit anymore.

446
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:13,993
You go back to your hotel room,

447
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:18,613
get your computer, write an e-mail,

448
00:25:19,456 --> 00:25:20,758
get it all out.

449
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:22,632
Hurt him.

450
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:25,064
Kick the shit out of him.

451
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,609
The metaphorical shit, of course.

452
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:30,770
And then you leave.

453
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,572
That's it.

454
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,532
Change your e-mail.

455
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:39,623
Put as much distance between you
and Doug Rich as you possibly can

456
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:42,942
and get him out of your mind

457
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:45,116
forever.

458
00:25:50,794 --> 00:25:52,854
God, you're even better than leif.

459
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,948
She hasn't signed it.

460
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:00,321
Okay, Hugh,

461
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:02,180
I'll get it done.

462
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:06,657
No, I got a plan.

463
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:09,388
What's your plan?

464
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:11,448
- You.
- Me?

465
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:13,707
- You got to talk to her, baby.
- Why?

466
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:16,997
Because she doesn't trust me.
I am a lawyer.

467
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,415
- More importantly, I'm Hugh's lawyer.
- You know what, here's the thing.

468
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,376
I can't get behind this whole
buffer pre-nup bullshit,

469
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,591
you know?

470
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:26,451
Is that really all they care about?

471
00:26:26,537 --> 00:26:28,096
Just their stuff?

472
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,857
Hugh has been screwed over
by a lot of his ex-wives.

473
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,246
Well, maybe he had it comin'.

474
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,148
I'm just sayin'.

475
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:40,010
I don't want to be a buffer if it
means livin' by a legal document.

476
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:44,300
look at it this way.

477
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:47,018
Geegee

478
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:48,906
could end up with part of Panco.

479
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:51,079
Do we really want a stripper

480
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:53,325
in control of our future?

481
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,099
She went to college.

482
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:57,173
Well...

483
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,391
Do it for me.

484
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:02,922
Do that woman-to-woman thing.

485
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:07,299
You ever get sick of lyin'?

486
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:09,587
This is not lying. This is

487
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:11,432
creative reasoning.

488
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,907
It's lying. It's all we do now.

489
00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:16,672
It's all we did as travelers, baby.

490
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:19,264
No, we never lied to our friends.

491
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:22,885
We lied to the outside world,
who the hell cares?

492
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:25,612
Well, things are different here.

493
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:29,745
If a lie can produce a
better result, then we lie.

494
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:33,813
If we want to stay here,
if we want our kids

495
00:27:34,572 --> 00:27:37,925
to have this kind of life, go to school,
learn to become somebody,

496
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:40,092
then we got to maintain the lie.

497
00:27:44,786 --> 00:27:47,311
But... What if we start
to forget the truth?

498
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:49,524
You know,

499
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:51,535
about who we are?

500
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,038
We'll never forget who we are.

501
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:57,302
It's locked into our dna.

502
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:04,788
I feel bad about what
I said to that pete guy.

503
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:07,089
That was a mean lie.

504
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:09,772
Yeah, but it did the trick, didn't it?

505
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:13,771
I guess.

506
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,068
Had to do it.

507
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:23,006
Yeah, I will have him call you.

508
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:26,375
- Hugh has called three time already.
- It's 8:15.

509
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:28,142
He wants to know
whether you've fixed it.

510
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,697
He's already had two xanax, and
they're not working. I have to tell you,

511
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:33,054
- he was not this anxious
at his other weddings. - Well,

512
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,108
maybe he really,

513
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:35,485
really, really,

514
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:36,752
really loves her.

515
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:38,995
I put the lloyd contract on your desk.

516
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:40,927
- I need it back today.
- All right.

517
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,064
Pete.

518
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,205
No, I am

519
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:50,420
really, really, really, really busy.

520
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,360
That was the best day of my life.

521
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:04,431
Oh, man, you look hot.

522
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:06,447
I ain't never been to vegas.

523
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:08,818
Kind of sucks.

524
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,703
Well, look.

525
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:12,507
Some mothers are bitches.

526
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:15,213
I mean, that's all there is to it.
Don't get me started on this.

527
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,206
I thought Hugh really loved me.

528
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,483
He does.

529
00:29:18,696 --> 00:29:21,676
Then why's he trying to get me
to sign that damn thing?

530
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:24,263
You know, it's almost
like he don't trust me.

531
00:29:24,374 --> 00:29:25,377
Honey,

532
00:29:25,478 --> 00:29:27,363
men are just like little boys sometimes.

533
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,701
You know, they're just scared someone's
gonna come and take away all their toys.

534
00:29:30,861 --> 00:29:32,391
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

535
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:35,452
I don't even care about his ol' money.

536
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,858
Oh, bullshit.
Everyone cares about money.

537
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:41,577
I've had it, and I've lost it, and we
both know it is better to have it.

538
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:43,061
It can't buy happiness.

539
00:29:43,497 --> 00:29:45,828
Yeah, but it can buy you
really great clothes

540
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:48,891
and a lot of shoes and a huge house

541
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:52,226
and all this stuff, and then you can
decide who it is you want to be.

542
00:29:54,802 --> 00:29:56,664
But you're right.
It can't buy you happiness.

543
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,950
And it ain't romantic.

544
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,795
No, it ain't romantic.

545
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,223
Well, some women were just
not meant to be mothers,

546
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:06,885
right?

547
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:09,185
Shit, I wouldn't sign this, either,

548
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,165
not unless there was
somethin' in it for me.

549
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:13,638
What do you mean?

550
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:15,209
I've been lookin' on the internet.

551
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,881
These things go both ways.

552
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,614
You can put all kinds of shit in there.

553
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:20,094
Hugh cheats on you,

554
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,239
ka-ching,

555
00:30:21,312 --> 00:30:23,369
five hundred grand in your bank account.

556
00:30:23,936 --> 00:30:26,713
I read about that catherine zeta
who's-it, she put that in there.

557
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,314
- I could do that?
- Yeah.

558
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:30,827
You don't want to do it doggy style?

559
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:33,229
Put it in your post-nup.

560
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:37,033
He's mean to your mother?

561
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:39,102
A new camaro.

562
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:40,616
I can really do that?

563
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:41,655
Honey,

564
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:43,871
it's all part of the negotiation,

565
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:46,587
you know? And let me
be the first to tell you...

566
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:48,289
That is all marriage is.

567
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:53,686
Well,

568
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,690
I guess I could think about it.

569
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:57,809
I would.

570
00:30:58,176 --> 00:30:59,941
No, I think you're worthy of love.

571
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:01,234
You know what I think, pete?

572
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:02,866
I think this is Doug's problem,

573
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:05,548
you know? He's obviously a
superficial son of a bitch.

574
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:06,986
He doesn't care for anyone.

575
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:11,184
No, no, that's not a good idea.

576
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:14,372
Why don't you have a drink?

577
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,653
Really?

578
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:18,672
That many?

579
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:23,102
Now, come on, pete. Don't be dramatic.

580
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:26,243
No, don't say that. I don't want
to hear you talking like that.

581
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,539
Look, pete, I got to go.

582
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:30,126
I got a lot of customers here.

583
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:31,455
Uh, patients.

584
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,328
We use both words.

585
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:37,256
Okay. Okay. Well, you can try me,
but I won't be here.

586
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:38,706
Okay. Good luck.

587
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:43,223
- Jesus, that guy is relentless.
- What did he say?

588
00:31:43,314 --> 00:31:45,187
He said he had a tragic childhood.

589
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,133
He said it all links back to
abandonment issues with his mother,

590
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,641
and that he's having difficulty
maintaing perspective,

591
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:52,348
and that Doug was his best friend.

592
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,574
Oh, God,

593
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:56,125
I feel awful. That's terrible.

594
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,360
Oh, trust me, he is
just being a big baby.

595
00:31:58,436 --> 00:32:00,128
Well, how bad did he sound?

596
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,236
Not that bad.

597
00:32:02,318 --> 00:32:03,773
I mean, I've heard worse.

598
00:32:04,277 --> 00:32:05,287
He'd been drinking.

599
00:32:05,371 --> 00:32:07,814
This is all our fault. You know,
we pushed him way too far.

600
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,686
He's just looking for a
little attention, that's all.

601
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,152
You call him back. You tell him...

602
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,210
Tell him what?

603
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,556
We're his friends.

604
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:15,654
- We're not his friends.
- Just tell him anyway.

605
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,438
Why should I tell him?
We're trying to get rid of him.

606
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:18,496
Not like that.

607
00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:20,563
Call him back.

608
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:29,264
Oh, my God, he's not answering.

609
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,041
I'm goin' to the hotel.

610
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:34,240
He's probably in the bathroom.

611
00:32:37,244 --> 00:32:38,771
Oh, crap.

612
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:41,284
We gotta open the door.

613
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:54,469
Baby, the door's not opening!
The key doesn't work!

614
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:56,272
- God damn it.
- I gotta pee.

615
00:32:56,489 --> 00:32:57,570
Can I help you?

616
00:32:57,631 --> 00:32:59,926
Yes, three times today, I...

617
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:03,231
I... Something's wrong
with the cards. I don't know.

618
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:04,818
I got to go downstairs and...

619
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:06,525
Oh, thank you.

620
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:08,904
- Thank you very much.
- You need some more towels? Soap?

621
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:16,727
What are you doing here?

622
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:19,200
We were worried about you.

623
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,127
You weren't answering your phone.

624
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,212
Come back inside, pete.

625
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,852
No. I am not comin' inside.

626
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,207
Okay, look...

627
00:33:26,364 --> 00:33:27,458
Say, you do jump.

628
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:28,593
What's gonna happen?

629
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:31,302
Your liver's gonna end
up comin' out your ear,

630
00:33:31,328 --> 00:33:33,132
your brain's gonna be
all over the pavement,

631
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,675
and then someone's gotta clean it up.

632
00:33:34,822 --> 00:33:35,843
Is that what you want?

633
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,645
You know, at the
very least, it's a cliche.

634
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:42,864
Pete, Doug's not worth it.

635
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,472
My life sucks.

636
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:47,117
I don't have any friends.

637
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,577
I just lost my job at balman, rogers.

638
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:54,354
My wife moved out.

639
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:57,904
So I came here...

640
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,781
To talk to my best buddy Doug,
and he shits on me, too.

641
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:03,893
Look, pete.

642
00:34:03,938 --> 00:34:04,948
Don't come any closer.

643
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:06,116
I mean it.

644
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,443
Okay. We could do a session right now.

645
00:34:08,477 --> 00:34:10,610
I don't want to talk to you.

646
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:14,478
I don't want to talk to anyone.
You, leif,

647
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:19,311
You're all full of shit.

648
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,568
What?!

649
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,293
We're all lonely!

650
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,437
No, you're not. You have Wayne.

651
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,402
everyone is lonely
at one time or another,

652
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:34,976
and, God knows, everyone gets lied to.

653
00:34:35,895 --> 00:34:37,596
It's just how it is, man.

654
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:40,727
Life is hard sometimes.

655
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,981
Look, a couple of years back,

656
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:48,997
I was right where you are now,
and I had a really easy way to do it.

657
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:51,186
I just got interrupted,

658
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:52,854
so I didn't do it.

659
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:56,393
I woke up the next mornin'...

660
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,867
I don't know.

661
00:34:58,276 --> 00:34:59,773
I just felt a little better.

662
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:05,267
Pete, you might wake up tomorrow
and just feel a little better.

663
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,612
You jump,

664
00:35:07,297 --> 00:35:09,067
you ain't never gonna know.

665
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:14,236
Come on.

666
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:17,988
Hell, if you don't feel better,

667
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:19,923
there's always tomorrow.

668
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:22,873
What, to kill myself?

669
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:27,027
What's your hurry?

670
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,084
Please come in.

671
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:45,554
Well, that's better.

672
00:35:46,664 --> 00:35:49,472
Well, it ought to be. I maxed out
the credit card on that one.

673
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,584
Really?

674
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:51,692
You have a limit?

675
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,509
Oh, everett's got me on
an allowance for everything.

676
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:58,077
I hate it, but what are you gonna do?
Sure as hell ain't gonna work.

677
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:01,832
A suit like this makes me
look like an asshole...

678
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,123
In a good way.

679
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,710
A suit like this

680
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,602
could make me fall in love with you.

681
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:17,719
Now, where am I gonna wear this suit?

682
00:36:17,906 --> 00:36:19,390
You got any ideas?

683
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:21,775
I might have a few.

684
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,034
Take off the arm.

685
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,437
Slowly.

686
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:44,367
Will you call us from the airport?

687
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,146
- Thanks.
- Bye.

688
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,043
Did you mean what you said in there?

689
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:02,884
About killing yourself?

690
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,903
Well, everybody's thought
about it one time or another.

691
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:28,481
geez, geegee hit the jackpot.

692
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:30,678
Course, she has to live with Hugh.

693
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:37,269
hi, guys.

694
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,527
- Hey, Doug. Kimmie.
- Hi.

695
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:45,250
Isn't this great?

696
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:48,104
I love it when Hugh gets married.
He throws the best parties.

697
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:50,151
Yeah. Let's hope this one works out.

698
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:52,273
His divorces aren't nearly as much fun.

699
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:55,015
Cherien, you look fantastic.

700
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,847
Well, look who's here.

701
00:37:58,123 --> 00:37:59,625
It's the Riches.

702
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,687
Howdy, neighbors.

703
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:18,484
- So how do you know...
- Dale did some work for me

704
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:19,731
on my house.

705
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:21,773
Turns out we got a lot in common.

706
00:38:21,937 --> 00:38:25,256
Hartley tells me that you two
were involved in a legal matter.

707
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,973
She says you are quite a lawyer.

708
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,460
You better believe it.

709
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:32,673
Doug here is the best goddamn
lawyer I ever worked with.

710
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:36,501
Although, I don't know what
you got against doggy style.

711
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:40,766
How are you?

712
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:42,223
How's young everett?

713
00:38:42,347 --> 00:38:44,118
Fine, Hugh. Just fine.

714
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:46,024
This is my friend, Dale Malloy.

715
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:47,151
Glad to have you.

716
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,246
Pleasure.

717
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,729
I got to get a drink.

718
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:53,258
Well, the bar's over there.

719
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:55,195
Would you folks excuse us?

720
00:38:57,748 --> 00:39:01,576
You're lucky I'm in love. Otherwise,
I'd kick your asses right out of here.

721
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:03,303
Oh, look, Dale, shrimp.

722
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:09,068
Shit, Wayne.

723
00:39:09,143 --> 00:39:10,690
Ken must have told him where we are.

724
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,002
What is he doing with
the one-armed bandit?

725
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:16,095
Dale is a psycho. I know he's
playing some kind of game.

726
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:18,122
I'm gonna talk to him.

727
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,084
Hey, there.

728
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:28,614
I've been lookin' for you everywhere.

729
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:30,493
Oh, Nina, you look so pretty.

730
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:32,865
- Where's Jim?
- Jim hates Hugh.

731
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,682
He and wes are home baking.

732
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,850
Wes has got a plan to open up
one of those cupcake places.

733
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,836
Well, that's nice'cause
everyone like cupcakes.

734
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,047
You know, I gotta find Doug.

735
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:42,218
Dahlia, can we talk?

736
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:44,319
- Can have coffee tomorrow morning?
- No. Now.

737
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:51,166
Here, let me top you off.

738
00:39:53,673 --> 00:39:56,165
We have a lot to talk about, my friend.

739
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:58,733
So who dressed you?

740
00:39:58,868 --> 00:39:59,874
I did.

741
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:02,359
So I seen your kids
around the neighborhood.

742
00:40:02,682 --> 00:40:04,799
Dahlia driving a big, fancy...
Oh, I mean,

743
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:08,190
Cherien, driving a big, fancy car.
Wow, you're doin'

744
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,075
really well for yourself,
bein' a successful a-ttorney.

745
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:18,857
You know, in some ways, this is
the happiest I've been in a long time.

746
00:40:19,608 --> 00:40:20,780
It's been a relief,

747
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:22,643
this whole business with Jim.

748
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,069
I mean, like a weight's
come off our shoulders.

749
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,796
I never realized how

750
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,870
hard it was to keep livin' a lie.

751
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:32,876
Or how lonely.

752
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,458
Here's the other thing I've come to.

753
00:40:39,426 --> 00:40:41,725
I can't abide being lied to anymore,

754
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:44,684
not by people I care about.

755
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:52,165
Y'all aren't in the witness
protection program, are you?

756
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:55,605
'cause I been thinkin' about it,
and it just doesn't quite make sense.

757
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,541
I mean, if that pete guy
was with the, say, fbi, then...

758
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:02,786
he'd know you were in
the witness protection program

759
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:04,349
and that you were the Riches,

760
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:06,467
if that's the name they've given you.
I mean,

761
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,035
I don't want to put you on the spot.

762
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,842
What is going on?

763
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:19,778
All right,

764
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,085
all right.

765
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:25,592
Well, you don't have
to tell me anything.

766
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,888
I just wish you wouldn't lie to me.

767
00:41:33,178 --> 00:41:34,891
You're my friend, Nina.

768
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:38,452
I'd never lie to you about that.

769
00:41:41,261 --> 00:41:43,379
Hey, quiet, everybody!

770
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:44,581
Everybody quiet!

771
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,488
Listen up, everybody!

772
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:48,487
Come on over here, honey.

773
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,108
I want to propose a toast

774
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:54,766
to the most beautiful gal

775
00:41:54,886 --> 00:41:56,389
I've ever set eyes on.

776
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:58,267
I've known

777
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:00,445
lots of great women in my day,

778
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,750
but I've never known happiness until...

779
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:07,161
Until I met geegee last week.

780
00:42:07,296 --> 00:42:08,438
What happened?

781
00:42:08,543 --> 00:42:09,655
This little girl

782
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:12,645
has shown me the true meaning of love.

783
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:16,626
She got her hands on my heart,

784
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:20,291
and she hadn't let go, and
I thank God for that. So,

785
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:23,206
to my beautiful bride,

786
00:42:23,957 --> 00:42:25,580
geegee Panetta.

787
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:30,748
Hear! Hear!

788
00:42:33,543 --> 00:42:35,105
Oh, oh, and, uh,

789
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,049
here's a little, uh...
Louisiana surprise.

790
00:42:43,532 --> 00:42:47,213
we're back from vegas,
and everything is right

791
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:52,051
it's the same this morning
as it was last night

792
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:54,739
you're the one, baby

793
00:42:56,978 --> 00:42:58,210
you're the one

794
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,434
I can't do it. I want to do it for you,

795
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,432
but I can't be a buffer.

796
00:43:02,988 --> 00:43:05,182
You're not a buffer. You're a traveler.

797
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:06,369
No, I'm not.

798
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,397
Not anymore.

799
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:10,982
I don't belong there, either, now

800
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:12,529
'cause I know too much

801
00:43:12,964 --> 00:43:14,332
about all of this now,

802
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:15,954
all these people.

803
00:43:17,245 --> 00:43:19,183
I'm not Dahlia Malloy,

804
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:21,136
and I'm not Cherien Rich.

805
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,516
You said we were gonna
come here and be somebody,

806
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:26,875
and I don't know who that is.

807
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:29,594
I know who you are.

808
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,036
You're my wife,

809
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:33,560
you're the mother of my children,

810
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:36,715
and you're the most
important person in my life.

811
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:39,690
And that's who you'll always be,

812
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,057
wherever we are.

813
00:43:41,192 --> 00:43:42,934
I cannot make a truth

814
00:43:43,084 --> 00:43:46,119
out of all the lies I'm tellin'
myself and everyone else.

815
00:43:46,735 --> 00:43:48,703
geegee, you're the one

816
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:55,043
you're the one, baby!

817
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,952
All right, y'all, let's get
this party started! Come on!

818
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:04,128
Baby, take the car and go home.
You be with the children.

819
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:08,241
I will look for Dale.

820
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:29,236
so what do we do?

821
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:32,222
- I am not goin' back to camp.
- No one's asking you to.

822
00:44:32,315 --> 00:44:34,907
God damn it, Cal.
You know, this is all your fault.

823
00:44:35,057 --> 00:44:36,823
If you wouldn't have gone to see tammy

824
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:38,644
then they wouldn't even
know where we are.

825
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:40,272
They would've found us sooner or later.

826
00:44:40,296 --> 00:44:41,676
No, they wouldn't have, Cal!

827
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:45,178
Why don't you just admit it, Cal? You
blew it. You ruined this for everyone!

828
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:47,694
You know what?
You're never gonna be a buffer, Di.

829
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:50,342
Drop it. It's never gonna happen.
You're a traveler.

830
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,722
- You're always gonna be a traveler.
- Screw you! You're a piece of shit!

831
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:55,957
Oh, knock it off. Jesus.

832
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:59,976
Think all your yelling and
screaming is gonna do anything?

833
00:45:02,211 --> 00:45:03,300
It's over.

834
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:07,582
Maybe we don't do anything.

835
00:45:07,695 --> 00:45:09,517
No, dad, we have to do somethin'.

836
00:45:09,611 --> 00:45:11,846
Dale came here for us.
He's not goin' anywhere.

837
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:14,340
Dale seems to have
been here for a while now.

838
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:17,369
He could have blown our cover
at any point, he didn't. Why is that?

839
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:19,689
He's Dale.
He's workin' an angle. I don't know.

840
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:22,803
Yeah. Well, we gotta work out what
the angle is and work it against him.

841
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:25,993
And why the hell is he hangin' out with
that stupid hartley underwood chick?

842
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:28,836
- Dale has got a plan.
- Okay. What?

843
00:45:29,991 --> 00:45:31,289
I don't know.

844
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:34,762
I guess he'll let us
know sooner or later.

845
00:45:36,396 --> 00:45:38,512
What are we supposed
to do in the meantime, dad?

846
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:41,529
Nothing.

847
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:44,569
We go about our lives, we go to school,

848
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:47,322
we go to work, we wait for
him to make the first move.

849
00:45:49,198 --> 00:45:50,568
Well, that's a shit plan, dad.

850
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:53,044
Yeah? Well, we leave, and he wins.

851
00:45:53,897 --> 00:45:54,918
We stay and...

852
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,613
Then we're in it with him.

853
00:45:57,082 --> 00:45:58,609
And it's all up for grabs.

854
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:01,733
I'm bettin' on us.

855
00:46:02,514 --> 00:46:03,523
What do you think?

856
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:19,581
there's someone in your office, waiting
for you. I told him to wait out here,

857
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:21,179
but he insisted on going inside.

858
00:46:21,263 --> 00:46:22,754
He said he's a friend of yours.

859
00:46:23,872 --> 00:46:24,882
Thank you, Aubrey.

860
00:46:45,665 --> 00:46:48,105
Guess you're probably surprised
to see me here, Wayne.

861
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:50,099
A bit.

862
00:46:50,592 --> 00:46:53,044
Well, I was on my way to
the airport this morning, but

863
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,100
I had a little time to kill,
and I thought

864
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:58,417
I'd drop by your house
to thank you for all your kindness.

865
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,876
Only you folks weren't home,
but your neighbor was.

866
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:04,775
Jim, I think his name is.

867
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:07,732
That's right.

868
00:47:08,189 --> 00:47:09,210
Lovely man.

869
00:47:10,773 --> 00:47:12,684
But, boy, does he like to talk,

870
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:15,472
especially about his neighbors...

871
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,309
The Riches.

872
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:22,275
So, Wayne...

873
00:47:24,294 --> 00:47:26,505
You and I both know
you're not Doug Rich,

874
00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:29,042
though everyone here

875
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:32,071
seems to think you are,

876
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:35,809
which leads me to a couple of questions.

877
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:38,273
Who are you?

878
00:47:41,446 --> 00:47:44,415
And where the hell is
my best friend Doug Rich?

879
00:47:48,648 --> 00:47:51,174
