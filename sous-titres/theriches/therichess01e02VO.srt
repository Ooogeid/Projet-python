1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,639
I'm Wayne Malloy. 

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,669
My family and i are travelers. 

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,539
Our kind has been living in 
this country for 150 years. 

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,009
We're not listed in the phone book,

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,049
we don't have social security numbers. 

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,319
We live off the grid. 

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,559
Some call us gypsies, others call us thieves,

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,639
most though, don't even know we exist. 

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,379
I've got three kids, a boy, a girl,

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,199
and, uh... um... 

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,459
my wife Dahliais just out of jail, on parole. 

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,759
We took her home to the traveler camp. 

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,179
The family gave her a warm welcome. 

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,569
I,on the other hand,
gota different type of welcome. 

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,419
I am the new boss. He is the old boss. 

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,709
Get over it. 

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,979
Sometimes,it takes a beating to make 
you realize it's time to move on. 

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,089
So where are we gonna go ?

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,169
Life's a river, kid. 

20
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,389
You gotta go where it takes you. 

21
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,439
So, with a loan from the family bank,

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,599
I packed up the rv and went out 
in search of something better,

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,319
something we could all be proud of,

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,909
something with a bit more substance. 

25
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,559
Look, dale and I had a disagreement. 

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,659
It wasn't that long before 
the family tried to stop us. 

27
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,339
You're in the wrong lane, asshole !

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,319
- Mick, look out !
- Shit ! Stop ! Oh, my god, no !

29
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,669
Unfortunately,

30
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,999
they stopped someone else instead,

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,269
and then they ran. 

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,729
Knowing that we couldn't
go back to our old home,

33
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,579
we decided to visit their new home,

34
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,929
eden falls, as the riches. 

35
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,839
Now, who buys a house on the internet ?

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,279
Come and meet our new neighbors. 

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,899
Doug, meet hugh panetta, biggest 
asshole east of the Mississippi. 

38
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,769
You flatter me, Jim. 

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,239
- You're sleep in gout here, huh ?
- Yeah. You people wanna wake up with no soul,

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,159
I'm proud to say my family is finally 
on the grid and surrounded by substance. 

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,059
I've taken many things in my life,

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,699
but I'm on my way to taking something
I never thought possible. 

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,149
The american dream... 

44
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,439
we're gonna steal it. 

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,649
What are you doing ?

46
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,109
Practicing. 

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,769
Practicing what ?

48
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,099
Being her. 

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,699
Why don't you come practice 
being her with me ?

50
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,129
You wanna do it like a buffer, Wayne ?

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,759
Oh, you know how buffers do it ?

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,409
How ?

53
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,589
Once a year in a cave,
standing up like polar bears. 

54
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,399
- Like polar bears ?
- Yeah, that's it. 

55
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:43,959
I think they fake it. 

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,319
- What, the polar bears ?
- A lot. Oh !

57
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,689
Oh, fake it, Wayne. 
Oh, fake it like a buffer. 

58
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,989
Oh, Wayne ! Wayne !

59
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:01,389
Oh, god damn it, Wayne ! Oh !

60
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,189
- It's me. 
- Where are you ?

61
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,029
I can't say. 

62
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,179
Far. 

63
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,599
You didn't even say good bye. 

64
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,529
I couldn't. 

65
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,459
When am I ever gonna see you again ?

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,399
I don't know. 

67
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,179
I don't even know 
what we're doing here. 

68
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,169
I miss you. 

69
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,619
Tammy ?

70
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,259
Shit, Ma's comin'. 
I gotta go. I love you. 

71
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,659
Oh. 

72
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,619
Man's gettin' calls in the middle
of the night, baby. Can't be a good thing. 

73
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,849
Maybe it's ed Mc Mahon. 

74
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,309
Maybe Doug'Sal ready a winner. 

75
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,829
Don't be stupid, Ed Mc Mahon don't 
call. He'd come to the house. 

76
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,479
Promise me you won't answer this. 

77
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,119
- Baby, I...
- promise me. 

78
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,019
All right, all right. Ow. 

79
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,859
We can do this. 

80
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,399
People do it all the time. 

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,679
Oh, they do ?

82
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,609
They move into dead people's houses,
steal all their stuff, and pretend to be them ?

83
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,019
Baby, this... all this is manifest destiny. 

84
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,489
It's meant to be. 

85
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,789
You're my queen, baby. 

86
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,069
But, Wayne... 

87
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,649
what if I like it ?

88
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,539
Nothing wrong with liking it. 

89
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,099
When I was a girl,

90
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,319
I always wanted to go to a prom. 

91
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,609
Wear one of them big,
old Fancy dresses. 

92
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,019
Have some of those...
what you call 'em ?

93
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,609
Shoes ?

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,839
You asshole. 

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,429
No, them flower things. 

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,859
Think of the life we can have. 

97
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,879
Think of the kids. 

98
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,409
- It's not real, Wayne. 
- We can make it real. 

99
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,579
I'm gonna go check on the kids. 

100
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,339
Okay. 

101
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,399
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. 

102
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,469
Okay. All right. 

105
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,749
The Riches
Season 1 Episode 02

106
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,829
Where do you think it all goes ?

107
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,239
You know, I don't know, Sam,

108
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,469
but it sure does make a lot 
of noise gettin' there. 

109
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,879
Stop it, Sam. 

110
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,889
This guy's got crap taste in music,
but he's got cool shit. 

111
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,349
Hey, listen to this,

112
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,969
"when you follow your bliss,

113
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,549
"doors will appear where there would 
not have been doors before

114
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,566
and where there wouldn't be for anyone else'
does that mean ?

115
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,929
I think it's what we're doing here. 

116
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,345
What ? Bliss ?

117
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:50,714
- What's bliss ?
- Bliss is passion. 

118
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:52,850
If you live your life with passion,

119
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:54,644
- fortune follows you. 
- Yeah, works real well

120
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:59,269
- if it's in a house behind a big-ass gate. 
- Maybe. Maybe we're following our bliss. 

121
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,792
Okay, listen up, team,

122
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:02,794
we got a lot to do today. 

123
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:13,269
- Sajak !
- Shit, dad !

124
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,013
All right, split up. Hey, no,
you guys stay together. 

125
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:18,657
Hey, no, no. Steash. Stop. 

126
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:23,152
The riches are law-abiding citizens. 
Everyone stay where you are. 

127
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:25,571
I'll handle this. 

128
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,418
Hide. 

129
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,934
Good morning, officer. 

130
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,102
What can I do for you ?

131
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,480
Mr. Rich ? Mr. Douglas rich ?

132
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,150
Is there a problem ?

133
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:48,378
Oh, that depend son what 
you call a problem. 

134
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,175
I noticed you don't have a system. 

135
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:54,311
A system ?

136
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:56,223
An alarm system ?

137
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,538
Officer lloyd shrage,

138
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,962
spartan security. 

139
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,652
I like to welcome you

140
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:07,803
and congratulate you on movin' to
the safest community in Louisiana. 

141
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:12,295
Uh, thank you very much, officer. 

142
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:15,700
I am so glad to, uh... 
to hear that. 

143
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,485
My family is very precious to me. 

144
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:19,980
At spartan, we provide for all of
our residents' security needs :

145
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:23,728
Alarm systems, 24-hour
patrol dispatch, and armed patrol. 

146
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,940
- Oh, well armed ?
- You bet. 

147
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:29,647
- We all carry assault weapons. 
- No shit. 

148
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:33,010
When you all get settled in,
then you give us a call,

149
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:35,985
- 'cause you can't be too careful these days. 
- No, I noticed that. 

150
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:40,869
So, yeah, I will do this,
officer shrage. Excellent. 

151
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:45,274
Armed weapons, keep 'em locked and loaded. 

152
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,592
Good. 

153
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,550
Easy peasy Japanesey. 

154
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,744
Hello ?

155
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:07,062
You people have got to relax. 

156
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:08,555
Buffers are not afraid of cops. 

157
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:10,420
Cops are our friends. 

158
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,353
What if that had been a cop ?

159
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:15,021
What if that had been someone
coming to find them ?

160
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,953
Do you know what happens if they find us ?

161
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:18,282
Do you know what happens to me ?

162
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,530
I go back to prison. 

163
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,754
You go to prison. Kids go to Foster Homes. 

164
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,543
You want that ?

165
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,079
We'll run if we have to. 

166
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:46,538
Somehow, you're gonna have to trust me. 

167
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:48,562
Oh, I heard that before. 

168
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:52,948
Okay. 

169
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:56,471
So listen up, troops. 

170
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:01,097
We're gonna dig into these buffers' 
lives until it bleeds. 

171
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:05,542
I wanna know about their friends,
their families, their jobs, their hat size. 

172
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:08,032
Cal, get into those gadgets, please. 

173
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,622
Just get those messages, read those e-mails. 

174
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:11,999
Will you do that ?

175
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,084
Thank you very much. Very kind. 

176
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:19,568
Didi, grab that big laundry basket full of mail
and pull out any pre-approvedcredit card applications. 

177
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,437
- Dougy's gonna need some new credit cards. 
- Okay. 

178
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,619
- Um... 
- what can I do, dad ?

179
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,945
Sammy, I want you to get my bag o' tricks
and make us out some new I. D. S, okay ?

180
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:28,871
Okay. 

181
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:33,818
Baby, if you could get Doug's calendar, hers, too. 

182
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:38,639
Just find out any relatives, friends,
things about that and stuff... 

183
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,905
sex slaves, whatever. 

184
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:45,859
Anybody who does good work
gets to shove something down the sink the sink. 

185
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,096
- Try "rich" with two hours. 
- Already did. No go. 

186
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:53,938
Honestly, who spends $450 on one pair of shoes ?

187
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:57,151
- Try really rich guys. 
- And she buys three or four at a time. 

188
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:59,527
I know, and every one of them butt ugly. 

189
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:01,039
- Seriously. 
- No taste. 

190
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,255
- Try "rich dead guy. "
- Surprisingly, no. 

191
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,970
What date is it today ?

192
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:08,148
It's the 23rd. 

193
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,020
Okay. 

194
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:14,575
Well, yesterday was apparently
his secretary's birthday. 

195
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,793
Are you... yes !

196
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,000
Well, hi there. 

197
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:22,358
Is this the javitz hair salon ?

198
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,535
No ? You're a law firm ? Okay. 

199
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,965
I have the wrong number. 
Silly me. Bye. 

200
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:31,825
Got it. 

201
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:37,211
Doug is a republican. 
His best friend is pete. 

202
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:40,472
Pete's a mortgage broker from Dallas. 
He's e-mailed twice about a golf trip,

203
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:43,311
and Doug is waiting for
"big Mama's house II"on netflix. 

204
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:44,960
Damn, I'm good. 

205
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:47,757
Well done. 
Okay, e-mail him straight back. 

206
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:50,588
Uh, tell him you got
a contagious disease, an illness. 

207
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,038
- Mono. 
- Chlamydia. 

208
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,894
- From a female. 
- Okay, mono. 

209
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:55,572
Mono. 

210
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,303
And sign it the way Doug would. 

211
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:59,179
"Weasel. "

212
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:01,708
Would I make that up ?

213
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:18,767
Shit. 

214
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:23,616
Damn it. 

215
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:27,313
Where you going, Tammy ?

216
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:37,975
What the hell ?

217
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,723
- Get out the way. 
- No. 

218
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:40,976
Move your ass. 

219
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:43,149
I know what you're up to. 
I'm going with you. 

220
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,670
The hell you are. 

221
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,151
I'm not happy, Dale. 

222
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:54,743
You promised a marriage for Ken. 

223
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:56,542
What do you think I am doing,
Ginny Dannegan ?

224
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:59,332
- You're following Tammy Sims. 
I know about her and cal. 
- Oh, yeah ?

225
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,023
- I know everything. 
- You don't know shit. 

226
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,967
I know Wayne Malloy stole the family bank. 

227
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:09,003
I know that you are up to your eye balls in shit
if you don't get that money back. 

228
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:14,011
I know none of this is helping your
position here. I know all that. 

229
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:17,157
Get out. 

230
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:18,345
No. 

231
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:22,127
Get out of my truck !

232
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:24,050
No ! Aah !

233
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:25,184
Let... 

234
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:29,800
Let go of me. Let go of me. 

235
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:34,014
You soy excuse for a man. 

236
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:39,556
I am pregnant, asshole. 

237
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:41,397
- Easy, Dale. 
- You okay, Ginny ?

238
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:43,491
Mind your own business. 

239
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,811
Oh, god damn it. 
I lost her. 

240
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:51,424
That's real nice,
hittin' a pregnant woman. 

241
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:54,933
- What did you say to me ?
- Nothin'... dick head. 

242
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:00,385
You son of a bitch. 

243
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,247
God ! Broke my leg !

244
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:07,654
Pussy. 

245
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:10,259
Oh. Oh, damn. 

246
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,414
Doug Rich was a litigator,

247
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:16,226
a securities lawyer, whatever that is. 

248
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:20,056
Cherien was his dental hygienist. 
They fell in love during a gum scraping

249
00:15:20,057 --> 00:15:22,665
- and were married two years ago. 
- In tampa. 

250
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,713
Took a long honey moon around the world,
kept a blog of their trip. 

251
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:28,192
Doug doesn't seem to have too many friends,
except that guy pete,

252
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,886
who gave the toast on his wedding video,

253
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,340
- so Pete could be trouble. 
- Cherien ?

254
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,289
Cherien's dad is dead and
her Ma'sin a nursing home in biloxi. 

255
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,925
Okay, apart from Pete

256
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:39,209
not gonna have much trouble
from family or friends. 

257
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:44,120
So, it looks like Doug and Cherien's monthly
expenses are about $7,500 a month. 

258
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:48,355
We gotta find about eight grand 
a month for this new life,

259
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:51,060
- and by "we," I mean you. 
- Thank you. 

260
00:15:51,505 --> 00:15:54,552
Well, I mean, yeah, if we don't want
the credit collectors on our asses. 

261
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:57,568
Judging from his tax returns,
Doug was raking in the kush. 

262
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,623
Doug had to be planning on makin' 
a living here, yeah ?

263
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,818
Well, it's funny you should mention that
because... 

264
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:05,423
Dougy was looking for work as a lawyer,

265
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:09,794
- and you've gota lunch interview today. 
- Huh ? Let me look at that. 

266
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:49,285
Hi, Doug Rich. 

267
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:51,717
Yeah, Doug Rich. 

268
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:52,848
Hey, how you doin' ?
Doug Rich

269
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,053
Hi, I'm Doug. 

270
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:56,358
I'm Doug. I'm Doug. 

271
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,634
Hi, Doug, Doug Rich. 

272
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:00,061
Doug Rich. 

273
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:10,414
You like that ?

274
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,500
Hello. 

275
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:17,452
Didi. 

276
00:17:19,443 --> 00:17:23,568
You're looking good, dad. 
You're looking good. 

277
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:28,409
- You're really gonna do this ?
- It's not like I'm gonna get the job. 

278
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:30,023
I just gotta turn up. 

279
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,888
If Doug doesn't turn up
someone's gonna wonder why,

280
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:34,501
and we don't want that, do we ?

281
00:17:34,502 --> 00:17:36,138
Why don't you just call in sick ?

282
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:38,184
Too late. It wouldn't look right. 

283
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,992
You don't know the first thing 
about the law. 

284
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:43,434
Well, I talked my way out
of that Nashville thing. 

285
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:46,291
- The judge was drunk. 
- Bullshit is Bullshit. 

286
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:48,558
Oh, I know Bullshit, Wayne. 

287
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,165
And right now, you are full of it. 

288
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,827
You just wanna play. 

289
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:55,427
You just wanna see 
if you can get this job. 

290
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:00,469
Why don't you just let me do my thing ?

291
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,006
You just sit there
and look pretty. 

292
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:07,656
Don't break any laws, don't break any windows,
don't break anything. 

293
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,869
Come on, Cal. 

294
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:15,113
You son of a bitch !

295
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:17,649
You, get out. 

296
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,320
Go on. 

297
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:21,976
Just like your dad. 
Don't you smile at me !

298
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:25,995
Asshole. 

299
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,441
Break anything. I'll break your ass. 

300
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:35,258
One pill. 

301
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,245
Well, that ain't gonna do it. 

302
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:49,158
God damn it, Didi ! Damn it !

303
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:00,137
Put the cookie down. 

304
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,250
Put it down, half pint. 

305
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:03,808
Put the cookie down !

306
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:05,188
- But I want one. 
- Put the cookie down. 

307
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:07,042
You're gonna have to make your own. 

308
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:44,752
Hi, Nina. I made you some cookies. 

309
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:46,310
Give me some drugs ?

310
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:47,930
Hi, Nina. 

311
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:50,229
I made you some cookies. 

312
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:52,754
You got any more of them little pills ?

313
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,598
Hi, Nina. You got any drugs ?

314
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,753
Shit, shit, shit. 

315
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:04,054
Well, hey there, Dahlia. 

316
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:05,338
Hi, Nina. 

317
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,532
I made you some cookies. 

318
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:11,367
To thank you for my hand and everything. 

319
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:15,586
Well, thanks, Hon. 

320
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:21,710
- So you wanna come in ?
- Uh, yeah. 

321
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,629
I saw your two girls
out riding their bikes today. 

322
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,042
My girls ?

323
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:34,580
Uh, Didi, and the... and the little one ?

324
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,056
Oh, Sam. 

325
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:45,414
She's cute, real cute. 

326
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:47,068
Yeah, she is. 

327
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,242
Real cute. 

328
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:51,388
What school you got them in ?

329
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:55,215
Oh, we haven't decided yet. 

330
00:20:56,853 --> 00:21:00,143
- So, Nina... 
- hmm ?

331
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:02,216
Oh, Nina,

332
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:05,636
you know these little pills
you gave me yesterday ?

333
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:07,247
I was just wondering, like,

334
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,729
if you just had like a few more ?

335
00:21:10,822 --> 00:21:13,038
I gave you five, Hon. 

336
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:15,992
That's enough to last you four more days. 

337
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:17,622
I know,

338
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:21,962
but would you believe
I dropped them all in the toilet ?

339
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:26,899
Darlin', maybe you need to ask yourself
why you need them in the first place. 

340
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:37,001
On second thought,
it's really none of my business. 

341
00:21:37,002 --> 00:21:42,641
But what I can do is give you
the name of a nice doctor in town. 

342
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:48,512
Dr. Salhanny ?

343
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:52,908
He's a sensitive man who understands
the sometimes... 

344
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:56,918
distressing nature of modern life. 

345
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:04,589
How long will you be needing 
a rental car, Mr. Pratt ?

346
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,877
A couple of weeks. 
My 740's in the shop. 

347
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:10,575
Chip here took it out for a drive,
got it side-swiped. 

348
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:12,571
It was some dick wad 
in the corvette, Chuck. 

349
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,228
So chip won't be driving
for a while. 

350
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:17,823
Well, Chuck,
it wasn't exactlymy fault, now, was it ?

351
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:20,563
Troy, could you tell chip to 
tell that to all state ?

352
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:26,936
Well, Geez, if you're used
to drivin' a 740,

353
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:30,403
you'll probably be interested in renting a car
from our prestige collection

354
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:33,629
Jaguar, Rover... 

355
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:35,430
Mercedes. 

356
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:40,909
Sure, we can... we can pick you up. 

357
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,918
Yes, we would. 

358
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:49,051
Come on, mom !

359
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:50,247
I'm comin' !

360
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:52,375
You're so slow. 

361
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:55,450
- Somebody's tired. 
- Hurry up !

362
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,338
Ohh !

363
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:02,340
- Come on. 
- I'm gonna snag my pantyhose
on the bike chain. 

364
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:05,219
Who the hell wears
pantyhose ?

365
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,882
Stuck in Buffer ville, Circa 1954. 

366
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,242
- Oh, man. 
- Come on. 

367
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:14,262
Wait up !

368
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:15,900
Didi ?

369
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:18,164
Just stop ! Hey !

370
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:20,780
Stop ! Hey !

371
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:25,146
Stop ! The rv !
Stop it !

372
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:27,650
Aw, shit. I knew we shouldn't 
have parked there. 

373
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:29,840
That's right. Y'all are tress pasin'. 

374
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,382
Hi, there. 

375
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:33,137
You're on my land. 

376
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:36,011
- Keep tellin' my husband we need a fence. 
- So what ? You just had it towed ?

377
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:38,226
How'd ya'll get in the front gate ?

378
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:43,121
- We live here. 
- Yeah, in that really big house

379
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,697
- just right over there. 
- I've never seen you before. 

380
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:49,102
So, you know everyone then ?

381
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:50,745
Well, as a matter fact, I do. 

382
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:54,997
I'm Hartley Underwood, President of e-ha,
the eden falls home owners association. 

383
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,226
- Great. 
- And who are you ?

384
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,798
I'm Cherien Rich. 
This is Didi, this is Sam. 

385
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,490
My husband is Doug Rich. 

386
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:06,718
He's a securities lawyer. He's a republican. 

387
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,954
The riches. 

388
00:24:07,955 --> 00:24:09,884
I was told there wouldn't be children. 

389
00:24:09,885 --> 00:24:12,177
Yeah, condoms ain't what they used to be. 

390
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:12,678
Huh. 

391
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,693
Well, it was real nice
to meet you, Charlene. 

392
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:21,844
Oh, and by the way, we are not zoned
for boat or rv parkin'here in eden falls. 

393
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,539
I guess you're gonna have 
to make other arrangements. 

394
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:29,669
It's Cherien, you stupid Ludney bitch. 

395
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,488
What about my colored pencils ?

396
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:35,858
Hey, we're gonna get 'em back, all right, honey ?
Don't worry about it, I promise. 

397
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:36,839
Oh, my god. 

398
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:38,889
Oh, my god !

399
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:42,102
What is wrong with her now ?

400
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:50,860
Come on, mom. 

401
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:56,152
Okay, eight from the door here. 

402
00:24:56,153 --> 00:25:01,951
One, two, three, four, 
five, six, seven, eight. 

403
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:10,874
Which tree was it ?

404
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,711
Oh, god. 
Oh, man. 

405
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:18,634
- Hey, mom. 
- Yeah ?

406
00:25:18,677 --> 00:25:20,188
What are you doing ?

407
00:25:20,497 --> 00:25:21,548
Nothin'. 

408
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:34,510
One, two, three, four, five, 
six, seven, eight. 

409
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:37,174
Okay, let's go. 

410
00:25:38,735 --> 00:25:41,119
$235 ?

411
00:25:41,403 --> 00:25:46,222
175 for the towing, 
plus $60 for the ticket. 

412
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:48,257
Well, all right. 

413
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,688
This has just been a big,
old stupid mistake. 

414
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:55,003
Plus, I'm gonna need to see a valid driver's 
license and proof of owner ship. 

415
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:56,943
Proof of owner ship ?

416
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,983
Well, we just moved here,

417
00:26:00,984 --> 00:26:03,753
so I don't know where my husband 
keeps all the documents. 

418
00:26:03,754 --> 00:26:06,640
- So if you'd just...
- that's not my problem. 

419
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:08,901
NO ID ? No PRoof of Ownership ?
NO VEHICLE !

420
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,901
For all I know, you could've stole it. 

421
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:36,348
- May shit rain down on these honest buffer ways. 
- Yeah, I told you. 

422
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:38,777
We gotta go with a different plan. 

423
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:43,045
You game ?

424
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,213
Sure. 

425
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:51,042
Let's get Sam his colored pencils back. 

426
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:52,999
Hey, wait up. Hold on. 

427
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:58,964
I know your boy Dale has been
a great disappointment to you, Earl. 

428
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,830
Well, he's disappointedme, too, Earl. 

429
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:04,887
Earl !

430
00:27:05,093 --> 00:27:06,734
- Huh ?
- Hi. 

431
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,791
Tea ?

432
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:12,159
Now, us dannegans

433
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,060
we've been wanting
a relationship with you Malloys ever

434
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:15,874
since that didi was young 'un. 

435
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:19,345
I even offered Wayne $50,000
to take Ken on. 

436
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:22,363
But it just don't look 
like that's gonna happen. 

437
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:25,756
Dale just ain't strong enough
to be the boss. 

438
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:27,615
I mean, he isn't. You know that. 

439
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,519
And what I've been noticin'

440
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,687
is that a lot of folk around here,

441
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:34,806
well, they respect Ken a whole lot. 

442
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:37,145
So, with your blessing...

443
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:38,783
Hey, Ginny-Gin. 

444
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,063
Nice of you to visit daddy,

445
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:44,430
- but he is a little tied
- get your hands of me

446
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:47,152
No one talks to daddy unless I say. 

447
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:48,243
No one. 

448
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,456
Get the hell away from me. 
I'm done with you. 

449
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:54,581
I wouldn't go talking up that 
dumb-ass brother of yours. 

450
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:58,671
Something bad might happen 
to him and you. 

451
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:00,705
Real bad. 

452
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:03,385
And no one will give a shit. 

453
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,072
Don't mess with me. I know things. 

454
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:24,843
How do people go
about their day in shoes like these ?

455
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,702
I got things to do. 
I can't do shit in these shoes. 

456
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:38,392
Take my purse. 
Take it. 

457
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,012
I like the shoes. 

458
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,263
- You can keep 'em. 
- Really ?

459
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,751
Hold on, hold on, hold on. 

460
00:28:50,005 --> 00:28:53,503
You know, I wasn't even
parked there that long. 

461
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:56,976
Oh, so you think it was towed, huh ?

462
00:28:56,977 --> 00:29:00,957
Yeah. Yeah, towed. 
I guess that's probably why I'm here. 

463
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:04,628
You know, I had this...

464
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:07,495
this scale model 
of ancient rome in my trunk,

465
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,752
and if I... if I don't find it,
I am really so dead. 

466
00:29:10,753 --> 00:29:14,045
It's really my last chance
to get a "C. "

467
00:29:14,478 --> 00:29:18,143
I made these little 
emperor sand gladiators

468
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:21,082
and vestal virgins and stuff. 

469
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,525
I mean, I really worked my ass off. 

470
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,516
What kind of car was it again, Hon ?

471
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,873
Um

472
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:31,188
a brown Corolla. 

473
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:33,090
Do you thinky' all could help ?

474
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:37,303
- Sure. Let's go look for it. 
- Thank you so much. 

475
00:29:37,304 --> 00:29:41,020
Oh. Oh,my god. That's it. 
That's my car right there. That one. 

476
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:44,107
Oh,I'm pretty sure that's not it, Hon. 
That's a Malibu. 

477
00:29:44,108 --> 00:29:47,192
Oh, wow. They look extremely similar. 

478
00:29:47,193 --> 00:29:50,096
- Well, that's a Malibu. 
- Okay. All right. 

479
00:29:50,097 --> 00:29:52,553
Well, maybe we'll just keep looking then ?

480
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:55,255
- Well, yeah. 
- Okay. 

481
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:57,566
Hey ! Hey, what the hell ?

482
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,826
Hey, stop !
Stop, you !

483
00:30:04,764 --> 00:30:07,115
- What do you wanna do ?
- Do it, mom. 

484
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:09,110
- You got it. 
- Stop ! Stop right there !

485
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:20,296
That girl. 

486
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:24,679
Mom, why did we park here ?

487
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,997
- It's a free country, ain't it ?
- You heard her. We're not supposed to. 

488
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:30,159
Oh, ask me if I care. 

489
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:35,824
You know,

490
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:40,831
Roy Lidge could not find a single good
word to say about you, Doug. 

491
00:30:42,498 --> 00:30:47,840
Well, Roy Lidge could not find
a single good word to say about Gandhi. 

492
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:49,300
Actually

493
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:52,901
he went completely nuts
when he heard you were coming in. 

494
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:55,350
Ah, well, that's Roy. What a nut. 

495
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,681
I understand Lidge is an animal. 

496
00:30:58,682 --> 00:30:59,704
Yeah, he is. 

497
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:03,028
Every day, we'd rattle his cage,
toss him a steak. 

498
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:07,469
Why are you interested 
in Hayden, Javitz, Doug ?

499
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:16,418
Well, I know you're a bunch of tough sons of bitches
who don't stop until you bring an opponent to their knees. 

500
00:31:17,595 --> 00:31:22,541
But I also know you won the client choice award,
which means that... 

501
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,009
this means,

502
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,183
no matter how hard you screw 'em,
they still love you in the morning. 

503
00:31:27,634 --> 00:31:29,626
And I want in on that. 

504
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,592
A lot of lawyers do, Doug. 

505
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,339
What makes you right for us ?

506
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,757
Napoleon used to say,

507
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:37,253
I know he's a brilliant 
general, but is he lucky ?

508
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:39,339
He used to say it in French. 

509
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:40,880
But I'm the lucky guy. 

510
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,951
Je suis lucky. 

511
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:45,028
I'm like a race horse. That's better. 

512
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:51,142
Like, uh, sea biscuit, the sea biscuit
of the non-sea biscuit world, you know ?

513
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,423
I just work very hard. 

514
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:57,120
At Kerriman, Fox, I billed more hours in a month
than most guys doin a year,in 10 years. 

515
00:31:57,121 --> 00:31:59,296
Well, a year is more realistic. 

516
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:00,778
I just work like an idiot. 

517
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,264
I just don't have any life
outside the firm, that's all. 

518
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:06,669
I'm like an animal,
like a nocturnal animal, like an owl. 

519
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:09,474
Or like one of those, you know, thing. 

520
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:14,165
I'm like tiger,
a saber-tooth tiger at night, you know ?

521
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,678
A big night time tiger,
that's me. 

522
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:19,422
You know ?

523
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:25,108
Bob,

524
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,795
I didn't come to Louisiana 
for the etouffee. 

525
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:34,396
I sure as hell hope
you didn't come here for these bubbas. 

526
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:37,810
How you doing, Doug ? Good to see you. 

527
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:39,328
Bob. 

528
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:43,937
Hey, Tommy, how you hittin' 'em ?

529
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:45,600
Better, Hugh. 

530
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:49,217
- You know panetta ?
- No. 

531
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:54,721
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, just enough to 
kick his ass on the golf course. 

532
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:55,736
Good. 

533
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:59,235
Panetta is a scum bag,
biggest thief in the real estate biz. 

534
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:03,344
Can't tell you how many law suits 
we filed against that prick. 

535
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:05,047
Yeah ?

536
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:07,555
How many you won ?

537
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:14,751
See, the thing about guys like panetta

538
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,389
is he's got weaknesses, which can be found
if you know what you're looking for. 

539
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:23,343
You've got to beat him at his own game. 

540
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:26,604
I already have. 

541
00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:50,113
Hi, Didi. Is your Momma home ?
'Cause I'd like...

542
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:51,361
hey, mom. 

543
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:00,043
Well, hi, Ms. Hartley. 

544
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:01,967
Who the hell do you think you are ?

545
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:03,287
Excuse me ?

546
00:34:03,587 --> 00:34:06,146
I told you not to park
that shit-heap on my land. 

547
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,204
Well, I didn't. 

548
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:10,981
Well, these two tires are nine 
in Cheson my property. 

549
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:13,868
Oh, honey,

550
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:16,142
you wouldn't know nine inches
if it jumped in your bedand

551
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:18,103
smacked you up side the head. 

552
00:34:18,217 --> 00:34:20,426
Oh, don't you talk trash to me. 

553
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:22,860
I will have that thing
towed to the junky ard this time. 

554
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:26,699
You touch my rv, I will kill you. 

555
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:28,174
Really ?

556
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:30,768
Well, maybe I should call
the police right now. 

557
00:34:31,023 --> 00:34:34,392
- you can call god damn Jesus Christ !
- Oh, don't you take the Lord's name in vain !

558
00:34:34,393 --> 00:34:37,642
Don't you mess with me,
you stuck-up little bitch. 

559
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:41,392
It will not end pretty... oh !

560
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:52,267
You only got one arm. 

561
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:55,940
You're crazy. 

562
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:59,179
You just made a big mistake, Charlene. 

563
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:07,156
Thank you. 

564
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:13,283
You just beat upa one-armed woman. 

565
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:15,225
Well, how was I supposed to know ?

566
00:35:15,593 --> 00:35:16,991
I ain't never...

567
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,581
I ain't never seen 
anything like that before. 

568
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:25,254
"The issuer of any security
up on which a restriction

569
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:30,692
"or transfer has been imposed 
pursuant to section 260. 102. 34

570
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:35,989
"shall cause a copy of this section
to be delivered to each issuee. "

571
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,738
Have you any idea what that shit means ?

572
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:41,464
- No, sir, I'm sorry. I have no idea. 
- Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,

573
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:45,335
just call me, Wayne, or call me Doug. 

574
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:47,227
Wayne is my middle name. 

575
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,224
- Okay, Doug. 
- Yeah. 

576
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,644
Who am I kiddin' ?

577
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:56,238
Oh, no, this won't do. 

578
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,747
Man should never drink alone. 

579
00:35:57,748 --> 00:35:58,980
What happened to your friends ?

580
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:00,405
Well, you know, Hugh,

581
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,823
places to go, people to sue. 

582
00:36:02,824 --> 00:36:06,596
Oh, I could've used you out 
there on that course today, Doug. 

583
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:08,927
Got my ass kicked. 

584
00:36:08,928 --> 00:36:10,686
Happens to the best of us, Hugh. 

585
00:36:10,687 --> 00:36:12,737
You're not payin'for this shit, are you ?

586
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,369
I haven't yet. 

587
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:16,904
Put it on my tab, Bobby. Come on. 

588
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,359
Let me buy you a real drink. 

589
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,767
Come on. 

590
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:23,236
Hugh's tab. 

591
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,544
Mom's crazy. 

592
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:58,655
Yeah. 

593
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,335
I guess we're stayin' here, huh ?

594
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:11,083
I guess so. 

595
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,790
Pool's cool. 

596
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,905
Yeah. 

597
00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:38,183
I guess we're gonna be sleepin'
in the house now. 

598
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:44,971
We never had a pool before. 

599
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:08,827
Limbaugh, you freakin' drug addict !

600
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:15,304
Ah ! I tried everything. 

601
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,511
Vitamins. 

602
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,347
I tried lipitor. 

603
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,828
I tried aroma therapy. 

604
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:26,983
I tried jumpin' off a cliff. 
I tried strappin'electric wires to my 'nads. 

605
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:28,315
Nothin' worked. 

606
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:31,084
My numbers were just...
blood pressure numbers, shit. 

607
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:32,755
Flyin' off the charts. 

608
00:38:32,756 --> 00:38:35,506
The only thing that works is

609
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:37,769
right here. 

610
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,897
Isn't that Jim, my neighbor ?

611
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:42,356
Sure is. 

612
00:38:42,357 --> 00:38:45,830
Neighbors, friends, employees, people I know. 

613
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,606
Shit, some of 'emare even people I like. 

614
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:49,828
See this ?

615
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:54,571
This is modeled on Hermann 
goering's summer place. 

616
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,485
Yeah, I noticed you had
the same patio furniture. 

617
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:00,636
Yeah. You should see the bunker. 

618
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:04,750
Hey, Doug, here,

619
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,850
wanna try the next one ?

620
00:39:07,197 --> 00:39:08,646
Sure. 

621
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:25,862
Not bad. 

622
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:28,006
Nice groupin'. 

623
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,839
You're a shooter, aren't you, Doug ?

624
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,937
I've shot a few in my time, Hugh. 

625
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:38,354
A few what ?

626
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:43,239
A few trespassers, hostile witnesses. 

627
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:47,438
So what were you doin' with 
those Hayden, Javitz Pricks ?

628
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:49,759
Just listening 
to what they have to say, Hugh. 

629
00:39:57,987 --> 00:40:01,217
Miss Schleewee, fourth grade. 

630
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,505
I loved her. 

631
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,487
If you ask me,
I wouldn't work at any one of those joints. 

632
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,127
Too many assholes

633
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:10,026
observin' you, watchin' you. 

634
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,236
Can't even take a dump
without everyone knowing about it. 

635
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:16,128
They've all tried to get a piece 
of meat one point or another. 

636
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:19,046
I shoved those law suits 
right back up their asses. 

637
00:40:19,394 --> 00:40:20,713
Can't touch this. 

638
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,592
They're amateurs. 

639
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:25,065
Ever done in-house ?

640
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:28,402
In-house. 

641
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:32,187
- As in "in-house counsel" ?
- It's a lot more interesting. 

642
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:34,632
Lot less bull shit. 

643
00:40:36,536 --> 00:40:37,952
No. 

644
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:40,912
I think I've decided to retire, Hugh. 

645
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,415
Get an rv and travel the country. 

646
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:46,171
Since when ?

647
00:40:47,134 --> 00:40:49,008
Since now. 

648
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:52,133
It feels good, don't it ?
Who is that, Dershowitz ?

649
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:53,971
Come here, you little scum. 

650
00:41:00,066 --> 00:41:01,278
How does it stay there ?

651
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:03,385
It's 'cause your nose is bigger,
you weirdo. 

652
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:05,264
Yeah ?

653
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:13,657
Oh, you're just in time. 

654
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:18,282
You cooked. 

655
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:19,766
I did. 

656
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:23,366
Right here ?

657
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,614
Maybe we should say grace. 

658
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,022
Okay. 

659
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:45,421
Bless us, o lord, and these, thy gifts,

660
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,300
for which we are about to receive
through Christ our lord, amen. 

661
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:48,851
Amen. 

662
00:41:54,257 --> 00:41:56,213
So, dad, how'd it go ?

663
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:59,752
Well, the good news is I got the job. 

664
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:01,722
You did ?

665
00:42:03,218 --> 00:42:05,170
Well, what's the bad news ?

666
00:42:05,171 --> 00:42:08,206
The bad news is I got the job,

667
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:11,730
- and I don't know shit about the law. 
- Dad, there are so many book son law upstairs. 

668
00:42:11,731 --> 00:42:14,040
I can help you brush up if you need help. 

669
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,473
That's very sweet, baby, but I...

670
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:17,107
you gotta know something
before you can brush it up. 

671
00:42:17,108 --> 00:42:19,172
You talked your way through
the Nashville thing, dad. You're fine. 

672
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:21,124
That was a Mis Demeanor. 

673
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:23,991
I can't con my way into a court of law. 

674
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:28,680
A court of law isa court of Goddamn law. 

675
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:30,584
Who am I kidding ?

676
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:33,378
I... I... I don't even know
what a securities litigator is. 

677
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:35,100
So what are you gonna do ?

678
00:42:37,315 --> 00:42:39,349
Don't know. 
I'll think of something. 

679
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,971
Yeah, you always do. 

680
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:46,387
Least we got the money. 

681
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:49,214
For now, we can use that to pay the bills. 

682
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:55,323
Oh, god damn it !

683
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:58,800
This is useless, Wayne. 
We are never gonna find it !

684
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:01,933
Tell me once again,
which tree did you think it was ?

685
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,175
I don't know. 

686
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:05,716
I wasn't thinking straight. 

687
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:07,256
Yeah, you know what, Ma ?
I wonder why. 

688
00:43:07,257 --> 00:43:09,807
- Would you shut your mouth ?
- Why don't you shut your mouth ?

689
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:11,380
Damn it ! This is 40 grand !

690
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,331
We can't go back home now, Ma !

691
00:43:13,332 --> 00:43:14,948
That is not home !

692
00:43:14,949 --> 00:43:16,625
This is the only home we got now. 

693
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:20,539
We could paint drive ways again. 

694
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:24,280
We don't have to live in some 
big-ass house like that,dad. 

695
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:26,292
What are we doin' here, Wayne ?

696
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,983
We don't have any money. 

697
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,776
You ain't never gonna be a lawyer. 

698
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:34,699
We're travelers, baby. We're thieves. 

699
00:43:36,472 --> 00:43:40,434
- We gotta stick with our own kind. 
- We are with our own kind. 

700
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:42,424
That's why we're gonna stay right here...

701
00:43:43,295 --> 00:43:44,634
together, us. 

702
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,836
I'm gonna get usall the life we deserve,
whether we want it or not. 

703
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:49,837
where are you going ?

704
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:51,817
To war. 

705
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:20,592
Doug. 

706
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:21,899
Hugh. 

707
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:25,570
It's almost midnight, Doug. 

708
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,299
Are you the ghost of Christmas past ?

709
00:44:27,877 --> 00:44:28,813
Yes, I am. 

710
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:31,232
Nice gun. 

711
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:32,207
Thank you. 

712
00:44:36,149 --> 00:44:38,093
Why are you in my house, Doug ?

713
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,268
Why are you here ?

714
00:44:44,603 --> 00:44:46,645
Why am I talking to you ?

715
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:52,156
We're discussing my package, Hugh. 

716
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:54,069
Your what ?

717
00:44:54,302 --> 00:44:57,356
My compensation package for my services. 

718
00:44:57,524 --> 00:44:58,741
As what, my pool boy ?

719
00:44:59,544 --> 00:45:01,137
As your in-house counsel. 

720
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:04,104
I didn't offer you a job. 

721
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:06,642
I think you did. 

722
00:45:06,643 --> 00:45:07,495
Is that right ?

723
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:11,676
I'm worth 150 million on paper, Doug. 

724
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:13,206
I run panco,

725
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:16,545
I run techcurrents, I run a lot of things. 

726
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:19,526
Not bad for a guy who used 
to cleanseptic tanks, huh ?

727
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,634
So, you want a shotto 
be my in-house counsel. 

728
00:45:25,158 --> 00:45:26,709
You gotta be the best

729
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:30,906
'cause I wipe my ass with those Hayden, 
Javitz Pricks, you understand ?

730
00:45:31,324 --> 00:45:35,068
So are you the best, 
Doug, or you just... 

731
00:45:35,923 --> 00:45:36,980
middlin' ?

732
00:45:37,421 --> 00:45:38,181
What do you think ?

733
00:45:38,217 --> 00:45:40,030
I tell you what I think. 

734
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:44,172
I think you'rean asshole, Hugh. 

735
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,224
You really are. 

736
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,706
And your numbers, they're not that high. 

737
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:56,858
Your blood pressure, it's normal. 

738
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:07,802
I think you simply like to shoot 
your friend sand neighbors in the face. 

739
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:11,728
Put down my gun. 

740
00:46:11,997 --> 00:46:13,692
Now, I know this

741
00:46:13,693 --> 00:46:16,263
because I used my powers of deduction. 

742
00:46:16,264 --> 00:46:19,707
I assess and deduce. 

743
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:21,702
That's what a good lawyer does, Hugh. 

744
00:46:21,703 --> 00:46:25,219
He assesses and deduces. 

745
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:30,856
A good lawyer makes you 
believe the truth. 

746
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:37,386
Holy shit. 

747
00:46:37,387 --> 00:46:41,854
And, Hugh, you know 
what a great lawyer does ?

748
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:43,607
Doug... whoa. 

749
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:48,529
A great lawyer makes you believe the lie. 

750
00:46:50,721 --> 00:46:53,306
Oh, shit. 

751
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:17,876
- You crazy bastard. 
- Thank you. 

752
00:47:24,584 --> 00:47:26,544
You're a sick mother, Doug. 

753
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,785
Yes. Yes, I am. 

754
00:47:37,111 --> 00:47:39,663
And I like that in a liar. 

755
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,929
Baby, don't splash mommy. 

756
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,823
Baby, you really gonna 
get paid $200,000 a year ?

757
00:47:56,824 --> 00:47:59,162
$200,000. 

758
00:47:59,163 --> 00:48:00,911
With benefits !

759
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,223
- What ?
- I gotta pee. 

760
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:10,272
- Oh, my god. 
- I gotta pee. 

761
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:12,082
You can't pee in the pool, dad. 

762
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:13,200
We're buffers now. 

763
00:48:13,201 --> 00:48:16,011
If we don't swim in the toilet,
y'all can't piss in the pool. 

764
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:19,862
I am a shark. I got $200,000. 

765
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,336
Don't pee in the pool !

766
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:05,676
Doug, I know you're there. 

767
00:49:06,052 --> 00:49:08,009
Say something. 

768
00:49:08,267 --> 00:49:09,882
Don't you hang up on me, Doug. 

769
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,527
Doug ?

770
00:49:13,204 --> 00:49:14,542
Doug.
