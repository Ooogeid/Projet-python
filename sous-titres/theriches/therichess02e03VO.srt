1
00:00:01,414 --> 00:00:03,632
<i>Previously on "The Riches"...
This is a school?</i>

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:05,342
A private school.

3
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:08,511
- Miss Fedley's the head of Rosemere.
- You're interested in Rosemere?

4
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:10,180
Why do you want to break in?

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,140
The computers
hold the key to our future.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,394
You get us inside,
Lane'll care of the rest.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,227
You now have an A- in calculus.

8
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:19,814
And where the hell
is my best friend, Doug Rich?

9
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:21,524
You can't bribe Pete.

10
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:22,901
I have to try.

11
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:24,069
Pete, you okay?

12
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:25,654
Jesus!

13
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:28,907
- I scared you.
- What did you do with Pete?

14
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:30,158
You killed him.

15
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,661
I hit him, and then...
But he fought back.

16
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:33,934
You murdered him!

17
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:36,539
We said 50-50.
We are in this together.

18
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:39,918
We're gonna bury Pete, and then
that's the end of our collaboration.

19
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:41,586
And I'm never gonna see you again.

20
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:43,254
What happened with Pete?

21
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:46,049
- Did he take the money?
- Pete's fine. Everything's all right.

22
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:47,217
Pete went home.

23
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:53,306
Bayou Hills, it's the deal
of a lifetime, Doug.

24
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,475
$150 million,

25
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:58,436
- and you cash in on $13 million.
- $13 million?

26
00:00:58,596 --> 00:00:59,896
$13 million?

27
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:02,190
All we got to do is be
the Riches for a few months,

28
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,153
the deal closes,
we cash in, check out,

29
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,027
and adiós. Just like any other con.

30
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,059
This is home.

31
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,119
Yeah, ma...

32
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:21,793
For the time being, anyhow.

33
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:23,934
I'll have a grande mochaccino.

34
00:01:24,054 --> 00:01:26,881
- Yeah, I call the jacuzzi.
- I got the couch in front of the tv.

35
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,482
Think I'm gonna sleep
for about three days.

36
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:39,182
You're under arrest for breaking
and entering rosemere academy.

37
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,056
That's ridiculous.

38
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:43,606
- They're just kids.
- Who committed a second-degree felony.

39
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,911
- Excuse me. My son was brought here.
- Name?

40
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,360
Rich, Cal Rich.

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,196
We're holding him with the others.
Pay the bail, and he's yours.

42
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:53,315
- Shit.
- Cal Rich is it?

43
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:56,202
Now, is he new in school this year?
That name doesn't sound familiar.

44
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:58,079
Yeah, we just moved here from Tampa.

45
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,874
H.L. Palmer. Kid's brent.

46
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,487
This is Bob Spurlock.
His kid's Willie.

47
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,503
And Afton Boatright, father of Lane.

48
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:07,714
So what's the story?

49
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:10,518
Boys supposedly had a business going,
charged money for changing grades.

50
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:13,257
Little shits are facing
felony computer-fraud charges,

51
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:15,222
not to mention
breaking and entering.

52
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:17,376
Ask me, a couple of months
in youth authority

53
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:19,354
might not be a bad thing
for these boys.

54
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:21,975
That's fine unless you want your kid
getting into college someday,

55
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:24,709
'cause no one's getting into
princeton with a criminal record.

56
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,650
I think it's in all our best interests
if we just work on this together.

57
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,652
How do you suggest we do that?

58
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,495
Strategy meeting.
Discuss our options.

59
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,658
What's say I get my secretary
set us all a lunch for tomorrow?

60
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:39,872
Good.

61
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,581
- Where do I pay this?
- Over there.

62
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:46,503
- Do you take checks?
- Bail bonds or cash.

63
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:59,724
- They let you out of the pokey?
- It's not a joke, Di di.

64
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:02,585
- Could do time for this.
- Come on, ma, I bumped the lock.

65
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:04,604
I didn't even let them
change my grades.

66
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:07,700
- Did they take your prints?
- Photographed me and everything.

67
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,682
Great.

68
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,069
With a criminal record, you'll
never get into college now.

69
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:14,447
Like I'm going to college.

70
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:16,407
I don't think college
is really the issue.

71
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,353
You don't know
what you're gonna do?

72
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,035
But now you may not
have the option.

73
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:21,947
Dad, I haven't been convicted yet.

74
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,187
Besides, maybe I should just
disappear for a while.

75
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,876
No, no, this family is gonna
stick together no matter what.

76
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:29,501
We're just staying around
long enough to get the money,

77
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,214
and then we cash out,
and we're gone.

78
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:33,235
There's a castle in Galway for sale.

79
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:35,009
We could get it for $3 million.

80
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,022
That's what i'm talking about.

81
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:39,878
I'd settle for just
being the Malloys.

82
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:44,686
Malloys with a shitload of money.

83
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:47,480
Come on, put you to bed.
Good night.

84
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,774
Is that me?
I need a shower.

85
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,236
That boy can't go to prison.

86
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,134
I won't let it happen.

87
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:57,377
There's no amount of money
that's worth it.

88
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,200
He is not going to prison.

89
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:05,738
This time, everything's different.

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,418
We're in the big leagues now.

91
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,087
I'm Doug Rich,

92
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,267
a lawyer.

93
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:16,593
I have power and money
and credibility.

94
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,530
This time,

95
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:20,680
they can't screw us.

96
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,474
You're not Doug.

FIELD OF DREAMS

100
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,178
Quinn, let's go,

101
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,067
unless you want to stay
for a couple more decades.

102
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:32,054
I left that book there
for you on the bed.

103
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,209
Do you some good.

104
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:35,588
You never stop.

105
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,119
Got to go. Schooltime.

106
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,454
- Yes!
- No!

107
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:52,540
It's just like a normal day.
Everyone doing things as normal.

108
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,808
Not for me.

109
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:56,502
As soon as I've sorted out your problem,
you're going to school, too.

110
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:58,963
I got a meeting with Fedley
tomorrow to discuss your arrest.

111
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:00,673
Okay, everybody's late.

112
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,092
The bus is gonna be here.
You got to get your backpacks.

113
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:05,329
Di di, come on,
get your clothes on.

114
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,305
- Come on.
- Shit.

115
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,265
Hey, Aubrey, how's it going?

116
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:11,572
Hugh didn't show up
for an investor meeting.

117
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,895
<i>- What meeting?
- Something about Bayou hills.</i>

118
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:14,771
Shit.

119
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,358
Tell them he had emergency
appendectomy and reschedule.

120
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:20,651
Appendectomy?

121
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,537
<i>I'll try and track him down.</i>

122
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:24,589
What?

123
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,699
Hugh's not there,
didn't turn up again.

124
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,410
I think I know where he is.

125
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,617
You go to work.
I'll meet you there.

126
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:33,706
What am I supposed to do at Panco?

127
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:36,086
Just be normal.
Normal day, just like every...

128
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,211
I have to go to
the lunch thing for Cal.

129
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:41,964
Why not?

130
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:44,675
Well, you see

131
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:46,511
with these guys, it's a guy thing.

132
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,005
- Hi, there.
- Hi, Nina.

133
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,498
Hi, Wayne.

134
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,364
So, what's the plan?

135
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:08,199
The plan?

136
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,763
Well, kids go to school,
and I go to work.

137
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:13,427
- That's the plan.
- Everything's back to normal?

138
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:15,570
Normal.

139
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:17,377
I'm a normal gal.

140
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,922
Wayne's a normal guy.

141
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:22,421
We're just normal folk
living a normal life, Nina.

142
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,036
Sorry, it's just how it is.

143
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:29,060
I got to go to work.

144
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:31,372
Cal made bail.

145
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:35,351
Normal sucks.

146
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,021
What?

147
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,109
What do you want, Doug?

148
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,214
You had an investors' meeting
this morning. You weren't there.

149
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:48,986
Screw 'em!
Those guys are minor league.

150
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:50,890
There are plenty more
where they came from.

151
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,076
What happened to this thing
we were gonna do?

152
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,656
Remember, Bayou Hills,

153
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:57,206
$150 million, deal of a lifetime?

154
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,035
Relax, we're doing it.

155
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,056
- I just got to do something first.
- Like what?

156
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,380
Like get laid.

157
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:06,924
- You're drunk.
- Nope.

158
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:10,351
- sober as a judge.
- What about Gigi?

159
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:13,831
Well, there's other ships
in the sea, ain't there?

160
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:17,143
In fact, I'm expecting one
to dock any minute now.

161
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,252
No, no, no, we got a deadline.
Five days, right?

162
00:09:20,372 --> 00:09:21,974
We got to raise this money.

163
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,636
You can do whatever
you want to do,

164
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:25,633
but I'm getting me
a little taste this morning.

165
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:28,362
I'd invite you to stay,
but I'm not into that kinky shit.

166
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:31,048
- Hugh, if you just...
- I know, I know.

167
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,944
I just got to spend some time
with somebody

168
00:09:33,064 --> 00:09:35,244
who doesn't want anything
from me, somebody who...

169
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:38,184
appreciates me
for what I have to offer.

170
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:40,291
I get hard at the drop of a hat.

171
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,138
Good.

172
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,629
Thank you for that.

173
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,714
At the drop of a hat, Doug!

174
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:48,758
I just got to take care
of some business.

175
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:50,838
Everything's gonna be fine.

176
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,966
Why don't you just come into work?

177
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:54,612
Be right there!

178
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:03,064
Well, with the two of you,

179
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,857
$1,500.

180
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,236
- No, thank you, he's not my type.
- Come on in, sweetheart.

181
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:11,030
- You will be coming in to work?
- Don't you worry.

182
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:14,451
- Give me the name of a good restaurant.
- Roger's. Best steak in town.

183
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,274
I want to see you in...

184
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,207
It is time for little Hugh
to get himself some.

185
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,813
How are your grades, Di di?

186
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:28,023
Great. How's the herpes, Kami?

187
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,341
Shut up.

188
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,674
It's regarding my son Cal.

189
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:37,702
Can you tell Mrs. Fedley that
it's Cherien Rich calling again?

190
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,678
<i>- Yes, I can.
- Yeah, it's very important.</i>

191
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:42,753
<i>- I know that, but she's very busy.
- Well, I appreciate she's very busy.</i>

192
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:45,025
Maybe you can remind her

193
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,224
I was very busy the day
that I found her goddamn bird.

194
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:49,136
<i>You don't have to have profanity.</i>

195
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:51,955
<i>As soon as she has some time, I will
let her know that you're calling-</i>

196
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,463
<i>- Crap.
- Excuse me?</i>

197
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,948
I got to go, sweetheart.

198
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,726
Hey, there, Cherien.

199
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:12,051
- Welcome back.
- What you doing here, Dale?

200
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,927
- I'm here to see Doug.
- Well, he's not here, so goodbye.

201
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,096
- I'll wait.
- No, you can't wait.

202
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,598
He's gonna be gone a long time.
Would you leave?

203
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:23,936
He is expecting me.

204
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:25,229
What?

205
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:28,357
Yeah, you can just ask him.

206
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:30,860
I'll be right over here, and...

207
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,077
I'll read this here magazine,

208
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:36,805
contractor journal.

209
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,358
<i>Leave a message.</i>

210
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,792
Wayne, would you call me back,
god damn it?

211
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:49,295
Dale is at Panco, okay?

212
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:52,467
Call me back.

213
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,845
Son of a bitch.

214
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,143
Geez.

215
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,586
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

216
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:21,578
Shit.

217
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,207
- Gentlemen.
- You come here often?

218
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:27,995
This is a total mistake.

219
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,543
It's a little,

220
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:30,920
you know, my friend Hugh

221
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,296
suggested this place.

222
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,814
That's right.

223
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,341
You work with Panetta.

224
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:36,822
Yeah.

225
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:39,929
Well, this looks like the sort of place
Hugh Panetta might frequent.

226
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,472
Sure does.

227
00:12:41,632 --> 00:12:43,265
Isn't he married
to a stripper?

228
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:46,894
There's an excellent chinese restaurant
just across the street.

229
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:48,813
I know I can get us in there.

230
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:51,880
So, what do you say? Chinese restaurant,
we'll cross the street, eat there?

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,361
I have heard they have some
nicely marbled kobe beef here.

232
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:58,364
Let's go.

233
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,531
Follow her?

234
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:04,161
Here's good.

235
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:09,792
I am sick of waiting.
Let me talk to Hugh.

236
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,335
About what?

237
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:12,811
About a job.

238
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:14,213
A job?

239
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:16,888
- Well, that ain't gonna happen, Dale.
- We'll see.

240
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:18,926
- Ask him.
- Why would he want to talk to you?

241
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:21,679
Because him and me got real friendly
the other night at your house.

242
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,934
At my house?

243
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:25,099
Yeah, him and me and Wayne,

244
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,056
had a good old time.

245
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:29,076
You might even say we bonded.

246
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:31,939
You were with them at my house?

247
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:36,986
I guess Wayne didn't tell you.

248
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:41,519
That is interesting.

249
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:49,248
Fedley's a bitch.
Always has been.

250
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:51,630
Of course, I'm one
of the only board members

251
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,297
who didn't endorse her, so...

252
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,562
she's gonna take this thing
and run with it.

253
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:58,669
- Very nice.
- $2,500 a bottle, it better be.

254
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:00,968
So, couldn't we just sue Rosemere?

255
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:04,221
We could make pursuing this case
very expensive for them.

256
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:05,639
Dance?

257
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,642
- Now, sweetheart, what is your name?
- Jasmine.

258
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:10,771
No, thank you. We're working.

259
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,563
- Lighten up, Bob.
- That's right, Bob.

260
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,338
Later then.

261
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:18,944
- If Muriel was to find out I was here.
- She's not here.

262
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,741
Isn't there something we can do
about Fedley before tomorrow's meeting?

263
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,336
- Like what, Doug, kill her?
- Well...

264
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:27,495
in my experience,
everyone has their price.

265
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,538
I don't know
where you're from, Doug,

266
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:31,190
but around here,
we don't bribe.

267
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,499
Of course not.

268
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:34,877
We donate.

269
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:36,850
Excellent.

270
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,438
Well, let's donate.

271
00:14:39,238 --> 00:14:40,525
What do we donate to?

272
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,743
That school's always
got its hand out for something.

273
00:14:42,863 --> 00:14:45,429
- Is there anything that Fedley needs?
- To get laid.

274
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,100
Okay, besides that.

275
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,042
She wants a new gym
to compete with Burton's.

276
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:55,692
She's always hocking the board
about raising more money for it.

277
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,192
- We're still short a million.
- That's it. We get her a gym.

278
00:14:58,352 --> 00:14:59,693
We give her a million?

279
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:02,404
I'd say keeping my kid
out of jail is worth $250,000.

280
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:05,115
- How about you fellas?
- Think that would do it?

281
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,910
I'm betting she wants that gym more
than she wants to put our kids away.

282
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,084
- Hell, I'm in.
- Me too. Doug?

283
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:12,781
I don't see why not.

284
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:14,750
$250,000?

285
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,544
You need to run that by Muriel?

286
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:20,339
Look, I'm just really
not that liquid right now.

287
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,258
I think it's a good idea.

288
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:24,927
I'm just not able
to swing it right now.

289
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:26,971
Anyway,

290
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:29,164
my kid says that
he didn't break in or anything.

291
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:31,684
He just paid
to have his grades changed.

292
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:35,213
That don't make your kid
any less culpable, Bob.

293
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:38,524
That's all right.

294
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,750
We'll work something out.

295
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:44,572
We're all in this together, right?

296
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:49,690
Excuse me, fellas.

297
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,161
Take your time.

298
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:54,053
<i>- Hey, baby.
- So,</i>

299
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,084
Dale was at our house when
you saw Hugh the other night?

300
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:00,041
What are you talking about?

301
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:01,169
<i>Dale.</i>

302
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,155
Dance?

303
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:05,853
What?

304
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,345
Dale is here at Panco.
Didn't you get my message?

305
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:11,888
He's there right now?

306
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:13,298
Yeah, Wayne, he's here.

307
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:14,754
He's here.

308
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,752
<i>He's going on about you guys
drinking at my house.</i>

309
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:21,233
<i>- I told you about that, didn't i?
- No.</i>

310
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,277
No, you didn't.

311
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,591
I told you about Hugh coming over.

312
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:26,942
<i>Yeah.</i>

313
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:29,533
And then Dale showed up.

314
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:31,942
Dale showed up.

315
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:36,148
Yeah.

316
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,251
Where was Pete during all this?

317
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:42,504
He'd gone by then,
long gone, gone home.

318
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:44,673
<i>Sorry, baby.
I forgot to mention Dale.</i>

319
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,443
It's been a crazy couple of days.

320
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,200
<i>Where are you?</i>

321
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,042
I'm still at the Cal

322
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:55,401
lunch-meeting thing.

323
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:58,821
Well,

324
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,773
Dale wants to ask you
for a job right now.

325
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:03,685
Look, baby,
can you deal with that?

326
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,872
I got to go here. All right, bye.

327
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,041
You're home early.

328
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,171
I hate those people.

329
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:26,609
What happened?

330
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:29,783
Nothing.

331
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,628
Sorry.

332
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,443
- What?
- We need to talk.

333
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:41,188
<i>- About what?</i>
- My job at Panco.</i>

334
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:44,024
I never promised you a job at Panco.
I said I would do what I could.

335
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:45,401
Well, I like Panco.

336
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,611
Panco isn't really you, Dale.

337
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:49,443
You said you'd get me a job.

338
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:52,261
Now, go get me a job at Panco.

339
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,951
- As what?
- I don't know.

340
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:55,285
Whatever you are.

341
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:58,539
Well, you're not me, Dale!
You're never gonna be me, right?

342
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:00,249
<i>I will do</i>

343
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,252
what I can, but I can't guarantee
it's gonna be at Panco.

344
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,066
Eamon Quinn!

345
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,181
Free as a bird.

346
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,656
Well, how is it, man?

347
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,563
It must be pretty weird?

348
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:25,482
The world must look really
different to you after 20 years.

349
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:27,803
I bet you never seen no cellphones,

350
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,240
or gameboys

351
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,172
or internet porn.

352
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:37,151
So, what have you got for me?

353
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:40,456
I got Wayne Malloy wrapped
around my little finger.

354
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:41,749
How's that?

355
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,507
It's called people skills, Quinn.

356
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:47,401
I find I have talent for it.

357
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:49,900
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

358
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,633
I don't remember that about you.

359
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,573
It's been 20 years.

360
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:57,109
A lot of life under the bridge.

361
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,224
I've changed.

362
00:19:02,522 --> 00:19:03,937
So, Wayne Malloy?

363
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:10,027
Yeah, I got like
a mid-level sales position,

364
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,241
just to get the lay of the land
and keep my eye on Wayne.

365
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:18,915
Bollocks. Wayne Malloy
would never give you that job.

366
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,037
He's not stupid.

367
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,666
Wayne Malloy is not as smart
as you think he is.

368
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:33,517
I can always tell
when you're full of shit, Dale.

369
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:38,889
Just like when you were
a spotty, little maggot of 16.

370
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,393
I ain't afraid of you anymore,
Eamon Quinn.

371
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:46,741
Sure, that's the only thing
I like about you, Dale.

372
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:48,943
Your one redeeming feature,

373
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:51,902
you're not that bright.

374
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:01,537
Still want to be partners?

375
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:07,411
You make sure you get that job, huh?

376
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:10,375
Help yourself.

377
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,632
- Shut up.
- What the hell are you doing?

378
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:57,851
I said...

379
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:59,857
"shut up."

380
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:03,557
Now, I got something
I got to say to you, cousin.

381
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,518
Are you crazy?
What is wrong with you?

382
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:11,398
I am sick and tired of you and Wayne
thinking that you're smarter than me.

383
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:14,568
I know exactly what you're up to,

384
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:17,365
and I'm tired
of listening to your bullshit.

385
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:19,180
Now...

386
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:24,994
I want you to tell Wayne
to get me a job at Panco,

387
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:30,208
or you're going back to prison.

388
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,045
It's just one little phone call,

389
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:36,340
and you're back in the slammer.
How would you like that?

390
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,014
You want to get a job at Panco?

391
00:21:39,753 --> 00:21:42,054
You don't know how to do anything,
you stupid prick.

392
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:43,730
Get out of here!

393
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:51,580
It is time you started treating me
with a little respect.

394
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:53,142
Miss Dahlia.

395
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:56,261
I am in this thing
whether you like it or not.

396
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:59,112
And I am gonna get what I want.

397
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:05,181
God, I love family time.

398
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:18,256
I want to kill him.

399
00:22:19,403 --> 00:22:21,051
We can't kill him.

400
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:23,941
I want him to die.

401
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:27,015
No $13 million, no nothing,

402
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:30,143
'cause that psycho could turn me
in any time he wants.

403
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,230
But that's not what he's after.

404
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,400
He just wants in on it...

405
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:41,614
All this...

406
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:43,824
The dream.

407
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:46,611
Putting you away
ain't gonna give him shit.

408
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:47,869
What we gonna do?

409
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,081
We're gonna keep our enemies close.

410
00:22:53,446 --> 00:22:57,371
I think I can get him a job
where he can't cause too much trouble.

411
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,106
At Panco?

412
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,693
Are you crazy?

413
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,802
We ain't got much choice.

414
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:05,669
He controls our life.

415
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,320
Is that what you're telling me?

416
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,309
And I'm supposed
to just go along with it?

417
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:20,694
I know what prison is.

418
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,363
This is starting to feel real familiar.

419
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:27,868
I'm sorry, baby.

420
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,622
It's my fault
that Dale can do this to us.

421
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,040
God damn it.

422
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,214
I'm sorry.

423
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:03,574
So, that's our new mail boy, huh?

424
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:05,304
Guess so.

425
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:07,866
What happened to George?

426
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:10,744
- That's bullshit.
- George, you're fired.

427
00:24:10,904 --> 00:24:11,974
Deal with it.

428
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,799
Where are you?
You sound like you're in a wind tunnel.

429
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,784
It's the hottest, fastest,
most powerful thing on four wheels,

430
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,790
and it's my ass in the driver's seat.

431
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:32,974
What are you talking about?

432
00:24:33,134 --> 00:24:36,728
Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 Roadster.

433
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:40,058
You've already got a car, Hugh.
Several cars.

434
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,735
You don't need a car.
You need to be here at work.

435
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:46,488
I don't have a car like this, pal.

436
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:50,325
<i>Do you have any idea
what 640 horsepower feels like?</i>

437
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:51,957
Whoo, baby!

438
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:53,370
It's better than sex.

439
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:55,205
Well, I'm sure it is.

440
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:58,708
340k, and at that price, it's a steal.

441
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:05,056
Don't you think it might be
a fun idea to come into work

442
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:07,717
and try to finance the Bayou Hills deal?

443
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,870
God damn it!

444
00:25:42,445 --> 00:25:43,992
Cal, we got to go.

445
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:54,256
Cal, we have to be at school
in 10 minutes.

446
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,515
I'm not going.

447
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:58,537
You're going. You got to be there.

448
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,811
What's the point?

449
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:02,898
The point is,
if you don't go, you look guilty.

450
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:05,754
I am guilty.

451
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:08,075
No, you're not. You are not guilty.

452
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:12,496
We've worked out a solution,
me and the other dads, so...

453
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:16,745
just come along and look presentable.
Everything depends upon this.

454
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,103
Everything?

455
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:19,523
Yes, everything!

456
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:21,166
Just trust me on this thing.

457
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:35,954
You're on your way out, huh?

458
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:39,768
You okay?

459
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,179
It can wait.

460
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:47,943
Dinner and my dealer...
You want to come?

461
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:57,786
$1 million.

462
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,249
That is quite a generous donation, H.L.

463
00:27:03,576 --> 00:27:07,504
We'd love to see that new gym built
before the boys graduate, Jane.

464
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:08,797
Thank you, gentlemen.

465
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:10,381
I appreciate that.

466
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:12,801
Now, what can I do for you?

467
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:17,050
Yes, well...

468
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,766
Your sons broke into my school

469
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:26,064
and changed
a number of students' grades.

470
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,565
Do you have any idea

471
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:32,487
how much that could have cost Rosemere
in terms of our reputation?

472
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:35,115
- We do, and it sickens us...
- Please let me finish.

473
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:36,767
In all my years at Rosemere,

474
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:39,494
I have never had
anything like this happen.

475
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:43,049
If word of this had gotten out
to the college community,

476
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:45,483
our transcripts
would have been disregarded,

477
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:47,627
our credibility ruined.

478
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:51,256
From what we understand, there weren't
that many grades tampered with.

479
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,755
That is not the point, H.L.

480
00:27:54,377 --> 00:27:56,990
Rosemere is dependent on its image

481
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,452
as a scrupulously honest
preparatory school.

482
00:28:00,572 --> 00:28:04,559
Your sons have shat all
over that reputation!

483
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,410
And perhaps
that is the price of privilege.

484
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:09,712
Jane, we all think that...

485
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:12,634
I've had to think long and hard
about how to best handle this,

486
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:14,237
and this is what I've decided.

487
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:18,325
I will not press charges
against your sons,

488
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:19,700
provided...

489
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:22,903
that they tell me who instigated this.

490
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:25,665
That student will be expelled.

491
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,818
The board is insistent
that I make an example.

492
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:31,755
So, I put it to you, young gentlemen,

493
00:28:32,622 --> 00:28:33,715
who is it?

494
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:39,215
Son?

495
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:41,705
You got something to say?

496
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:46,895
- It was Willie.
- What?

497
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:48,021
That's a lie.

498
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:49,878
Wait, Willie, is this true?

499
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:50,753
No!

500
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,582
Willie was pissed
about his lousy chemistry grade.

501
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:54,611
Bullshit.

502
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:56,613
It was me.

503
00:28:57,122 --> 00:28:58,811
I did it. My whole idea.

504
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:02,197
I broke into the school.
I changed the grades.

505
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:04,454
I'm the one that should be punished.
It's only fair.

506
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:06,799
You should probably expel me.

507
00:29:08,052 --> 00:29:09,430
We good? We done?

508
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:11,527
You good?

509
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,620
All right, good talk.

510
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:20,730
Excuse me.

511
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,893
I guess that takes care of it.

512
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:31,147
What is wrong with you?
Why did you do that?

513
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:32,848
She agreed to drop the charges.

514
00:29:32,968 --> 00:29:35,193
No one in prison.
Willie could go to another school.

515
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:38,914
Willie didn't do anything!
Willie had his chemistry grade changed.

516
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,533
It was Brent's idea,
and Lane hacked the computer.

517
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,684
I didn't know
they were gonna blame Willie.

518
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:47,032
It's not about Willie, Dad.
This is about you, okay?

519
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,733
You sat there and let them nail him.

520
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:51,793
That's the plan
you were telling me about?

521
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:54,462
My plan was to keep you out of prison.

522
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:59,745
I would do anything
to give you the chance I didn't have.

523
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:02,324
Look, Cal, this world...

524
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:06,099
it's about power and money,
and that's freedom.

525
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:09,352
God, Dad, I don't even know who you are.

526
00:30:11,662 --> 00:30:13,322
What you're becoming...

527
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:18,945
whatever it is,
I don't want anything to do with it.

528
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:23,363
I'd rather be piss poor with my dad

529
00:30:23,483 --> 00:30:26,035
than $13 million richer
with whoever you are.

530
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:52,937
Holy mother of shit.

531
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:54,405
It's Eamon Quinn.

532
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:56,858
I thought he got life.

533
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,949
How many people
you got to kill these days to get life?

534
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:06,826
Frank Linehan, that's you?

535
00:31:08,696 --> 00:31:10,324
'Cause you all grown up.

536
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,459
Ain't nobody gonna offer me a beer?

537
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:17,698
I think you ought to leave.

538
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:22,258
Little Ginny Dannegan.

539
00:31:23,356 --> 00:31:27,183
Last time I saw you,
you were about 12 years old.

540
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:30,219
I always knew you'd be a beauty.

541
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:32,894
You cannot just waltz in here.

542
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,459
I saw you.

543
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:38,175
I saw what you did
to my daddy and my uncle.

544
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,055
I didn't do nothing
that wasn't meant to be done.

545
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,073
Everybody's got to die sometime.

546
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:52,330
<i>Memento mori.</i>

547
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:54,666
Anybody here know what that means?

548
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,770
It means "remember, you're gonna die."

549
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,883
The roman slaves used to say it...
<i>Memento mori.</i>

550
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,636
Remember it,

551
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:09,973
or you're gonna live your life
like a dumb animal.

552
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:15,850
Maybe y'all need to read a book
every now and then.

553
00:32:45,244 --> 00:32:47,333
You can take your shot at me now.

554
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:50,196
Go ahead.

555
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:52,970
It's the code.

556
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:01,649
I know you had to do that

557
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,277
on account of what I did
to your daddy and all.

558
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:06,863
I got no hard feelings.

559
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:15,149
It would be common courtesy
for somebody to help me to my feet.

560
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:16,956
Right about now, huh?

561
00:33:20,351 --> 00:33:21,210
Good lads.

562
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:36,225
Somebody get me something to drink,
for Christ sakes.

563
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:39,771
Whatever happened to irish hospitality?

564
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:52,576
What?

565
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,202
I'm scared all the time.

566
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:57,218
Of what, darling?

567
00:33:57,532 --> 00:33:59,832
Feeling something bad's gonna happen.

568
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,219
Things I should have done, I didn't do.

569
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,468
And now I'm living
in this kind of purgatory.

570
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:13,883
That's life in Edenfalls, honey.

571
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,265
That's life everywhere.

572
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,729
You know what you need?

573
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:25,525
I promised Wayne
I wouldn't do that no more.

574
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,135
I'm not talking about drugs, honey.

575
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:33,350
All I'm saying is you need to...

576
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:36,828
figure out what it is
that you're afraid of.

577
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,415
What are you afraid of?

578
00:34:41,823 --> 00:34:43,399
Being alone, mostly.

579
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:49,227
Nobody to be loving me anymore,

580
00:34:50,184 --> 00:34:52,266
Ntaking care of me anymore.

581
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:55,763
I love you, Nina.

582
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,605
I love you, too.

583
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,604
Now, come on, stop it.

584
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:03,813
Let's go get us some good shit.

585
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:08,131
What?

586
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:12,551
Nina, you're meeting
your dealer at church?

587
00:35:13,983 --> 00:35:16,367
Of course not. It's an A.A. meeting.

588
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:36,124
What?

589
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:43,478
No, no, I'm coming right over.

590
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,826
I started using, drinking
around sixth grade.

591
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:52,068
I dropped out at 10th grade

592
00:35:52,188 --> 00:35:54,692
and started hitchhiking
across the country.

593
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:57,143
Lost touch with my family.

594
00:35:59,246 --> 00:36:00,540
By the '80s,

595
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:03,945
I was slamming meth
and robbing people as a way of life.

596
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:09,171
I ate out of trash cans,
slept in abandoned houses,

597
00:36:09,955 --> 00:36:12,172
until my arrest record
caught up with me,

598
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,255
and I wound up behind bars.

599
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,839
After I did some time,

600
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,114
I got my shit together.

601
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:21,242
I cleaned up my prison record,

602
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:23,507
got a whole new life for myself.

603
00:36:25,107 --> 00:36:27,021
It was my 30th birthday.

604
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,400
I figured, things were going so well,
why shouldn't I be able to celebrate?

605
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:34,350
Two days later,

606
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:36,761
I woke up in a motel,

607
00:36:37,824 --> 00:36:40,862
naked, sweating, shivering cold.

608
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:44,235
There I was on parole,

609
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,350
my life hanging by a thread,

610
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,918
and I had relapsed,
and I didn't even know why.

611
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,004
I had a shotgun at the house,

612
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:56,425
and I thought
I'd put the barrel in my mouth

613
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:58,048
and pull the trigger.

614
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:01,706
That way, I'd finally get some peace.

615
00:37:05,646 --> 00:37:06,631
That's it.

616
00:37:06,898 --> 00:37:08,234
Let's get out of here.

617
00:37:08,354 --> 00:37:09,866
Just hold on a second.

618
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:15,709
As I was walking past my son's bedroom
while he was sleeping,

619
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:17,821
it hit me.

620
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:20,652
It's like, "what about him?

621
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:24,802
"i mean, do you want him to grow up
without a father like you did?"

622
00:37:26,256 --> 00:37:27,915
That straightened me out.

623
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:30,069
I've been sober ever since.

624
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,406
Thanks for listening
and keep coming back.

625
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:41,376
Will you just wait for me in the car?

626
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:43,695
I'm only gonna be a moment.

627
00:37:57,714 --> 00:38:00,522
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure thing.

628
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:05,832
Did you ever break parole?

629
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:09,764
I ain't hanging out
with no more damaged men, okay?

630
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:11,937
Now you just go, you big, old drunk.

631
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:14,420
You take him out of here, Doug.
I'm calling the cops.

632
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:17,037
Hugh, she's gonna call the cops.

633
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:19,133
She loves this song.
This is her song.

634
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:22,200
It's my house.
She won't even let me in!

635
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:27,399
Oh, hell, Doug...
It just doesn't work without her.

636
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:30,186
What?

637
00:38:30,628 --> 00:38:32,006
None of it.

638
00:38:33,337 --> 00:38:34,899
I lost it, Doug.

639
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,817
You lost what?

640
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:38,767
My mojo.

641
00:38:39,828 --> 00:38:40,988
Your mojo?

642
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:47,505
I can't get it up.

643
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:53,056
Not with a hooker,
not in a Lamborghini, nowhere.

644
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,430
I spent $340,000 on a car.

645
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,131
Something better happen in my pants
or what's the point?

646
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:01,845
They got pills for that, don't they?

647
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,546
It's not the same. I like it natural.

648
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,584
It only works with Gigi.

649
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:11,076
I tell you, I'm not a man without her.
I got to get her back.

650
00:39:11,196 --> 00:39:14,021
I'm going to get her back.
That's right... Get her back!

651
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:16,565
Hugh, that would be a huge mistake.

652
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,313
Gigi stole your mojo.

653
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,988
You go back to her,
and she's just gonna steal more.

654
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:24,356
She'll suck it right out of your body.

655
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,242
You'll have negative mojo.

656
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:29,453
Believe me, there's only one way
you're gonna get it back.

657
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:32,146
How?

658
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:36,099
You got to reclaim your power.

659
00:39:39,352 --> 00:39:42,633
- What the hell are you talking about?
- This is simple law of physics.

660
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:44,593
Gigi stole something from you.

661
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:46,971
You got to replace it
with something equal and opposite.

662
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:49,764
Yet bigger

663
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:51,266
and more powerful,

664
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,730
like $150 million...

665
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,315
Bayou Hills, deal of the century,

666
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:00,567
a lasting legacy to the genius

667
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:03,027
that is Hugh Panetta.

668
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,615
That's you,
the source of all your power.

669
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:09,067
Gigi's Delilah to your Samson.

670
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:11,601
She's kryptonite to your super...

671
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:12,879
mojo.

672
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:16,506
And you must avoid her at all costs.

673
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:18,145
Otherwise...

674
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:24,550
I don't know.

675
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,151
Well, I do know, Hugh. You got
to get some meaning in your life,

676
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:30,678
the kind of meaning
that hard-focused, nonstop,

677
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,892
100-hours-a-day-type work's gonna do.

678
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,059
Gigi's is an impediment.
She's an obstacle.

679
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:38,481
She's a cancer.

680
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:41,442
You must excise her from your life.

681
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,059
She's toxic.

682
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:53,704
Most people wouldn't have the balls
to talk to me about my wife like that.

683
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:59,389
You really are my friend, aren't you?

684
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:02,755
I love you.

685
00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:04,541
I love you, Doug.

686
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:08,321
And I'm not even that drunk anymore.

687
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:09,970
Thank god I puked.

688
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:32,885
I'm Dahlia Malloy.

689
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:35,896
And I'm a...

690
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:39,458
I'm a parole violator.
