00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:03,604
<i>Last season on</i> The Riches...

2
00:00:03,724 --> 00:00:05,550
Now, who buys a house on the internet?

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,510
- A rich man.
- What about his job?

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,676
Someone's gonna come looking for him.

5
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:12,369
You gonna tell me no one's coming
throught them doors tomorrow?

6
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:13,850
I don't know who's coming.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,603
Okay, I'm confused.
I don't get it. What's the angle here?

8
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,963
- How are we bleeding them?
- We're not bleeding anyone!

9
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,494
- Oh, we're not?
- Then what are we doing here, dad?

10
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:23,359
The American Dream.

11
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:24,874
What?

12
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:27,989
We're gonna steal it.

13
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:31,136
Hi, I'm Doug.

14
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:37,916
Doug Rich! Meet your new team.

15
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:41,961
Panco team, meet your new legal chief.

16
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:45,977
Come and meet our new neighbors.

17
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:48,092
I'm Jim. This is my wife, Nina.

18
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:50,553
Andrea said we should
introduce ourselves.

19
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:55,058
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Doug Rich.

20
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:56,643
Haven't you read Calder v. Bull?

21
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,648
Have you read Hester v. Strapeling?

22
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:04,067
Ratson v. Catson?

23
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:07,779
You are the best goddamn lawyer
I ever met.

24
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,241
Dad, we have to do something.
Dale came here for us.

25
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:13,846
Dale seems to have been here
for a while now.

26
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:17,284
He could have blown our cover
at any point, he didn't. Why?

27
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:19,900
He's Dale. He's working an angle.
I don't know.

28
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:23,753
We have a lot to talk about, my friend.

29
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:26,840
Doug is a republican.
His best friend is Pete.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,657
Pete's a mortgage broker from Dallas.
He's e-mailed twice about a golf trip.

31
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,138
Is Doug here?

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,899
Doug who?

33
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,561
Guess you're probably surprised
to see me here, Wayne.

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,188
You and I both know
you're not Doug Rich.

35
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,983
Though everyone here...

36
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:46,517
seems to think you are.

37
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:47,652
Who are you?

38
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:50,751
And where the hell
is my best friend, Doug Rich?

39
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:57,365
I don't like Wild Berry.

40
00:01:58,504 --> 00:02:00,067
Yeah, you do.

41
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:01,708
You like it. Okay.

42
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:05,913
Got about an hour.

43
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:09,799
It's Hugh.

44
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,426
We don't have time.

45
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,305
Can we talk?

46
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:16,931
It's 4:00 in the morning.

47
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,850
She locked the doors on me.

48
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,976
We got to go!

49
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:23,897
We had this fight. I said some stuff.
I called her names.

50
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:25,226
Pete is not dead!

51
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,984
He is asleep! We do not have all day!

52
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:30,193
The saddest person she ever met.

53
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:31,653
She didn't mean that.

54
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:33,609
- She was upset.
- We are heading out!

55
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,448
I'm sitting here telling you I need you.

56
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:38,895
I'm on my way.

57
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,040
Oh, dear lord.

58
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:56,846
What happened to you?

59
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:00,103
I won't ask.

60
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:05,772
I won't tell.

61
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:07,181
I know.

62
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,420
I just wish...

63
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,115
I could come with you.

64
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,904
I just wish I had the guts.

65
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:19,453
Everything okay up there?

66
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,079
Please, help me!

67
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:28,461
You're...

68
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,507
That guy in the truck.

69
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:34,968
I'm a handyman.

70
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:36,637
Where are we gonna go? Mexico?

71
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,701
- I vote Canada.
- It's too far, Di.

72
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:39,964
What do you say, baby?

73
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:42,176
Wherever we go,
we got to go right now.

74
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,551
Mexico it is.

75
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:45,728
Sorry, Didi,
I could do with a margarita.

76
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,832
So, this,

77
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,405
Doug and Cherien,

78
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:57,654
the Riches?

79
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,877
You've known them for years?

80
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:02,227
They're real?

81
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,384
Or they were.

82
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,374
And these people,

83
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:07,812
wherever they are,

84
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,328
they took over their lives.

85
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,300
Information like that
you could hold over somebody's head.

86
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:19,304
You could use that to get some green.

87
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:21,870
You mean blackmail them?

88
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,308
Are you out of your mind?

89
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:26,394
I don't want money!
I want my friends!

90
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:30,356
We got to go to the police,
have those two arrested.

91
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:33,234
I have to find out what
they've done with my friends.

92
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,320
Oh, my God! What am I doing here?

93
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,685
What's wrong with me?

94
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:40,617
- They're getting away as we speak.
- No, they're not going anywhere.

95
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:42,368
Distributor cap's gone.

96
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:43,411
Shit!

97
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:45,830
Great, what the hell are we gonna do?

98
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,249
- That's got to be Dale.
- The guy's probably awake by now.

99
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,310
No. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay 'cause,...

100
00:04:52,305 --> 00:04:53,630
your dad has a plan.

101
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,026
Are you coming?

102
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:05,934
Yeah, Pete,

103
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:07,836
I'm coming.

104
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,028
Let's go for a little stroll.

105
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,026
You don't have a plan.

106
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,743
Well, not at the moment.

107
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,544
We got to get out of here.
How much money we got?

108
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:27,938
- 7 grand.
- 7 grand?

109
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,919
Your dad fakes it as a lawyer
for three months

110
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,876
and all we got is 7 grand?

111
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:33,651
Calm down. There's nowhere to run to.

112
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:36,023
We got to get out of here.
If Pete wakes up, calls the cops,

113
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,141
we're gonna get busted
for killing the Riches.

114
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:40,318
This is what we'll do.
I'll go back to the house.

115
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:42,239
I'll get the Mercedes,
and pick everyone up.

116
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,704
- The house could be crawling with cops.
- I'll take that risk.

117
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:46,486
Dale could be waiting for you anywhere.

118
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:48,977
- Well, I'll take that risk.
- Sam's gone.

119
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,650
Wait, wait, wait!

120
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:02,365
- Baby, what the hell?
- I have a plan.

121
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:05,436
Okay, what's your plan, sweetheart?

122
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:10,248
- Where did you get this?
- In the woods where you buried it.

123
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:12,064
I want to give it to Pete.

124
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,182
You're gonna bribe Pete?

125
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:17,182
You had this all along
without telling us?

126
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:20,354
- I was saving it for a rainy day.
- Oh, my God.

127
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:23,163
When your dad had
to break into Hugh's office

128
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,377
so that Dale wouldn't kill him,

129
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:27,974
- that wasn't rainy enough for you?
- Not as rainy as this.

130
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,642
You're gonna bribe Pete?

131
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:32,923
No, you can't, sweetheart.
You can't bribe men like Pete.

132
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:35,585
- Not with this.
- Why not with this?

133
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:39,703
Money makes the world go around.
Every man has his price.

134
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:45,107
Okay, good try.

135
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:46,655
Go wait for us in the RV.

136
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,717
All right.
Get in the car.

137
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,195
What's wrong? Get in the car.

138
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:27,405
I want you to grab the kids,
get the hell out of here.

139
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,127
I will meet you in Galveston.

140
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,787
Wayne, get in the goddamn car.

141
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:32,392
I'm not going, baby.

142
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,605
Got the 40 grand
and the 7 grand we saved up.

143
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:37,928
I'm gonna talk to him.

144
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,462
Like Sammy said,

145
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:42,131
money makes the world go around.

146
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,675
He's a little boy. You're a grown man.

147
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:47,878
There's things you want,
and there's things that are.

148
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,098
- You got to know the difference.
- I have to try.

149
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,077
You can't bribe Pete.

150
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,189
Don't you get it? He's honest.

151
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:02,276
Then I will buy you a little time
and get you closer to Mexico.

152
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,972
Get in the goddamn car.

153
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:07,657
If anyone's going to prison,
this time it's me.

154
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:00,728
Where are you, Pete?

155
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:13,597
Pete, you okay?

156
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:28,171
Jesus!

157
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,573
I scared you.

158
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:35,411
- Rough night, huh?
- Go shit yourself!

159
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:38,871
"Pete, you okay?"

160
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:41,209
Where is he?

161
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:43,252
I love this part.

162
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:48,716
I spilled a little bit on your bed.

163
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:52,345
Really nice bed.
It's very soft, pillowy.

164
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,472
Where are you, Pete?

165
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:01,569
What did you do with Pete?

166
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:08,611
<i>The mailbox of the subscriber
you are trying to reach...</i>

167
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:09,570
Pete who?

168
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,351
I'm just pulling your leg.

169
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:15,515
You're talking about your buddy, right?

170
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,411
Your buddy Pete.

171
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:19,079
Where are you, Pete?

172
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:22,333
You're really
gonna want to see this one.

173
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:23,790
Yes, Sirree.

174
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:25,948
Is that...

175
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:27,480
you...

176
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:28,589
Doug?

177
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,175
Is that you...

178
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,757
and your lovely wife?

179
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:40,184
What do you want?

180
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,022
What do I want?

181
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:46,607
I want to sit down
and formulate a little plan.

182
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:50,946
Blow it out your ass.

183
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,197
So what did you do? Did you kill them?

184
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:55,594
Move into their house,
start living their lives?

185
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,731
Is that what you did?
You stole their names?

186
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:00,246
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Where's Doug and Cherien Rich?

187
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:03,499
Where the hell
are Doug and Cherien Rich?

188
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,179
I got all the cards.

189
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,641
I'm holding all the cards,
and you're holding none.

190
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,838
What do you want to do?

191
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,319
Where is he?

192
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:32,948
Screw you.

193
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,639
It's just a little blood. Calm down.

194
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:39,201
Right now. Where is he?

195
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:41,454
- Put that thing away.
- Where is he?

196
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:42,705
Pete's alive.

197
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:45,458
He's just a little hurt, but he's fine.

198
00:11:45,618 --> 00:11:46,542
Bullshit.

199
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:49,211
He was gonna go to the cops.
I had to stop him.

200
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,979
I did you a favor.

201
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:58,734
I did you a favor!

202
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:01,216
Wait. I did you a goddamn favor, Wayne!

203
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,829
Where are you go... I did you a favor!

204
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:09,565
- What are you doing?
- None of your damn business.

205
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:12,193
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm a moron?

206
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:14,445
You ain't gonna find him.

207
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:17,406
He is safe and sound, tucked away.

THE LAST TEMPTATION OF WAYNE

213
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:08,791
Hey, man.

214
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:10,426
Man, wake up.

215
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,591
Come on, wake up!

216
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,390
You killed him.

217
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,516
I just... I hit him, and then...
But he fought back.

218
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:30,229
You murdered him!

219
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,148
- I did you a favor.
- You murdered him!

220
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:35,123
You were in a shit storm,

221
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:37,403
and I swept up all the shit.

222
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:39,321
Back up.

223
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:42,199
You owe me
a big goddamn favor, Doug Rich!

224
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:45,161
- Just back up.
- What are you doing?

225
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:47,236
Getting the hell away from you!

226
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:51,250
I'll call the cops.

227
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,377
- I'll call the cops on you.
- I don't care!

228
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:55,921
They'll think that you did it
'cause people saw you with Pete.

229
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:58,166
Call them, then! Go on, call them!

230
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:01,260
I will tell them...
that you killed the Riches.

231
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,146
Go ahead and do it, goddamn it!

232
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:10,441
Shit.

233
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:16,108
Jesus.

234
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:21,439
Shit.

235
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,709
Help me get him in the house.

236
00:14:33,335 --> 00:14:34,350
Come on.

237
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:36,545
All right, mama. Mind your head.

238
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:38,464
Get your foot in. Here's your blanket.

239
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,273
What are you doing?

240
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:43,896
- It's my stuff.
- Take that back.

241
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,763
Come on, I actually bought this shit.

242
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:48,224
You should have robbed it,
we're only taking necessities.

243
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,605
If you ask me,
you never should have let him go back.

244
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,687
- I'm not asking you.
- Yeah, mom, it's bad luck.

245
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,022
Don't say that!

246
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:58,025
It's bad luck. We work
when we're together. You know that.

247
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,653
We're not together, okay?
Your dad is a stubborn ass.

248
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,969
- We have to wait for him.
- We have to go back.

249
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,365
Don't you think I tried?

250
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:06,823
Okay, look, I know you're scared.

251
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,453
This is what we do.
We can do this, all right?

252
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:11,163
We split, we come back together,

253
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:13,950
we go on the road...
This is how we live our lives.

254
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,002
Have you forgotten?

255
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:22,333
Go on. Go close up the RV. Let's go.

256
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:29,932
- You can't take all those books.
- How many can I take?

257
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,768
None of them.
I mean, we're fully loaded up.

258
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,284
Oh, Jesus Christ.

259
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:38,880
We don't need
these damn buffer clothes anyhow.

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,984
Don't tell your brother or sister.

261
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,723
Easy there, Speedy.

262
00:15:51,113 --> 00:15:53,998
You got to keep your eyes on the road.
Eyes on the road, mom.

263
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,376
Watch it!

264
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:00,170
Shit. Sorry.

265
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,342
What the hell is that?

266
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,140
Mom, what is that?

267
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,169
Oh, shit. Nina?

268
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,196
I changed my mind.

269
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,449
As it happens, I do have 'em.

270
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:29,742
Have what?

271
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,368
The guts.

272
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,331
Nina, sweetheart,
you can't come with us.

273
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:37,582
My life's in shambles, Dahlia.

274
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:39,083
My future's bleak.

275
00:16:39,244 --> 00:16:40,821
My marriage is bust.

276
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,713
I mean, look at me.

277
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:46,008
Do I look like a woman
with something to lose?

278
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:48,566
I guess not.

279
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,629
We can't.

280
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:52,014
Get in the back.

281
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:53,974
Come on.

282
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,271
Get in, gypsy Rose Lee.

283
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:01,565
Sorry, grandma.

284
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,442
Come on, Sammy.

285
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,986
You don't need all that space
for your little butt.

286
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:12,942
What's wrong with Justin?

287
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,960
Don't move. Hugh?

288
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,132
Keep this against your head, okay?

289
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:20,552
Justin's blessing.

290
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:22,461
Who are you?

291
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:24,922
I'm Doug Rich.

292
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:29,927
- Your friend.
- Then why did you try to kill me?

293
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,638
I didn't know you were there!

294
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:33,722
Bullshit.

295
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:35,683
I was just back...
I was coming to see you!

296
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:38,868
That's really bullshit.
You never even asked where I was.

297
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:41,180
Jesus! Who the hell is that?

298
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,648
Hey, there, Mr. Panetta.

299
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:44,817
Doug, what the hell's going on?

300
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,371
Hugh, this is Dale.

301
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:50,406
He is a local handyman.
He's just helping me around the house.

302
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:51,865
At 4:00 in the morning.

303
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:53,851
We had a spillage.

304
00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,998
Okay, just stay here.

305
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:06,255
We have been acquainted,
Mr. Panetta, at your wedding.

306
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,717
That's a sweet ride
you have out there, the Denali.

307
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:12,886
Vortec, 6.2-liter.

308
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:16,106
I'm gonna have one of those one day.

309
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:18,767
If I work hard.
That's what I tell myself.

310
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,636
Whatever floats your boat.

311
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,566
- Help you out.
- Easy. Easy.

312
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:27,528
- What?
- Your hands.

313
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:30,946
Kind of dirty.

314
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:34,353
So, I don't like it.

315
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,076
Germs.

316
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:37,827
Little germs never hurt nobody.

317
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:39,621
No, I said don't... Geez!

318
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,623
Tell him not to touch me!

319
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,406
Get away!

320
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:46,100
Get away from me!

321
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,552
- Morning, officer.
- Is this your vehicle, sir?

322
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,250
It is. I am so sorry.

323
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,659
You realize that it's illegally parked
up here on your lawn.

324
00:18:58,779 --> 00:18:59,962
I know.

325
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:02,603
I need the bathroom so bad, I just...

326
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:04,757
I'm sorry to bother you
at this time of night,

327
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,230
but we just can't have this.

328
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:09,495
I understand.
This is no bother at all, officer...

329
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:15,240
I'm the new co-head
of Edenfalls security.

330
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:19,087
It is very good to meet you,
officer Delroy. I am Doug Rich.

331
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:21,371
- So you'll re-park the vehicle?
- Absolutely.

332
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:23,624
I will. The key's inside. I'll just...

333
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:25,542
- When?
- It'll be done.

334
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:27,348
I will do it right away.

335
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:30,079
Car sounds awful.

336
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:32,336
Mom, it's getting worse.

337
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,384
- You got to pull over.
- We can't stop.

338
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:36,219
Cops may have an apb out on us.

339
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,223
The car is bleeding antifreeze, ma.

340
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:41,207
Would you just stay with me, please?

341
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,582
We're gonna pull to the next town,
dump this piece of shit,

342
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:46,772
and Cal's gonna steal us a new car
'cause that's what we do.

343
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,273
Mom, I really don't want
to go to Mexico.

344
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:52,110
You're gonna have to go,
because it's either that or prison.

345
00:19:52,804 --> 00:19:55,460
<i>Adios, amoeba</i>.
Let's freaking cucaracha.

346
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:59,117
So, Doug is not a lawyer.

347
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,329
- He isn't even Doug.
- His name's Wayne.

348
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:05,582
Wayne Malloy.

349
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,045
- And you're Dahlia Malloy?
- That's right.

350
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,704
And the kids?

351
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,467
Kids are Malloys, too.

352
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,697
Then who are the Riches?

353
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,514
I don't know.

354
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,578
You mean you never met them?

355
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:26,770
We just stole their credit cards.

356
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,689
We're not their best friends.

357
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,274
So you're con artists.

358
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:32,822
That's right.

359
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:34,924
Some kind of identity thieves.

360
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,825
We're drifters, Nina.

361
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:42,369
We are grifters and drifters

362
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:43,763
and nomads.

363
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,045
We are the scourge
of the goddamned earth.

364
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:48,333
We are travelers!
Right?

365
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,857
Don't make Mama sing!

366
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:55,510
Come on.

367
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,176
<i>Busted flat in Baton Rouge</i>

368
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:03,015
<i>Waiting on a train
Feeling about as faded as my jeans</i>

369
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:05,434
<i>Bobby flagged a diesel down</i>

370
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:10,101
<i>Before the rain drove it
all the way to New Orleans</i>

371
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:12,905
Would you sing with me?
We're living large. We're on the road.

372
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:14,401
Come on, goddamn it. Sing.

373
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:19,156
<i>Freedom's just another word
for nothing left to lose</i>

374
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:23,360
<i>Nothing, I said nothing, hon,
if it ain't free</i>

375
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:26,788
<i>And feeling good was easy enough when</i>

376
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:29,134
<i>Bobby sang the blues</i>

377
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:33,337
- <i>Feeling good was good enough for me...</i>
- Shit.

378
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:35,429
And there she goes.

379
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:37,466
Nice. That's good, mom.

380
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:38,615
Oh, shit.

381
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:41,678
I should have stopped earlier.

382
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,893
Bobby McGee.

383
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:51,943
What the hell's going on?

384
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:55,010
Just be calm.
Keep that ice bag against your head.

385
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,940
Don't you tell me what to do.
You keep your dirty hands away from me.

386
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,987
Shut up, Hugh!

387
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:02,240
- Don't tell me to shut up! I say...
- You shut up.

388
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:04,785
- Car keys.
- What?

389
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:06,613
Give me your car keys right now.

390
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,363
Hold on. I...

391
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:10,987
Shit.

392
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:13,126
You lost your car keys?

393
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:14,787
Oh, no. Shit.

394
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:16,456
Shit. It's...

395
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:21,321
No, it's...

396
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:22,893
You looking for this?

397
00:22:31,605 --> 00:22:33,563
Fell out of your coat
while you was unconscious.

398
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,610
Thought I'd keep it for safekeeping.

399
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:40,217
Thanks.

400
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:49,037
Tussey custom-molded grip.

401
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,499
Matter of fact it is.

402
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:53,542
Fact it is.

403
00:22:53,703 --> 00:22:54,515
Sweet.

404
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,628
Okay, car keys now.

405
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,025
Quickly!

406
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,299
So, Dale...

407
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:07,347
Know your tussey, huh?

408
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:09,388
Yeah, I know my guns.

409
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:12,561
I can't find the keys.
I'll move it first thing in the morning.

410
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:15,327
Is that your vehicle, too?

411
00:23:15,447 --> 00:23:16,398
yes, that is.

412
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,693
- You got a busted tail light there.
- Yes. Fender bender.

413
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:21,486
With the Denali?

414
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,491
You can't drive around like that.

415
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:31,538
- I know.
- You want some help with it?

416
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,222
I'll be fine.

417
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:36,897
They probably got
some replacement bulbs in the trunk.

418
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,128
I believe they do.

419
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:40,048
But I'll be fine.

420
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:41,956
- You sure?
- Yeah.

421
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:45,404
- It'll only take a second.
- I like to do those things myself.

422
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,875
It shows you're the man about the house.

423
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:52,726
What's that?

424
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,062
What was that?

425
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:57,022
Well, that sound.

426
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:58,523
Was that an owl?

427
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:01,693
- Sounds like a cellphone.
- Oh, that's my cellphone.

428
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:03,154
In the trunk?

429
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:08,700
Aren't you gonna answer it?

430
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:12,496
Well, it's 5:00 in the morning.
It could be important.

431
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:14,414
Not at 5:00 in the morning.

432
00:24:16,174 --> 00:24:18,088
My kids, they did this.

433
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:20,261
That's where they hid it.

434
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:23,965
- Okay, it's none of my business.
- I've been looking for it all day.

435
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,738
The kids, they just...

436
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:28,678
My eldest...
I just can't do, he just does this.

437
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:31,598
It's none of my business, sir.
You have a good evening.

438
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:32,974
Thank you very much.

439
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:36,853
That was a gunshot.

440
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:39,272
That sounded like a loud cough.

441
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:42,054
- I have to investigate this.
- I don't even have a gun, actually.

442
00:24:42,174 --> 00:24:43,176
I know who it is.

443
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:46,154
- It's my friend, and he has...
- I have to do my job.

444
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:47,863
Step away from the path, sir.

445
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:50,607
I can't do that 'cause I pay your wages,
and I know my rights here.

446
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:53,203
- Step away from the path now!
- I will not do that.

447
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:55,956
- Step away from the path, sir!
- I can not do that.

448
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,786
I tried to tell you, Dale.

449
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:06,633
That's this kind of hair like triggers.

450
00:25:06,793 --> 00:25:07,792
Sure does!

451
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,929
Who the hell are you?

452
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,546
I have reason to believe
there was a gunshot.

453
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:15,934
Nope, there no gunshot.

454
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:22,749
Sir, I heard a gunshot.
Are you the owner of the...

455
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:25,158
- Who the hell are you?
- Hugh, calm down.

456
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:26,653
This is officer Moody.

457
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,697
Officer Delroy Moody.

458
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:30,949
Security. He's not even a cop.

459
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,078
Sir, I'm gonna ask you again.
Where is the gun?

460
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:36,623
Shut up.

461
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,623
Don't give it to him, Dale.

462
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:41,835
- I think your friend is a little drunk.
- He's trespassing!

463
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,545
You tell him,

464
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:44,588
"go home."

465
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:45,630
Shut up.

466
00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:48,091
Sir, let's just try
to be responsible here.

467
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:50,629
He's got no power.
He's a rent-a-cop.

468
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,846
He is bullshit!

469
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:54,347
Now, be a man

470
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:56,685
and tell him to go home!

471
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,104
Sir, please.

472
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:02,720
You heard the man.

473
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:04,291
Go home.

474
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:11,990
Jesus, Dale!

475
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,326
- I didn't say pull the gun on him.
- Dale...

476
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,203
Give the officer the gun, please.

477
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:18,974
I said "go home."

478
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,085
I can't go home.

479
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:23,746
I am on duty.

480
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:25,378
This is my job.

481
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:28,381
If I see alcohol
and there is a gun involved,

482
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:30,884
I'm required by law
to confiscate the gun.

483
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:31,968
Come get it.

484
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:39,935
No, I said come and get it,
bullshit man.

485
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:52,030
Put the gun down, Dale.

486
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:55,961
You make me.

487
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:06,169
Just how do you want this to end?

488
00:27:07,113 --> 00:27:09,123
Do you want to take him out, too?

489
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:12,592
Do you want to go to prison...

490
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:14,374
or...

491
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,348
do you want to be my partner?

492
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,706
Just how much blood
do you want on your hands?

493
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,654
50-50.

494
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,267
Blunt, huh?

495
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,609
I don't like the smell of this town.

496
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,467
All right, blunt's what we got.

497
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:15,828
We're gonna get a car,
and we're gonna get out of here.

498
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:17,581
Mom, I'm starving.

499
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:19,057
I could use a shower!

500
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:21,615
Honey, you got a bug in your hair, okay?

501
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:22,800
Come on, girl.

502
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,248
A normal breakfast
is all we're asking for.

503
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:26,867
I'd just like to point out

504
00:28:26,987 --> 00:28:29,126
that if you hadn't have got rid
of the toolbox,

505
00:28:29,246 --> 00:28:30,707
we wouldn't be in this mess.

506
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:33,298
I had to take it out for Sammy's books.
You should have spoke up.

507
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,387
Grandma looks tired. I think
we need to get her something to eat.

508
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,847
God, when did you kids become so soft?

509
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:42,515
Mama, y'all want some pancakes?

510
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:47,193
Mama, talk to me.

511
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,231
Is she dead?

512
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:57,113
Cal, put her over there on that bench.
Be careful.

513
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:00,617
Okay. Here we go.
You're all right.

514
00:29:00,777 --> 00:29:01,743
Mind her head.

515
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:04,996
Oh, ma, please don't die.
Is she breathing?

516
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:07,662
I can hear her heart.

517
00:29:08,854 --> 00:29:10,210
You hear her heart?

518
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:13,446
Yeah. It's just faint.

519
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:15,924
We got to take her to the hospital.

520
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:18,301
Hospital.

521
00:29:18,795 --> 00:29:21,887
Mr. Rich, I have to report this
to the police. A law was broken.

522
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:24,057
Officer Delroy, please call me Doug.

523
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:27,102
I just want to say one thing.
You know who that man is over there?

524
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,550
Like I said, I'm new here.

525
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:30,943
He is Hugh Panetta.

526
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,982
I mean, he made all this.

527
00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:36,403
Doug, with all due respect,
God made all this.

528
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:39,948
No, no, no, no, all this.
This. The Edenfalls.

529
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:44,635
His company carved out and created
this community of Edenfalls.

530
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:46,996
I mean, you got him
to thank for your job.

531
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:52,502
Well, I suppose, technically,
I did trespass on your property.

532
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,295
That's a legal situation
you got yourself in there.

533
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:56,548
I know. I'm a lawyer.

534
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,883
But I still have to turn in this gun.

535
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:02,178
Well, then you turn the gun in.
You keep it in the bag. It's safe there.

536
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:06,416
Well, Doug, for your information,

537
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:08,268
I am not bullshit.

538
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:10,562
It is my job to keep this place safe.

539
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:11,521
I know.

540
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:13,022
And I'm gonna do it.

541
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:14,816
Thank you.

542
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:17,639
Thank you so much.

543
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:21,601
Screw him.

544
00:30:21,721 --> 00:30:22,949
I got another one.

545
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,457
- We got to get you back home.
- I can't go home!

546
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:33,877
My heart's broken, Doug.
I lost my wife.

547
00:30:34,037 --> 00:30:36,629
- What did you do?
- Tried to give her this ring.

548
00:30:36,957 --> 00:30:38,996
And I was all excited about it, too.

549
00:30:39,116 --> 00:30:41,676
I wrapped it up.
I stuck it under her pillow.

550
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:43,678
- She didn't like it?
- She liked it.

551
00:30:44,614 --> 00:30:46,931
- What's your problem then?
- She didn't love it.

552
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,351
- That's what the problem is.
- How do you know she didn't love it?

553
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:52,520
The eyes. I could tell.
Something in the eyes.

554
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,690
You know, when a girl's lying to you,
she's trying to be polite.

555
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:58,151
I said, "Baby, you don't love it.

556
00:30:58,311 --> 00:31:00,403
"Why are you lying to me?"
And she's all...

557
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:03,448
"Dreams are complicated, Hugh."

558
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:06,651
Perhaps she was telling the truth
about the ring.

559
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,481
I know what lying is.

560
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:12,081
So I asked her, politely,
not to lie to me

561
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:13,917
and to be happy!

562
00:31:14,077 --> 00:31:16,839
I mean, she jiggy danced
in Vegas for a living.

563
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,670
Now she's living in a house on a hill.

564
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:20,298
I'm making her dreams come true.

565
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,842
Least she could do is be happy about it.

566
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:29,140
So she cried a little,
said she was happy.

567
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,977
And I guess I sort of took the ring
and just stuck it on her finger.

568
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:37,524
The ring didn't fit. It's too small.
I drew some blood.

569
00:31:37,684 --> 00:31:40,443
She called me a monster,
saddest man she ever met.

570
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,738
So, I pulled it off
and threw it in the toilet.

571
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:47,325
- I think it broke.
- The toilet?

572
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:49,913
The finger.

573
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:51,553
Anyway...

574
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,957
She's in pretty bad pain.

575
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:55,625
I tried to call 911.

576
00:31:55,785 --> 00:31:57,335
She kicks me out on the street.

577
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,187
How'd you get the ring back?

578
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:00,922
- What?
- From the toilet.

579
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:04,521
What's she mean?

580
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:06,844
"Dreams are complicated," Doug?

581
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,226
God. I don't know. Maybe she meant,

582
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:12,093
now she's got the house on the hill,
she doesn't want it.

583
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:15,307
- Then why'd she marry me, then?
- Maybe she married you for who you are.

584
00:32:15,427 --> 00:32:17,855
Who I am is
a guy with a house on the hill!

585
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:21,221
You busted her finger!

586
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,800
You want to apologize,
get down on your hands and knees.

587
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,072
You crawl and you ask for forgiveness.

588
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:28,825
Then you get some time off
and you take a vacation.

589
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:31,204
No. No, I can't.

590
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,496
You can't crawl on your hands and knees?

591
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:35,373
No. I can't take a vacation right now.

592
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,983
Hugh, just take a vacation, okay?

593
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:39,868
Can't. I can't. Come here.

594
00:32:41,664 --> 00:32:43,222
Take a look at this.

595
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:46,572
Bayou Hills, Doug.

596
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:48,303
We can't pass it up.

597
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,638
There will always be another deal.

598
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,517
There's not gonna be another Bayou Hills
as long as we live.

599
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:56,728
That's why I came over here
to talk to you tonight.

600
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:59,022
You came over here
to talk to me about your wife.

601
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:00,218
Her too.

602
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:01,775
Here. Look at this.

603
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:02,737
Christ.

604
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:05,746
Uh... right.

605
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:07,001
Sweet. Excellent.

606
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:08,168
Sweet?

607
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:12,125
It's the deal of a lifetime, Doug.
The state took our bid.

608
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:14,841
We're all-in.
We're not calling. We're not raising.

609
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:16,998
We're all-in!

610
00:33:17,158 --> 00:33:19,049
Five days to raise the money.

611
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:22,547
This goes through,
Panco makes $150 million.

612
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,880
I make a third of that,

613
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,090
and you cash in on a baker's dozen...
$13 million, Doug.

614
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:29,719
$13 million?

615
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,362
Your mother's heartbeat is very faint.

616
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:49,238
- What's wrong with her?
- Calm down.

617
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:51,783
She has arrhythmia.

618
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,826
Now, that's either from heart disease

619
00:33:54,377 --> 00:33:56,012
or she's dehydrated

620
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:57,163
and drunk.

621
00:33:58,263 --> 00:33:59,874
Has she been drinking?

622
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:01,501
No! Of course not!

623
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:02,567
You're sure?

624
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:04,253
Not that I know of.

625
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:05,874
Cause she reeks of alcohol.

626
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:21,938
No go?

627
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:23,856
Can I see your i.d., please?

628
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:26,851
Yeah. Hold on.

629
00:34:27,874 --> 00:34:30,362
Well, there we are.

630
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:33,116
Can you hear me, sweetheart?

631
00:34:33,276 --> 00:34:35,034
- Mrs., uh...
- Morgenstern.

632
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,414
Could you try to sit up for me?

633
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:41,332
It's Dr. Morgenstern.

634
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:42,457
Is she a doctor?

635
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:46,114
I want a large cadillac.

636
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:50,174
Everyone does, dear.

637
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,942
Does she have dementia?

638
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:53,010
We think.

639
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,846
- You think?
- We're sure.

640
00:34:55,006 --> 00:34:56,180
How was she diagnosed?

641
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,862
- Alzheimer's.
- Dementia.

642
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:02,854
There was a big debate going on
among the doctors who treated her.

643
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,002
So many...

644
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:08,752
things in here.

645
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:11,738
There we go. Yeah.

646
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,107
- Thank you, Miss Prestwich.
- Of course.

647
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:18,161
Never know who's spending
your money these days.

648
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:19,504
Don't I know it.

649
00:35:19,624 --> 00:35:21,956
How old is your mother, Mrs. Prestwich?

650
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:23,256
She's 78.

651
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:24,623
78...

652
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:28,171
Let me see.

653
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:31,048
Your daughter...

654
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,968
- says she's 91.
- Well, that's incorrect.

655
00:35:34,906 --> 00:35:36,177
All right, then.

656
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:39,599
I'm gonna need to admit your mother
to blunt presbyterian.

657
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:41,267
She's just drunk!

658
00:35:41,427 --> 00:35:43,644
You don't know much
about your mother's health.

659
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:45,229
You gave her alcohol.

660
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:47,190
You barely know how old she is.

661
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,009
Now, if anything,

662
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:50,777
that's elder abuse.

663
00:35:50,937 --> 00:35:52,320
You saying I abuse my mother?

664
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,865
- Do you know how old your mother is?
- I beg your pardon?

665
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:59,327
Do you know how old your wife is?
Do you know about their health affairs?

666
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:01,909
When was the last time
your wife had a pap smear?

667
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:03,831
Well, as...

668
00:36:03,991 --> 00:36:06,709
I don't want to know.
That's not the point. I love her.

669
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:11,255
How dare you accuse me of elder abuse!
I'm outraged!

670
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:12,753
You just calm down.

671
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:17,053
Your mother is coming with me,
and she's coming to blunt presbyterian.

672
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:19,968
You just wait here a moment,

673
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:21,654
and I'll be right back.

674
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:24,224
Son of a bitch.

675
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:25,737
White coat.

676
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:28,731
Say I don't love my ma.
I'm a good daughter.

677
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:31,067
Have you used that card recently?

678
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:34,779
You know, I don't know.
Maybe not recently.

679
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:39,659
That must be the problem then.
I bet they froze it for security.

680
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:44,372
Please, I really just want
to get my grandmother treated.

681
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:47,124
That's why you should give
those Visa folks a call.

682
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,171
The card's dead.

683
00:36:52,508 --> 00:36:53,923
Oh, shit. Shit!

684
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,102
If they froze Prestwich,
they froze them all?

685
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:58,336
- I guess. Probably.
- Hey, you got any cards?

686
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:00,095
Uh, I left them.

687
00:37:00,556 --> 00:37:02,723
I left all my credit cards and cash.

688
00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:05,017
- You ran away without a penny?
- Yeah.

689
00:37:05,177 --> 00:37:05,935
Why?

690
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:08,250
I thought it would be more fun.

691
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,982
You know, kind of live off the earth.

692
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,640
You got to get cash.

693
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,696
Okay. All right. Pay with that.

694
00:37:16,856 --> 00:37:19,490
Find out exactly what medications
they need for her.

695
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:24,787
Screw blunt presbyterian.

696
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:28,153
She just got to get rehydrated.

697
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,003
Y'all want to live off the earth,
now's your chance.

698
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:09,296
I can't believe grandma was drunk.

699
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,486
She wouldn't even let me have a sip.

700
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,184
- She drank that whole thing of whiskey.
- I know.

701
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:16,672
That's, like, amazing.

702
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,593
- What's going on here?
- Football night.

703
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:21,850
Oh, that figures.

704
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,566
- Everything all right here, folks?
- Great. Thank you.

705
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:26,682
You ordered too much.

706
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:29,518
- We'll just take some of it with us.
- We don't have the cash, Di Di.

707
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:31,846
We just had to pay for mama.
We're going on the road.

708
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:33,655
We got to pay for gas and drugs.

709
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:35,650
Whatever you haven't started,
you send it back.

710
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,068
I need my steak and eggs.

711
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,155
- I'm gonna get up.
- Don't you...

712
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:43,783
Don't you... I'm warning you!

713
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:46,118
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Such a little bastard.

714
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:04,804
Can I eat my steak and eggs?

715
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:14,397
That's nice. That's real nice.

716
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:17,858
You robbing old ladies now, hmm?
Feel good?

717
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:20,569
Do you feel good?
That was a shitty thing to do.

718
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:23,406
Let that be your "comeupponce."

719
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,157
I think the word is comeuppance.

720
00:39:25,544 --> 00:39:27,952
What are you, the word police?
You shut your pie hole.

721
00:39:29,354 --> 00:39:31,539
Wrap that steak in a napkin.
Go steal me a car.

722
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,752
- Don't you look at me like that.
- Can I come?

723
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:38,217
No, sweetheart.

724
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,131
Starsky don't need no Hutch.

725
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:49,003
You all right there, ma'am?

726
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:50,850
Are you sure?

727
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:52,883
I thought I had $40.

728
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:55,081
Oh, sweetheart. I know how that is.

729
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:56,188
Here you go.

730
00:39:56,348 --> 00:39:57,594
Don't you mind that.

731
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:13,121
Jesus!

732
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,250
You scared me to death.

733
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:19,003
I just want to see how it's done.

734
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,191
Which way, Doug?

735
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:35,018
Which way to the light?

736
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,291
Just through these doors.

737
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,748
I can't talk.

738
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:48,616
I'm with him now.

739
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:52,938
This goddamn town
is giving me the creeps.

740
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:55,125
Let's get ma and get out of here.

741
00:40:58,302 --> 00:40:59,259
Partner.

742
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:00,844
We said 50-50.

743
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,480
I love you.

744
00:41:06,445 --> 00:41:08,058
<i>I love you.</i>

745
00:41:09,988 --> 00:41:11,514
I love you. Where are you?

746
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,099
I'm at the house.

747
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:14,183
Where's Pete?

748
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,152
We are in this together.

749
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:19,528
Did you really think
that spiking my scotch would lick me?

750
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:22,691
Pete's fine. Everything's all right.

751
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:24,628
Everything's all right.

752
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:27,279
Well, everything's all right.

753
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,240
Where do you think you're going?

754
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:30,592
Oh, Jesus.

755
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:33,577
This is my van.

756
00:41:37,136 --> 00:41:38,749
The gang's all here.

757
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,251
Get out of the car.

758
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:46,293
I am talking about a certain dead body
festering in the trunk.

759
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:49,151
I know what you're talking about,
and I am dealing with it.

760
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:52,221
So why don't you get out
of the goddamn car now?

761
00:41:52,502 --> 00:41:54,014
This ain't your car.

762
00:41:54,696 --> 00:41:56,425
And that ain't your house.

763
00:41:56,545 --> 00:41:58,050
And I don't know Doug Rich,

764
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,766
but I'm assuming he, too, is
in a festering condition, am I right?

765
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:05,332
You rat me out,

766
00:42:05,452 --> 00:42:06,726
I rat you out,

767
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:08,771
vice versa and so on.

768
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:11,801
Mutually insured destruction.

769
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:15,396
We're in this together...
Two peas in a pod.

770
00:42:16,155 --> 00:42:19,272
Mutually "assured" destruction,
you asshole.

771
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,934
That's right. "Mutually assured."

772
00:42:22,054 --> 00:42:25,254
Mutually insured to the bitter end.

773
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:30,423
What's the plan?
