00:00:01,704 --> 00:00:03,454
<I>Previously on "The Riches"...

2
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,887
- I'm sorry.
- You wanna pretend to be the dead guy?

3
00:00:10,987 --> 00:00:13,262
You want to wear his suits,
and you want me to be to his dead wife?

4
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:15,275
Do you really think dad has a plan?

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,700
He stole the money, ma lost the money,

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,970
and now we're here
in a dead guy's house.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,793
How'd y'all get in the front gate?

8
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:23,927
We live here.

9
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:28,280
Why are we gettin' a bill from Mountain
View Nursing Home for $4,700 a month?

10
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:30,980
- Must be where Cherien's mother is.
- Come on, ma,

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,934
- we're getting out of here.
- It's Cherien's mom.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,253
Does it matter?

13
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:39,293
If my husband's gay?

14
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:41,119
It doesn't matter to me.

15
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:42,789
Well, you're not his wife.

16
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:44,724
School bus is here!

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,978
Oh, him?

18
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:51,045
Aw, got yourself a buffer boyfriend.

19
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,535
- Aw, Jesus Christ, chunky!
- What's wrong with you idiots?

20
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:56,291
Shut the goddamn door!

21
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,691
I wanted to be a partner, but
there is my partner lying on the ground.

22
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,440
Something about it makes
me sick to my stomach.

23
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:06,981
I'm not lying, Wayne.
I told you, I'm off that shit.

24
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,071
I was gonna flush it!

25
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:14,167
How big a supply is this?

26
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:17,135
- A month? A week?
- No, Wayne! No! No!

27
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:19,612
Are you tryin' to blow
this whole thing to hell?

28
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:23,465
How do you like it,
watching someone you love self-destruct?

29
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:25,530
I've messed up your whole life.

30
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:29,566
All I ever wanted was
a messed-up life with you.

31
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,420
Baby, you gotta get up.

32
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:48,501
Oh, baby.

33
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:51,489
Oh, baby.
You gotta get up, go to work

34
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:52,686
What?

35
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:55,714
Yeah, let me see.

36
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:02,166
Meth hangovers are the worst.
Just the worst.

37
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:05,792
You know, you gotta drink
a lot of water. Come on.

38
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,535
- You still got your job at Panco, baby.
- Don't want it.

39
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:12,680
- Hugh's an asshole.
- Yup, he is.

40
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:14,260
Now,

41
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:19,295
I was up all night,
and I've been thinkin'.

42
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:22,396
I've really been screwin' things
up since we got here, you know?

43
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:25,431
And, after yesterday, Jesus,

44
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,560
I can't do this anymore
to you and the kids.

45
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:32,316
This life we got here is a good thing.

46
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:35,915
I think we just gotta take it on,
you know? Make it our own.

47
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,185
Really?
Sure.

48
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,913
Now, you know what else
I've been thinkin', Wayne?

49
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,759
We need to get us some ishka.

50
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:49,797
We need to clear all the shit out,
do a cleansing, all of us together.

51
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:51,447
Remember? Like that time in Kentucky,

52
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,064
when we went in the river
with all snow on the rocks?

53
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,086
Now?

54
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm sure there's a cold
river around here somewhere.

55
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,883
- No.
- Yeah. Cleansing baby, cleansing.

56
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:06,034
Now?

57
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:08,964
Come on. Let's just do it.

58
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,006
The school bus is
gonna be here any minute.

59
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:14,318
Mom, you know, I got a math quiz today.
I can't just go jumpin' in a river.

60
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,111
- Sorry.
- It's library day.

61
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:19,235
I gotta return my books,
otherwise, I can't get new ones.

62
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,557
- Banana.
- With a bit of vanilla yogurt.

63
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:25,897
Okay, let's just do it later then,
all right? We'll do it after school.

64
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:37,988
Look, we got to deal with
the whole dr. Morganstern situation,

65
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:41,164
'cause you really miss all your
friends at the home, don't you, mama?

66
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,899
She doesn't miss her friends.
She likes it here.

67
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,523
- Can we talk about this later?
- We're gonna have to talk

68
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:49,222
about it eventually because,
you know, we can't keep her.

69
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:51,021
- Hey! Give me that, you jerk!

70
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,298
Give it.

71
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,335
It's Eric. He wants to
know if you're wearin' the shirt.

72
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:55,390
What's "the shirt"?

73
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,053
Eric bought them both matching shirts.
It's very cute.

74
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:01,530
They are not matching, Cal.
They're similar.

75
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:04,284
You're such an idiot.

76
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,425
I thought we had to get to work.

77
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,643
What's wrong with you?

78
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:19,223
He's such a dick, mom.

79
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:22,450
Don't mind him.
I think it's nice you got a friend.

80
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:25,125
- You do?
- Yeah. It means you're

81
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:28,332
gettin' adjusted to this place.
I guess.

82
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:32,416
Hey, I want to show you somethin'.

83
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:38,878
I'm through with it, see?
I'm through with it, all of it.

84
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:42,833
- Wow, that's great, mom.
- No, no, I mean it.

85
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,909
- I'm... I mean it.
- Okay.

86
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:47,731
'cause I don't want you to feel
like you got to protect me no more.

87
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,691
It's not fair,
and, you know, I'm gonna do it myself.

88
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:54,513
- Whatever you say, mom.
- School bus is here, Di.

89
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:56,496
- Gotta go. Bye.
- Okay.

90
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:01,722
Hugh's not back yet.

91
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:05,309
What do you mean, he's not back yet?
Where is he? What's he doing?

92
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:07,609
He told Kimmie he was at the
mortgage brokers convention in Reno,

93
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,816
but when she called the hotel,
he wasn't registered.

94
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:10,867
Shit.

95
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,592
He just called and fired Larry in legal.

96
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,554
Called him a sniveling dickhead.
He cancelled his company credit card.

97
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,136
You know what? He did the
same thing to Sabrina in accounting.

98
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:19,216
- You're kidding.
- And now he won't even

99
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,276
answer his phone.

100
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,873
- Does he do this often?
- Not since I've been here.

101
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:24,066
- It's kind of freakin' everybody out.
- Did you hear about Hugh?

102
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:25,945
- I just did.
- Maybe he's having a nervous breakdown.

103
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,683
I had a professor who did that once,
he ended up

104
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:29,067
naked on the Golden Gate Bridge.

105
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,128
What if he's under investigation
by the FBI or something?

106
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:32,898
Let me tell you something,
if anything goes down,

107
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,502
I ain't taking the rap for Hugh's shit.

108
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,774
- Is Panco going under?
- No, of course, it isn't.

109
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:40,157
I'm sure everything's gonna be fine.
Now, everyone, just go back to work.

110
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:41,377
I'll go...

111
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,286
make some calls.

112
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,302
You know what's going on here.

113
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:52,388
- Hugh's on a meth bender.
- Wayne,

114
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,479
the man is an animal stone-cold sober.

115
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,895
God knows what kind of
mess he's gonna make for himself.

116
00:05:56,995 --> 00:06:00,368
- I know, we gotta do something.
- Well, these people are panicked.

117
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:02,570
They need leadership.

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,323
You want to be a partner?

119
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:07,487
That white one.

120
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,078
Well, this is what you want, ain't it?

121
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,119
Is it what you want?

122
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:17,908
Long as we're here,

123
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:20,451
if we're gonna stay,

124
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:23,969
might as well commit, right?

<i>Anything Hugh Can Do, I Can Do Better</i>

132
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,196
So there it is.

133
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,648
As of this moment,
I am in control here.

134
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:13,306
What are you, General Haig?

135
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:16,930
I'm the chief financial officer.
I've been here seven years.

136
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,646
You, what, seven minutes?

137
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,790
What, uh, makes you the boss?

138
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:24,732
Well, Mason, these partnership

139
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:28,125
papers that I have signed with Hugh.

140
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,484
- May I?
- Absolutely.

141
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:34,148
So this is the situation.
Hugh, at the moment,

142
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,628
is in a clinic,

143
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:40,458
where he is undergoing intensive

144
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,998
Gestalt therapy,
designed to purge himself

145
00:07:43,102 --> 00:07:46,361
of all of his abusive behavior,
which we all know about.

146
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,398
This is a good thing,

147
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:51,903
and he'll be back very soon,
hopefully better.

148
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:54,029
But, Mason...

149
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,919
Thank you, I welcome your question.

150
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,750
I welcome all your questions.

151
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:59,955
In fact, my first

152
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,803
act as a partner is to
institute an open-door policy.

153
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,257
Come to me with your questions.

154
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:08,543
Just come on in, let's have a chat.

155
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:12,179
Things are gonna go a little
differently around Panco from now on.

156
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,113
I talked to Hugh last week about
taking tomorrow off. I've got finals.

157
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,391
No problem, Aubrey.
Your dreams are my command.

158
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:20,951
Great. I've got crim
pro and real property,

159
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:23,412
and you know what
a killer that's gonna be.

160
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:29,010
What?
Oh, now that Larry's been fired,

161
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,420
you're gonna have to take over
his cases until we hire someone new.

162
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,001
- Anything pressing? - Nothing much.
A few contracts, pending settlements.

163
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:40,763
Oh, you are going to have to go
to court tomorrow on the Oxenberg case.

164
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:44,253
- Court? - It's a hearing.
It's not a trial or anything.

165
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,306
A nuisance suit against Panco,
a little discrimination thing.

166
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,499
How little?

167
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:52,079
Hugh intentionally blew the sale on a
house in the Paradise Grove development.

168
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,998
The couple is claiming discrimination.

169
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,232
On the basis of what?
They're gay.

170
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:59,478
Larry filed a motion
for summary judgment.

171
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,788
Aubrey, quick snap test.

172
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:05,762
Summary judgment,

173
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:09,201
which means we are
going to try to...

174
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,056
Get the suit dismissed.

175
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:14,455
You will. That is,
I'll be gone, remember? Finals?

176
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:17,840
Hey, I got an idea.

177
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:19,794
Call Larry. Tell him

178
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,900
new boss in town.
He's got his job back.

179
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,633
Larry is too pissed to go for that.

180
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:27,589
In fact, I wouldn't
be surprised if he's filing

181
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:29,604
termination suit as we speak.

182
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:33,475
Well, I am excited by this, but, uh

183
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:35,969
it's not my specialty,
you know?

184
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:39,146
I'm a securities lawyer.

185
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:40,554
Don't worry.

186
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:43,237
Larry's done all the work.
All you have to do is show up.

187
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:48,007
With your experience,
it should be a piece of cake.

188
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:49,854
Piece of cake.

189
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,749
I don't get many guests over for dinner.

190
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:06,042
I used to be real popular
in high school, but, lately...

191
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:07,563
I don't know, must be the arm.

192
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:10,987
I bet you were a
cheerleader in high school.

193
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:13,158
I was.
How'd you guess?

194
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:16,208
Well, now, what about you?
What were you in your teenage years?

195
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:18,165
I used to start a lot of fires.

196
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:24,449
I'm kiddin' you.
I was football, quarterback.

197
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:27,130
Now, see, I knew it.
You got that look.

198
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:31,010
I'm sorry to keep you out here.
He just...

199
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:34,542
He doesn't allow anybody in the
house while he's watching "Jeopardy!"

200
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,815
- I think you're pretty.
- Excuse me?

201
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:40,659
I said, i think you're pretty, Hartley.

202
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:42,375
Be careful now.

203
00:10:42,927 --> 00:10:46,558
Know what I'm gonna do for you?
Gonna do all your landscapin' for free.

204
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,919
I'm gonna cut them shrubs over there.

205
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:55,880
Oh, God.
Is your cake done?

206
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:58,749
No, that's him.
I can't hire you, Dale.

207
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,701
You need to go.

208
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:04,172
He can't keep you in a gilded cage.
Oh, you wanna bet?

209
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:05,937
I got the prenup from hell.

210
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,085
Hugh's had it out for
me since the day I was hired.

211
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:13,539
Well, that must be difficult,
but let's look forward.

212
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,940
He threw a cell phone at my head once

213
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:19,079
because he spilled a glass
of water on his own desk.

214
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,011
That's not good.
Um...

215
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:26,210
What can we do to make
Panco better for you, Greg?

216
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,201
- I'd like my own office.
- Right.

217
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,671
And an assistant would be nice.

218
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,862
All right. Well

219
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,351
- we'll see what we can do.
- Really?

220
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,959
Panco does not have to be run by fear.

221
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:44,078
We can do better than that.

222
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,094
Smile, grandma.

223
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:50,076
This'll help bring
some glow to your face.

224
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,472
You seem like a winter.

225
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,127
Let's try some pink.

226
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,492
You have very pretty eyes, grandma.

227
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:14,370
See, when you accentuate
your best features,

228
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,503
you feel better about yourself.

229
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:18,986
I sure do.

230
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:23,371
Banana.

231
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,897
I won't let them take you away in a van.

232
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:34,734
If they do,
i'll hotwire a car and come and get you.

233
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,396
I'll take a large cadillac.

234
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:46,704
No, marcy.
I know it was a bad divorce, i do.

235
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,761
Hugh always spoke very fondly of you.

236
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:54,003
What can we at panco do for you?

237
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:56,255
A parking space with my name on it.

238
00:12:56,536 --> 00:12:57,767
Better "hold" music.

239
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:00,862
Healthier snacks in the vending machine.

240
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,292
Other companies give their
employees parking spaces all the time.

241
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:07,742
Really?

242
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,959
A longer lunch break 'cause
i barely have time to eat my yogurt.

243
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,003
That seems reasonable.

244
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,305
I know he's an asshole.

245
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,980
No, i'm not sayin' he's not an asshole.

246
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:18,168
He's just an asshole who
i've got to find right now,

247
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,663
so i was wondering if you could...

248
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,637
Just with my name. It doesn't
have to be too big, just little.

249
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,675
Staff meetings, 'cause we're
supposed to have weekly staff meetings.

250
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,083
I mean, what happened to them?

251
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,101
And...?

252
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,810
A damn parking space.

253
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:40,369
Well... That was pointless.

254
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,750
All right! Oh, Jesus!

255
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:46,144
Well... What's pointless?

256
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,411
Talking to these people.

257
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,851
Whatever happened to hopes and dreams?

258
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:51,927
They have no vision.

259
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:54,062
Their lives have become so narrow.

260
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:55,939
They're just working to work.

261
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,979
Wayne, it's pretty hard
to have hopes and dreams

262
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,969
when you're just tryin' to survive,
you know?

263
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:08,111
Okay, let's see the timeline.
Death of louis xv.

264
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:09,779
May, 1774.

265
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,364
All right, king louis xvi crowned.

266
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,382
June, 1774.

267
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,196
Hey, there.

268
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,135
Nice shirt.

269
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:29,580
Thanks, dude.

270
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:34,330
Okay, eric, let's, uh...
Let's keep going.

271
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:39,472
King louis xvi tried for
treason and monarchy was abolished.

272
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:43,695
1792, and that is when
marie antoinette lost her head.

273
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,280
You know, it's close,
but, actually, it's in 1793.

274
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,037
Hi, di. Hi, eric.

275
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,570
- Hello.
- Hey, mom.

276
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,467
You want to stay for dinner?

277
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,755
i would, but i gotta go.

278
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,603
I told my mom i'd be back at 5:30.

279
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:01,465
Wait, i thought you're gonna
help me with the reign of terror, baby.

280
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:03,809
You know, it's my weakest thing.
You were gonna quiz me.

281
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,441
I can't.
I got my dad's car.

282
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,153
Well, i can quiz you.
I love history.

283
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:10,065
That's okay, mom.
It's fine.

284
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,798
No, no, it'll be good. Here.

285
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,728
What was the initial impact of

286
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:19,447
the death of "lewis x-v-i"?

287
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:26,815
"lewis x-v-i." that's a good one.

288
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,191
What?

289
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:30,518
No, never mind, mom.
It's no big deal.

290
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:32,207
It's cool.

291
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,255
Why? What's funny?

292
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:35,358
Well, it's "louis the sixteenth,"

293
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:36,977
but, i mean, don't worry about it.

294
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,487
Come on, eric, i'll, uh, walk you out.

295
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:44,062
See you later, mrs. Rich.

296
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,595
- Bye, eric.
- Shut up, cal.

297
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:56,271
Well, lewis, louis, who gives a shit?

298
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,699
He's a buffer prick, ma.

299
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:11,169
Gay money, straight money,
what difference does it make?

300
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,886
Well, let me try to clarify that, doug.

301
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:18,461
Five families decide to buy houses
in a cul-de-sac in paradise grove.

302
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,273
Five churchgoing families,

303
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,921
who want to create a
family-value-oriented community

304
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,340
in which to raise their kids.

305
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,308
- So...?
- So, they're in escrow, okay?

306
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:32,199
One day, they look over,
and they see two women.

307
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,293
Two women in khakis and penny loafers,

308
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,307
shakin' hands with the realtor

309
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,770
in front of the sixth house
of their little cul-de-sac.

310
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,546
Khakis and penny loafers?

311
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:44,881
It's not that they don't
like gay people, mind you.

312
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:46,853
They just don't want
them living next door.

313
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:50,089
So, let the churchgoers
move somewhere else.

314
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:52,951
Well, the problem is, is...
Greg, please.

315
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,363
The problem is

316
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,344
we've been just as much
a victim of the downturn

317
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,696
in the housing market as anybody.

318
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,709
The houses in paradise grove
just aren't selling that well.

319
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,174
We've used some bullshit collateral
to get our last loan from the bank,

320
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:07,294
and the only real source
of money to repay those loans

321
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:09,326
is from those five homes in escrow.

322
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:12,406
And while you're thinking about it,
put this in your hat and smoke it...

323
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,728
All our loans are cross-collateralized.

324
00:17:14,924 --> 00:17:18,525
If one loan fails,
the whole house of cards folds.

325
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:19,933
Meaning, panco.

326
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,129
That's right, my friend.

327
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:24,287
So, you ask me what the difference
is between gay money and straight money?

328
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,341
In this part of the country,
christian money begets christian money,

329
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,321
and gay money puts you out of business.

330
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:43,300
- Hi, nina.
- Hi, there. Come on in.

331
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,260
I didn't know you did pottery.

332
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:48,861
Yeah, um, started as a hobby.
Now it's sort of taken over my life.

333
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:55,298
Oh, hi, cherien. Uh, this is wes.
Wes, our neighbor, cherien.

334
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:58,098
- Oh, so she's the one...
- Yes.

335
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:00,819
We're on our way to the market.
Need anything, nina?

336
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:03,306
No, thanks.

337
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:04,618
Well, we'll see you later.

338
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:05,781
Nice to meet you.

339
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:11,623
They're making a
bouillabaisse for dinner.

340
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:12,994
He seems all right.

341
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,715
Wes? Oh, he is.

342
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,581
Real nice.

343
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,000
Good cook.

344
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:20,510
So,

345
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,571
- he and jim are...
- Friends, yeah.

346
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,533
For some time now, it seems.

347
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:28,738
And you're all just

348
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,586
hangin' out together?

349
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,609
Jim and i have been
doing a lot of talking

350
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,146
since your dinner party, dahlia.

351
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:38,803
I guess you could say
we've come to an understanding.

352
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:41,571
Neither of us wants to downscale
at this stage of our lives,

353
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:44,246
and there's zinny to think about,
so

354
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,477
we're sharin' the house.

355
00:18:47,064 --> 00:18:48,694
That's about all we're sharing.

356
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,369
Well, i do not know
how you are doing it.

357
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,433
Whee!

358
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,103
I got a problem, nina.

359
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,769
- With this?
- No.

360
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:06,153
With didi.

361
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,353
I don't know how to talk to her anymore.

362
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,206
I don't understand.
It's weird.

363
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,963
When they're little,

364
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,746
they just kind
of look up to you.

365
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,174
They just want to dress like you,
be like you.

366
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:17,595
I mean,

367
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,103
people used to call her
my little twin.

368
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:22,622
And now she doesn't want
to have nothin' to do with you.

369
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:26,091
Well, i'll tell you one thing.

370
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:31,777
I sure as hell don't have any answers.

371
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,211
Zinny hasn't been out of her room

372
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,581
except to go to school
since she turned 13.

373
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,906
She is a real bitch.

374
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,369
Most days, i just leave her alone.

375
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,724
It's either that or kill her.

376
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:45,862
Oh, god.

377
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,123
I got a big stack of
books if you want to read 'em.

378
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:50,630
Maybe you'll have
better luck than i have.

379
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,469
Is that...

380
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,132
It's a lighthouse.

381
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,950
Nice job, di.

382
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:07,317
- What, cal?
- What?

383
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:10,214
You've turned into a total
buffer asshole. That's what.

384
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,320
Why? Because i actually study?

385
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:14,525
I don't give a shit if you study.

386
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,408
Well, what do you think
we're supposed to be doing here,

387
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:18,939
- cal? Robbing houses?
- No,

388
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,326
di, i think we're supposed
to be wearing matching shirts

389
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,974
under our uniforms and thinkin'
we're better than everyone else.

390
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,938
I do not think that i am
better than anyone else, cal.

391
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:30,196
I'm just trying to get along here.
Maybe you should try that.

392
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:33,405
Maybe.

393
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:37,493
<i>Well, i may not know so much of law,
mr. Feller,

394
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:40,261
<i>but i know what's
right and what's wrong,

395
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:43,117

396
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,114
Thank god.

397
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:52,528
- Where are you?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

398
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:55,395
<i>Somewhere in the desert, i'm guessin'.

399
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,432
Right. Well,

400
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:00,180
are you okay?
I mean, everybody's worried.

401
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:02,973
<i>Doug, did you know
that muslims fast for the

402
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,076

00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,942
<i>Get this...

404
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,264
No, i didn't know that.

405
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,657
Look, i gotta talk to you
about the oxenberg case, okay?

406
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,721
<i>Get this: it's not
just food they give up.

407
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,316
<i>They give up all

408
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,818
<i>Oh, thank you, tarquin.

00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:21,225
<i>Sex and, you know?

410
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:22,716
- So...
<i>- Carnal stuff.</i>

411
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:24,155
So let me get this straight...

412
00:21:24,204 --> 00:21:25,918
You are in the desert with some muslims?

413
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:28,642
<i>No, but i am fasting... I think.

414
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,557
<i>And it's brought me
a shitload of clarity, too.

415
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:34,164
<i>Here, listen to this...

416
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:36,945
<i>"the candle is not there"

417
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:38,964
<i>"to illuminate itself."

418
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:40,648
<i>is that heavy or what?

419
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:43,310
Extraordinarily heavy.
Okay, look, hugh.

420
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:44,912
<i>- Doug, buddy.</i>
- No.

421
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:47,404
<i>You're my only friend.

422
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:50,462
<i>You're the only one that gets this

423
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:53,040

<i>Okay, listen to...
Listen to me, hugh...

425
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,985
i'm feelin' a little... I gotta go.

426
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,499
<i>- Doug, i'm getting a little dizzy here.</i>
- No. Hugh.

427
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,271
Hugh, hugh, stay with me!

428
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:07,140
God damn it!

429
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:16,882
Hey, how is it goin'?

430
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:18,885
Fine.

431
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,134
Good. That's good.

432
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:31,409
What are you doin'?

433
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:35,215
Well, di, i just want you
to know that i'm here for you.

434
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,409
If you want to talk about anything,

435
00:22:37,932 --> 00:22:39,999
if you feel like sharing.

436
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,157
Sharing what?

437
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:46,048
Just talking, lettin' me
know what's goin' on in your life.

438
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:49,045
I don't feel like it.

439
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:53,066
Well, you know, what i'm hearing now

440
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:55,716
is that you're not in the
mood to talk about it right now.

441
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,400
Yeah, that's what i'm saying.

442
00:22:57,692 --> 00:22:59,621
Okay, well, you know what?
That's too damn bad

443
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:02,420
because i have somethin' to
say to you delilah malloy! I don't like

444
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:05,530
the person you're becomin'. You're
turning into a mean, nasty little bitch.

445
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,412
and that is not the person i raised!

446
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,124
The person that you raised?

447
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:10,629
You were in prison.

448
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:13,164
I was in prison for two years.
I never stopped being your ma.

449
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,941
I took care of everybody...

450
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,741
Dad, sam, cal.

451
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,749
And now you, what? You want to
come back, and you want to be the mom.

452
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:22,871
I think it's a little bit late for that.

453
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:25,044
You know what your problem is?

454
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,062
It's that you're just scared.

455
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:30,213
You're just scared that
i'm gonna be better than you,

456
00:23:30,436 --> 00:23:32,989
that i'm gonna go to college,
mom, and i'm gonna be somebody.

457
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,515
I gonna be somebody
that you could never be.

458
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:36,931
Bullshit.

459
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,874
You know what scares me?

460
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,317
How quickly you've
become one of them buffers.

461
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:45,156
It's "those" buffers, mom.

462
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:47,880
You have completely lost
touch with what's important.

463
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:49,530
Look at that guy you picked.

464
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:52,728
He is nothin' more than
a haircut and a shit-eating grin.

465
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:55,685
I love him.

466
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:58,165
Oh, you love him?

467
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:02,615
- What does that mean to you?
- I'm sleeping with him.

468
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,174
Without a blessing?

469
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,122
You're a real little buffer now.

470
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:19,021
Congratulations.

471
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:28,222
Since its inception nearly 15 years ago,

472
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:31,754
panco properties has had a history

473
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:36,029
of community-building and family values.

474
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:38,782
We sell to families...

475
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:40,376
It's what we do.

476
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:44,234
We sell to all kinds of families:
red, yellow, black, white.

477
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:45,846
Are you really gonna say that?

478
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,925
Well, i was thinking of.

479
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,842
That sounds like some kind
of bullshit to me, wayne.

480
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:53,853
What's that got to do
with anything anyway?

481
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:56,244
Well, what am i supposed to say?

482
00:24:56,607 --> 00:25:00,338
This is about discrimination. We do
not discriminate under the law.

483
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:04,070
A gay couple has complained

484
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,022
that hugh and panco have
refused to sell them their house

485
00:25:07,112 --> 00:25:08,253
because they are gay.

486
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,210
Now, here is the thing:

487
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:11,641
gay people are not

488
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:14,377
specifically protected
under the fair housing act.

489
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:17,601
Hugh can absolutely
refuse to sell to them

490
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:20,517
and not be breaking any laws.

491
00:25:21,224 --> 00:25:23,869
Are you gonna stand there
and tell me that that's okay?

492
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,273
Absolutely. It's completely legal.

493
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:30,117
But, no, no, i mean, it's not okay, but

494
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,432
in this state and in
the whole country, as it is,

495
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:35,750
gay couples are not
protected under the constitution.

496
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:38,196
- Well, they should be.
- Well, that's not the point.

497
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:40,967
The law is on hugh's side.
I can win this.

498
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:43,014
So you're gonna walk
into court tomorrow,

499
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:47,597
and you're gonna defend hugh's right
to be a total flamin' asshole?

500
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,604
Yeah. That is what
is so great about the law.

501
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,241
Well, that makes you
an asshole, too, wayne.

502
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:59,897
Excluding people? Oh,
my god, are you kidding me?

503
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,429
What if that was your child, huh?
What if that was your son?

504
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:07,940
You are no better than hugh.

505
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,653
Well, if i don't do it
and panco collapses,

506
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,573
what are we gonna live on?

507
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:15,565
Air?

508
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:20,600
So this is it, huh?

509
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:27,575
The american dream.

510
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:33,607
What happened?

511
00:26:35,673 --> 00:26:39,712
This morning, you were all gung-ho
about me stepping up for hugh,

512
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:42,574
making a commitment, showing leadership.

513
00:26:42,737 --> 00:26:44,187
Well, maybe i changed my mind.

514
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:49,114
Maybe i thought you were
gonna be better than hugh.

515
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,248
I am better than hugh. I have
already made a difference.

516
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,794
Honey,

517
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,389
i'm just doing my job here.

518
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:01,117
And, you know, we should all be
pretty damn glad that i can do it

519
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:03,171
because it is not easy.

520
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:05,870
I gotta go into a real
courtroom tomorrow,

521
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,786
argue in front of a real live judge.

522
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:10,417
You know what?

523
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:12,700
I think i'm gonna do okay.

524
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,612
What is the point if all you're doing
is buying into their buffer bullshit?

525
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:18,768
It is not all black and white.

526
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:20,887
Not all buffers are bad.

527
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:22,004
Oh, really?

528
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:25,121
Well, i'm real glad you think so 'cause
your daughter's sleepin' with one.

529
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:55,612
So, di.

530
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:02,713
Here you go, mom.

531
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:05,091
You're not doug.

532
00:28:05,454 --> 00:28:07,106
And you're not my mom,

533
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,738
but we're having fun
with pancakes, aren't we?

534
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:16,507
So, baby?

535
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,976
Yeah, dad?

536
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:26,365
- Got enough money for lunch?
- Yeah.

537
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:29,139
Yeah, you gave me $10 yesterday, rember?

538
00:28:29,212 --> 00:28:30,213
Right, right, right.

539
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,713
Okay. I gotta go get ready.
Thank you for breakfast.

540
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:35,412
Okay. Di?

541
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,009
Dad,

542
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:40,654
we only did it once. We used protection.
I don't know how i feel about it, okay?

543
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:42,570
Okay, okay, great.

544
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:44,138
Good talk.

545
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:50,803
That wasn't so hard.

546
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,460
Don't know what i was worried about.

547
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:56,161
I made some calls.

548
00:28:57,206 --> 00:28:58,208
Anyone i know?

549
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:14,835
Well, i had a chat with didi.

550
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:19,641
It seems she and eric

551
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,444
had sex once, and she used,

552
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:25,333
uh, you know, birth control.

553
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,301
It made me feel better.

554
00:29:34,596 --> 00:29:36,237
We had sex when you were 15.

555
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,141
We were married, wayne.

556
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:40,651
We were in love.

557
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,700
She didn't even talk to us.

558
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,486
She didn't get no blessing.

559
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:50,089
I have no idea who that girl has become.

560
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,195
Well, she's living here now.

561
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,488
If we were living back there,

562
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:57,349
she'd probably be married
to that idiot and pregnant.

563
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:59,208
Is that what we want?

564
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:03,404
Baby,

565
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,219
you're taking this too hard.

566
00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:08,224
Didi is still didi.

567
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:11,360
No matter what she says or doesn't say,

568
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:15,556
she still needs you,
and i need you, too.

569
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,128
I got the whole of panco in my hands.
I can't do this without you.

570
00:30:23,118 --> 00:30:24,384
Well, i'm still here, ain't i?

571
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:32,049
- Where's aubrey? I need aubrey.
- Finals.

572
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,748
Right. Damn.

573
00:31:34,358 --> 00:31:35,520
Anyone hear from hugh?

574
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:37,843
No, but there are some people
waiting in your office.

575
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:39,425
Who is waiting in my office?

576
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,574
I think they said their
name was "mockingbird."

577
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:44,420
doug, doug, i know you
promised greg his own office,

578
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:46,482
but i actually have more
seniority than he does.

579
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:48,151
All right. Well, you get an office, too.

580
00:31:48,223 --> 00:31:49,254
We don't have the space.

581
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,259
- All right, well, no one gets
an office. - What?! That's bullshit!

582
00:31:57,603 --> 00:31:58,822
I'm liz oxenberg.

583
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:01,233
Oxenberg.

584
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:03,586
Yes, that oxenberg.

585
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,710
- Hello.
- This is max.

586
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:15,809
- Hi, max.
- Hi.

587
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,674
Gwen doesn't know i'm here.

588
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,687
She'd kill me if she did.

589
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:24,033
I just wanted to see
the face behind panco.

590
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,678
Well, i'm hardly the face behind...

591
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,401
You know, i didn't even want
that piece of shit house originally.

592
00:32:28,543 --> 00:32:31,124
It's too small.
The construction is crap.

593
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:34,045
It doesn't have much of a backyard.

594
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:37,931
- So, why... - Because it's all we could
afford on both our salaries,

595
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:41,165
and it's in the best public
school system in ducaine.

596
00:32:41,448 --> 00:32:42,980
We wanted that for max,

597
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:47,036
even if it meant we had to live next
door to a bunch of homophobic bigots.

598
00:32:47,377 --> 00:32:49,220
They didn't even give us a chance.

599
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:52,312
We're not worthy of their cul-de-sac.

600
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:55,148
Guys like you are lucky.

601
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,948
You will never experience
what that feels like.

602
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:03,400
See you in court, mr. Rich.

603
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:04,960
Come on, max.

604
00:33:14,915 --> 00:33:16,276
Can i talk to you, doug?

605
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:18,744
Now is not a good time.

606
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:22,515
I sit next to tony, as you know,

607
00:33:22,742 --> 00:33:26,174
and, lately, i've noticed he's been
making a lot of personal calls.

608
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:28,755
Long distance personal calls. I just...

609
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,960
Write it up, and we will
talk about it later.

610
00:33:33,322 --> 00:33:35,392
Well, i just know hugh wouldn't like it.

611
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:39,448
Ashleigh, try hugh's cell number again,
and keep trying until he answers.

612
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:40,610
And then?

613
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:43,531
And then i'll talk to him, sweetheart.

614
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:45,999
What?!

615
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:47,870
Was greg just in here ratting me out,

616
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,224
just because he's pissed
about the whole office thing?

617
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,777
What a friggin' wuss. You know
what you need to do, doug...

618
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,876
What i need to do is work!

619
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:59,130
So what i need you to do is to get
out of the goddamn office, tony!

620
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,059
All of you,

621
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:03,555
stay out of my office!

622
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:06,022
I am working!

623
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:10,986
I have to be in court today!
Do you have to be in court today?!

624
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:13,568
Thank you!

625
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,459
Just stay out...

626
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,884
Well, didn't take you long to turn
into one of them screamers?

627
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,614
They won't leave me alone.

628
00:34:27,578 --> 00:34:29,053
I'm just sayin', wayne.

629
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:30,755
You're scarin' me.

630
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:32,910
I got him.

631
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:35,718
- He's on line one.
- Thank you.

632
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:40,937
<i>What do you want, doug?
Tryin' to relax here.

633
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,547
Hugh, you still with the muslims?

634
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,334
<i>What the hell are you talkin' about?

635
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:50,477
i've gotta talk to you about
the oxenberg hearing today, okay?

636
00:34:50,836 --> 00:34:51,857
Oxenberg?

637
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,267
<i>Yeah, you know,
the paradise grove thing?

638
00:34:54,578 --> 00:34:56,791
Oh, the carpet munchers.

639
00:34:57,301 --> 00:34:58,351
What's the problem?

640
00:34:58,464 --> 00:34:59,910
<i>Pretty clear-cut case, ain't it?

641
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:02,369
Well, yeah, legally, absolutely.

642
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:03,643
Clear-cut case, but...

643
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:06,639
<i>jesus christ, don't
start with the morals crap.

644
00:35:06,712 --> 00:35:08,933
You're a lawyer. You don't have morals.

645
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:12,418
Oh, not my face, too, darlin'.
This stuff smells like shit.

646
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,582
- No, hang on.
<i>- Here's the point</i>

647
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:17,748
<i>on this oxenberg thing,
it's just business. It ain't personal.

648
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:19,635
I don't have a problem with gays,

649
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:21,784
but... Here, look at it this way.

650
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:24,383
You paid a shitload
for your house, right?

651
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:25,895
- Yeah.
<i>- Right, right?</i>

652
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:29,088
<i>Well, you want to look out the window
and see a bunch of guys french kissin'

653
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,963
<i>or havin' some kind of naked
pool party with your kids around?

654
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:35,069
Shit, no. I pay that kind
of money for a house,

655
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:39,237
i don't want to live next to somebody
i don't want to live next to!

656
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:41,488
<i>It's my right as an american citizen.

657
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,607
But i have met the oxenbergs.

658
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:46,540
They have a kid, you know?
They're harmless.

659
00:35:46,946 --> 00:35:51,911
Doug, i sell that house to them, i lose
millions of dollars. End of story.

660
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:56,470
I gotta go. This nice girl's gonna
finish wrappin' me up here.

661
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,995
Hugh, just...

662
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:06,170
You don't have to do this, wayne.

663
00:36:09,015 --> 00:36:10,598
Dahlia, you don't understand.

664
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:29,708
hey. What's up?

665
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:31,505
- Hey, di.
- Hey.

666
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,739
Gettin' some gum.

667
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:35,227
Eighty-one cents.

668
00:36:36,316 --> 00:36:37,350
Out of ten.

669
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:42,381
There you go.

670
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,868
I really don't want all this
change, man. I'm sorry.

671
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:47,938
I mean, you can probably
use it more than i can.

672
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:49,608
You mind if i give you 10 ones for a 10?

673
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:50,733
- Whatever.
- Yeah?

674
00:36:54,032 --> 00:36:56,442
Thanks. I really don't want
to carry around a lot of bills,

675
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:57,473
you know what i mean?

676
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:00,336
You know what? Um,

677
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,795
i'm not thirsty. Let's just...

678
00:37:01,878 --> 00:37:03,490
- Let's go.
- What? I am.

679
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,393
- Let's get back.
- Wait. Hold on. What's...

680
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,610
What is the rush?

681
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:09,399
You gave me too much, dude.

682
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,763
Oh, shit.

683
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,714
I'm an idiot, man. I'm sorry.

684
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:15,130
Is that witchblade? I love witchblade.

685
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,629
I'm more of aspawnguy myself.

686
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:18,005
Spawn's for freaks, man.

687
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:22,286
I'm sorry. I'm holdin' up the line.
I'm talkin' too much.

688
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,225
Here, why don't i just
give you this for the 20?

689
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,369
Is he doin' what i think he's doin'?

690
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:30,291
You know what? I don't care. I'm not
gonna stick around to watch this.

691
00:37:30,343 --> 00:37:31,357
- Come on.
- Thanks.

692
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,012
- Thanks, man.
- All right now.

693
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:55,353
Next.

694
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:05,142
Where are you?!

695
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:12,736
There was a man.

696
00:38:13,128 --> 00:38:14,319
What man?

697
00:38:15,582 --> 00:38:17,412
I made some calls.

698
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:28,302
What's wrong with you?

699
00:38:29,158 --> 00:38:30,160
With what?

700
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:33,515
Why did you short count the sales guy?
You don't need the kale.

701
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:35,838
Just keepin' up my skills, di.

702
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:38,162
You could have been arrested.

703
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:40,209
You did it in front of eric.

704
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:42,909
I did it in front of eric?

705
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:45,071
Eric is clueless.

706
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:47,894
He knew exactly what
you were doing, cal.

707
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,217
Luckily, he just thinks
you're a total asshole.

708
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:54,225
Good. This is who i am.
I'm all right with that.

709
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,677
Fine.

710
00:38:56,758 --> 00:39:00,243
You know what? Be whoever you want to
be, cal, but don't screw this up for me.

711
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:02,102
These people...

712
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:04,901
Your boyfriend,
the teachers, the neighbors,

713
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,165
i don't get it. Why do you give
a shit what they think of you?

714
00:39:09,258 --> 00:39:10,896
Because i like them, cal.

715
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,451
How many of them will be
there for you in the end?

716
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:19,111
When it really counts, di,
when all this goes to shit?

717
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:21,980
Not one.

718
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,883
You know, i used to look up to you,

719
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:29,124
and now i don't even know
who you are anymore.

720
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:31,610
You don't know who i am anymore?

721
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:36,222
I'm not the one who's changed, di.

722
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:41,031
I'm not the one who's turned my back on
my family'cause i'm ashamed of who i am.

723
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:04,724
All rise.
Honorable judge pearline now presiding.

724
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,708
In the case of oxenberg,
thomas v. Panco inc.

725
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,644
- Your honor, douglas rich for the
accused... For the defendant.

726
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:18,631
May it please the court.

727
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:23,307
Your honor, state and
federal laws prohibit

728
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:26,268
discrimination on the
base of race, religion,

729
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:27,358
and gender.

730
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,218
- However...
- Let me stop you right there, mr. Rich.

731
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:31,408
Your honor?

732
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:33,645
I have read your arguments, mr. Rich,

733
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,779
and you are right.
They don't have a case.

734
00:40:35,953 --> 00:40:37,971
Your summary judgment is granted.

735
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,876
Case is dismissed. Bailiff, what's next?

736
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,070
That's it?

737
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,761
You won your argument, mr. Rich.
Do you want a medal?

738
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:50,693
Bailiff?

739
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:55,281
Case number 0-2-7-0-5-9-5,
Atkinson v. Layton.

740
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:07,507
What are you doin'?

741
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:08,900
Don't you know i fired you?

742
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:10,351
I don't need to get paid.

743
00:41:10,453 --> 00:41:12,486
Well, you can't just
put plants in my yard.

744
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:14,781
I told you, everett doesn't
like me having friends.

745
00:41:14,955 --> 00:41:16,915
Then we won't be friends.

746
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,197
Dale, you need to go.

747
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:23,465
I think you're a treasure.

748
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,702
- I'm gonna call the police on you.
- Go ahead.

749
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:29,258
I'll call my husband.

750
00:41:30,812 --> 00:41:32,554
God, you are beautiful.

751
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:37,099
I am gonna paint your
house from top to bottom.

752
00:41:39,045 --> 00:41:40,061
Please go.

753
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:42,457
You want me to go?

754
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:47,089
Or do you want me to move in?

755
00:41:48,222 --> 00:41:50,647
Everett hears everything
that goes on in that house.

756
00:41:50,736 --> 00:41:52,334
I think he's got cameras.

757
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:55,717
- I think he's got me bugged.
- Then i'll move into the pool house!

758
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:58,113
I'll be discreet.

759
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:03,035
Dale, you are really cute,

760
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:05,213
but i think you might be crazy.

761
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,211
I'm gonna be your handyman.

762
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:15,902
I'm gonna come in real handy.

763
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,038
<i>- His back is broken.
- Broken?

764
00:42:22,214 --> 00:42:25,254
<i>But, apparently, only enough
to put pressure on the spinal cord.

765
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:27,307
<i>The only way to
remove that is to operate.

766
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:30,217
<i>- Then why haven't you?
- I thought you understood.

767
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,000
<i>He may not be strong
enough to survive it,

768
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:34,379
<i>and, under the circumstances,

769
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:37,362
<i>i couldn't assume the responsibility
without your consent.

770
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:46,538
What are we gonna do with you, ma?

771
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:52,216
- There was a man.
- There's always a man.

772
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,220
One of life's tragedies.

773
00:42:56,413 --> 00:43:00,290
We fall in love, then we have to deal
with all the shit that comes with it.

774
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:01,655
Now, wait a minute.

775
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,385
I'm not going to be held
responsible if that boy dies.

776
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:07,115
Why do you think cherien
turned out such a bitch?

777
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:09,758
Was it 'cause of you?

778
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:13,112
Was it somethin' you did or didn't do?

779
00:43:22,363 --> 00:43:24,992
I feel like a crap
mother most of the time.

780
00:43:27,344 --> 00:43:29,304
I was two years in the slammer,

781
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:31,772
did a lot of drugs,

782
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,183
did a lot of bad things.

783
00:43:35,184 --> 00:43:37,188
I ain't gonna win no good
parent award, you know?

784
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:44,245
I love my kids more than the world...

785
00:43:48,007 --> 00:43:49,590
But no one told me how to do it.

786
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:57,881
Boy, i wish you could tell me how.

787
00:44:08,337 --> 00:44:09,615
I've been clean two days.

788
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:12,505
I guess that's somethin'.

789
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:37,880
I'm lockin' up now, sir.

790
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:39,419
Right, officer.

791
00:45:12,702 --> 00:45:13,704
What's this?

792
00:45:14,618 --> 00:45:15,664
It's a cup of tea.

793
00:45:16,585 --> 00:45:19,163
I thought it might help if you
were gonna be up late studying.

794
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:21,283
Thanks, mom.

795
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:24,797
Trust don't come easy, didi.

796
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,672
I know that better than anyone.

797
00:45:30,664 --> 00:45:31,680
I can wait.

798
00:45:34,788 --> 00:45:35,804
Mom?

799
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,335
I never slept with eric.

800
00:46:06,837 --> 00:46:07,839
Hi.

801
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:11,005
Hi.

802
00:46:12,965 --> 00:46:14,765
I don't know how to be myself

803
00:46:15,491 --> 00:46:16,493
here, wayne.

804
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:21,968
Sometimes i think i do,

805
00:46:23,726 --> 00:46:25,076
then it all gets messed up.

806
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:27,065
I mess it up,

807
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,478
and i end up blamin' everyone.

808
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:33,687
In camp,

809
00:46:35,414 --> 00:46:36,663
there are rules,

810
00:46:37,665 --> 00:46:38,696
traditions.

811
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,051
It just kind of makes sense.

812
00:46:43,836 --> 00:46:45,230
But now that we're here...

813
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:49,729
I don't know what the rules are.

814
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,622
Neither do i, baby.

815
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,182
Neither do i.

816
00:46:56,678 --> 00:46:58,919
I guess we're making them up as we go.

817
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:03,627
I was thinking...

818
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,214
You still want to find
a cold river somewhere?

819
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:13,922
'cause i do.

820
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,246
it's not exactly a river.

821
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,386
Those rocks aren't even real.

822
00:47:34,315 --> 00:47:35,563
It's all we got.

823
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:38,768
How'd it go in court today?

824
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:40,924
I won.

825
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:45,660
I'm sorry.

826
