1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Looks like we gotta
figure this one out, huh?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I was under the impression all
the figuring had been done, Greg.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,000
I've got the slugs,
Spike. We're on our way.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,400
Ed, the range is short

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,900
and that thing doesn't shoot straight.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,600
You don't hit him dead on,
it could be bad for Sam.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,000
Spike, we've got no choice.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,500
Why should he live?

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,700
Why should he live?!

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,500
When, every day,

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
what he did kills all of us, Greg.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,400
it kills all of us a little bit more

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,500
and a little bit more
and a little bit more,

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,700
till there's... there's nothing left.

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,600
There is something left, Walter.

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,300
What? There's no reason why.

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,500
There's just people in pain,

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,300
spinning around a black hole,

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,100
hoping that somebody, anybody...

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,000
Go, now!

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,500
Could put chili peppers in her smoothie?

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
No. No, shaving cream in her locker.

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,200
Put shaving cream in her locker.

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,400
That is a great idea. What
are we, in summer camp?

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,800
We're gonna short sheet her bed next?

26
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,800
Come on, she's 10 years vet.

27
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,000
She's been hazed by the best.

28
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,100
We gotta come up with something good.

29
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,500
Something real good.

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,900
Sam, any ideas?

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,100
Do we really need to haze her?

32
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,500
I mean, she's not gonna
be here forever, right?

33
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
No, but we wanna make her feel
like she's part of the team, right?

34
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,200
We don't know when
Jules is gonna be back.

35
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,500
Guys, after the escort today,

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,400
we take all the kevlar out of her vest,

37
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,100
we fill it with cream cheese,

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,000
then we do the obstacle course.

39
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,300
First time she falls flat on her face,

40
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,500
instant hilarity.

41
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
You know what? You're a genius.

42
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,100
All right, Wordy, get a camera for that.

43
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,800
What are you? Mr.
Mature all of a sudden?

44
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,500
Come on, who's the guy

45
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,900
that put the pepper
spray in Spike's gear

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
his first day, huh?

47
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,500
Wordy.

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,200
It's like you said,

49
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,100
"we're not dealing
with some rookie here."

50
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,600
She deserves a chance to settle in.

51
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,600
Make a good impression.

52
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Then you get the boots
with the cream cheese...

53
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,600
Hi, boys.

54
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,700
Morning.

55
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,700
Hey, Wordy, that escort
job we have to today,

56
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,000
I could use the shield... refresher

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that we talked about.

58
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,600
Okay.

59
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,800
Sure. 5 minutes?

60
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,700
Mm-hmm. Awesome.

61
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Take your time. Yeah.

62
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,900
Mm, 'kay. See you out there.

63
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,200
All right. Gentlemen.

64
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,100
What?

65
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
It's just that sometimes you don't...

66
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,800
really know what it is
that's gonna set it off.

67
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,400
It could be a...

68
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,400
a song.

69
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,900
Or, uh...

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
something that she used to say.

71
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,000
But this time it wasn't uh...

72
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,000
anything like that.

73
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
It was...

74
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,400
more about the loneliness.

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,700
Anyway it happened and now I move on.

76
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,100
My name is Wendy

77
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,400
and I miss my little girl.

78
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,400
But it has been 8 days
since my last drink

79
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,600
and I'm just very happy
to be here right now.

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,100
I'd say you got our attention.

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,900
Well, I was just trying to...

82
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
throw you guys off a little bit.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,100
Spare myself the whip
cream in the boot trick

84
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
for a day or two.

85
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,100
Yeah, well, you know the drill.

86
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Are you kidding?

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,100
Back in vice, I wrote the drill.

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
So, you were in vice for how long?

89
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,900
Four years. Two in undercover.

90
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,600
Apparently, I make a very
convincing meth freak.

91
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,200
Really?

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Which I try not to take too personally.

93
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
Yeah, blending in with those guys...

94
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,200
I don't think I could do it.

95
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,200
Yeah.

96
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,800
You know what the worst part is?

97
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,400
You kinda get used to it.

98
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Oh, yeah?

99
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,600
I saw the opening here, I thought...

100
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,000
I wanna be a straight
up good guy, you know?

101
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,300
Sounds pretty damn nice to me.

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,100
Uh, you know what?

103
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
It's great.

104
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,400
Okay, thanks, Spike.

105
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,700
All right, we're gonna go over the brief

106
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,600
one more time,

107
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,400
catch donna up to speed.

108
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
It's good to see you.

109
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,600
It's good to see you too.

110
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,200
Wendy.

111
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
I thought I might find you here.

112
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
Sorry about the wait.

113
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,000
My lawyer's been all over it.

114
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,800
You just need to sign and, uh...

115
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Well, I always thought your maiden name

116
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,200
was prettier anyhow.

117
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,800
Uh, look.

118
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,700
Nobody's supposed to
know about this, but...

119
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,800
they're flying him in today.

120
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,000
Who?

121
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
What do you mean, "who?"

122
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
The leslie spit killer
is our escort job?

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,500
Peter Wilkins, yup.

124
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,600
17 women in 6 years.

125
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,300
eleven months ago,

126
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,800
homicide's about to press charges

127
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,600
and he bolts overseas.

128
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,900
A month ago,

129
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,600
he turns up in a mental hospital

130
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,600
in Bernberg, Germany.

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,500
He admits to everything:
names, dates, dumping patterns.

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
Weren't they holding him,

133
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
saying he was too crazy to be tried?

134
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,100
Yeah, but the legal wrangling is over.

135
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
We say that he gets a
mental competency hearing

136
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,900
and they fly him over to us.

137
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,600
And we're the welcoming party.

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800
His is a joint op.

139
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,000
Us and the federal customs department.

140
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,900
All right, our counterpart is, uh....

141
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,200
delia semple

142
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,000
with the airport attachment.

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Now, airport might be in our city, guys,

144
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,800
but, on the other side of customs,

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
that's international territory.

146
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
It's her jurisdiction, it's her rules.

147
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,800
When did you get back from assignment?

148
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
I mean, your parents have been calling.

149
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
They said that they
haven't heard from you...

150
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,500
Got nothing to say to them.

151
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, Walter, come on, you can't still...

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Oh, so you're passed that too, eh?

153
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,900
Learn how to do that

154
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,700
in one of your little groups?

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Yeah.

156
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,500
You should try one sometime;

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,300
it helps.

158
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah, it didn't help so much last week.

159
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
What happened then? You
forget to forget her?

160
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,000
You know, not all of us get to go off

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,700
and be a war hero.

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
Some of us have to stay right here,

163
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,100
in the same house,

164
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,400
and go by the same school
that she went to everyday!

165
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Some of us don't get to forget, ever!

166
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,700
All right, I'm sorry.

167
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,100
I know I wasn't there
when you needed me.

168
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,000
There's enough "sorrys" to go around.

169
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,900
Walter, it's taken me a lot of years

170
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,800
and a lot of bottles to get here,

171
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,900
but you can do this too,

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and you're not losing her by doing it.

173
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,500
You're moving forward for her.

174
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,300
Every time I close my
eyes, I see her, Wendy.

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I see her lying on that thing

176
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,000
they slid her out on,

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
and I hear myself
saying, "yeah, that's her,

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
that's my daughter."

179
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,800
Every time I close my eyes.

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,300
And that's where you still are,

181
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,200
but I can't be there anymore.

182
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,800
and when you find that
you can't be either,

183
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,000
I want you to phone me.

184
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,800
Any time.

185
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,200
Even after this, okay?

186
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
All right, we're gonna meet at the gate,

187
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,300
the feds are gonna escort
the prisoner to customs.

188
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,400
Then we are gonna take custody,

189
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
escort the prisoner

190
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,600
to the psychiatric evaluation.

191
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,100
Now, nobody knows he's flying in today,

192
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,500
so there's no crowd control.

193
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,300
But if anybody wants this guy?

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,300
They will go through us
to get him, all right?

195
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,500
So, let's keep our eyes open.

196
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,500
Let's gear up, hit the trucks.

197
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,900
I have lived with, sold to,

198
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,100
bought from scumbags,

199
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,500
but protecting them? Come on.

200
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,100
You got words of wisdom for that?

201
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Look, as for me, I get confused,

202
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,800
I just think of my daughters.

203
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,000
And whatever I gotta do, I do.

204
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,200
A few guys just through the
customs doors over there.

205
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,500
So, straight across and
out here to the trucks.

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Like I said, low profile all the way.

207
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,300
Is it true that accused
serial killer Peter Wilkins

208
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
is being taken into custody today?

209
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,800
And what do you have to
say to the victims families?

210
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Ma'am, please, just stand back.

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
Eddie, low profile.

212
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,900
Hey, I followed every protocol you sent,

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
this isn't on us.

214
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,500
Right this way, guys.

215
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
I know how some of you
must be feeling right now,

216
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
and I'm sorry.

217
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,200
But right now we have a job to do,

218
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,900
so, if you just vacate the premises,

219
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
everyone'll be a lot safer.

220
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you very much.

221
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,100
Just a second.

222
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,700
I just don't see the big deal?

223
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,400
Mr. Broder, by the time we
get Mr. Wilkins into custody,

224
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,700
'till the time we get
him to that hospital,

225
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
he's as exposed as he'll ever be.

226
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,000
Just 5 minutes tops.

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
5 minutes is a long time

228
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,500
to be walking through
that crowd of people;

229
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,200
we have no legal ground to restrain

230
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
who'd want to kill this guy.

231
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,500
And that's bad why again?

232
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,400
Look, Mr. Broder, all kidding aside,

233
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,800
my main concern is for my team
and the job they have to do.

234
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,700
Agent Delia Semple,

235
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,500
Federal Customs Department
airport attachment.

236
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,400
Who's Sergeant Parker?

237
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,100
Right here. How are you?

238
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Sergeant Parker, I
understand you have a problem,

239
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,600
which means I have a problem.

240
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,600
No argument there.

241
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Good start. Solutions?

242
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,300
We were just discussing
those with Mr. Broder here.

243
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,000
No matter where I move the crowd to,

244
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
you still gotta go past 'em.

245
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,300
He's not wrong.

246
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,200
Once you're through customs,
there's only one way to go.

247
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,400
But not through that crowd.

248
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,200
We could take the prisoner
directly from the airplane;

249
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
we have a truck on the tarmac.

250
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,500
Out of the question.

251
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Look, we understand:

252
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,700
tarmac's international grounds,

253
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,900
federal jurisdiction.

254
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,400
You need to hand him off
on our turf, we get it.

255
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,600
Boss, why don't we take
him through customs,

256
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
and then double back to a loading area,

257
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,900
and have a truck waiting there?

258
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,300
Our turf, take custody there,

259
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
but we gotta keep the crowd preoccupied,

260
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
or they'll follow the truck.

261
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,600
Well, I can give 'em a
little press conference,

262
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,300
a little distraction,

263
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,500
while you guys are getting
Elvis outta the building.

264
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,800
So, you wanna take the prisoner
along a non-vetted route,

265
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
through an international area

266
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,600
where he's back under my jurisdiction,

267
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,700
lie to the press and evade the public?

268
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,600
Pretty much. Pretty much.

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Let's make it work.

270
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,000
This is Agent Semple.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,700
Superintendent MacLean, please.

272
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,600
Then get him out of
the meeting, how about?

273
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Thank you.

274
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,100
Superintendent, slight change of plan.

275
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,500
Absolutely necessary, I'm afraid.

276
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Not a bad vacation

277
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,900
For the guys who get
to fly over, at least.

278
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, if you like jumping over
the ocean in a metal coffin,

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
sure.

280
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,700
So there's something that you
guys are actually afraid of?

281
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,400
Well. You know what? We
all have our weak spots.

282
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,500
Could be anything:

283
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,100
flying, cats...

284
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,300
it was one cat; it was mean.

285
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,800
I was there, it was mean.

286
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, well, I'm with you.

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Try flying into Khartoum international,

288
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
everything feels like
a cakewalk after that.

289
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Khartoum? Youthful backpacking?

290
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,000
It was year ago,

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,700
went through a rough
time, needed to get away.

292
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Helped train local police there.

293
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,000
It was a good experience.

294
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,400
Semple.

295
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,800
Copy. They're coming off.

296
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,300
Okay, subject's
approaching. Everybody up.

297
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,700
Peter Wilkins?

298
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,700
Peter Wilkins, I hereby
take custody of you

299
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,600
and will transport you through customs,

300
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
after which time

301
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
you will be placed in the custody

302
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,200
of the strategic response unit

303
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,900
and transferred to
Ossington mental hospital.

304
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,200
Let's get this over with.

305
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,500
Hey Sarge, Roscoe's trying to get you...

306
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Not now, Danny, I'm busy.

307
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, he wants you to
go up to departures...

308
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Cover for me. I'll get your back later.

309
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,800
Sorry, bro, cannot,
they want me down here.

310
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,500
Hey, what's up with the crowd, anyway?

311
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,800
Somebody famous coming in or something?

312
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,300
Well. I'm down here,
so I'll deal with it.

313
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,500
Yeah, but they want...

314
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,000
I am exactly where I
need to be right now.

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,100
I'm gonna tell Roscoe.

316
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,200
Tell whoever you want.
You stay outta my way.

317
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,200
Or you're gonna do what, big man?!

318
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,000
All set, Sergeant.

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,300
All right, I'll wait
for your confirmation.

320
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,100
Lewis, accompany the Sarge.

321
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,700
Eddie, it's not necessary,
I'm just making a statement.

322
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,800
We know the new route;
those people out there don't,

323
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
and if one of 'em is planning on

324
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
taking a run at our guy,

325
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,500
that puts you in their way.

326
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,800
Look, hey...

327
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
sorry about that cat thing.

328
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
We'll talk about that later.

329
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Diamond formation.

330
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,400
Can I have your attention please?

331
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,000
Everyone please listen it up.

332
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm telling you,

333
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,100
Volcek is 10 pounds of
crazy in a 5 pound bag, okay?

334
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,100
He grabbed me.

335
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
His eyes, Broder, I'm telling you,

336
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
I get chills thinking
about those eyes, okay?

337
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,700
Danny, are you high?

338
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,200
'Cause I don't have time.

339
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,600
Just to let you know, we'll
be making an announcement

340
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,200
in a few minutes.

341
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,800
I beg your patience.

342
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,600
You see the crap I'm
dealing with right now?

343
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
You think I have time for your crap?

344
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,000
There he is.

345
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,500
Okay, let's find out.

346
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,000
Coming. All clear.

347
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,300
Copy that.

348
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Something's going on with Broder.

349
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,100
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

350
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,400
Oh, Danny, get back to work.

351
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm hit!

352
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,300
Team, status. Status.

353
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,900
We just took fire.

354
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,600
Who's hit?! Check the press!

355
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
Who's hit!

356
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,900
Wordy! Wordy's down.

357
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,300
I'm good, I'm good, it's in the vest.

358
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,300
Where's the shooter?

359
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,800
No eyes! No eyes on the shooter.

360
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,300
Prisoner's unharmed!

361
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,200
The vest! Are you sure?

362
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,500
Deep breath, Wordy. Let's go.

363
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Wordy okay?

364
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,400
Someone help me up. Help me up.

365
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,700
Agent Semple, stop!

366
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,500
Agent Semple is pursuing the shooter!

367
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,700
Sam and I gotta go!

368
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,200
Negative. You stay
with the prisoner, Ed.

369
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,600
She's got no backup!

370
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Sam, go! Get her, bring her back!

371
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
We're gonna take the
prisoner to customs.

372
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,400
Okay, let's do that.

373
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,200
1, 2, 3, let's go! Go, go, go!

374
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,700
Approaching mechanical room. Level 3.

375
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,300
Now... this stops now.

376
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,600
That's up to you.

377
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Suspect is cornered,
need backup immediately.

378
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,900
It's over.

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,400
Agent Semple, take cover behind me.

380
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,000

Go-go-go!

381
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Sam!

382
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
Eddie! Eddie, backup, now.

383
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,000
Copy that. We're on our way.

384
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,600
Negative, negative! Stand down.

385
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,400
Stand down.

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Nice phone. Gps?

387
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,400
Shooter on the loose...

388
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,700
the whole area's unsecure.

389
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,000
We protect the prisoner here
until we apprehend the shooter

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
and get sam back.

391
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
Copy.

392
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,000
Agent Semple, I'm gonna send
my guys to the mechanical room.

393
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
As soon as we get the prisoner...

394
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,700
no point, they're gone.

395
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,400
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, Parker.

396
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
You need to get yourself checked out

397
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,800
after that blast.

398
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,700
I'm getting intel, I'll be there in 5.

399
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Let's get this vest off.

400
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,300
Thanks, I'm fine.

401
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,200
Just gimme one sec, okay?

402
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Sir, we need a room with
one entrance and no windows.

403
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,700
You got something?

404
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,000
What about the holding areas
for suspicious entrants?

405
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,900
Got that?

406
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,700
That's our communication,

407
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,600
we can all hear each other with that.

408
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Listen very carefully.

409
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
We are going to do a
prisoner swap in 20 minutes.

410
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,400
I'll contact you with a location.

411
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,000
Okay, can you tell me if
my officer's all right?

412
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He's fine.

413
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
For now.

414
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,300
Eddie.

415
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,200
All right, no communication
except by phone,

416
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,300
everybody got that?

417
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,800
Copy.

418
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
We need a different
location for holding,

419
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,600
something secure.

420
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,500
Wordy, you still need
medical assistance.

421
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,900
I'm fine. We need to get Sam.

422
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,800
Let's go.

423
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,200
I hear you, I hear you,

424
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,700
but with the rounds you took,

425
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,800
you're not running after anything.

426
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm not...

427
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,300
So, I'm gonna put you on protection.

428
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
We can't move that prisoner

429
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,000
until we've neutralized the shooter

430
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,000
and secured the area.
We need you, Wordy.

431
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,600
We just need you where we can use you.

432
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,700
Whatever I have to do.

433
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,700
Partner with Wordy?

434
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,800
Yeah, yeah.

435
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,200
Spike, Lewis, you're with me.

436
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,600
Room by room, if we have to;

437
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,000
let's see some floor plans.

438
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,200
Hi.

439
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey. Walter Volcek.

440
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,500
Joined custodial a month ago.

441
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,800
Father of Julie Volcek,
14th victim of Peter Wilkins.

442
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,100
My superiors have been informed.

443
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,700
We're checking every security camera...

444
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,600
Okay, thank you,

445
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
we'll take care of it from here.

446
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
We put the word out to
all our agents on site.

447
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Our number one priority
is getting your man back.

448
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,900
Agent... Parker.

449
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,000
He is where he is because
of what I let happen.

450
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,500
No. No, you didn't let anything happen,

451
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,800
this guy's a pro.

452
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I'm gonna guess he's military.

453
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,500
How's that?

454
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,200
He's a great shot

455
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,500
and he grabbed one of my guys,

456
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,100
and that's a hard thing to do.

457
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,700
Now, what I'm worried about,

458
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,000
is his lack of care for
getting caught or killed.

459
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
That tells me he's desperate,
which means he's dangerous.

460
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,700
Well, don't think you can afford

461
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,500
to turn down any help, can you?

462
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,300
Okay, well...

463
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,100
we can use some help interviewing staff

464
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,700
and protesters and...

465
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,400
the ever so vigilant
security chief, Broder.

466
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,500
Let's go.

467
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,200
Over here.

468
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,700
Sit down where I can see you.

469
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,700
Right here.

470
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,100
Don't move.

471
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,800
You okay?

472
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,300
Shut it!

473
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,800
Is it bad?

474
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,400
No, it's, uh...

475
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,100
a rib or...

476
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,300
maybe three.

477
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
Wordy,

478
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,900
in what universe is it
fair that you protect that

479
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,100
and you take a bullet for it?

480
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,300
If you got an answer,
I'd love to hear it.

481
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,700
My wife Shelly's gonna ask me that

482
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,400
in about 3 hours.

483
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
So, you think of your daughters now.

484
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,900
What do you want to do to him?

485
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,000
I guess, uh...

486
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,000
I think, when I go home tonight,

487
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,900
and I hold my baby girl,

488
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
it's gotta be with clean hands.

489
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,700
Okay, sit. Sit.

490
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,900
Right here, sit down.

491
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,300
I've never seen it so empty before.

492
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,500
That's procedure.

493
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,700
We cleared the whole area for you.

494
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,000
How are the ribs?

495
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,800
My hearing's a little shot.

496
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
It's just a concussive grenade.

497
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,500
With your, uh, your body armour,

498
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,900
there shouldn't be any real damage.

499
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,800
Appreciate the planning that
must have gone into that.

500
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,700
You obviously don't wanna
hurt anyone, except...

501
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,000
Well, the plan's changed.

502
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,000
Can't afford to be so
considerate anymore.

503
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,900
Infantry?

504
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,900
Air force?

505
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,300
Come on, not navy, please.

506
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
You?

507
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,600
Special forces.

508
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,700
That figures.

509
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
Jumps on a grenade.

510
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Tell all the ladies
what a superhero you are?

511
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,900
Yeah, infantry spend all your
time bitching about special forces.

512
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,500
And no flags come up

513
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,500
when his name matches
one of Wilkins's victims?

514
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,600
How's that supposed to come up

515
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,300
in a, a clearance check?

516
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,500
Oh, I dunno, took semple's
guys 30 seconds on Google

517
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
yeah.

518
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,600
Yeah, so, I'm the bad guy.

519
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,300
Meanwhile, these poor people,

520
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,100
you won't even let them
get a look at the scumbag,

521
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,600
who's off to get what,

522
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,300
10 years of ping pong?

523
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,600
They don't deserve
that justice at least?

524
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,500
Who's the bad guy again, huh?

525
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,100
Member of the victim's group

526
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
said they got an anonymous
call this morning.

527
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
Come to the airport today.

528
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,500
Figure Volcek made the call? Maybe.

529
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,900
But then how'd he find
out about the flight

530
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,400
in the first place?

531
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
How'd he get his gun
through employee security?

532
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,300
And who knew about the alternate route?

533
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,400
Us, you guys,

534
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
and Mr. Security there.

535
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Let me have a talk with our Mr. Broder.

536
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,600
So...

537
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
prisoner exchange... really?

538
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
Saw it work in the Sudan.

539
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,200
You in safari?

540
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,300
Yeah, I was part of Unmis.

541
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,500
The Sudanese army, they
had a... bunch of rebels;

542
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
they turned them over to us,

543
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,900
rebels handed over
some of their soldiers,

544
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,700
it all seemed pretty straight forward.

545
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,900
This isn't Africa.

546
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,500
you got that right.

547
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,100
If this was Africa,

548
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,800
nobody'd have a problem
with what I have to do.

549
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,800
You lose somebody you love,

550
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,700
I'm not saying I don't get you...

551
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,000
get me?

552
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Buddy, don't even try
to pretend, all right?

553
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,300
What I'm saying is, from
an operational standpoint,

554
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,500
I'm not seeing the desired
outcome being very likely,

555
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,300
knowing our rules of engagement.

556
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Sudanese had rules too.

557
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,500
The wives and the
children of your soldiers

558
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,100
are crying at your door every night,

559
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,900
the rules change.

560
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,300
People can do things they...
never would've expected.

561
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,100
I don't understand how
Walter could've done

562
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,400
something like this.

563
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,900
I tried to help him,

564
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,100
we tried to go to groups together,

565
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,300
and he... he just, he couldn't do it.

566
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,500
He just, he couldn't get past it.

567
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,300
Is there anything else you can tell me?

568
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
Anything that might reach him?

569
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,500
It's just you...

570
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,200
you feel so alone.

571
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
You feel like you're the...

572
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,300
you're the only person
that's going through this

573
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,900
and if he knew...

574
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
if he knew that he wasn't alone.

575
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,300
Thank you, Wendy,
we'll let him know that.

576
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,500
Ed, just spoke with
Volcek's wife. You copy?

577
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,300
Copy that, boss. What'd she say?

578
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,500
He's a good guy.

579
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,900
He was a loyal soldier.

580
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,600
They had the one daughter, Julie.

581
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,700
She was 15 when Wilkins killed her.

582
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,100
There's some complicating
factors though.

583
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,200
Volcek was on assignment
when it happened.

584
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,900
Julie was with her grandparents,

585
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,400
his folks.

586
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
They let her stay out past curfew

587
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,400
and she never came home.

588
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,100
Walter hasn't spoken to them since then.

589
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,600
Their marriage... well, you know,

590
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,600
you know, the stats on that one...

591
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,200
parents of murder victim.

592
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,000
I mean, it's all pretty understandable.

593
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,300
Textbook loser, eh?

594
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,800
I am not saying that, Walter.

595
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,100
Why not?

596
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,400
I've lived with it long enough.

597
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,600
Almost done though.

598
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,900
You know what I want;

599
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,100
give it to me, you can have me.

600
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,600
Shoot me. I don't care anymore.

601
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,100
Yeah, but I care.

602
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,200
I care about my guy,

603
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,500
and I do care about what
you're going through,

604
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,800
but I especially care about ending this

605
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,200
without anymore pain.

606
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,100
So, please, can you help me do that?

607
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,100
Sure.

608
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,300
Come and meet me.

609
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
Gate 525.

610
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,600
I'll have your guy, you have mine.

611
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,900
Okay, but that's gonna
take some time, Walter.

612
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,100
5 minutes.

613
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,200
Let's get this over with.

614
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,400
Okay, Spike and Lewis?

615
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,200
securing level 2,

616
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm gonna meet 'em at gate 526.

617
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,300
Okay, you're sierra one.

618
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
Copy that.

619
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,500
Broder gave himself up.

620
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,100
Says he called in the tip to the group.

621
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,700
Thinks he's being a righteous citizen.

622
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,500
He swears up and down

623
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,700
he had nothing to do with Walter.

624
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Just a bad coincidence. Yeah, hmm.

625
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
We're keeping on him.

626
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,300
Nice bit of talk there.

627
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,500
Sounds like you had himin
the end. Yeah, well...

628
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,200
We'll see how much

629
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
when we show up with no Wilkins.

630
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,400
I've got eyes on both of 'em,

631
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
we're sticking to hand signals for now.

632
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,000
Copy. If he shows up,
I'll be there in 5.

633
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,400
Until then, if he makes
any kind of move on Sam...

634
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,900
copy that, boss.

635
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,700
okay. okay.

636
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Boss, he's here.

637
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,700
'Kay, on my way.

638
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,400
You've got scorpio, if you need it.

639
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,800
Gonna bring my hand up very slowly,

640
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,300
'cause I'm sure you got a sniper on me

641
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
and want him... I want him to see this.

642
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,100
What the hell is that?

643
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,000
Boss, we got a big problem.

644
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
What, you can't take the shot?

645
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,100
No, I can take the shot,

646
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,600
but if I do I kill Sam.

647
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,300
He's holding a grenade,

648
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
the pin's been pulled.

649
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,000
If I take him out, he'll take out Sam

650
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
and anybody within 20 feet.

651
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,200
I don't see Wilkins in 5 minutes,

652
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,800
I let go. That's it.

653
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,400
Unless somebody's got a better idea.

654
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,300
"Unless somebody's a better idea."

655
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
Is he talking to us?

656
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,300
Ed, we need Spike to scan for
any nearby radio receivers,

657
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,800
I think Volcek might be
trying to reach out to someone.

658
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
I can't.

659
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,500
Spike's covering him and Sam,

660
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,800
if Wordy and Donna can switch
with Lewis and Spike...?

661
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,200
No, they've got Wilkins.

662
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm gonna call for a backup team.

663
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,900
To get here in 5 minutes?

664
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,600
Sergeant, let me help. Delia.

665
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
The least I can do is
help you do your job.

666
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
You get your officers off Wilkins,

667
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,800
I'll cover him.

668
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,500
No, no, he's our responsibility,

669
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,100
Once you handed him off officially.

670
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,300
Look, we both know who's wearing this

671
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,200
when it's over, and
I'm ready to face that.

672
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,100
So, let me cover for you.

673
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,500
You go, I watch him, off the books.

674
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,100
Come back, it never happened.

675
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,100
Let me do this for you.

676
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
And me.

677
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
Thank you.

678
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,700
Ed, Semple's gonna help.

679
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,200
Get your guy. Bring him back safe.

680
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,600
She'll send Wordy and Donna your way.

681
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,500
Copy that.

682
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Hey, Walter.

683
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,900
Greg Parker.

684
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,800
So, we gotta figure this one out, huh?

685
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I was under the impression

686
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,100
all the figuring had been done, Greg.

687
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,200
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to be honest with you,

688
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,500
I'm not gonna be able to
give you what you want.

689
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,500
Spike, I need you to scan

690
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,600
for any kind of radio
frequencies. Boss's got a hunch.

691
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,000
What about Sam? This guy's escalating.

692
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
Let me try for a
hand-to-hand takedown.

693
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,000
It's too risky.

694
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,100
He drops it, I'll lose you both. No way.

695
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,200
No sniper, no distraction,
no hand-to-hand,

696
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,900
what do we have left?

697
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,000
I'll get the slug.

698
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,500
It's a longshot, I know,
but it's all we got.

699
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,600
So, you wanna tell me what
this is all about then?

700
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
I just, uh...

701
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,000
just need some time here.

702
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,500
Okay, you want time. You
wanna explain that to me?

703
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,000
Can't explain it to you,
Greg, 'cause you don't know.

704
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,600
Nobody knows. People
who say they do know,

705
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,800
they're the worst.

706
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,500
You know, all these people,
they say they want to help you,

707
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
they just don't leave
you alone, you know?

708
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,100
But you gotta be alone
to understand why.

709
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Right?

710
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,100
I've got the slug.

711
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Spike, we're on our way.

712
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,000
You gotta be really careful, okay?

713
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,300
It'll do the job, it'll
paralyze on contact,

714
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,900
but, Ed, the range is short

715
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,600
and that thing doesn't shoot straight.

716
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,300
You don't him dead on, it could be...

717
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,500
it could be bad for sam.

718
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,200
Spike, we got no choice.

719
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,800
Why should he live...

720
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,900
when every day, what...

721
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,900
what he did... kills all of us?

722
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,800
It kills all of us,
Greg, a little bit more,

723
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,600
and a little bit more
and a little bit more,

724
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,000
until there's nothing left.

725
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,100
There is something left, Walter.

726
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,700
What?!

727
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,500
What's left, Greg?

728
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,800
What's always been there,

729
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,700
family. Your family.

730
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,500
It still needs you, no matter what.

731
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Family...

732
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,000
let me tell you a little
bit about my family, Greg.

733
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,700
I have a...

734
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,700
an ex-wife...

735
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:30,800
who drank herself into a
coma every night for 4 years!

736
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,000
And she pities me!

737
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,300
I have a mother and a father
that I can't even look at

738
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
without thinking about throwing up,

739
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,300
and I have a cd where
a daughter used to be;

740
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,800
there's no family left, Greg!

741
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,200
See, that's what you realize.

742
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,800
I mean, there's no reason why,
there's just people in pain,

743
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,700
spinning around a black hole.

744
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,500
Hoping that somebody, anybody...

745
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,500
Go now!

746
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,500
Go, go, go!

747
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,500
Stay down! Stay down!

748
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,100
Don't move! Don't move! Stay down!

749
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,400
No! Noooooo!

750
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,600
No!

751
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,300
Get him up.

752
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
We know who's working with you, Walter.

753
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,800
Come on.

754
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,600
It was Broder, right?

755
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Yeah.

756
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,700
He put the call into the,

757
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,600
into the victim's
group for a distraction?

758
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,900
The alternate route, he tipped you off?

759
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,700
What's this "better idea"
you're talking about?

760
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,300
What's he supposed to do?

761
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,000
Come on, buddy, he's already in custody.

762
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Whatever it is, it's not gonna happen.

763
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,100
And the more co-operative you are,

764
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,400
the better it'll be for you.

765
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,200
This isn't the Sudan, Walter.

766
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,800
We can't change the rules.

767
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,600
We gotta job to do, no matter what.

768
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,200
What about the Sudan?

769
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,000
He was stationed there last year.

770
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,800
Why?

771
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,000
Wordy, Donna, get back to the prisoner,

772
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,100
right away.

773
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,400
What's up, boss?

774
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,100
Stupid.

775
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,900
Superintendent McLean's office?

776
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,500
Yeah, did Agent Semple call today,

777
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,000
about a change in the escort route

778
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,500
for, uh, Peter Wilkins?

779
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,600
Thank you.

780
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay, Ed, uh... they didn't get a call,

781
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,500
they didn't get a call,
she wasn't talking to them.

782
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,800
So, what's that got to do with Broder?

783
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Yeah, and I think Broder
was telling the truth.

784
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,600
He didn't have anything to do with this.

785
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
It was Walter and Delia.

786
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,500
Run.

787
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,300
I need to make it look
like you tried to escape.

788
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,200
I said run, you son of a bitch.

789
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,000
Run!!

790
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,700
Clear.

791
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
There not here, boss.

792
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,800
Listen to me, Walter.

793
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,200
I know you think you're
trying to protect her,

794
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,200
but you're not.

795
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,800
If Agent Semple hurts that man,
she's done, she's destroyed.

796
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,500
Have you not been listening, Greg?

797
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,100
She's already done.

798
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Run!

799
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,800
Wilkins got her sister the
same time he got my Julie.

800
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
She could've lost it like most of us,

801
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
but she was... she was strong.

802
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,700
She didn't even tell her superiors.

803
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,800
Her sister had a married name,
so she just kept it to herself.

804
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,100
She tell you this in
Khartoum? The Sudan?

805
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,900
Yeah.

806
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,900
It's like it happened for a reason.

807
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,800
I mean, what are the
chances, both of us there,

808
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,800
both of us trying to get
away from the same thing.

809
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
But you can't...

810
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,600
you can't get away. You can't get away.

811
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,900
It's like you can...

812
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,200
it's like you can smell
it on each other, you know?

813
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,600
It... stinks.

814
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,700
Like, uh... like gasoline.

815
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,500
That kind of pain.

816
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,400
What's she gonna do, Walter?

817
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,800
All I had to do was shoot him.

818
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,400
Now that's all she has to do.

819
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,700
Boss, we're looking at the CCTV now.

820
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,900
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

821
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,600
If she used her ID card,
there's a record of it.

822
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,800
Right here, I got her.

823
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,900
Third basement, right below us.

824
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,500
The two of you get down
there, I'm on my way.

825
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,300
Copy. Right around the corner.

826
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,900
No, please.

827
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
Close your eyes and this'll be over.

828
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,400
Please.

829
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,500
Close your eyes!

830
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,500
Please...

831
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,300
Agent Semple!

832
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,700
I just want him to close his eyes.

833
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,300
You need to put the gun down.

834
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,500
I just need him to close his eyes.

835
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
I said, close your eyes!

836
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Oh, please.

837
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,300
Donna, on target.

838
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
If you don't put the gun down,

839
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,300
we'll be forced to shoot you,

840
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,500
do you understand?

841
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,000
Delia.

842
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,400
Delia, what're you doing?

843
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,400
This isn't right, this isn't justice,

844
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,900
this is vengeance, you know that.

845
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,200
You don't know what I know!

846
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Okay.

847
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,000
But can I tell you what I do know?

848
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,500
You've had Wilkins all
alone for nearly 20 minutes.

849
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,900
You could've killed him
by now, but you didn't.

850
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Because you're a cop,
you're not a killer.

851
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,500
I was a good cop.

852
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,500
I was a good sister.

853
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,100
And you still can be.

854
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,100
No, he took that away.

855
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,700
Now I'm just this!

856
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,800
Delia, no!

857
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,700
Stay down! Stay down! Stay down!

858
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,000
After which point,

859
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,900
Mr. Wilkins was returned to our custody

860
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,800
and the body of Agent Delia Semple

861
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,300
was transported to Metro General,

862
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,100
awaiting an autopsy.

863
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,100
Donna, you have anything to add?

864
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
How did SIU go?

865
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I shot a cop; they're really happy.

866
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Donna, we have a saying here:

867
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,000
"just 'cause you did right,

868
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,400
doesn't mean you get to feel right."

869
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,800
Our hands are clean, yeah?

870
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Okay.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
