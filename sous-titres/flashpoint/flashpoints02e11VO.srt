1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,290
don't tell me what to do.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,170
Want to take out your phone?

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,360
Take a little video?

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,860
You could show all of your friends.Wouldn't that just be hilarious?

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,470
No,I don't,billy.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,630
Billy...

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,610
third door,north end,west side.

8
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,170
You know my name?

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,230
See,that's funny to me.

10
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,360
-Copy that. -What do you usually call me?

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,630
Tell me.

12
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,930
Sam,jules.

13
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,360
What do you call me?

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,940
He's upstairs.We're headed up.

15
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,670
What do you call me?

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,730
****

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,590
Can I see?

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,100
yeah,sure.

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,840
It's amazing.

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,660
Kind of looks like a map or something.

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,930
It kind of is,I guess.

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,120
Like,you know when you see those guys on tv with those big screens behind them,

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,770
and they have,like,that map with a big snowflake on it?

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,990
See,what I think it would be really cool is if we saw the people-- l

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,650
ike,drawings of,like,little people,of course,but...

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,530
and they're,like,walking around being like,"where are my gloves?

27
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,700
" Or like,"where's my scarf?

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,740
" Or like,"where's my jacket?

29
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,330
" well,what's your map about?

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,620
I don't know.

31
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,080
My life,or something.

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,510
It sounds really stupid when I say it out loud though.

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,000
Is that you?

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,710
Seriously,billy,it's really good.

35
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,390
That's the thing about art class,you know.

36
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,040
Like,when I'm there,I just...I feel happy.

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,960
It's the only time I really feel like that.

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,810
I'll see you later,okay?

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,930
Hey,what's going on?

40
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,380
-Nothing. -Nothing?

41
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,740
Sorry about the detour.

42
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,380
Sleeping beauty there couldn't get up in time to take the bus this morning.

43
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,860
No worries.

44
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,340
Teenagers and mornings-- not a good fit.

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,860
Well,teenagers and anything-- not a good fit.

46
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,100
how's school going,clark?

47
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,830
Clark?

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,750
What?

49
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,460
Ed: Mr.Parker's talking to you.

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,460
Clark: I'm listening to music.

51
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,690
Ed: Can't you just tell him how school's going.

52
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,680
Parker: It's okay.

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,130
School's fine.

54
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,100
That's good.

55
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,440
-See ya,mr.Parker.
-Good to see you,clark.

56
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,650
"Thanks for the ride,dad.

57
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,660
" that takes some patience,huh?

58
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,660
Yeah,you have no idea.

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,220
Yeah.

60
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,700
Yeah,I'm lucky I guess.

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,160
Yo,k-way.

62
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,570
-Girl: Hey,billy.
-Oh,come on,buddy,don't be rude.

63
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,700
Scott,leave him alone.

64
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,810
Where you headed?

65
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,680
Uh,the corner store.

66
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,950
Nutritious lunch?Cookies and chips?

67
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,690
-stop it.
-Scott: Stop what?

68
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,480
You're looking after k-way here?Your little artist buddy?

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
Come on.I was going to give him some lunch money.

70
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,780
-God,scott!
-What's your problem?

71
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,150
-I don't have a problem. -Hey,let her go.

72
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,630
-Excuse me?
-I said let her go.

73
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,930
I heard what you said.

74
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,090
-Then let her go.
-Guys,come on.

75
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,330
Or else?

76
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,130
-There's no "or else.
-" Really?

77
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,850
Boy: Scott...

78
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,380
'cause I kind of believe in "or else.

79
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,850
-Girl: Scott!
-Don't talk to me or else.

80
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,420
Or like,uh,stay out of my business or else.

81
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,420
-Boy: Get him!
-Nice one.

82
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,970
I didn't think gay boys could fight.

83
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,790
I'm not gay!

84
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,420
Why are you hitting yourself,huh?

85
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,740
-Why are you hitting yourself?
-Girl: Scott!

86
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,620
Oh,ouch.It's got to hurt.

87
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,930
-Tony?
-It's priceless.

88
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,370
Come on,smile,gay boy.

89
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,580
-Girl: Tony,stop it!
-Smile.

90
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,930
Just say it.We all know the truth-- you're a little piece of garbage.

91
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,780
-That's why you're eating 
-girl: Scott!

92
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,170
Little piece of garbage.

93
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,530
You're doing great,k-way.

94
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,570
You're doing great.

95
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,600
-Stop it!
-Scott: He'll say it,he's gay.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,320
-I'm not gay!
-Say it!

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,100
: I'M...I'm gay.

98
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,300
And "I'm a piece of garbage.

99
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,440
" And I-I'm a piece of garbage.

100
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,650
What a loser.

101
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,290
Scott!

102
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,610
give me that.

103
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,930

trace?

111
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,860
Oh,it's you.

112
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,680
shouldn't you be at school?

113
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,830
get me a beer.

114
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,190
What the hell are you doing?Get me a beer.

115
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,930
decent?

116
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,960
Yeah.

117
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,960
So?

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,390
So?

119
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,080
First day back.You nervous?

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,020
Nah.

121
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,310
So I heard,uh,I heard you took some time off.

122
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,270
Beaches and margaritas?

123
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,490
Yeah,a little r & R.

124
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,160
But I also went back to the base.

125
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,140
Really?

126
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,640
Wow,I thought,uh,I thought you and your dad...

127
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,400
when the general summons,you don't say no.

128
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,520
what was that about?

129
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,220
Well,he pulled some strings and he wants me back in the military where I can really make a difference.

130
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,470
Nice.

131
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,800
What did you say?

132
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,350
I said I can make a difference here.

133
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,830
Good for you.

134
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,740
He thought he heard me wrong,'cause it didn't sound like "yes,sir.

135
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,930
" Anyways,dealing with my dad,that was...

136
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,970
that was the easy part.

137
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,510
What was the hard part?

138
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,580
When my mom asked when she gets to meet you.

139
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,360
Each fall the weather changes...

140
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,000
obviously.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,570
Cool winds are being pushed south,but the atlantic ocean is still warm from the summer.

142
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,140
This makes for...can I help you?

143
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,150
If you're not in this class,you'll have to wait till the bell rings.

144
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,310
will you please leave my classroom...

145
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,010
don't touch me,okay?

146
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,400
I have no intention of touching you.

147
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,340
But you,sir,are disrupting my class.

148
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,220
Hey,buddy...

149
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,200
don't touch me.I'm just trying to find somebody,okay?

150
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,190
-What's your problem? -I don't have a problem!

151
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,550
You're not even in this class,you loser.So get out of here.

152
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,570
Don't call me that!

153
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,390
teacher: Get down!Get down!

159
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,040
-You got that right. -That's right.

160
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,740

Lock down,intelligence.

178
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,670
We've got one gunman,looks like a student.

179
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,870
Two injuries.That's all we know for now.

180
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,360
No further shots fired-- that's a good thin?

181
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,340
Right ed: Depends.

182
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,100
-I'm principal chivali.
-Hello,ma'am.

183
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,840
I got the alert from room 312.

184
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,010
We used a teacher's intercom-- predetermined code word.

185
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,310
-Which is? -"Code red.

186
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,580
-Sounds a little obvious,I know.
-What happens with a code red?

187
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,730
It means we follow the drill.But the teachers know it's the real deal because it hasn't been prearranged.

188
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,250
Lock the doors.Make sure any glass is covered.Close the blinds.

189
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,690
Get the desks in a barricade in the corner.Students behind the desks.

190
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,350
As far as most of the students know,this is still just a drill.

191
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,570
We do them every few months.

192
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,800
But all these kids have cell phones.

193
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,590
They're going to be calling and texting each other.

194
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,260
Who knows what they're saying,what they know.

195
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,160
That's why we're going to do this quickly,keep it calm.

196
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,030
-You heard from tony? -No,I can't get through.

197
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,210
Clear them out.

198
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,250
Out of the way,guys.Out of the way.Back it up.

199
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,480
Police.Let them in.

200
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,130
Spike: Sru on the scene,1:37 P.M.Two shots fired at approximately 1:21 P.M.

201
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,740
Ma'am.

202
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,070
Ma'am,where did the first responders go?

203
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,160
The,uh,first officers on the scene.

204
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,890
I don't know.They just went in.

205
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,540
We got one on each door,two heading up to the third floor.

206
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,960
Okay,eddie.

207
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,020
Sru only.We got to control this,okay?

208
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,110
Ma'am,you got any further idea who we're dealing with here?

209
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,000
I mean,with all the cell phones,somebody must have seen something.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,870
Yeah,male,caucasian,15 to 17,hoodie,medium height.

211
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,240
Definitely a wellesley student.Possibly a sophomore,but that wasn't confirmed.

212
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,100
Okay,so,uh,white kid in a hoodie.

213
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,590
Yeah,no,I know.It sounds like half the kids in my school.

214
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,980
This is sergeant greg parker with the sru.

215
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,580
-All first responders within the school.
-Everybody in.

216
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,190
Subject is caucasian,15 to 17,medium height,wearing a hoodie.

217
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,740
Do not engage.

218
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,080
Come back to the principal's office,which is considered command post,asap.

219
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,360
-Officer: Price,we got to move.
-Come on,everybody in.Golet's

220
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,610
.Price,come on.They want us at command post.

221
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,390
Price: Okay,lock that door.

222
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,390
15 minutes,no further shots fired.

223
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,310
Parker: Good.

224
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,040
Okay,let's lock down the exterior.Uniform on every door.

225
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,620
All the kids that are already outside,let's contain them in the parking lot.

226
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,270
Sam and jules are bravo team.Let's get a lay of the land.

227
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,100
Lou,you're with cops and first responders.

228
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,420
Spike,you're with me.

229
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,170
Let's monitor all cell phone chatter.

230
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,830
Let's stay on the intercom.Let's keep the classrooms calm.

231
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,330
No one in or out unless they're being escorted by the police.

232
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,400
Copy.

233
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,440
All right,eddie.

234
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,620
Injured first-- let's get them safe and any information we can on the subject,anything at all.

235
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,010
All right.Let's go.

236
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,390
just go to class.

237
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,820
Answer your stupid phone; I don't care.

238
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,190
It's geography.It's mrs.Hilton.

239
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,710
She's,like,a hundred years old; she won't even notice.

240
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,340
If you have something to say.

241
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,850
I don't want to do this anymore.

242
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,460
One month,that's what it's been.

243
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,950
One month going out with you,and I don't even feel like myself anymore.

244
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,180
Okay.

245
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,950
You beat the crap out of my friend.

246
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,000
No,I was sending him a message,all right?

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,130
That guy was trying to get between us.

248
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,100
-He was helping me!
-You don't need help from a guy like that.

249
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,260
Guy like what?

250
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,150
-That guy is...
-what?

251
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,690
Weird?A big loser?

252
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,090
Yeah,well,so was I.

253
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,770
Until a month ago,when you decided that I was worth the time of day.

254
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,970
God,at least,at least he's interesting.

255
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,190
-He's smart.
-Okay,yeah,see,there you go.

256
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,840
Thank you very much.

257
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,030
He's smart and I'm what?

258
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,800
Just some jarhead football player?

259
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,260
So sorry I don't do arts and crafts.

260
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,810
Let's just go.

261
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,230
Mrs.Hilton,it's the police.

262
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,600
My name's ed lane.I'm with the strategic response unit.

263
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,140
We need you to open the door.

264
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,380
Ma'am,please open the door.We understand you've got some kids in trouble in there.

265
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,130
We're here to get them out.

266
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,530
Thanks,ma'am.

267
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,340
They're over here.

268
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,870
Marcus paley and rachel heintzman.She's not moving.

269
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,340
Marcus,you okay?

270
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,080
Wordy: How's rachel doing?

271
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,840
Um,she passed out about five minutes ago.

272
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,700
Look,I-I'm fine,I swear.

273
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,010
Please,just get her out of here.

274
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,410
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

275
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,900
You okay if we come back for you?

276
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,350
Okay,we need you to stay calm,stay warm,conserve your energy.

277
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,340
Keep this tight.Watch your hands.

278
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,910
It's my fault.

279
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,370
I called him "loser," and he went nuts.

280
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,140
I don't even know who he is.

281
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,490
-It's okay. -So sorry.

283
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,350
It's okay,marcus.It's not your fault.

284
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,550
Guys,guys,we know this is a dangerous situation.

285
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,650
And we're gonna be back for you just as soon as we can,okay?

286
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,760
but right now,the safest place for you to be is right here with the lights out and doors locked.

287
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,150
You're doing everything right.

288
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,540
You're doing everything right.

289
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,100
You have any idea who this kid was?

290
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,050
Jen thinks he mightbe in tenth grade,but we just couldn't see.

291
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,390
Okay,anybody-anybody have A...

292
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,120
have a yearbook?

293
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,330
-Here. -Good.

294
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,680
All right,while we're gone,I want you guys to look through that book,

295
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,670
see if you can identify this kid,okay?

296
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,760
We're gonna be right back for you.

297
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Meantime,we're gonna get rachel to a hospital.You guys are doing great.

298
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,630
Wordy.

299
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,920
We got to get her out to the paramedics.They can't come in under lockdown.

300
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,960
Mrs.Hilton.

301
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,800
Keep this door locked,okay?

302
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,950
Keep the door locked.

303
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,440
Guys,the news is spreading.Kids are texting each other.

304
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
The phones are jamming with 911 calls.

305
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,520
-Shooter hasn't been active in...
-18 minutes.

306
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,240
Good.Spike,stay on the chatter.

307
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,200
Hey,there's a kid up there with a gun.We got to get up there as soon as possible.

308
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,640
Every second counts.

309
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,430
Parker: Which is why we're slowing down movement until we get further intelligence.

310
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,270
See,right now,the subject is inactive.

311
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,430
And by "the subject," you mean the gunman.

312
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,850
Zero fatalities,two injuries.Sounds like they were unplanned.

313
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,670
Which affects our subject profile,which affects our response.

314
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,620
Okay,and what about the injured?

315
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,380
We're on it!Sir.

316
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,710
Boss,I'm not liking this cafeteria.

317
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,190
It's too open.

318
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,140
Sitting ducks.

319
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,710
Parker: Yeah,agreed.Let's evacuate the lunchroom.

320
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,900
And,uh,any stray kids you find in the hallway,get them into classrooms,

321
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,540
safe and out of the way.

322
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,700
spike,we need to know who this kid is and what he wants.

323
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,100
I'm on it,boss.

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,580
Parker: Alpha team?

325
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,830
-Ed: Almost back.
-Copy.

326
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,810
Boss,we're headed to the lchroom.

327
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,670
Police!Don't move!

328
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,730
-I said don't move!
-Jules.Show me your hands.

329
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,450
Step outside.Stand up and turn around.

330
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,150
Put your hands on the counter.

331
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,820
Okay,pal.You're gonna be okay.

332
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,390
We're gonna take you to a place where someone's gonna ask you a few questions.

333
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,460
what are you doing?There's a guy in the school,and he's got a gun!

334
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,590
-Let us in!
-They can't!

335
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,550
Remember the drills?The doors stay locked.

336
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,510
-Once they're locked...
-lunchroom.We go to the cafeteria.

337
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,860
No,we'd have to cross the school.

338
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,290
Make a run for the front doors.

339
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,020
we're getting reports of a possible gunshot near the gym.

340
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,900
We're getting a ton of cell phone chatter.

341
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,460
This is no longer a drill.The kids inside know what's happening.

342
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,400
Okay,boss,wee at the west door.

343
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,060
How's she doing?

344
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,830
Not good.Let's go.

345
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,830
Teacher confirmed an id of the subject from the yearbook,eddie.

346
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,380
Billy dresden,16 years old,tenth grade.

347
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,130
We're trying to reach his parents now.

348
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,800
Any idea what he wants?

349
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,250
-Spike?
-Nothing firm beyond the id.

350
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,510
"Huge loser,loner,total freak.

351
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,940
"Eats alone,never talks to anyone,always wears the same clothes.

352
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,970
" I found a picture.

353
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,550
Let's start at the gym.If he's gone active...

354
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,850
you go in hard.

355
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,110
Parker: Bravo team,what's your 20?

356
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,960
Cafeteria's clear.

357
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,310
-Maybe not.
-Okay,go careful.

358
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,310
We think the subject's on the first floor.

359
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,790
All right,guys.We've got you.We're going to move slow and calm.

360
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,150
You're going to follow us.

361
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,440
Boss,we've got about six in here.We can't contain it.

362
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,880
We're going to take them out.

363
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,930
-Copy.
-Lou,we got six kids coming out the west door.

364
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,360
Everyone's out.Cafeteria's clear.

365
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,010
Alpha team's headed to the gym.Bravo team stays east.Copy that.

366
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,680
You guys are back in.

367
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,100
Ella,where the hell are you going?

368
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,750
I don't know where else to go.

369
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,600
Okay,we just have to hide until it's over.

370
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,290
Okay.

371
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,970
Behind here.

372
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,620
Billy.

373
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,190
Well,this kid hasn't killed anyone yet.

374
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,630
He's had ample opportunity.

375
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,690
Nothing on the internet.No creepy photos.

376
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,760
No "look at me and my gun" stuff.

377
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,710
Classic domestic scenario.Regent park,projects,poverty...

378
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,000
mom's unemployed,dad's got a criminal record.

379
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,100
Drugs,couple of destic assaults on the mother.

380
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,970
Probably where he got the gun.

381
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,370
Yeah,well,a kid like this,no money,horrible home life,stuck in a fancy-pants high school?

382
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,090
It's a perfect storm.

383
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,650
It's still no excuse.

384
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,590
-This is gina maxton.
-Gina,hi.

385
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,090
-This is greg parker.
-Hi,gina.

386
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,990
I understand you know billy dresden.

387
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,070
From art class.

388
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,510
So,what happened?

389
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:34,650
Some guys near the field,football guys mostly,they were shoving him around.

390
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,400
They were...putting garbage in his face and stuff.

391
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,660
Do you know who was doing it?

392
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,010
It's okay.

393
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,120
Gina.This is really important.

394
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,100
Tony sent this to everyone.

395
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,770
-Billy: Please!
-Scott: He's gay.He'll sayt.

396
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,690
-No.
-Scott: Say it!

397
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,460
I'm gay.

398
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,320
Scott: And you're a little piece of garbage.

399
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,420
Billy: And I-I'M...

400
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,420
I'm a piece of garbage.

401
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,050
-Tony who?
-Tony price.

402
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,330
Gina: But it was scott mink,mostly.

403
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,820
Alex rosati.

404
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,970
Okay.

405
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,200
Thank you,gina,for coming forward.

406
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,090
All right.Let's get the locations for all three subjects.

407
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,100
If this is target-specific...

408
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,750
could be good news.

409
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,040
Eddie,this may be target-specific.

410
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,550
Stand by for locations.

411
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,500
-Good news how-?
-It means he might be looking for specific individuals.

412
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,310
Better if it's not random.It's easier to contain.

413
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,190
I'm pulling up the schedules on all three names.

414
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,010
Buddy,you got to leave this scene.

415
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,740
You're in big trouble if they find out tony's your son.

416
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,180
Get out of here.

417
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,560
Now.

418
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,750
Got 'em!

419
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,210
Okay,eddie.You ready?

420
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,570
Gym's clear.We're ready.

421
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,800
Tony!

422
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,330
I-I-I just need to talk to you,okay?

423
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,980
I know you're in there!

424
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,010
please.We were just getting a projector,but they locked the door.

425
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,950
Tony,come out,okay?

426
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,570
Come out.

427
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,240
please.

428
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,320
-Please don't hurt me.
-don't tell me what to do.

429
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,510
You've been doing that for two years now.

430
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,240
All of you.

431
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,640
But you don't get to do that anymore.

432
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,960
Tony,where the hell are you?

433
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,260
I...look,it's dad.I don't t re whayou did.

434
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,490
Just please answer the phone.

435
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,590
Uhjusti'm going up to the command post.

436
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,320
Want to take out your phone?

437
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,200
Take a little video?Some photos?

438
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,360
You can show all of your friends.Wouldn't that just be hilarious?

439
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,340
No,I don't,billy.

440
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,010
Billy?

441
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,500
You know my name?

442
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,900
See,that's funny to me.

443
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,940
Because what do you usually call me?Tell me.

444
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,800
What do you call me?What do you call me?

445
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,480
It's not me that calls you that,billy.

446
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,960
Please.

447
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,620
-Please.
-Don't move!

448
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,770
Keep your hands up and go down the hallway.

449
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,390
Go.

450
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,330
And give me your phone.

451
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,740
-Sam,jules.
-Outside the cafeteria.

452
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,790
First floor looks clean.

453
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,980
See you on two.

454
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,010
busy.

455
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,310
How can 911 be busy?

456
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,510
Scott.No one knows we are here,okay?

457
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,910
-It's fine.
-I know,I know.It's just...

458
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,870
who would do this?

459
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,250
Yeah,I know.Who would be so vicious?

460
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,070
I'll keep trying.

461
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,170
Guys,we're on the second floor.

462
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,720
Right there.Right there.

463
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,070
He took tony down the hall.

464
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,070
-Which way did he go?
-That way.

465
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,280
-I'm afraid he's going to hurt him 
-calm down.Calm down.

466
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,940
We need you to stay right here.We're going to send somebody back for you.Right there.

467
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,840
Spike,student on second floor needs retrieval.We are in pursuit of subject.

468
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,720
say it,tony.

469
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,870
Say it.

470
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,110
: I'm sorry.

471
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,930
I don't believe you.

472
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,790
I am.I'm sorry.

473
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,000
Smile,tony.

474
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,450
I'm so sorry.

475
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,980
You're on camera.

476
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,140
Please.Don't hurt me.

477
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,800
: Team one,the situation has just escalated.

478
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,600
We have an active shooter.It's a new deal.

479
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,080
Spike: Alpha team,respond.Are you in the vicinity of the gunfire?

480
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,540
Where are you guys?

481
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,780
North stairwell.

482
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,170
One shot fired.

483
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,960
Subject may be above us.

484
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,900
Kids are saying he may have a hostage,tony price,one of the targets.

485
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,570
If you need to,you take him down.

486
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,840
Boss,we're heading upstairs.We're on the move.

487
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,950
Boss?911's patched in a relevant caller.

488
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,770
Ella brandt,tenth grade.Claims she knows the subject.

489
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,990
: Ella?

490
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,920
Ella,hi,this is sergeant parker.I'm with the police.Where are you?

491
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,900
Um,we're hiding.

492
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,650
We're okay.I just...

493
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,280
it's billy,isn't it?

494
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,390
How do you know billy,ella?

495
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,720
He's my friend.

496
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,490
I mean,he probably won't be after today.

497
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,580
Parker: Because of what's happening?

498
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,900
No.Because of what happened to him.

499
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,720
tony : I'm sorry.

500
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,770
-Billy : I don't believe you.
-Tony: I am!

501
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,490
: I'm sorry.

502
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,770
I'm so sorry.Please.

503
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,990
-Are you scared?
-Please!

504
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,350
Are you sad right now?Because that'S...

505
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,350
okay,ella.You just tell me where you are.We'll come get you.We can talk about this in person.

506
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,440
He is a good person.

507
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,600
He wouldn't hurt anyone.

508
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,460
At least,he wouldn't have.

509
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,410
I just...I just wish...

510
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,810
I should have done something.I could have changed this.

511
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,880
No.This isn't your fault,honey.

512
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,870
When he was getting the crap kicked out of him,I didn't have to just stand there like some idiot

513
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,590
while the biggest jerk in school was going after him.

514
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,140
He was standing up for me.

515
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,250
He was defending me.

516
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,300
Tony!

517
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,540
Tony?

518
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,630
Tony?

519
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,440
Ella,you said "we" before.

520
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,080
Who are you with?How many people?

521
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,780
I'm going to make sure that one of my team gets to you as soon as we can.

522
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,470
Just tell me where you are.

523
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,450
: Oh,my god.

524
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,710
What's happening?

525
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,430
-He's here.
-Parker: Who?

526
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,120
Ella: Billy.

527
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,490
El,where are you?

528
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,620

531
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,430
Guys,we got a 20 on our subject.Fourth floor,room 409.

532
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,530
Art department.On the south side.

533
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,180
Alerting first responders.

534
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,510
We got a 20 on billy dresden.No interference,okay?

535
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,470
Keep it tight.We're going to close off the fourth floor.

536
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,700
I'm going to go talk to him.

537
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,510
What?

538
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,310
Ella,no.You stay right where you are.

539
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,240
You stay right where you are.

540
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,370
He is my friend.

541
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,290
I need you to believe me.

542
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,940
He's a good person.

543
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,190
Ella.

544
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,460
: Can you hear me?

545
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,930
Ella.

546
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,920
: Stay here.

547
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,300
-Billy?
-Ella?

548
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,750
What-what are you doing?

549
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,830
Ella: I don't know.

550
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,540
What are you doing?

551
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,210
I just...

552
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,650
I just wanted to see what I'd done.

553
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,660
You know,it's funny,sometimes you think something's gonna work out.

554
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,010
Even if it's not beautiful,you at least think that it's gonna work.

555
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,290
And then...

556
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,350
a few hours later,you come back and you see that it...

557
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,160
it's nothing.

558
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,450
It just doesn't work.

559
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,040
Ella: I think I know what you mean.

560
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,240
Billy: You do?

561
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,750
Ella: Sure.

562
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,500
I feel like that all the time.

563
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,720
Okay,guys,she's talking to him; he seems responsive.

564
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,240
Alpha team,what's your 20?

565
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,680
We're outside 409.

566
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,640
Window's covered-- we don't have eyes.

567
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,220
We can be in there in a split second.

568
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,630
Copy.Waiting on bravo.

569
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,730
Bravo team,what's your 20?

570
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,110
We're on our way.

571
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,330
How many doors in the room?

572
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,320
Two-- main door and a rear door.

573
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,790
Sam and jules,head for the rear.

574
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,020
Third door,north end,west side.

575
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,600
Copy that.

576
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,660
So,what's bugging you?

577
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,930
What's bugging me?

578
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,540
About the painting.

579
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,620
You came up here to see the painting,right?

580
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,720
It doesn't go anywhere,it's just...

581
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,140
there's no point to it,there's no place for it to go.

582
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,170
It's just...

583
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,910
I-it's just scared.

584
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,270
But you're not scared of me.

585
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,240
I just wanted somebody to care!

586
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,650
Some-somebody to apologize.

587
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,270
It's so stupid,and...

588
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,780
I just made it so much worse.

589
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,550
I sent...

590
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,140
a video out to all of tony's friends.

591
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,590
I don't even know what I'm doing!

592
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,000
Billy...

593
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,890
everyone is scared.

594
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,570
You know what happened after lunch hour?

595
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,690
What?

596
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,810
I told scott that I...

597
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,400
couldn't go out with him anymore.

598
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,020
I think you scare him.

599
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:19,330
I think you freak him out because you're smart and you're interesting.

600
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,110
And because I like you.

601
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:28,280
He feels stupid,and he acts like a jerk,but it's not your fault.

602
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,790
It's his.

603
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,400
Billy...

604
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:38,290
it is not your fault.

605
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,450
This whole day,it shouldn't have happened.

606
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,530
I wish I could take it back,I really do.

607
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,860
Yeah.Me,too.

608
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,590
I-I'm sorry.

609
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,270
No,it's okay.

610
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,360
Hey.

611
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,440
I'm right here with you.

612
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,790
Hey,you and me,together.

613
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,090
Parker: Okay,he's showing remorse.He's de-escalating.

614
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,970
We got to let them play it out.

615
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:20,820
Okay,why don't we just go talk to them.

616
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,650
Okay?

617
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,330
But you got to put that down.

618
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,020
Just put it down on the table,and then we'll go and talk to them together.

619
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,370
Yeah?

620
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,040
-Okay.
-Boss.

621
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,830
Sam,jules.

622
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,940
Almost there.

623
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,510
Are you good?

624
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,930
Okay,'cause I'm right here.

625
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:52,120
Every step I am right here.

626
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,380
Promise?

627
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,970
I promise.

628
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,640
Just put it down.

629
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,060
Put it down on the table,and then we'll go.

630
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,910
Okay?

631
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,430
It's gonna be okay.

632
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,340
She's walking him out.

633
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,740
We're getting him out.

634
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,560
who's there?Who's there?

635
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,840
Scott?What?You lied to me!

636
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,860
-No,no,she didn't!
-Okay,we've got a third party in there.

637
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,010
Go in!Now!

638
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,790
Billy.Billy,don't worry about him.

639
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,950
That's not who you need to be worrying about right now.

640
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,150
Where's tony?

641
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,740
I-I don't know.

642
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,420
Look at me we heard gunfire,billy.

643
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,110
Ella: Billy...

644
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,640
please.Please.

645
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,620
I just wanted you to be okay.

646
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,530
I just wanted us both to be ay.

647
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,670

648
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,810
Put the gun down!Now!

649
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,930
Do it now!Put the gun down!

650
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,610
Get down!Get down now!

651
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,780
I repeat: Subject's contained,he has been shot.

652
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,520
Guys,let's get this kid out of here.He's still breathing.Jules?

653
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,300
Ella,it's okay,sweetheart.

654
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,570
It's okay,you're safe.Juith les.That's it.

655
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,290
Ella?

656
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,450
Ella?

657
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,550
Ella: Get away from me!

658
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,030
Down on your knees,hands behind your back.

659
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,070
Why?What did i do?

660
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,460
Just do it,please,sir.

661
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,300
My son tony was one of the targets.

662
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,440
He killed my boy.

663
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,640
Come on,let's go.

664
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,830
Yeah,put him on.

665
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,110
Somebody wants to talk to you.

666
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,490
-Dad?
-Tony?

667
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,340
I'm okay.

668
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,270
: Tony,you're okay...

669
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,860
he just wanted me to say I'm sorry.

670
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,580
Tony...

671
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,030
price: Oh,my god.Oh,my god.

672
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:05,930
I've got a son; he's in high school,too.So I get it,all right?

673
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,630
I...I get it.

674
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:15,790

675
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,120

00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,380
Me,too.

678
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,460

679
00:37:54,340 --> 00:38:02,120

00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,510

682
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:24,600
* I figured all my worst fears believe in childlike heroes *

683
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,460

687
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,590

You did great.

691
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,880
You did everything right.

692
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:14,460
* Your blood,your fire your kiss good night*.

693
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,750
billy's on his way to st Mike'S.

694
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,640
He's gonna make it.

695
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,460
Because you were there to help him.

696
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,950
'Cause you were there.

697
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,580
I think that's your mom.I think she's waiting for you.

698
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,330
You want to turn around and tell me if that's your mom?

699
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,980
Is that your mom?

700
