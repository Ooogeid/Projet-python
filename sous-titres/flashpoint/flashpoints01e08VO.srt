1
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,310
You lie just like everybody else!

2
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,010
A gun never solved anything. Believe me.

3
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,730
Spike, he's escalating. Where are you?

4
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,550
- 15 seconds away.
- That's not good enough!

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,980
Just put the gun down.

6
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,610
Bravo Team, are you set?

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,740
I'll let you know when we're there.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,100
You get over next to him
and put your hands up.

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,900
Now. I need you now. I need you now.

10
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:48,160
- It's over. It's over.
- No.

11
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,635
Your time is up.

12
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:57,989
- Good luck with your lawyer today.
- Thanks.

13
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:01,529
<i>3 hours earlier</i>

14
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:16,051
<i>WATCH YOUR CHILDREN THIS CONVICTED
FELON IS LIVING IN OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD</i>

15
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:38,403
Hey,just one hole.

16
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,160
How many shot ?

17
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,462
20.

18
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:46,123
It's nice that's why
you still my number one.

19
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:48,490
That's why I'm always number one.

20
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:52,112
Ed we're being suit wrong for death.

21
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:58,751
First York Plazza.

22
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,330
What you've got ?

23
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:10,532
Male youth breached the perimeter,
Ed the boy !

24
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:19,782
Wrong for death.

25
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:24,621
We're being suit or I'm being suit ?

26
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,852
Technically... you.

27
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:34,352
So, your file has finally arrived

28
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,103
This is it

29
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:38,373
That's it prosecution's case against you.

30
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:44,661
Ok. Ok. alright.

31
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:49,853
Michael before you get too excited, I got
to tell you I've been trough at all,
I'm afraid you gonna be disapointed.

32
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:52,020
It's nothing in there than you
don't already know.

33
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:54,632
It's nothing in there about
my so called confession.

34
00:02:54,645 --> 00:03:00,873
Just what the informer say on the stand.
It's nothing about how the prosecution tracked
him down, how they got them to talk,
no papertrail.

35
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,421
How can that be ? where is he ?

36
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:06,760
I mean it is n't the prosecution supposed to have all the evidence ?

37
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:13,042
You know, I've talked to them to Cheznick Office.They haven't even admitted the papers may have been lost or misfiled.

38
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:21,572
Those pages they proove my innocence, they are us frame.

39
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:26,172
How could we appeal without all the files ?

40
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:31,700
We're still appealling right ?

41
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,920
We can still make a case.

42
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,852
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:45,213
The force are behind you 100 %.
I'm behind you yet. Franck  McAndrew
is gonna talk in trough it.

44
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:47,372
You brought my lawyer back.

45
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:52,302
- He wants you down at the courthouse this morning deposition
- This morning.

46
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:57,820
We need to be seen taking this seriously.
We stole they go to the press,
this things get legs.

47
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:02,070
Just told you know they go down at the courthouse, they don't have a case.

48
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:03,932
Are you kidding me ?

49
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:10,790
A guy in a building shots a woman dead,
holds an another woman hostage,
turns his gun on you.

50
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:13,251
I'll do what I'm hire to train to do. Come on !

51
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:16,123
I know that's the truth of what happen,
nobody doubt that.

52
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:20,052
Somebody does. Somebody does.
That's... you know !

53
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:25,012
Yeah, guy's son, everybody grieves
your own way. You know that.

54
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:27,613
They look for someone to blame.

55
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,450
Well, look no further.

56
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:34,593
But you promised me; you
said you'd represent me.

57
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,190
We're understaffed, under-funded.

58
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:39,503
I got more cases than I can handle,
with files that are complete.

59
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:42,412
People that are still in jail, Michael.

60
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:45,183
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry? You're sorr...

61
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:50,522
I spent 11 years in there,
wondering what happened.

62
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:54,963
How somebody could get on the stand and say
that I said things that I didn't even know.

63
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:56,260
Ian, man, if we don't appeal, I...

64
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,743
Michael... Come on.

65
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:02,263
You're young, you're
26, you got early parole.

66
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:03,863
You got your whole life, you're free.

67
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:06,493
No, I'm not free, Ian! Okay?

68
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,420
As long as they
think I killed Katie--

69
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:12,753
her family, my family, everyone
I ever met, everyone I ever knew--

70
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:15,722
I'll never be free.

71
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:19,583
I can't help you.

72
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:22,751
So who's gonna be there?

73
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:26,170
that lawyer, her tape
recorder, a bailiff.

74
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:27,810
I hear there's gonna be
a couple of dancing girls.

75
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,280
You know, we went through
this all before, you know?

76
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,473
We went through it all
for the inquest, right?

77
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:34,301
Stick to the facts, you
got nothing to worry about.

78
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:40,840
What? Just... what?
Ed, give me one hour.

79
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:45,542
You tell the story, and I work my magic,
and then unfounded lawsuit disappears,

80
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:49,163
you're back in your cape and
tights. You're saving the world.

81
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:53,353
You're still reading comic books,
huh? That's nice. Let's do this.

82
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:01,162
Prosecutor's Office-- how
may I direct your call?

83
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:04,052
Hi, uh, my name is Stan Smith.

84
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:07,431
I'm an associate of Dan Cheznik's,
from the Bar Association.

85
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:10,790
I was hoping to make an appointment
with him. I lost his cell phone number.

86
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:13,602
Mr. Cheznik isn't here;
he's in court all day.

87
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:15,651
Can I get his secretary to call you?

88
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:18,683
No. Thank you. That won't be necessary.

89
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:10,012
Sir, just empty your
pockets, please? Thank you.

90
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:15,230
Step to the side, please.

91
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,740
- I just need to go in for a minute...
- Step to the side.

92
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:19,783
Raise your arms.

93
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,981
- The prosecutor--
- Arms up!

94
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:27,123
- He wanted to meet with me.
- Feet apart, please.

95
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:30,522
Look, if you could
just have him paged...

96
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:33,470
Raise your pant leg, sir.

97
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:37,062
That's a parole device.

98
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:41,201
Entering the courthouse without an attorney
is a direct violation of parole... Officer!

99
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:44,483
Back off! Put your hands up! Don't move!

100
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:50,232
I said don't move!

101
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,321
Hostile! Main floor, right corridor.

102
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:57,342
Hostile! Main floor, right corridor!

106
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,662
I had the subject in the crosshairs
when my sergeant called Scorpio.

107
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:40,322
I put my finger on the trigger.

108
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:43,411
So, from that point on, it was your call
whether to shoot or not, is that correct?

109
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:45,992
That's correct. It was my call.

110
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:49,353
We've got a man with a
gun. We'render lockdown.

111
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:52,901
What's going on?

112
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:55,100
I'm not finished. Sir?

113
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,342
Just a sec. What's going on?

114
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:59,000
They're evacuating.

115
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,872
I gotta ask you to sit tight till all prisoners
have been returned to the holding cells

116
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:03,460
and we can safely clear the building.

117
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:04,093
He hasn't finished.

118
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:06,031
Yeah, uh, maybe we should
just finish this up, Ed.

119
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,660
I'm sure it's nothing. Is this nothing?

120
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:11,191
He would tell us if it
was something. Yeah? Ed?

121
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:15,471
Strategic Response
Unit. Unlock the door.

122
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,172
Come on!

123
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:22,142
Boss, it's me.

124
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:24,520
- You at the courthouse?
- Yeah.

125
00:09:24,538 --> 00:09:25,933
We've got an active shooter there.

126
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:26,961
I figured something was up.

127
00:09:26,978 --> 00:09:29,720
He charged a security barrier, he fired a gun.

128
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:30,553
What's his 20?

129
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:31,943
- Grab Ed's gear.
- Copy that.

130
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:33,853
He ran down the corridor.
He could be anywhere--

131
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:37,603
courtroom, judge's
chambers, holding cells.

132
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:41,010
Guy's mid-20s. Black.
Weapon's a handgun.

133
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:44,980
and he was wearing a parole device.

134
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:48,420
An ex-con. Fantastic.

135
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:03,251
All right, go up to the north
exits, okay? I'm sending up Chris.

136
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:05,813
SRU. My team is on their
way. How many shots fired?

137
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,282
One, so far.

138
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:08,943
One's enough. He say
what he was looking for?

139
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,811
Said he needed to see
one of the prosecutors.

140
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:12,090
My guy didn't get his name.

141
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:14,151
Probably looking for a
courtroom. How many are there?

142
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,802
Nine. Three on each
floor. Kid went that way.

143
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:19,510
- You got uniforms on the exits?
- Yep.

144
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,465
Okay, we're going to have
to set up a command post.

145
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:36,529
Tell your guys to stand down.

146
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:38,559
I need building plans, I need video.

147
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:41,040
Okay. Room 240 is free.
We'll send everything up.

148
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,513
Security video's all
wireless. Up the stairs.

149
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:46,842
Got ya. Left, right?

150
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:50,681
Uh, second floor, take a
left. Oh, you'll need these.

151
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:04,311
last night. But I don't
know if he meant it.

152
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:07,072
He was kind of drunk. It was weird.

153
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,603
Drop the phone.

154
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,111
Put your hands up.

155
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,851
Now put them up.

156
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:30,271
Looking for a man named Dan
Cheznik. Do you know where he is?

157
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:32,953
I don't know.

158
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:34,170
I'm sorry, I don't know.

159
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:35,781
Look, you work here, don't you?

160
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:38,943
Yes, but not with him.

161
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:54,272
Everything okay, folks?

162
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:55,230
He's got a gun.

163
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,100
Turn around, get out of
here now or I will kill her.

164
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,220
I swear I will.

165
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:04,041
I said get out of here.

166
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:08,253
Okay, you know what, I'm
just working security.

167
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:11,520
So I'm just going to go
ahead and set this down.

168
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:14,133
Take the clip out.

169
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:16,680
Put it right here, okay?

170
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,793
Just, uh... tell me what you want.

171
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,120
I want to talk to Dan Cheznik.

172
00:12:22,137 --> 00:12:24,533
The lawyer, right?

173
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:27,781
Okay, well, you know... you know
what, I got a cell phone in my pocket.

174
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:30,771
I've got the keys to the building.

175
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:33,623
Let me just... let me just
call my boss here, and...

176
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:36,530
we'll see if we can
find him for you, okay?

177
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:38,462
Okay.

178
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:43,010
But you do anything stupid, and I
will shoot her, right here, right now.

179
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:44,781
I promise you I will.

180
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:47,890
I hear you. I hear you.

181
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:53,512
I'm just going to reach in my pocket
here, get my phone, call my boss, okay?

182
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,242
That's all.

183
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,842
It's okay.

184
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:10,973
- Parker here.
- Boss, hey, it's me.

185
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:15,083
Yeah, I'm in a stairwell off
the thirfloor with a young man...

186
00:13:15,096 --> 00:13:15,710
What's your name?

187
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:18,562
Forget my name. Ask about Cheznik.

188
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,853
Young man? What are you saying, Ed?

189
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,700
Are you telling me you're
with the subject now?

190
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:22,453
Yeah.

191
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,141
Okay, hang tight. We're
right outside the building.

192
00:13:25,157 --> 00:13:28,973
We're looking for a... for a
prosecutor named Dan Cheznik.

193
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:30,472
You got your gun, Ed?

194
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:34,550
No, no, no.
it's C-H-E...

195
00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:36,913
Are you telling me that
he's got you at gunpoint?

196
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,172
That's right, yeah.

197
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,753
We just need a location for
the young man and the lady here.

198
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,482
- Okay, he's got a hostage?
- Correct.

199
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:46,082
Do you want the team on immediate
action plan? Just give me yes.

200
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:49,293
No... no. He's a prosecutor.

201
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,650
Okay, just stay on the line with me, Ed.

202
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,550
Tell him you'll call him back.

203
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,671
Boss, I'm going to
have to call you back.

204
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:59,961
Okay.

205
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:06,622
Stairwell off the third floor.
The guy's got two hostages.

206
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,072
One's a young woman.

207
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:11,201
- How do we know?
- 'Cause Ed's the second hostage.

208
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,963
Guys, he doesn't have his gun with him.

209
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,833
Oh, no.

210
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:23,933
Okay, Ed's asking for a
deliberate action plan.

211
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,813
A 20 on a lawyer named Dan Cheznik.

212
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:30,383
Wordy, first priority-- let's
find Dan Cheznik. He's the target.

213
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:33,190
- On it.
- Jules, you're on the subject.

214
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,812
Pull all profiles on guys
wearing parole bracelets.

215
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:38,393
- Okay, let's find out who this guy is.
- Got it.

216
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,832
- Spike, you and Lewis...
- Kira, we got a guy here on parole wearing a bracelet.

217
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,830
Mid-20s, black. We need an I.D.

218
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:46,342
Jules, can you send a snap
from the security footage video?

219
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:51,001
Okay, he's charming, he's good-looking.

220
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:55,520
Ed's going to be fine.
Let's go. Hold up. Hold up.

221
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:57,001
Hey, buddy. You okay?

222
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,740
Boss, any luck for my friend here?

223
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:01,472
No, we're still working on that.
Can you stay on the line with me?

224
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:04,543
They're working on it. It's just going
to take a sec. I'm just going to stay...

225
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:06,623
stay on the line here
and get some information.

226
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,061
No, no, hang up.

227
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:11,790
Tell them to call you back
when they know where he is.

228
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:14,660
Boss, I'm going to need
you to call me back.

229
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:18,021
Copy that. Just stay cool, okay?

230
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:21,723
Slow him down. Put
him on our time, okay?

231
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,041
Copy that.

232
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:29,811
Where can I find Cheznik?

233
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,213
Cheznik... He's prosecuting
the Frasano case.

234
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:35,261
That's Courtroom Seven, third floor.
Room's already been locked down.

235
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:38,141
What's the best way up there without
getting near my guy in the stairwell?

236
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,220
Rob will take you up. Rob.

237
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:44,470
Okay, you can tell your guys to fall back.
We'll take care of it from here. Thanks.

238
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:48,442
Clear out a courtroom. We
contain him inside there.

239
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:51,553
You know what, let's stick with
Courtroom Seven. Two birds with one stone.

240
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:54,300
Gotcha. We get the prosecutor out of there
while we prep it for tactical options.

241
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:57,172
That's good. Plus we
tell the kid one less lie.

242
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:59,913
You know the layout here? Any windows?

243
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:02,661
There's a bunch of windows looking out on
King's Court, but you'll never see through them.

244
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:04,160
That's all right, we'll take care of it.

245
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:06,702
We'll get the subject contained, we'll
settle him down. Wordy, you're team leader.

246
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:10,450
Let's come up with tactical options, and
just let me know when the room's clear, okay?

247
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,582
All right, let's go.

248
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,770
He's going to call back, right?

249
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:23,611
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He'll call back.

250
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,353
So, uh...

251
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,363
this prosecutor must have...

252
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:34,181
must have really done
something bad to you, huh?

253
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:40,511
To get you to pick up a gun and
come back in here and risk your life.

254
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:47,332
What were you convicted of?

255
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,081
Murder, okay?

256
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:52,241
He convicted me of murder.

257
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:58,492
Guys, we can't stall him much longer.

258
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:05,011
Answer it!

259
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:10,843
- Yeah.
- Okay, Courtroom Seven. For real.

260
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:13,901
We're clearing it out now,
so stall him. Take it slow.

261
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:16,282
We're looking at the
building plans right now.

262
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:19,921
He doesn't have a location on the
prosecutor yet, all right? But he's trying.

263
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:23,423
Plan A, less lethal.
Working on a surprise entry.

264
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:24,210
What's he saying?

265
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:27,050
He's working on it, he's working
on it. Just give him a second.

266
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:29,623
Plan B, lethal from across the court.

267
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:31,330
The frosted windows looking west.

268
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:34,222
We're going to need to
use thermal. You copy that?

269
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:35,581
Yeah.

270
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,112
Okay, we've already got
video. We'll lay in the audio.

271
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,902
Look for an earwig on
the prosecutor's table.

272
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,421
- What is he saying?
- Okay, okay...

273
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,462
What is he saying?

274
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:46,143
It's Courtroom Seven. Courtroom Seven.

275
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,282
Which floor? Show me. Let's go.

276
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:51,052
All right, she's scared, all
right? You're making it worse.

277
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:53,000
Walk now!

278
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:54,702
Just put the gun down.

279
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:58,531
Put the gun down and you
can take me instead, okay?

280
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:03,030
Take me instead.

281
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,230
- Cuff him.
- It's fine.

282
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:07,982
- Now!
- It's fine.

283
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:09,811
Cuff him. I'll take the two of you.

284
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:13,482
It's fine. Come on.

285
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:18,922
If he's not in that
room when I get there...

286
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:30,711
It's okay. It's okay.

287
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:34,320
Move.

288
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:35,711
Your attention please.

289
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:38,641
I'm Officer Wordsworth,
Police Strategic Response Unit.

290
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:40,422
- Which one of you is Dan Cheznik?
- That'd be me.

291
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:43,193
All right, come with me. The rest of
you on your feet. Leave your things.

292
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,002
We need you to clear
this room immediately.

293
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:52,822
Okay, so Dan Cheznik's one of the
top senior prosecutors in the country.

294
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:55,232
15 years at the bar. Hundreds of cases.

295
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:56,903
Near perfect conviction record.

296
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:58,572
They're on the move.

297
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:01,633
Oh, my God, they got Ed handcuffed.

298
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:03,680
What the hell are you doing there?

299
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,033
Guys, we need you to move fast.

300
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:07,541
We'll answer all your questions outside.

301
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:10,603
All right, they're
almost at the courtroom.

302
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:13,331
Still a half dozen people in there.

303
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:15,190
Lewis, how's audio?

304
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:17,821
Done. Earwig's on the table.

305
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:22,441
Okay, subject is in the
corridor, seconds away.

306
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,493
Spike, let's go.

307
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:29,422
Wait... Hey, no. Up.

308
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:34,560
They're at the door.

309
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:36,423
- Up. You can't be here.
- I'm scared...

310
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:39,050
- Five seconds.
- Go.

311
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:41,321
You don't get it, do
you? I have nothing left.

312
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:44,060
I'm not afraid to use this. I will kill
you both, leave you both lying here.

313
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,293
I do not care anymore.

314
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:48,023
Okay, come here. That's it.

315
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,510
Come on, buddy, just buy us a minute
here. Buy us a minute here, huh?

316
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:55,133
Come on, stop screwing around. Go!

317
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:57,062
I got it.

318
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:15,850
You lied. You said he'd be here.

319
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,841
And they told me he would
be. I thought he would be.

320
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:21,593
You lied! You lied just
like everybody else!

321
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:27,370
This wasn't supposed
to happen, oh, my gosh!

322
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:31,871
He came into the courthouse with a gun looking
for you, and you have no idea who he is?

323
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,151
That could be anyone.

324
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,583
You remember every bad
guy you've arrested?

325
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,311
Any idea why he'd go after you?

326
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:40,570
Sure. Same reason I live in a
bunker, drive home in an armored car.

327
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:43,213
I'm a prosecutor who does his job well.

328
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:48,442
Look-- just so you know, that's my teammate
staring down the long end of this guy's gun.

329
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:52,012
So, I'd appreciate it if you
think real hard about this.

330
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:54,192
Let's start over.

331
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:58,323
Any hate mail recently,
any threatening phone calls?

332
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:02,682
Okay, thanks, it's downloaded.

333
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,580
Boss, we have an ID.

334
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:09,422
Subject is Michael Jameson, 26 years old,
released from Kingston Penitentiary 12 weeks ago.

335
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,223
What'd he do?

336
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:14,220
1997, raped and murdered
one Katie Bakerton.

337
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:26,391
You-- you're gonna get your cell
phone, you're gonna call the police,

338
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:29,880
and you're gonna tell them that they
have 15 minutes to deliver Cheznik to me,

339
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:33,073
or one of you dies! Do it!

340
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:49,352
We've got a 15-minute deadline.

341
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:51,371
Spike, Lewis, where are we in Plan A?

342
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:53,390
Looking for a point of
entry to the balcony.

343
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:55,611
Might be a rooftop. Where
there's a will, there's a way.

344
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,422
Copy that, if that's the only way in.

345
00:21:57,448 --> 00:21:59,221
Sam, Wordy, where's Plan B?

346
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,432
Cheznik's on his way down.
We're heading into position.

347
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:03,660
- We'll let you know when we're there.
- Copy that.

348
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:07,391
Got an ID on the girl
he kills. Katie Bakerton.

349
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:18,441
They, uh... said they were
looking for him... all right?

350
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,620
They said they're going
to call any minute.

351
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:26,582
Move towards him. I'm
a cop. Move towards him.

352
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:30,130
Distract him for a
second. Just for a second.

353
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,412
What are you doing?

354
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:34,273
- I don't know.
- Stop talking. Don't move!

355
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:38,850
All right, why don't you
just tell me you name.

356
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,813
May-maybe I can help you.

357
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:43,603
All right, what is it,
a payback? Is it revenge?

358
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:45,382
I don't want revenge.

359
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,133
Ed, if you hear me, look up.

360
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:50,291
All right, buddy. Okay.

361
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:53,521
Just keep him contained close to
the balcony, we'll drop from there.

362
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:56,620
You stole a gun, you
come in here, and...

363
00:22:57,498 --> 00:22:59,102
you're telling me you
don't want revenge?

364
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:01,142
I want my name back.

365
00:23:01,157 --> 00:23:04,980
And I want to know how they got a
confession out of me when I never confessed.

366
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:09,971
Two years, I've been waiting for the file
to show up: the government's case against me.

367
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,053
Well, today it did.

368
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:14,353
And now my lawyer's telling
me that the file isn't there.

369
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,500
Now, I need to talk to
the man that put me away,

370
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:19,811
and I want him to look me in the
eye and tell me what happened.

371
00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:21,853
Just got... just keep him talking.

372
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:24,243
And try to find a point of connection.

373
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:26,661
I've got Dan Cheznik here.

374
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:29,160
Bring him in.

375
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,100
I hear you.

376
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:36,032
And you know what, you and
me, we're not that different.

377
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:38,581
Something happened a
couple of months ago.

378
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:42,071
I did something, and I...

379
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:45,160
I keep having to defend it.

380
00:23:45,178 --> 00:23:47,183
Defend what I did.

381
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,533
Name's Michael Jameson; you convicted
him of the murder of Katie Bakerton.

382
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,232
Katie Bakerton? When
was that? Ten years ago?

383
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:57,242
Eleven.

384
00:23:57,308 --> 00:23:58,773
It was a brutal murder.

385
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:00,913
Okay, all right, got it, thanks.

386
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:02,833
Here's the criminal index report.

387
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:04,910
Ten minutes to deadline, Jules.

388
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:07,653
Find out who his lawyer
is. Get him on the phone.

389
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:09,360
His lawyer?

390
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:11,462
Alpha Team, what's your 20?

391
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:13,823
Broaching blue, Alpha One.

392
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,733
- Top of the world.
- Copy that.

393
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,822
Ed, Spike and Lewis are
on their way. Stand by.

394
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:21,433
Bravo Team, where are you?

395
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:24,162
Ma'am, we need the room.
Please come with me.

396
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,421
Almost same position.

397
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:29,613
How's Ed?

398
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:32,433
He's hanging in there. He's
trying to get this kid to open up.

399
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:34,813
Maybe...

400
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,153
maybe I look at myself differently, too.

401
00:24:38,168 --> 00:24:39,831
It's like...

402
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:43,610
I know exactly what happened
that day. I remember perfectly.

403
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:50,253
And my brain keeps playing tricks on
me and I start to go over it and over it

404
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:57,102
in my mind and asking myself if maybe...

405
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:01,782
I remember it differently.

406
00:25:02,507 --> 00:25:04,911
If maybe I was wrong.

407
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:07,913
I did that for 11 years.

408
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:14,861
They charged me as an adult, but
I was 15 when they put me away.

409
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:18,950
Never finished high
school, never had a job...

410
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:22,302
never kissed a girl.

411
00:25:22,316 --> 00:25:27,151
And I don't know anything about anything,
but I know what happened that day,

412
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:30,451
and I know I didn't kill Katie.

413
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,651
Okay, boss, we're on the back roof.

414
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,132
We should be at the vent soon.

415
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:36,162
Copy that.

416
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:38,630
Why don't you... why don't
you tell me about her?

417
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:41,803
What was she like?

418
00:25:41,815 --> 00:25:44,552
She's amazing.

419
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,312
Incredible smile.

420
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:55,573
She didn't have to be, but
she's nice to everybody.

421
00:25:55,587 --> 00:26:01,642
Didn't matter what kind of family you
had, house you lived in, she just saw you.

422
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:08,992
So I showed up the first day at school, and
I'm 12, the only black kid in the class...

423
00:26:09,746 --> 00:26:12,581
It's like they'd never seen it before.

424
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:15,823
The kids are whispering
and moving their desks.

425
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:20,363
And I'm feeling like I just want
to fall into a hole and disappear.

426
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:24,673
Well, she comes right over
and she sits beside me,

427
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:29,270
smiles and tells me
we're going to be friends.

428
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:31,242
And just like that, we're friends.

429
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:36,270
She was raped, dumped in the woods,
tied her ankles, tied her wrists,

430
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:40,590
slid her throat, covered
her face with a T-shirt.

431
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:42,340
Couldn't stand to see what he'd done.

432
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:45,710
Just like that, best friends.

433
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:48,053
Three years...

434
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:51,760
Three years we were best friends until.

435
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:54,263
I fell in love with her.

436
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:57,070
All the evidence pointed to Michael.

437
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:59,213
She was killed with a knife; he
had a knife that fit the specs.

438
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:01,333
She was raped before she was killed.

439
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:06,532
Well, we knew from Michael's transcript
he had said he wanted more from Katie.

440
00:27:06,548 --> 00:27:08,520
Did Katie feel the same way?

441
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:11,313
I don't know.

442
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:15,793
The day I told her, we rode to the park,

443
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:19,033
she was sitting on the back of my bike,

444
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:22,430
I was swerving, she was laughing.

445
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:25,682
We were having such a great time.

446
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:29,713
Just being together. Just us.

447
00:27:30,437 --> 00:27:33,240
Man, it was a perfect day.

448
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:38,452
And then I just said it.

449
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,842
I mean, I told her I loved her.

450
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,363
What did she say?

451
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:45,723
She said I was sweet.

452
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:51,142
She leaned against me, kissed me on the
cheek, and she asked me to give her a ride.

453
00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:52,843
Who's the girl on the right?

454
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:55,112
And I said yes.

455
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,643
I doubled her...

456
00:27:56,656 --> 00:28:00,333
doubled her to the
corner near her house.

457
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,002
She wanted me to drop her off.

458
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:06,223
And he was the last
person to see her alive.

459
00:28:08,588 --> 00:28:11,302
And that was the last time you saw her?

460
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:14,823
Yeah.

461
00:28:14,838 --> 00:28:17,013
I remember this.

462
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:20,963
I remember seeing her
picture in the paper.

463
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:26,270
I'm so sorry.

464
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:32,703
11 years in the joint, this
guy still sounds like apple pie.

465
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:38,973
Yeah, well, psychopaths, they spend
years perfecting their stories.

466
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:42,272
Sarge, I just got off the phone with
Michael Jameson's lawyer. He backs it up.

467
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:45,540
He says all the evidence against
this guy was circumstantial,

468
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:50,453
and he confirms that the material
was missing from his file.

469
00:28:57,116 --> 00:28:58,821
Bravo Team in position.

470
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:00,822
Frosted windows, limited joy.

471
00:29:00,848 --> 00:29:03,793
Stand by. We're five minutes away.

472
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:05,921
That one's Ed. You see the cuffs?

473
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:07,820
I've got the suspect.

474
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,370
I could take him right now.

475
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:11,811
We don't fire on a thermal image.

476
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:14,480
We need to see the guy for real.

477
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:18,221
Okay.

478
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:21,741
Boss calls Scorpio? First
shot's mine, on the glass.

479
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:25,470
You're a split second later on the subject,
as soon as you've confirmed it's him.

480
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:26,631
Copy that.

481
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:31,152
So the case against this
guy, what'd you have on him?

482
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:32,491
You name it.

483
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,542
Well, that's what I'm asking.

484
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:37,481
Hey, who's on trial here?

485
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:39,530
I'm not the one waving the gun around.

486
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:43,662
Okay, but my guys are in there facing
a gun because this kid came after you,

487
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:47,743
and I'd kind of like to understand
what it is that's pissing him off.

488
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:50,643
You need me, I'll be outside
calling my attorney...

489
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,832
Sir, you do not leave that hallway.

490
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:55,991
You stay with security.
I may have more questions.

491
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:04,543
Hey, Jules, get Michael's
lawyer back on the phone.

492
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:06,881
Let's find out what this
Cheznik isn't telling us.

493
00:30:06,897 --> 00:30:09,373
I'm on it.

494
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:11,501
Alpha team, what's
going on? Where are you?

495
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,361
We're two minutes away from deadline.

496
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:16,042
It's gonna be tight.

497
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:21,543
So you sat up there and
you told your story and,

498
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,640
what, you thought the
jury would believe you?

499
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,461
That's a good boy, Eddie.

500
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:28,513
Just keep walking him back till
he's right underneath the balcony.

501
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:30,272
They did.

502
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,020
Until Cheznik puts
some guy on the stand,

503
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:36,452
some guy that'd been in a holding
cell with me for five minutes.

504
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:40,673
And he gets up there and he tells
the jury that I confessed to him.

505
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:42,790
That I told him that I killed her.

506
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:47,832
Is there anything in Michael's file that shows wrongdoing
on the part of the prosecution, anything at all?

507
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,480
No. Anything that might've
incriminated Cheznik is gone.

508
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:52,633
What about other cases
this guys prosecuted?

509
00:30:52,646 --> 00:30:55,203
I'll need some time.

510
00:30:56,265 --> 00:30:59,603
So this guy says that
you confessed to him.

511
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:01,543
What did you say?

512
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:03,733
Nothing. Not a word, not even a hello.

513
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:04,902
And that's what you told the jury?

514
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:08,730
Yeah, but this guy, he knew
stuff about how she died.

515
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:12,320
Things that only the killer would
know. Things that I didn't even know.

516
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:15,502
Talk to me, Lewis.

517
00:31:15,517 --> 00:31:17,110
Almost there.

518
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:20,873
Ed, one minute till the shooter's
deadline and Alpha needs more time.

519
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:23,332
You need to buy us more time.

520
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:25,222
So that's why you wanted the file.

521
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:26,962
But none of it was there. Okay?

522
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,662
Cheznik made sure of that.

523
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:31,253
All right, you have got
to forget about Cheznik.

524
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:36,221
Okay, and confronting him at gunpoint
is not gonna convince anyone of anything.

525
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:39,303
If you're innocent, put the gun down.

526
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:43,483
A gun never solved anything. Believe me.

527
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:46,552
The police are probably out
there right now with a sniper.

528
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:51,201
I know how they
work.So, I'm asking you--

529
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:56,882
I am begging you,
I am begging you--

530
00:31:57,757 --> 00:32:00,252
just put the gun down.

531
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,711
- No, it's over.
- No.

532
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:10,701
You get over next to him
and put your hands up. Now!

533
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:13,301
Spike, he's escalating. Where are you?

534
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:14,491
15 seconds away.

535
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:16,613
That's not good enough.

536
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,712
Now. I need you now. I need you now.

537
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,063
Bravo Team has it.

538
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:23,142
No, I don't wanna go lethal.
I don't want to go lethal.

539
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:26,992
Alpha Team, I'm watching
you. Are you set?

540
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,382
Your time is up.

541
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,940
- We're set, boss.
- Go, go, go.

542
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,813
Police! Put the gun down now!

543
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:39,323
- Put it down now!
- Drop the weapon!

544
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:42,511
You okay? You're okay. You're okay.

545
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:45,853
He's got her. He's got her, he's
got her. They're clear. They're safe.

546
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:48,091
- Come on, come on.
- They're safe.

547
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:50,353
You son of a bitch.

548
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,890
Okay, where's the
subject? Where's, uh...

549
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:03,900
Where's Michael Jameson?

550
00:33:12,178 --> 00:33:14,370
That's why I looked up. I didn't know.

551
00:33:14,387 --> 00:33:17,492
You're all right. You're okay.
Cuffs off. Get these cuffs off.

552
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,392
You did great.

553
00:33:22,146 --> 00:33:22,860
Are you okay?

554
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,431
I'll be all right when
that kid gets out of there.

555
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:27,470
I've been on the phone with his lawyer.

556
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:29,563
The kid was right, the
case was a disaster.

557
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:30,641
What do you mean, a disaster?

558
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:32,640
Get a load of this.

559
00:33:32,656 --> 00:33:37,362
If you won't let me talk to Cheznik
then give me a tape recorder.

560
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:40,533
Subject turns to suicide. 12:11 PM.

561
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:42,452
Michael's asked for a tape recorder.

562
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:45,560
All right, Lewis. Just take
it easy, just talk to him.

563
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:49,283
Okay, it's coming. It's
coming. They're working on it.

564
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,013
All right? Please, stay calm, all right?

565
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:55,352
If you could lower
that gun a few inches...

566
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:59,733
- No, they...still won't let me go.
- That's him.

567
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,010
Are you listening to me?

568
00:34:01,027 --> 00:34:02,763
Make sure it's recording.

569
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:05,170
What did I just say?

570
00:34:05,197 --> 00:34:07,163
What did I just tell you?

571
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:11,702
Excuse me, sir, if I could just talk to
you for a second, I gotta get back in there.

572
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,600
Well, they got you out. What's going on?

573
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,071
Listen, I've got to call you back.

574
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:17,240
If I could just get this straight.

575
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:20,053
So it's a young girl who
was raped and murdered,

576
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:22,980
and the public was looking
for somebody to hang, right?

577
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:24,333
They always are.

578
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:30,230
And the only real suspect is this kid,
and all you got on him is circumstantial?

579
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:31,781
- Are we picking this up?
- Yeah.

580
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:33,612
Nobody's gonna want to take that case.

581
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:34,631
That's right.

582
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:36,181
It's a no-win.

583
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:40,310
So, you do what it takes to
make the case. You know what?

584
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:44,241
I get it.

585
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:47,341
The system's rigged
against the good guys.

586
00:34:47,356 --> 00:34:49,251
You do what you gotta do.

587
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,253
I hear you. Like, like...

588
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:55,600
give an informant the details
of a murder, that kind of thing?

589
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:59,443
How many years did you knock
off this guy's sentence?

590
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,321
'Scuse me.

591
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:06,352
What about the eight other cases you used
jailhouse informants to get "confessions"?

592
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:07,820
Get your hand off me.

593
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:08,801
Happily.

594
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:11,201
I make no apologies for what I did.

595
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:13,901
Those were good cases.
They were tough cases.

596
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,691
No one else could've
gotten those convictions.

597
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:18,422
They knew that, that's...

598
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:20,263
That's what?

599
00:35:20,297 --> 00:35:24,841
Why they made you a senior prosecutor,
a month after that kid went to jail?

600
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:33,032
Hey, Ed. Nice work.

601
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:35,443
Is what he said enough to nail him?

602
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:38,722
No. No, but the whole thing might
be enough to get this kid an appeal.

603
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:41,382
Jules is working on it.
I'm going in to tell him.

604
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:45,011
Boss, I... Let me have the vest. Okay?

605
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,731
Ed, you can't just keep putting
yourself in the middle of this thing.

606
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:52,063
That's not how we work, you know that.

607
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,333
What is this?

608
00:35:56,357 --> 00:36:00,790
You think this is some way to atone, you
save this kid, you get to take it all back?

609
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:03,410
I'm not trying to take it back.

610
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:05,730
Ed. Eddie.

611
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:22,591
Okay, this is Strategic
Response Unit officer Ed Lane.

612
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,040
You're a cop?

613
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:26,701
Yes, I am.

614
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,100
I need you to listen to me.

615
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:32,042
I got Cheznik, on record,

616
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:36,623
admitting that he would do whatever
it took to get a conviction.

617
00:36:37,035 --> 00:36:41,430
Your lawyer says there may be
as many as eight similar cases.

618
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:45,840
With the evidence he has,
it's enough for an appeal.

619
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:48,282
So, just...

620
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:51,761
just put the gun down, okay?

621
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:56,161
Nobody dies today.

622
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:59,622
Nobody dies today, okay?

623
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:04,212
What you... what you
were saying about...

624
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:07,753
going over something in your brain?

625
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:10,403
Yeah?

626
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:13,423
In prison, I went over a lot of things.

627
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:16,360
But there was this one thing that I...

628
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:19,943
I kept asking myself over and over.

629
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:25,721
I asked myself why Katie didn't
want me to drop her at home that day,

630
00:37:26,058 --> 00:37:30,023
why she wanted me to
drop her at the corner.

631
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:35,503
She didn't love me.

632
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:41,311
She wanted me to drop her at the corner
because she was meeting someone else.

633
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,000
She had a date.

634
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:45,810
Oh, my God.

635
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:48,643
Whoever she was meeting,
that's who killed her.

636
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:51,592
It had to be.

637
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:57,890
I promised her, the first time I went to her
grave, that I would prove I was innocent--

638
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:01,213
not for myself but for her.

639
00:38:03,477 --> 00:38:04,692
So they'd start...

640
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:09,393
they'd start to look
for him, whoever he is.

641
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:12,581
So justice would be done.

642
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:15,781
I promise you...

643
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,450
we're gonna make sure that happens.

644
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,852
And you will get your appeal.

645
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:27,902
Nobody dies today, okay?

646
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,770
That's it.

647
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:34,723
Put your hands on your head.

648
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:56,092
You know, you never told me your name.

649
00:38:57,356 --> 00:39:00,110
My name's Michael Jameson.

650
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:03,480
Michael Jameson.

651
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:10,872
It's all right.

652
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:27,212
- You all right?
- I'm good, good.
