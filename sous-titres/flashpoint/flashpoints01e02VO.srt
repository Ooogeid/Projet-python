1
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,170
I told you to stay away from me.

2
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,300
Jack, don't do it.

3
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,680
I told you to stay out!

4
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,870
Jack, look at this man.

5
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,850
Look at him.

6
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,000
His name... is william.

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,720
Jack.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,630
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes I do! Yes I do!

9
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,190
<i>2 hours earlier</i>

10
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:02,190
Because he said we could
take the cottage for...

11
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:04,166
two weeks.

12
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:07,845
Because they're going
road-tripping out east again.

13
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:13,797
I figure we help them rewire
the boathouse. You know.

14
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,001
That's a pretty good deal, I figure.

15
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,231
I wanted to show you something.

16
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:28,980
I was going through some old
stuff in the garage, you know.

17
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:33,311
I can't remember the
name we gave for this.

18
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,312
Bass-master.

19
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:37,793
Bass-master! That's
right, bass-master...

20
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:40,860
you didn't forget.

21
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:44,211
A six-pounder, you
pulled outta that lake.

22
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:46,483
Two-pounder.

23
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,181
Two-pounder? it was
at least five pounds.

24
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:52,912
I mean, who's gonna remember
better, me or the six-year-old?

25
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,782
ruby? Ruby!

26
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:30,862
Hey, sally.

27
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:33,790
New shirt?

28
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:34,970
You like?

29
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:35,883
Pink, huh?

30
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,703
The high risk world
of internet shopping.

31
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:40,453
Morning, sarge.

32
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,270
Hi, jules.

33
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:42,982
Hey, we're breaking in
the rookie, wanna watch?

34
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,371
Yeah. Yeah, gimme five.

35
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:48,430
ten rounds, ten targets,
you don't get to miss.

36
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:50,322
I don't miss.

37
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,723
This week's mockup is
courtesy of bob the builder.

38
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,302
Three-sixty simulation?

39
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,870
Only the best for the proud
men and women of the sru.

40
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:02,941
- Live ammo, right?
- Always.

41
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:12,421
- Here we go.
- Play nice.

42
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:20,511
party started?

43
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,673
No, you're just in time.

44
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:31,001
I love his hair.

45
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,091
sam-tastic.

46
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:39,281
Not bad. Faster.

47
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:42,682
granny.

48
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:49,303
- Hope no one turns out the lights.
- Nice.

49
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:06,280
that was good.

50
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,521
cool.

51
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:19,841
What else you got?

52
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:21,341
Are you up for it?

53
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,471
Uh, we're gonna need the suitcase.

54
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:26,343
We unpacked it.

55
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:28,162
repack it and meet us there.

56
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:30,240
Hold this, honey. Is the ambulance...

57
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:31,942
No, there's no time.

58
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:36,113
It'll take a half hour
just to get here. Thanks.

59
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:39,891
Okay, let's go. Let's go, hun. Let's go.

60
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,353
You okay, pheobs? You
getting enough air?

61
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:46,060
Let me check your lpm.

62
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:49,663
It's okay.

63
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:53,542
it'll be okay.

64
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:58,483
This time tomorrow, you're
gonna be good as new.

65
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,262
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

66
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:16,373
Running a check on license hn5r57a.

67
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:20,201
- Officer!I'm sorry, I have an emergency here.
- Get back in the car.

68
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:21,260
- My daughter...
- sir!

69
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:24,413
- My daughter is very- you're not
listening to me! - Sir! Hands on the car!

70
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:25,461
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

71
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,293
Look, I know I shouldn't have done it, but we
have to get to saint simon's hospital right away.

72
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:34,971
They have a heart. They have a new
heart for my daughter. Please. Please.

73
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:43,203
Okay, listen. Follow me close,
okay? Stay on my right bumper.

74
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:46,821
Okay. Okay. Okay.

75
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,520
Phoebe? Hey, is everything okay?

76
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:13,371
Oh, yeah, we got the page.

77
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:15,931
Oh, that is awesome. That is awesome.

78
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,620
- Upstairs to cicu, fast!
- Thank you. Uh, thank you.

79
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,983
- Go!
- I'll be right up.

80
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:24,351
Hey, it's heather.
Phoebe's on her way in.

81
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,711
Phoebe swanson. The heart recipient.

82
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:29,640
What do you mean?

83
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,600
You gotta be kidding me.

84
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:37,372
Check it out.

85
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,712
Mr. Swanson, could I have
a quick word with you?

86
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:46,211
Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:49,111
Don't move.

88
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,530
mr. Swanson, I'm afraid we've had
a bit of A... miscommunication.

89
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,311
What's up?

90
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,571
Well, the transplant coordinator...

91
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:03,681
the recipient list had been updated;
she had not been made aware of that.

92
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,852
I know this is distressing,
but the truth is...

93
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:11,723
another patient has had
to be given priority.

94
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,223
I'm, I'm sorry, what?

95
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:23,422
I'm so sorry, mr. Swanson, but
the next heart will be phoebe'S.

96
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,133
Uh, maybe you don't know this, but...

97
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:30,593
phoebe has been on the
waiting list for 14 months.

98
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,231
I really have to apologize.

99
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:34,120
She's first in line. She's
been first in line for a month.

100
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,092
This is not a deli counter, mr. Swanson.

101
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:37,940
oh, heather, could you
please explain to him.

102
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:40,013
Look, she was here
already once last week.

103
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:43,423
She was prepped and everything,
but the heart was flawed.

104
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:44,463
Do you know what that's like?

105
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:46,801
- Considering the travel time of this organ...
- yeah.

106
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:48,452
The window of survivability is shorter.

107
00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:51,221
So, then why are we standing here?

108
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:56,122
In this situation, the computer selects
the recipient closer to the hospital.

109
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:58,942
closer? Closer.Look, the
only reason we were at home is

110
00:07:58,955 --> 00:08:03,193
because the hospital told us to go home
to prepare ourselves to say goodbye.

111
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:06,011
- Did your computer tell you that?
- Mr. Swanson!

112
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:08,171
And now you're telling me
that if we had just stayed-

113
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:11,310
I'm telling you that you should
not have been paged today.

114
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,930
I don't care, this is my
daughter. This is my daughter!

115
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:15,311
Mr. Swanson, keep your
voice down, please.

116
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:17,900
No-no-no-no-no, I'm very sorry,
I am very sorry, but screw that!

117
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:18,811
You are not... there is no way...

118
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:22,002
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask
you to keep your voice down.

119
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:27,362
I'm sorry, mr. Swanson.

120
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,722
okay.

121
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:43,870
Okay. Okay.

122
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,441
Dad.

123
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:01,891
Okay, okay. I'm sorry!
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

124
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,853
the heart belongs to phoebe!

137

Come on.

138
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,982
Let's keep the peace.

139
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:15,021
'Kay, we're gonna take
care of this right now!

140
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:18,652
The guy who was just
here, uh, where is he?

141
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:25,042
- Heather, could you get him for me?
- 'Kay, jack, no problem.

142
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:32,143
Mr. Krupchik, to cicu immediately.
Mr. Krupchik, to cicu please.

143
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:35,570
10-31, possible 10-66.
Standby for updates, over.

144
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,516
Copy that.

145
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:39,145
We got multiple 911'S.

146
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:42,657
Usual precision reports: It's two guys
with a gun and one guy with a bomb.

147
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,241
Civilian presence?

148
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:47,172
Surgeons, nurses, staff, patients.

149
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,322
No id yet?

150
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:52,423

151
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:54,893
I'm here. Right here.

152
00:10:54,908 --> 00:10:55,733
Okay.

153
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:57,060
Jack, please, I'm sorry, could-

154
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:59,862
nobody moves!All right?

155
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:04,550
The heart is phoebe's and
you're gonna make it happen.

156
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:06,803
I can't just... it's
just not that simple.

157
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:11,650
Look, I don't care how not
simple it is, just make it happen.

158
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,362
I can'T.

159
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:17,820
Please, mr. Swanson, I can'T.

160
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:21,692
Okay. Fine. Fine.

161
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,412
Nobody moves!

162
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:37,040
okay, all right, just
stop what you're doing.

163
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:39,590
You've got the wrong patient.

164
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,731
Let's set command post on site.

165
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,962
Copy that. Jules, you'll be
my secondary tac, if required.

166
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,070
You got it.

167
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:53,672
Wordy, cover the boss. Spike, comm
links; explosives, if we need 'em.

168
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:54,622
Copy-copy.

169
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,993
A bomb, make it a bomb,
I never get a bomb.

170
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:58,751
Explosive entry, at
least, I would settle for.

171
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:01,890
Lew, you're less-lethal.
It's a hospital, so no gas.

172
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:03,652
Less lethal?

173
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:07,801
mr. Braddock, you may
observe from the command post.

174
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:10,110
Observe?

175
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:12,693
Job's not about being a good shot.

176
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:15,300
The job's about saving lives.

177
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:39,163
- Sgt. Parker?
- Yeah.

178
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,033
- Floor plans just came in.
- Good. Just one subject?

179
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:43,951
- Male, white.
- Where is he?

180
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:48,150
Uh, here. Fourth floor,
cardiac intensive care.

181
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:51,012
- Elevator immobilized?
- On it.

182
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:52,732
Keep that outer perimeter contained.

183
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:54,271
Our guy carrying anything else?

184
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:55,593
Police officer: Anything else?

185
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:57,323
Besides your side-arm.

186
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:59,103
Police officer: Right,
sorry. I don't think so.

187
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:00,431
Hostages?

188
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,752
Police officer: Surgical
team, heart recipient.

189
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:05,373
Uh, there's critical
patients in icu rooms...

190
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:07,701
- the guy's daughter.
- The guy's daughter?

191
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,733
Security room's right here,
let's make that the command post.

192
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:14,791
Wordy, lew, get a reccy for the boss.

193
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:17,973
Morning, gentlemen. Sru. We need a
command post right here, right now.

194
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:19,490
Man: All right, you got it. Let's go.

195
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:21,290
Thank you.

196
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:25,482
He's moving the patient
into the waiting area.

197
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:26,810
We need to know what he's saying.

198
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:28,901
I'll reverse phone lines.

199
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,612
Establishing inner perimeter
command post at this extension.

200
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:36,873
Let's cut off distractions.

201
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:41,133
Critical incident: Multiple hostages
taken, st simon's hospital, 11:01 am.

202
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:43,270
We've been here five minutes;
we don't have a name, yet?

203
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:44,511
It's jack swanson.

204
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:45,843
This is heather, she's a nurse.

205
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,113
We need an address for
jack swanson, s-w-a-n-s-o-n,

206
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,042
and detective units to
canvas area friendlies.

207
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:54,091
- His daughter's a patient?
- Phoebe.

208
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:56,282
She was just discharged to
spend her last days at home,

209
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:59,690
so she lost her spot in
line for a heart transplant.

210
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:03,841
So he's having a bad day, guys.

211
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,851
- And where's the heart?
- It's en route.

212
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,872
How long is it viable?

213
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,091
More than an hour and
we run into trouble.

214
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:12,553
That doesn't leave us
a lot of time, guys.

215
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:15,293
Hey, sarge, you want to get an early
start, we'll feed you on the fly?

216
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:16,743
Yeah. Yeah, I'm game.

217
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,910
Heather, do you mind sticking around?

218
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:20,442
Lew, wordy, I'm comin' out.

219
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:23,471
Let's see if we can
get mr. Swanson home.

220
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:30,373
Jack's a single father,
self-employed, handyman.

221
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:33,231
Do you think he's the
type of guy to fire a gun?

222
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:36,102
I don't know. He's a regular guy.

223
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:38,731
I think he just sort of... snapped.

224
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,023
Jack swanson?

225
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:47,530
This is the police, strategic
response unit. How you doin'?

226
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:53,930
okay, three nurses here, one surgeon.

227
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:56,742
Immobilized patients
here, here, here and here.

228
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:58,720
It's fish in a barrel.

229
00:14:58,738 --> 00:14:59,981
Where's the subject?

230
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:02,602
He's here, in the cicu.

231
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:04,332
East hallway's sterile.

232
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:05,653
Sterile?

233
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:08,271
Means the subject has
no shot unless he moves.

234
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:10,421
What if he moves?

235
00:15:10,437 --> 00:15:12,521
Everything changes.

236
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:18,240
no-no-no-no-no.
No.

237
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:29,193
It's all right, these guys are with me.

238
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:31,661
They don't move unless I say so.

239
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:35,421
11:07 am, sgt. Greg
parker begins negotiation.

240
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:39,670
It's my job to help you and I want
to make sure know one gets hurt.

241
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,363
I want you to back off!

242
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:43,891
Can't do that, jack. We're
gonna stay right here.

243
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,451
Is it all right if I call you jack?

244
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:47,641
My name's greg.

245
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:49,200
Hey, I mean it!

246
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,581
Let's just talk, okay?

247
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,150
How's his home life?

248
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:54,650
There's just the two of them.

249
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:55,802
They're pretty close.

250
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:57,123
His wife died.

251
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:58,753
Do you know how?

252
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:01,741
She was killed in a car accident.

253
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:04,452
Jack was driving.

254
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:08,170
He's suffering from survivors
guilt over his wife's death.

255
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:10,281
Sounds like you're pretty
upset about something.

256
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:11,760
Maybe I can help.

257
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,791
What do you think?

258
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:17,682
I want you to turn the tv's back on.
My daughter was watching tv, all right?

259
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:24,381
He wants his daughter's
eyes on the tv, not him.

260
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,130
Let's get something from him first.

261
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:28,803
'Kay, I'll start working on that.

262
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:32,172
In the meantime, why don't you
tell me why we're here today?

263
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:34,071
What's this all about, jack?

264
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:36,582
It's about saving my daughter's life!

265
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:39,192
All right.

266
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,123
What's your daughter's name?

267
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,613
We've got two civilians in the O.R.

268
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:45,901
Here, and a group
near the subject, here.

269
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,680
We already know why the perp's here.

270
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:49,470
He's a subject, not a perp.

271
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,603
He's a guy with a gun.

272
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,813
He's a father in trouble.

273
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:56,463
You ask questions, sam, you
show him that you're listening.

274
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,630
All right. Thanks.

275
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:00,442
Heart's here.

276
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:03,672
Yeah, that's fine. Let's just make
sure we keep it out of the way, okay?

277
00:17:04,037 --> 00:17:06,560
So your daughter's been waiting
for a heart, is that right, jack?

278
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:09,570
Yeah. She's been waiting over a year!

279
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,270
She can't wait any more.

280
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:14,022
I understand.

281
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:15,271
So let's work together and...

282
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,062
see if we can figure
something out, okay?

283
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:23,010
But, jack, right now, I'm sorry, but
I need to ask you a little favour.

284
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:25,160
Can you just let me know how
everyone's doing over there?

285
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:29,263
Because when I talk to my bosses they're gonna
want to make sure everyone's safe and uh...

286
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:32,320
I can't really see too
well from over here, so...

287
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:35,192
I need to know that they're okay.

288
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:37,340
Can you ask them for me?

289
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:49,950
- you okay?
- Dad.

290
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,921
I gotta do this, sweetheart. I gotta.

291
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:57,013
You're okay? Okay.

292
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,940
You guys okay?

293
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,161
Yeah, they're okay.

294
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:06,532
How 'bout the other patient?

295
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:11,251
Is the other patient okay?

296
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:17,021
are you-you... are you okay?

297
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:24,251
yeah.

298
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:25,771
He's okay.

299
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:27,050
Thank you, jack.

300
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,103
You did real good.

301
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:31,662
Harder to hurt someone you connect to.

302
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:34,802
'Cause then they're real people too.

303
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:36,032
Everyone's fine.

304
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,231
Jack did a real good job here.

305
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:40,402
So how we doing on
those tv's for phoebe?

306
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:41,981
What's your take, jules?

307
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,721
Think he's doing good.

308
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:47,602
11:14, parker initiates
stockholm. Tv demand granted.

309
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,721
It's gotta be a less lethal option.

310
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:54,232
Let me shoot the gun, problem solved.

311
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:56,360
- Too risky.
- I won't miss.

312
00:18:56,765 --> 00:19:00,250
Gun fragments, civilians, we don't get
away with collateral damage here, sam.

313
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,641
We need to isolate him.

314
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,490
11:15, forensic physiologist
arrives on scene.

315
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:13,560
Good morning, luria here.

316
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:14,860
Morning, doc.

317
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:20,262
Subject is jack swanson, in transition from
red to yellow, he's responsive to stockholm.

318
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:22,852
No flies on you guys.

319
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:25,122
No, he's workin' the greg parker magic.

320
00:19:25,136 --> 00:19:28,362
Let me access meds and mentals;
I'll get right back to you.

321
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,661
hey, they said I should talk to you.

322
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,493
I'm jack swanson's home nurse.

323
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:37,343
Why don't you just tase his ass?

324
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,290
Muscle spasm
- he'll pull the trigger.

325
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:41,730
So we go in hard tactical.

326
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,270
Yeah, I was just gettin' at that.

327
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:46,032
Look, there's something
I need you to do.

328
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,890
All right, see these stairs here?
That's where we came in, right?

329
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:50,852
I want you to make a reverse entry.

330
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:53,692
Go across this hallway, these doors
here, I need you to go through them.

331
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:55,731
Now be careful because
that's a big road.

332
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:56,933
I want you to cross it.

333
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,692
I want you to make an
entry into this timmy'S.

334
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:00,283
I'll have a double double.

335
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:02,191
- Jules?
- Cream, no sugars.

336
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,991
- Spike?
- No, I'm good.

337
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:07,570
You serious?

338
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:18,071
You went all coffee-shop on his ass.

339
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:23,563
Do you think we can talk a little about the
last few weeks; what that's been like for him?

340
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:26,903
- Sure.
- Great. Is that phoebe's?

341
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:29,753
Yes.

342
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:34,283
And now they wanna give her heart to somebody
else and they expect to what? Just walk away?

343
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:36,642
Heart's still en route, boss.

344
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,141
She's your daughter.

345
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:42,000
That's right. Like,
see, you get it, right?

346
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,530
You just want to help her.

347
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:46,441
You got kids, right?

348
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:49,120
I can tell you love her a lot, jack.

349
00:20:49,135 --> 00:20:51,233
You got kids?

350
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:56,690
yeah, I do. A boy.

351
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:00,482
- What's he doing?
- What?

352
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:03,541
Negotiating 101: Never
lie to the subject.

353
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:06,842
He's not lying; he has a kid.

354
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,892
Really?

355
00:21:08,907 --> 00:21:10,313
Before your time.

356
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:14,202
Jules, she reckons jack
hasn't slept in three days.

357
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:17,171
So we're looking at impaired
cognitive function and irritability.

358
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:20,470
Emotional volatility, impulsiveness...

359
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:23,671
hey, any word? Any word?

360
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:26,210
Yeah, the heart, it needs
to get up there or it dies.

361
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:28,912
Well, then you'd better get
it up there. Fourth floor.

362
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:34,021
Hey, this area's still restricted.

363
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:36,571
That sru guy just cleared me.

364
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:41,530
He's 16. He's gonna be 16 next week.

365
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:43,800
So you know what that's like.

366
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:48,873
Come on, you come home every day to
your kids and they keep you going.

367
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:50,982
It's true, kids keep you going.

368
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,860
So can you imagine losing that?

369
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:55,700
Yeah, yeah, I can imagine.

370
00:21:55,718 --> 00:21:58,461
I mean, you'd do anything
for your kid, right?

371
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:00,791
Uh, what's his name?

372
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:06,761
- Dean.
- Dean.

373
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:10,611
What would you do?

374
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:14,041
Come on, help me out a little
bit here, what would you do?

375
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:19,153
What's going on? We
got a breach. Wordy, go.

376
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:23,323
- Trouble.
- That's the heart, right?

377
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:27,171
- Jack! Jack, just stay with me.
- That's her heart.

378
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:28,821
Excuse me, excuse me, I'll take that.

379
00:22:28,837 --> 00:22:31,292
Give it to me! Give it to me!

380
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:37,540
- He's got the heart.
- How the hell?

381
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,091
Get those elevators locked off.

382
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:48,323
Come here! Out the door you came in. Go!

383
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:52,651
- Okay, back off.
- Okay, jack.

384
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,320
Keep the gun down, okay?

385
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,831
What do we do now?

386
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:02,222
Well, we...

387
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:07,921
we got the page, I got heart,
so I think you know what we do.

388
00:23:09,246 --> 00:23:13,083
they've already done her blood and urine tests,
so they should start her immunosuppressants.

389
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:15,402
Now, let's get this thing done.

390
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:16,822
Doc, you stay where you are.

391
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:18,183
Spike, take over as secondary.

392
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,680
- Jules.
- Gotcha.

393
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:23,111
- He needs to be prepped for surgery.
- No, he's going nowhere.

394
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:24,711
Jack, let's just think
this thing through.

395
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:26,992
That's going to my daughter!

396
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:30,103
Just calm down, jack.
Think this through.

397
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,823
All right, hold it right
there! Hold it! Stop!

398
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:34,382
- Calm down, we all go home safe.
- Got the solution.

399
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:38,072
Stop, stop, stop-stop-stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop, stop!

400
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,701
- Safety's on, safety's on.
- Less lethal, go.

401
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:46,380
Stop.

402
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:54,141
shot fired. Shot fired. Officer down.

403
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:55,412
Wordy?

404
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:01,702
I didn't mean that!

405
00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:03,003
Wordy?

406
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:05,012
I'm okay. Vest.

407
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:08,531
We're holding fire. We're holding fire.

408
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:09,792
I'M... so sorry!

409
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:12,330
- We're holding fire, jack.
- Holding fire.

410
00:24:12,346 --> 00:24:14,433
Wordy, I'm pulling you back.

411
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:17,360
copy.

412
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:20,023
11:28, heart breached the perimeter.

413
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:22,283
Subject re-escalated to red.

414
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:25,032
Jack, listen to me, okay?

415
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:27,471
That was not what you meant to do.

416
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:29,511
Jules, stay ready.

417
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,961
No, I didn't mean it.

418
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:33,763
He's okay, jack.

419
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:35,711
You okay, mr. Wordsworth?

420
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:36,873
I'm all right!

421
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:38,543
He's okay, jack. You see?

422
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:41,572
Your bullet hit his vest
and that's a good thing.

423
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:45,691
And it's a good thing that I was here and I saw that
you didn't mean to use that gun on my friend, right?

424
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,780
yeah, no, I-I didn't mean it.

425
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:49,960
Okay, of course you didn'T.

426
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:54,503
And I trust you on that, so
now you gotta trust me, okay?

427
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:56,262
We're running out of
time on that heart, jack.

428
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:58,572
What do ya say, we give it to the doc?

429
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,161
I can't do that.

430
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:01,463
Jack.

431
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:03,090
Spike.

432
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:05,923
We need to get him out
of the waiting area.

433
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:08,573
We need an empty room.

434
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:12,273
Hey, look, you gotta start prepping
my daughter for surgery now, okay?

435
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:17,032
Doc, don't you need to make tests on
the heart to make sure it's usable?

436
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:20,310
Yes. We need to examine the heart
for tissue damage during transport.

437
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:21,790
Okay, well, we wanna...

438
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:24,420
see that heart taken
care of, right, jack?

439
00:25:28,357 --> 00:25:30,013
Yeah, okay, but I stay with it.

440
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,601
Well... can you do that, doc?

441
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:35,992
- Don't you need a sterile environment?
- We do.

442
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,312
Then that's a problem, jack.

443
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:39,560
You see, that gun,
that gun isn't sterile.

444
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,472
Remember what we said about...

445
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:43,400
doing everything we can for our kids?

446
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,070
This is one of those things.

447
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:49,400
Okay. Okay. All right.

448
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,653
Uh, h-h-he
stays right here.

449
00:25:57,678 --> 00:25:59,852
Okay, jack.

450
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:08,513
It's not fair.

451
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,461
It was his decision.

452
00:26:10,477 --> 00:26:12,310
What was?

453
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:17,111
She was dying and they made him choose
and he chose to take phoebe back home.

454
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:19,411
He must feel like it's his fault.

455
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:21,443
Come on, what's going on, guys ?

456
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:23,961
We can't isolate jack.

457
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:26,653
Well, let's keep working on that then.

458
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:29,832
- Are these two O.R.'S side by side?
- Yes.

459
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,160
- Spike, you bring charges?
- Yeah.

460
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,542
We're gonna need rappelling gear, too.

461
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:37,050
Wordy, you take over here for spike.

462
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,370
Boss?

463
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:42,331
This is what I'm thinking.

464
00:26:42,348 --> 00:26:44,683
We maybe got an option B.

465
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:46,891
We gotta get phoebe into O.R.One.

466
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:49,311
Spin it to jack, no promises.

467
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:51,392
Lewis, you good to go on my call?

468
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:52,171
Copy.

469
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:54,393
All right, we're runnin' outta
time. Let's keep up with the intel.

470
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:56,792
Get the boss something he can work with.

471
00:26:56,806 --> 00:26:59,690
- Jack.
- Yeah.

472
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:02,072
They're still doing
some tests on the heart.

473
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:07,411
Now, nothing's new and no promises,
but we want to move phoebe into the O.R.

474
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,620
And get her ready just
in case. Is that okay?

475
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:17,930
Yeah.

476
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:23,512
Yeah, that would... that'd be great.

477
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:26,313
Okay.

478
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:31,430
Hey, thank you.

479
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:42,223
jules, subject is moving. Take
your white hallway. Go, go, go.

480
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:46,873
Meds and mentals: Pretty
clean mental history.

481
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:51,031
Prescription for ssri anti-depressants
after his wife's death.

482
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:54,102
A home nurse says his family's overseas.

483
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:02,822
We've got less than a
half hour on the heart.

484
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,663
We've got nowhere to go.

485
00:28:04,677 --> 00:28:07,811
There's civilians everywhere
- O.R., Icu.

486
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:10,963
Our only solution is lethal.

487
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,273
We saving jack or are
we saving the heart?

488
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:24,453
What are you doing? Come on, move
him back. Come on, move him back.

489
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:28,960
Okay, jack. Move him
back. You step away.

490
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,061
Leave him there.

491
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:37,231
Sierra one?

492
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,283
In position.

493
00:28:40,756 --> 00:28:42,451
Lew, jules is on him.

494
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,860
Lewis, you take a break.

495
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:55,852
Keep 'em on the happy stuff.

496
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:57,680
Sam!

497
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:02,080
Sending up the heart, that was you?

498
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:03,833
Yeah, it was running
out of time, I assumed...

499
00:29:03,847 --> 00:29:06,042
never, never assume, sam.

500
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:08,363
If it looks simple it's usually not.

501
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:12,733
You tossed in a lit match and
left your team to put out the fire.

502
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:16,463
Is everyone all right?

503
00:29:20,078 --> 00:29:23,631
In the spirit of fostering
a little mutual trust?

504
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:26,162
Belongs to the girl?

505
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,451
I should bring it up,
maybe it would help.

506
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:31,331
Good idea.

507
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,850
It's rocket time.

508
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:38,331
Now, gianni won the poll for
both races here last year.

509
00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:40,923
There's ten laps to go.

510
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:42,681
yeah.

511
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,600
Gianni's leading, but
it doesn't mean anything.

512
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:48,790
Garrity's five back, but he'll
save his juice for the last two.

513
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:52,601
He's just like capretti.

514
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:56,651
Daytona '98.

515
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:58,582
Did you see it?

516
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,481
I was there.

517
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:02,782
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

518
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,171
Yeah, a friend of mine went to
summer camp with capretti and uh...

519
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:08,921
he got us in. Vip treatment.

520
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:11,413
So you went with your, what, your son?

521
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:14,681
Yeah. Yeah, we got to
go down into the pit.

522
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:17,481
Capretti gave dean
one of his race gloves.

523
00:30:17,497 --> 00:30:19,860
shut up.

524
00:30:20,395 --> 00:30:22,972
You watch with phoebe?

525
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,153
Oh, yeah.

526
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:30,732
So is your boy, dean, a fan?

527
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:36,603
I don't know.

528
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:38,781
What do you mean you don't know?

529
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,001
I mean, I don't know.

530
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:45,403
I haven't seen my son in a long time.

531
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:48,032
I'm sorry, what?

532
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:50,770
I haven't seen him in nine years.

533
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,810
Now, wait a second, you just
said that your kid's your life.

534
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:56,742
Yeah, it's true, he is.

535
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,893
No, you said you knew what it was like;
that you come home every day to your kid.

536
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:04,510
Not exactly. What I said
was... what I said was...

537
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:07,520
He said, "you come home every day
to your kids, it keeps you going."

538
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:10,630
You said, "it's true,
your kids keep you going."

539
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:13,721
I said, "it's true, they keep you going."
I didn't say, "I see him every day."

540
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,832
I said, "they keep you
going." And that's true.

541
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:18,751
My wife left with dean nine years ago

542
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:23,571
and I tried to turn a lot of things
around so I could be a better guy...

543
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:26,590
a better dad, but uh...

544
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:31,312
I don't, I don't know if
he still likes stock car.

545
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:35,143
I don't know what his
shoe size is, jack.

546
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:37,991
I lost my chance.

547
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:41,661
I lost my chance.

548
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:48,783
But this thing you're trying o do for
your daughter here, I understand that.

549
00:31:49,717 --> 00:31:54,520
I really understand that, and I can't
say that I wouldn't do the same thing.

550
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:59,283
But at the end of the day,
you gotta be there for her.

551
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:02,733
No, no, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

552
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,870
Thing is, it doesn't matter that
I'm there for her. What matters...

553
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:09,540
is that she has her life. That's it.

554
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:12,241
That's important.

555
00:32:12,255 --> 00:32:14,110
So um... where's the heart anyway?

556
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:16,413
Why haven't they taken it in to phoebe?

557
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,982
boss, the heart, we're
almost out of time.

558
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:25,713
There's only 15 minutes left.

559
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:29,882
All right, I'm breaking a
lot of rules here, jack. Okay?

560
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:33,702
But the truth is...

561
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:37,042
they're not gonna let
phoebe have that heart.

562
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:42,182
No, no, you said that
they were working on it?

563
00:32:42,197 --> 00:32:44,493
That's what...

564
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:47,783
that's something negotiators do.

565
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:51,821
We stall for time, we pass
the buck, we stretch the truth,

566
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:55,273
but uh, I don't want
to lie to you, jack.

567
00:32:57,117 --> 00:32:58,513
What's he doing?

568
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:00,301
He knows we're at the end of the line.

569
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:03,063
- Yeah, but you can'T...
- he knows what he's doing.

570
00:33:04,578 --> 00:33:06,000
I could keep asking them.

571
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:10,183
I can keep asking them and asking
them, but the thing is, is that...

572
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,933
they are never gonna
let you have that heart.

573
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:15,381
Yes. No, no. Yes, they will. They will.

574
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:19,191
Jack, one guy walks into a place
with a gun and gets what he wants,

575
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,332
the next thing you know, a
whole bunch of guys are thinking,

576
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:24,643
"hey, maybe I can get the same thing."

577
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:29,323
That becomes a big problem, jack.

578
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:32,991
I know you're tired, buddy.

579
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:35,233
I know you're tired.

580
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:38,091
There's a chance your daughter
will get another heart.

581
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:43,750
You still have a chance, if let him
go; if you let them do their work.

582
00:33:46,998 --> 00:33:50,500
okay. All right. Okay.

583
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:57,400
it's gonna be okay. Go.

584
00:33:59,135 --> 00:34:02,460
Thank you, jack. Go on.

585
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:05,510
That was a good choice, jack.

586
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:08,421
It was a good choice.

587
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:14,652
What's your take jules?

588
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,991
Gone from red to yellow.

589
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:20,431
Now, let's get him off
this gurney and onto...

590
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:24,813
now, just put the gun
down, on the floor.

591
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:30,430
You stay away from me.

592
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:34,693
Okay, you said that this heart wasn't
gonna go to waste. Is that right?

593
00:34:35,477 --> 00:34:37,571
No solution. No solution.

594
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:39,572
This is not good.

595
00:34:39,597 --> 00:34:43,670
This is option B. Sierra one,
prepare to trade up. Go, go.

596
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:06,961
I told you to stay away from me!

597
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:08,121
Jack, don't do it.

598
00:35:08,136 --> 00:35:09,473
I told you to stay out!

599
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:11,833
Jack, look at this man.

600
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:16,581
Look at him.

601
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:18,921
His name...

602
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:22,823
is william. Jack.

603
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:30,530
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do! Yes, I do!

604
00:35:31,877 --> 00:35:35,580
Boss, there's minutes left on the
heart. You have to do something.

605
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,082
- Jack, I'm sorry.
- what?

606
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:43,651
I'm sorry, jack, but the tests
came back and the heart's damaged.

607
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:44,992
well, I don't believe ya!

608
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:48,920
Jack, you could use that gun, but
I'm telling you, it'll be for nothing.

609
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:53,033
So you can decide to
do something for nothing

610
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:57,063
or you can go into that other room over
there and you can be with your daughter.

611
00:36:00,546 --> 00:36:02,680
Maybe she gets another chance.

612
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:03,892
Maybe another heart comes through.

613
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:06,633
You gotta believe it will.

614
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:10,261
But, right now, what do
you think phoebe wants?

615
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:13,523
Right now?

616
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:18,230
if you want to see your daughter...

617
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:28,292
go see phoebe, jack.

618
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:32,063
We'll back off.

619
00:36:51,247 --> 00:36:54,003
Is this something you needed?

620
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:29,312
spike and jules, standby.

621
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:35,750
Subject moving, he's still armed.

622
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:53,002
Police! Get down!

623
00:37:53,015 --> 00:37:55,090
Get the gun! Get the gun!

624
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,270
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Stay down!

625
00:37:58,288 --> 00:38:01,113
- Do not move!
- Stay down!

626
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,153
I'm sorry.

627
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:19,082
You said the heart was no good.

628
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:21,042
Yeah, I wanted to keep you safe.

629
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:23,992
You said you knew what it
was like, but you don't know.

630
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,570
You don't know what it's like!

631
00:38:30,386 --> 00:38:32,533
- You all right, sarge?
- Yeah.

632
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,693
Let's go.

633
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:54,481
11:53 am.

634
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:57,652
Subject contained, incident resolved.

635
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:03,111
You re-escalated him.

636
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:08,181
Wordy, get those transcripts printed.

637
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,901
You let it get personal.

638
00:39:40,515 --> 00:39:46,143
* it's just too hard to hear you say *

639
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:52,793
* the world is such a better place *

640
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:58,751
* without you here I need you here *

641
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:02,712
* it's just too hard *

642
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:11,560
- what's happening?
- Change of plans.

643
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,693
You gave a life today.

644
00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:30,281
It wasn't my turn.

645
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:36,500
* So give me hope anyway you can *

646
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:42,871
* I need to know that there's a plan *

647
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:49,391
* where we can be together be *

648
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:52,600
* so give me hope *
