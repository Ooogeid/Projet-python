She knows the drill; we've

It cost,like, half a paycheck to fill up,
which is the same price as a secondhand bike.

'em out, night on the town.

Excuse me.

101
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,060
You told me not to overpack.

102
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,080
I simply suggested we
experiment in traveling light.

103
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,530
Which is fine, except now you
want me to wear the Dior tonight.

104
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,980
And guess what? It's at home.

105
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,900
You're going to look beautiful.
Doesn't matter what you wear.

106
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,130
Hell,wear the bathrobe.

107
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,420
Sexiest thing a woman ever put on.

108
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,990
What do you think?

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,980
- Oh,I agree.
- See,Ed agrees.

110
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,920
- Liked him from the moment I met him.
- Poor Ed.

111
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,130
Sir,I'll double-check this stuff.

112
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,820
Of course,whatever you need to do.

113
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,440

114
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,510
And mineral water. Absolutely.

- No sugar.

1:23 P.M. Knock on the
door. Brace yourselves.

120
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,150

Uh,sweetheart?

126
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,790
No,you are not having the steak frites for
lunch because we had steak last night for dinner.

127

- Thank you very much, my dear,perfect.
- Thank you.

128

It's a nice choice.

129
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,930
My wife says the same thing.

130
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,980
A little omega-3 and the crossword
if you want to live to be 70.

131
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,530
She's aiming for a hundred.

132
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,070
14 years she's been taking care of me, and
ever since I met her, everything's better.

133
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,360

Yeah, but not for half an hour.

150

4:00 P.M.: interview with
a journalist,library bar.

151
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,030
Eagle One suggested they go down
early for a glass of champagne.

Aw,what a guy.

153
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,040
All right,hold on. Hold
the elevator. I'm on my way.

154
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,940
You got our team on all the exits?

159
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,260
Well,it's a dangerous job you do.

160
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,800
I mean,now,knock on
wood, not tonight,but...

161
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,380
- Right,well,she's okay with it.
- Really?

162
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,870
Is she a police officer as well?

163
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,560
No,she's a caterer. This
is Jules; she's with us.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,710
Spike, there's an unmarked exit
just opposite the front desk.

165
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,310
- "Staff only"?
- That's the one.

166
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,630
Sarge,I'm not liking the bar.

167
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,290
Three exits-- one to the street, one
to the lobby, one towards the kitchen.

168
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,280
Corridors running east,west,up,down.

169
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,270
Yeah,we've closed off
access to the street.

170
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,400
We're about to have
Jules on the lobby door.

171
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,730
Copy that. Be there in two.

172
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,410
Okay,so the bar's a little soft.

173
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,290
What's the closest lobby exit?

174
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,410
- South.
- Wordy?

175
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,590
Outside's clear. Heading in.

176
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,150
Okay,just stayon it.

177
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,190
Eagle One-- he likes
to wander off-course.

178
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,120
I'll take the front exit when they
get here, and I think we're good.

179
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,600
Ready for anything.

180
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,590
We'll be gone by 8:00. Our
suite's already paid for.

Why don't you bring your
wife in for the night?

182
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,800
Fridge full of champagne, room service.

183
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,700
Lovely idea.

184
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,530
- Very kind,very kind,but I...
- Can't take favors. I get it.

185
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,890
One of the ironies of having
money-- everything costs less.

186
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,100
I'll get you my corporate
rate. It's practically free.

187
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,990
Sir,you know, you're very generous
with the rest of the world.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,070
- I just wouldn't feel comfortable...
- Ed,Ed,word to the wise.

189
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,360
Don't try and fight him on this.

190
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,730
Let me guess. You don't have
enough time. Tough job,long hours.

191
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,530
You're great at what you do,Ed, but
I got a few years on you. Trust me.

192
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,710
One thing money can't
buy is enough time.

193
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,010
Say yes. Call your wife.

194
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,050
It's a wonderful idea. Surprise her.
Give her a call. Come on,go ahead.

195
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,150
Okay. Okay.

196
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,040
I still remember the night
you flew me to Santiago.

197
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,450
He said it was a surprise,
told me to pack for two nights.

198
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
She packed for two weeks.

199
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,560
Hotel balcony. He asked me to marry him.

200
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,500
He said he was leaving
the mining industry behind.

201
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,710
I was working for the
Foreign Service at the time.

202
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,630
We had known each other
a whole entire month.

203
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,580
I will tell you what sold me on it.

204
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,100
He looked at me,and he said, "I'm finally
gonna do something good with my life."

205
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,480
That's what he said. And he was holding
out a ring. I mean,what was I gonna say?

206
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,270
Is she not there?

207
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,510
No. No,she didn't,uh...
She didn't answer.

208
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,470
Okay. Mrs. Graham is
waiting at her table.

209
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,500
Thank you.

210
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,630
SeÃ±or Castillo. Lovely to meet you.

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Nice to meet you.

212
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,170
Hello. I'll see you in the room,darling.

213
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,990
Yes. Please, sit,sit.

214
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,880
Eyes on Two.

215
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,590
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

216
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,110
Hey,did you just call?

217
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,300
Uh,yeah. Yeah,I did.

218
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,260
Do you know where that cheese shop is?
You know the new one. It's got the,um...

219
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,570
- Cheese?
- You should know. You ate it all.

220
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,930
Anyway, I'm having Amy over
tonight since you're working late.

221
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,090
Well,that's too bad, 'cause I
think I can get us a suite tonight.

222
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,730
You're working at the Royal York,right?

223
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,220
Ed,we can't afford the Royal York.

224
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,900
Think I can get us a deal.

225
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,110
You can't make it, you can't make it.

226
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,330
Are you kidding? Room service.

227
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,940
Date night alone with my husband.

228
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,450
Champagne,fresh sheets. What time?

229
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,820
What about Amy?

230
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,830
Ah,she can eat someone else's cheese.

231
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,760
Clark?

232
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,970
I'll get my mother to come over. 6:00?

233
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,790
- Okay,yeah. I might be a little bit late,but,uh...
- Jay?

234
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,040
you know,we're gonna finish things
up here, and,uh,that should be good.

235
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,780
Okay. I'll start the champagne
and the bubble bath without you.

236
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,310
- See you then.
- See you then.

237
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,540
Nice work. Jay,nice to see you again.

238
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,170
Listen,I'm gonna need a suite for tonight
at my corporate rate, but it's not for me.

239
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,570
Of course. We've got a lovely
suite available on the fourth floor.

240
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,160
We'll get it ready for you right now.

241
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,560
Always happy to have a friend...

242
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,300
Sir,we got to move.

243
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,240
Stay here. I'll be right back.

244
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,140
Explosion,kitchen oven. Get a medic
in here. May have some injuries.

245
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,880
Oh,my God.

246
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,460
The woman and the journalist sitting at
this table-- did anybody see them leave?

247
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,400
Jules,what's going on?

248
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,710
Eagle Two. Ed,she's not here.

249
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm gonna check the bathroom.

250
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,430
What do you mean, not here?

251
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,460
What's going on? Where
the hell is my wife?

252
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,890
Hey,Spike,bomb truck.
Figure out what happened.

253
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,420
Lewis,Wordy,get security
to lock it all down.

254
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,170
All exits,temporary red alert.

255
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,400
Jules,channel two.

256
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,170
All right,Jules,talk to me.

257
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,550
I turned my head for three seconds,
trying to figure out where to take her.

258
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,990
Journalist is also
missing. Possible subject.

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,590
I repeat,Team One, Eagle Two is
MIA. I have no contact with her.

260
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,720
Stairwell's clear. Lobby's clear.

261
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,190
Tell me what is going on.

262
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,480
Sir,I'll keep you up to date.

263
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,720
You're telling me that my wife is
missing, and you'll keep me up to date?

264
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,840
What the hell is happening here?

265
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,530
Sir,please, I need you to stay calm.

266
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,470
And I need you to stay here.

267
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,930
It's got to be about money,right?

268
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,640
We'll get a ransom note
in about a half an hour.

269
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,670
We don't know that.

270
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,770
- Well,I know that.
- Sir,please.

271
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,530
Cut off gas supply to this
kitchen now and ventilate--

272
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,300
fans,windows,everything--
before anything else blows.

273
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,620
Let's see why this thing
didn't take the roof off.

274
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,350
Hey,there's no sign of Eagle
Two leaving the building.

275
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,300
As far as we can tell,she's...

276
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,440
She's still within the perimeter.
As far as the journalist...

277
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,720
He was fully accredited
with the Millennium Forum.

278
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,910
Unless he's a master of forgery, he
writes for a small Chilean publication.

279
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,590
His name is Rafael Castillo.

280
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,480
Excuse me. What are you saying?

281
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,180
I'm saying we may be
looking at a kidnapping.

282
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,480
Good news is,if so, she's
being held within the building.

283
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,860
That's the good news?

284
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,730
Sarge,we got guys at every exit.

285
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,950
That's good. Cover Spike.

286
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,720
Ask around, and just wait for my orders.

287
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,170
Okay,let's break it down,do the math.

288
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,690
800 rooms,divided by five...

289
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,930
No. Excuse me. 809,actually.

290
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,030
It's 160 rooms per person.

291
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,680
Kira,get Rolie. We need
Team Three here ASAP.

292
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,090
Even if we cut these numbers in
half, we're talking 80 rooms each.

293
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,240
No. Absolutely not.

294
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:31,550
We have 532 guests already
checked in, 27 of whom are VIPs.

295
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,150
We cannot invade their privacy.

296
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:36,590
- This is their home away from home.
- Jay! Jay! Jay! Jay!

297
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,690
I've got one job. That's
protect the principal.

298
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,960
Principal's wife goes missing,
that affects the principal.

299
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,200
See,you,on the other
hand, have two jobs.

300
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,600
Get my guys some master
keys, and get a grip.

301
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,950
I don't know. I was on the phone.

302
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,010
I was talking to my mother, and
then I heard that thing go off.

303
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,100
It's okay. It's okay. We're
just... We're trying to make sure.

304
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,700
Uh,did you see any strangers,
any guests in the staff areas?

305
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,500
Well,Claudia,if you hear
anything,if you see anything,

306
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,590
you come speak to one of us,all right?

307
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,120
Uh,you said your shift's
over at 5:00. Is that right?

308
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,330
Security's gonna show
you out the staff door.

309
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,940
Just show 'em your ID.

310
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,510
Police! Strategic Response
Unit! Anyone there?

311
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,530
Security. Is there anyone in there?

312
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,920
Police! Strategic Response
Unit! Is anybody in there?

313
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,850
Good. I'm glad I caught
you. You haven't left yet.

314
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,660
Yeah,I know. I'm just getting
ready. What do you need?

315
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,930
Soph,we can't do it tonight. I...

316
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,620
We're having a serious
security problem here.

317
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,840
Okay. Are you all right?

318
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,150
Yeah. Yeah,I'm fine. I'm fine.

319
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,390
That's okay. I'll see
you when you get home.

320
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,120
Well,Ed,when I was still in ming,I
took over a company in Venezuela.

321
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,270
Hostile.Got very ugly,

322
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,990
but,Ed, you don't become what
I am by being nice to everyone.

323
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,230
But,I mean, this was all years ago.

324
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,710
Well,let me ask you this. Could
your wife be involved in something?

325
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,970
Something that you don't know about?

326
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,430
I... I don't know.

327
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,530
I don't think so, but I suppose you
never really know anyone completely.

328
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,210
Sarge,Ed,I don't like it.

329
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,860
I got wires. I got a fuse.
Explosives 101,nothing fancy.

330
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,760
You could learn this
stuff in high school.

331
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,200
But it's a bomb. It's definitely a bomb.

332
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,490
Wasn't built to kill, but it
sure was a hell of a distraction.

333
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,880
Do you know why you're here?

334
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,220
No. Money,I guess. I don't know.

335
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,440
Ramon Castillo, Gabriel
Alvarez, Diego Garcia.

336
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,900
Three men who were
loved by their families.

337
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,140
Tell her. Tell her!

338
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,070
My father-- his name
was Gabriel Alvarez.

339
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,210
We lived in Falpago,Chile.

340
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,620
The last time I saw him, he
was standing on our doorway.

341
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,210
He was making my mother
laugh, even as she was crying.

342
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,480
He was fighting for our
village, to make things right.

343
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,920
But it didn't work. They took him away.

344
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,700
They humiliated him. They tortured him.

345
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,280
He disappeared.

346
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,380
I never knew what happened to him.

347
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,290
I'm sorry. I am. But...

348
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,950
I don't understand what
this has to do with me.

349
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,270
Don't! She can't bring them back.

350
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,210
*******

351
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,620
***********

352
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,160
SeÃ±or Castillo... please.

353
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,380
I'll explain how it works.

354
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,710
Sarge? This freight elevator
hasn't moved in 20 minutes.

355
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,570
It's worth a shot.

356
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,300
Jules,we've got a frozen cargo
elevator in the east wing.

357
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,640
Might be worth a look.

358
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,440
- Send Lewis,too.
- Copy that.

359
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,270
Sarge,she's here. We got her.

360
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,310
But we've got a problem.

361
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,420
- Please stand back. Stand back.
- Okay.

362
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,690
They called it a necklace bomb.

363
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,140
Civilians coming through. Let
them out. That's the last of them.

364
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,650
No,sir,no, sir,Inspector.

365
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,450
They told her, anyone tampers with
it, anyone tries to isolate her,

366
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,670
get her out of the building, they trigger
the blasting cap and sever her spine.

367
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,370
I don't know,I... I don't know.

368
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,150
They also told her it was
fitted out with a camera.

369
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,650
We can't take that chance.

370
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,650
Boss,th's it. Everyone's
out. The floor's secure.

371
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,790
Three different triggers.

372
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,650
Mercury switch, pressure
fit,and a remote.

373
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,090
Now,if we can disable the remote,
we can deal with everything else.

374
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,850
And sir,if you've got any ideas...

375
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,920
All right,we'll see
you in a bit. Thank you.

376
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,550
Where is she?

377
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,260
She's safe. She's doing well,
but we need you to stay back.

378
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,560
If you are gonna be down
here, you're here to help us,

379
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,370
and you need to stay back
until further notice,sir.

380
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,010
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

381
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,140
- Okay,come on,Eddie.
- Wordy.

382
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,420
- We'll be back.
- Sir.

383
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,770
Spike says he can't cut it until
he knows what's triggering it.

384
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,830
Plus,they told her there's a camera.

385
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,060
They'd hit play if
anyone tries to cut it.

386
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,720
- We got to get them in bomb gear.
- I know. They both said no.

387
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,240
You're gonna be fine.

388
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,610
- We're all here with you,okay?
- Okay.

389
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,940
Guys,I need ten seconds
of complete silence,okay?

390
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,940
If she's safe,I don't
understand why I can't go in.

391
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,600
Sir,it's for your own safety.

392
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,770
How is she a threat?

393
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,530
It's not her,sir.

394
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,000
They've got her in a necklace bomb.

395
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,310
Oh,my God.

396
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,890
You've heard of these things?

397
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,620
I lived in South America for eight
years. Yes,I've heard of them.

398
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,920
Oh,dear God,please. Just say yes.
Say yes to however much they want.

399
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,120
They don't want money.

400
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,930
What do they want?

401
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,200
You didn't see her? You
didn't see the woman who spoke?

402
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,880
No. By then,I was blindfolded,
so apart from the journalist...

403
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,330
There was nobody else in there?

404
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,440
I don't know. Castillo was the
one who gave me the instructions.

405
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,870
Can you give them to me again?

406
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,110
I am to go to the
opening address at 7:00.

407
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,500
I don't even know what time it is now.

408
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,340
No alarms,no changes, no
alerting the other guests.

409
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,210
You can't be serious.
That's 20 minutes from now.

410
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:56,830
In front of the room, in front of
everyone, my husband is to confess.

411
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,390
Confess to what?

412
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,380
To something about
his mining operations.

413
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,850
Something about a man
named Gabriel Alvarez.

414
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,610
Gabriel Alvarez.

415
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,230
If you tell the truth,
your wife will live.

416
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,430
Now,that's what they told her.

417
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,650
Any of this make any sense to you?

418
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,600
Let me see her.

419
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,520
- Okay,go. Quickly.
- Okay.

420
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,710
I love you.

421
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,370
********

422
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,620
- This is too much.
- No,it's too late.

423
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,070
There's no time to debate this,Claudia.

424
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,230
You cannot back out on us now.

425
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,630
The world needs to
know what this man did.

426
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,130
So,I give this to Felipe in the room...

427
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,760
and then I can go,right?

428
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,380
Unless I don't make it in.

429
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,730
Why wouldn't you?

430
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,770
Security is going to be very tight.

431
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,830
Listen,if I don't make it in,

432
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,370
and if Graham lies to us,
to the room, you press...

433
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,980
this button. Okay?

434
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:29,230
But,Claudia, if the man apologizes
to us, to everyone,nothing happens.

435
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,560
We let her go.

436
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,590
- You promise?
- Of course.

437
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,910
Okay.

438
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,650
Thank you. Claudia,your father...

439
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,430
this... this is what he would do.

440
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,030
Does it have a camera?

441
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,210
I can't tell until we pull it apart.

442
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,590
Is she safe to walk around?

443
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,810
I need a minute to develop the
X-ray, but as far as I can tell,

444
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,180
there's no embedded motion
sensor,no timing device.

445
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,020
- So,it needs to be triggered?
- Yeah.

446
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,660
Found a small amount of TNT, and there's
a blasting cap attached to a relay switch.

447
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,260
Could be set off by cell phone,
could be set off by shortwave remote.

448
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,860
Okay,meaning?

449
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,030
Meaning,they're either gonna call it in or
they're gonna be within the line of sight.

450
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,180
Probably within 30 feet.

451
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,540
What about the people around her?

452
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,530
It's a blasting cap. It
goes off, it breaks her neck.

453
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,110
She's done,but it's not gonna hurt anybody
else within five,ten feet, I'm guessing.

454
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,360
Okay,we'll put her up in the balcony.

455
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,150
Meets the demands,but
keeps her out of the way.

456
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,090
That's the best we can
do right now. Let me know.

457
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,070
All right.

458
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,850
There is no guests or staff
members with the last name Alvarez.

459
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,460
And beyond Graham giving a public confession
during his keynote speech in front of the press,

460
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,940
in front of the world, we don't know
what these people want or who they are.

461
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,270
What the hell did this guy do?

462
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,030
His past life,in his
sleep-- I don't care.

463
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,160
The wife doesn't even know,sir.

464
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,550
They told her that he would
understand what it was about.

465
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,070
No,we can't risk it.

466
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,960
60 people having drinks, and we're
gonna put a woman in the middle of that?

467
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,120
We keep her up in the
balcony, out of the way.

468
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,920
Having her in the room
is part of the demand.

469
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,810
I don't care.

470
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,580
This guy says one wrong word, we've got a
woman being executed at a public function.

471
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,580
Sir,either way, they're gonna kill her.

472
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,650
They're not asking for money or hostages or
concessions, which means it's like war,right?

473
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,630
They're making a point.They're
making it publicly,

474
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,440
and they want him to see
what happens to his wife...

475
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,590
Not if we stop it.

476
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,930
We've got 14 minutes. We don't
have time to do anything else.

477
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,040
- All right.
- Go,Sam.

478
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,340
We follow their
instructions to the letter.

479
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,080
Eagle One and Eagle
Two go into the party.

480
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,080
Eagle One does his thing, as instructed.

481
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,270
In the meantime...

482
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,320
Spike is working on
electronic countermeasures,

483
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,950
jamming all cell phone signals
within a 100-meter radius.

484
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,550
No calls in,no calls out.

485
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,840
Don't tell me this thing can
be set off by a cell phone.

486
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,760
Not anymore.

487
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,720
The only other possible trigger
is shortwave remote, like a pager.

488
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,560
What does that mean?

489
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,940
That the subject has to be within the
line of sight, 30 feet from Eagle Two.

490
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,820
We contain the room. Sam prepares
a less lethal solution because,

491
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,050
if the weapon is a garage door
opener, we can't take that chance.

492
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,500
We cannot shoot to kill.

493
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,920
We contain the room; the
subject's already arrested.

494
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,980
All right,Greg.

495
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,100
I'd like to talk to my husband,please.

496
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,130
Sweetheart.

497
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,500
This isn't happening,okay?

498
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,880
It's just another night.

499
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,180
It's just me and you.

500
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,950
You get up there and you tell the
truth, and we go home together.

501
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,000
David... please.

502
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,450
You can't get up there and lie.

503
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,650
You can't try and save me by
confessing to something you didn't do,

504
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,730
'cause what you have built,
what we've built together,

505
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,610
if we let them destroy it
like this,it will never end.

506
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,070
I'll see you in there?

507
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,290
Yes. I will see you in there.

508
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,530
I lo you.

509
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,610
With all my heart.

510
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,800
Sierra One in position.

511
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,310
Copy that.

512
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,910
Ed?

513
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,030
- We're on our way.
- Copy.

514
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,200
Okay. Let's keep the peace.

515
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,940
Boss,what did this guy do?

516
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,590
I don't know.

517
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,900
Eagle One approaching.

518
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,340
Got to be something I can
do,uh, somebody I can pay.

519
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,390
Just buy us a little time to do our job.

520
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,560
Longer you talk,the
better. Left here,sir.

521
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,310
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Jane Renn.

522
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,280
I'm with the Millennium Forum.

523
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,170
I'd like to welcome you tonight,

524
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,530
and thank you for braving the
increased security this evening.

525
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,420
It's my pleasure to invite tonight's
speaker to join us: David Graham.

526
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,050
He needs no introduction.

527
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,340
Thank you very much.

528
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,390
Eagle Two,we're in position.

529
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,080
Copy that.

530
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,380
I...

531
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,520
don't know what to say.

532
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,240
nored tonight in this way,

533
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,530
I wish I deserved it. I do.

534
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,730
I wish that more than anything.

535
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:32,760
The nonprofit work we've done in South
America is the work I'm most proud of.

536
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,250
- Jules,any sign of the journalist?
- Negative.

537
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,950
It all began,of course,
as an idea of Catherine's.

538
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,450
Everything does--
everything good.

539
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,080
15 years ago, we sat on
a balcony in Santiago,

540
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,390
and I promised Catherine I would
do something good with my life,

541
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,570
if only she would just stay with me.

542
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,300
Magically... she agreed.

543
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,420
And since that night,
I've never looked back.

544
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,240
Because if I did, if I did...

545
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,250
look back, I would see things
I can't believe I let happen.

546
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:19,360
I would see ghts. Faces.

547
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,460
Ramon Castillo.

548
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,460
Diego Garcia.

549
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,280
Gabriel Alvarez.

550
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,600
Gabriel Alvarez mounted
a citizen's blockade.

551
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,200
My copper mine in Huaron,

552
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,190
a very effective and
very expensive blockade.

553
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,340
Her shift is over.

554
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,470
That waitress, her
shift is done at 5:00.

555
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,120
Copy that.

556
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,310
Quadrant Three, possible
subject, waitress,black hair.

557
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,670
I was approached.

558
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,030
I was told if you cut
the head, the body falls.

559
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,170
I said "Yes, "take care of him."

560
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,310
Two days later, the blockade was gone,

561
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,200
and I didn't ask any questions.

562
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:21,170
I am responsible for the death

563
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,390
of Gabriel Alvarez.

564
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,190
I said "Yes."

565
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,270
Yes is the easiest word.

566
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,140
Yes, I love you.

567
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,940
Yes, I will marry you.

568
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,940
Yes, get rid of the problem.

569
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,740
What you don't know is that
saying yes stays with you forever.

570
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:06,250
The violence you do. These choices.

571
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,500
Quadrant Three, male black suit
approaching possible subject.

572
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,420
I am sorry. I am...

573
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,450
so sorry.

574
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,920
- No,no,no!
- Sam,tell me you got the solution.

575
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,020
I've got it.

576
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,030
Go,go,go,go.

577
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,410
**********

578
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,050
Now? Dead. Definitely dead.

579
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,770
Okay,can we keep cell signals blocked
until we get this thing is off?

580
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,020
Done.

581
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,490
- Mezzanine clear?
- Mezzanine clear.

582
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,190
Jules,up in the mezzanine,
Spike's gonna meet you up there.

583
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,130
Copy that.

584
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,030
I don't think so.

585
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,110
- Okay,it's time.
- Okay.

586
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,430
Okay...

587
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,200
Okay.

588
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,900
- All right?
- Yep.

589
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,110
- You're going to take this thing off?
- That's right.

590
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,220
- Where's your gear?
- It's all right here.

591
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,280
No,I mean don't you have a
protective suit or something?

592
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,640
- No,I don't need one.
- Please.

593
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,600
We're going to be just fine.

594
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

595
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,780
Boss,we got the journalist.

596
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,040
He tried to exit the staff door.
One of the uniforms recognized him.

597
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,750
I should have told her.

598
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,700
I'm not here to judge.

599
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,140
I was trying to protect her.

600
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,180
So were we.

601
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,080
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

602
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,710
Thank you.

603
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,090
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Okay.

604
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,420
Thank you.

605
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,490
- Excuse me, Mrs. Graham?
- Yes.

606
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Go ahead. State your name and address.

607
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,170
My name is Claudia Andres.

608
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,580
I live at 267 Cressyoad, in North York.

609
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,980
I am a waitress in this hotel.

610
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,240
I'm really sorry about
what happened tonight.

611
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,920
Mrs.Graham,can you identify this woman?

612
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,480
Her face,her voice?

613
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:27,190
Yes. Yes,I can.

614
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,220
She served us lunch today.

615
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,330
Okay,thank you.

616
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,190
Wordy,let's bring her to the VIP guys.

617
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,690
Get her processed as
a possible accessory.

618
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,750
Copy that.

619
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,270
Catherine,I'm sorry.

620
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,330
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't you... don't you apologize!

621
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:06,320
Sir,they're going to need
a few minutes to debrief.

622
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,110
Right,of course.

623
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,110
- I got to go.
- Okay.

624
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,160
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

625
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,580
Thank you.

626
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,120
8:27 P.M.: incident contained.

627
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,000
Two arrests. VIP secured.

628
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,070
That was a long day.

629
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:42,360
If it's okay with you,
all right,debrief tomorrow.

630
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,610
Yeah.

631
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,560
Sam,Spike...

632
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,310
good job,everybody. Good job.

633
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,290
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

634
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
Date night.

635
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,760
- All right. See you tomorrow.
- All right.

636
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,940
Hey,Jules!

637
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,150
- Hey,it wasn't your fault.
- Yeah,I know.

638
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,700
So,why are you leaving? We got
the truck. I'll take you back.

639
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,360
Can you just take it back to HQ?

640
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,670
I'm really close to my
house. I just want to walk.

641
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,460
- Fine,I'll drive you home.
- Sam!

642
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,150
- What?
- Okay,stop,all right?

643
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,490
I don't need you to be
nice to me right now.

644
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,980
I don't need you to rescue
me or be the big hero.

645
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:51,600
I just... I need a minute alone.

646
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,860
You think I feel sorry for you?

647
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,550
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard. Let's go.

648
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,310
Jules,I'm driving you home.

649
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,760
I promise you don't even need to talk.

650
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,370
No,I just...

651
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,120
Soph?

652
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,170
What are you doing?

653
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,930
Date night. It's a good book.

654
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,820
- You mad?
- No.

655
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,350
- Sure?
- I'm sure.

656
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,710
So,did you save anybody today?

657
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,100
Kinda did. Yeah.

658
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,640
