1
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,617
We got a possible i.e.d.:

2
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,147
<i>batteries, wires, pipe.</i>

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,726
Five...

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,117
Confirming no visible identification.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,996
Four...

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,117
Blocking remote detonators.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,865
Three

8
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:35,017
<i>Gonna try chemical detection
for any nerve agents.</i>

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,895
Two...

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,317
This isn't good.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,217
One...

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,700
Fire in the hole.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,884
I'm dyin' already.

14
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:50,117
Want me write you a note,
get you outta class?

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,217
Could you?
Would you, officer lane?

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,781
<i>Boss, what's the word?</i>

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,817
We gotta guy comin' in for the ac.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,917
Hallelujah! Okay!

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,417
Tomorrow.
Oh, come on. Nice.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,317
Okay, we're gonna hit the briefing room
and then we're gonna patrol

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,678
in air conditioned comfort.

22
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,117
Have I told you recently
how much I really do love you?

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,117
<i>Hello, boys.</i>

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,003
<i>Jules.</i>

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,479
- How do manage to stay so fresh?
- I think cool thoughts.

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,017
<i>Kira, we're gonna hit the streets.</i>

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,300
<i>Team two's gonna hit rexdale.</i>

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,317
Sergeant rangford.

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,917
That's, uh, Mr. Rangford
to you, sir.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,317
Hey, don't call me "sir,"
I work for a living.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,265
- How're you doing, Daniel?
- I'm doing fine.

32
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:28,856
- It's good to see you, Greg.
- Good to see you, too. You look good.

33
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:31,511
What're you doing haunting the barn?
A day like today you should be out

34
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:33,801
- hitting the golf course.
- What are you kiddin' me?

35
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:35,017
You been out there?

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,017
You don't call, you don't write...

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,917
Eddie! How you doin'?

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,105
Fine. Fine.

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,817
- So? How's Sophie and Clark?
- They're good. They're all good. Yeah.

40
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,817
<i>Sru.</i>

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,917
Spike! You still wear the rookie badge?

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,117
Nunh-unh. This is Sam Braddock. 

43
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,517
- He's new but he's trying.
- Good to meet you. I'm Danny.

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,125
Hot call, team one.
Gear up!

45
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,221
What do we got?

46
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:58,517
Suspicious package.
Train station, south terminal.

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,300
Babycakes, I'm comin'!

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,917
Let's go.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,500
<i>Hey, danny!</i>

50
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,857
Keep the peace, boys.

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,617
- Who called it in?
- <i>A security guard.</i>

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,260
He says the suitcase
has been there almost an hour.

53
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:18,517
<i>Copy that.</i>

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,564
We gotta keep that perimeter wide,
we gotta keep it locked down.

55
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,017
- Hey, who was the guy at the station?
- Danny Rangford.

56
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,917
Most decent, honest cop
I ever met in my life.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,850
The guy's a legend,
retired about a year ago.

58
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,117
- He's the guy that brought me into SRU.
- Yeah?

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,112
<i>Yeah. Him and Barney Fletcher.
The two of them.</i>

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,004
They fought to have us trained
in psychology and negotiation.

61
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:40,717
If it wasn't for them,
we'd be straight-up SWAT.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,984
- So he was commander?
- Never made it passed sergeant.

63
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:45,508
Avoided promotion.

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,511
- Why?
- Keeps you in the action.

65
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,548
I thought maybe it was the booze.
You didn't smell it off him?

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,617
- You new?
- Three weeks.

67
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,817
Uh, look, do you know if anyone's using
the briefing room in the next while?

68
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,999
Mm, I don't think so

69
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,921
Team three's going off shift,
team one's out.

70
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:08,117
Good. I just wanna get a few things
in order. Is it okay if I use the room?

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,645
- Go ahead.
- I'm just gonna have a walkabout first.

72
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,317
That okay?
Mm-hmm.

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,954
Strategic response unit.

74
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Okay.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,810
- Morning, sergeant.
- Inspector Stainton. What's the word?

76
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:06,117
We're not liking this.

77
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,017
There's been a spike in terrorist chat
last two weeks.

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,217
Station sees over 200,000
commuters a day.

79
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,217
I'd say it has "hot spot"
written all over it.

80
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,810
Sam, north containment.

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,217
- Lewis, west
- Copy.

82
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,117
Wordy, east

83
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,601
<i>Spike, do your thing</i>

84
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,014
<i>Jules, second the boss.</i>

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,619
Stay connected. We're gonna need
everyone's brain on this one.

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,018
<i>Let's get to know our friend.</i>

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,344
<i>Kira, can I trouble you a sec?</i>

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,617
Mm-hm.

89
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,017
There's a file
I've been meaning to look at.

90
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,117
A file?

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,417
Yeah, it's number 5512,
you'll find it under team four, 1989.

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,617
Okay. What's this in regard to?

93
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,017
Ah... Just getting
a presentation together.

94
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,417
You know. Old boys on a lecture circuit.

95
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,917
<i>Uh, it's probably not on the computer.</i>

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,817
Uh, look, if it's any trouble. I can
always go down to the archives myself.

97
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,667
Oh no, no. It's no trouble. I just need
to clear it with Commander Holleran.

98
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:06,217
Uh... What do you need to do that for?

99
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,617
Oh, I just can't release files
without permission. It's policy.

100
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,417
Uh, well, it's not like
it's a breach of uh... Anyone's privacy.

101
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,517
I mean, it was a case of my own.
I was there.

102
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,517
Sorry, but officially
you're a civilian now, so...

103
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,350
No.

104
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,115
You don't need to do that.

105
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,456
Look.

106
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,703
The old days, one of us at the desk...

107
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,123
We'd have looked the other way.
Hm? Huh?

108
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,758
- Well, I'm sure commander Holleran...
- You're not hearing me.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,719
I didn't come this far...

110
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,301
<i>- Stay quiet, mm?
- But I can just</i>

111
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:52,465
No. Just stay quiet and look down. Hm?

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,646
<i>I need that file.</i>

113
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,690
Do you understand?

114
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,600
Yep.

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,100
Let's go, darlin'.

116
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,723
10:36 am, suspicious suitcase.

117
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:14,123
Constable scarlatti initiating
electronic counter-measures.

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,065
I'll wait here, you go in
and get the file. Fast is good.

119
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,360
Wait.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,180
I'll take that.

121
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,484
Sorry.

122
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,517
Okay, I know the subject, anticipate
the weapon, target the solution.

123
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,117
What kind of person plants a bomb
in a public place?

124
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,117
<i>Organized personality,
not impulsive,</i>

125
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,617
not mentally incompetent...

126
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,317
Emotionally detached,
above-average intelligence...

127
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,217
Access to volatile material,
and familiar with its use.

128
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,517
Yeah, and who wants to strike
the city's transportation hub.

129
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,017
Or just doesn't like tourists.

130
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,633
Okay, everyone, eyes and ears open.
We may be dealing with an individual

131
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:16,013
<i>who likes to hang around
and watch the carnage.</i>

132
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,417
It wasn't supposed to go
this way, you know?

133
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
Wasn't supposed to go this way.

134
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,667
<i>You could've just given it to me.</i>

135
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,516
All I needed to do was, go in the
briefing room, get a little work done,

136
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,652
undisturbed.

137
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,420
I'll make sure you're not interrupted.

138
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:35,769
Maybe you're not trained for this 
at your desk, but where I came from

139
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,465
we're trained to profile people
and here's what I get from you:

140
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:41,271
you're ambitious, you're serious about
your job, you don't wanna be passive,

141
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:42,717
be perceived as the victim.

142
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,017
So here's what you'll do:

143
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,317
I walk into that briefing room, you'll
sound the alarm first chance you get.

144
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,317
I try walking out of here, same problem.

145
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,458
Man with a gun,
making unorthodox demands.

146
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,854
- You see my dilemma? Smile.
- <i>Hey, kira.</i>

147
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,617
<i>Any word on the air conditioning?</i>

148
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,612
Tomorrow.

149
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,178
Sergeant Rangford?

150
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,668
Troy!

151
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,348
- You hear? I made sergeant. Team three.
- Huh.

152
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,659
- So you haunting the old barn?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,844
Sit down. Sit, sit.

154
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,222
Okay, confirming no visible
identification.

155
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,787
Babycakes is sending out a signal
blocking remote detonators.

156
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,424
<i>I'm gonna start with the infrared.</i>

157
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,519
Good news so far.
Nothing unusual in the heat patterns.

158
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,627
<i>Gonna try chemical detection
for any nerve agents, blood agents...</i>

159
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,317
- Sergeant?
- Inspector, anything good?

160
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,217
Some of the people that reported
the case said they smelled hay nearby.

161
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,566
So? Hay...

162
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,217
Moist hay.

163
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,117
One woman said she smelled
freshly cut grass.

164
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,117
Stainton, so what're you sayin'?
That someone stuffed the case with hay?

165
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,877
Boss? Hay and grass aren't the only
things that smell like hay and grass.

166
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,624
Those people that smelled hay
and grass, track them down.

167
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:10,417
They gotta be put under
medical observation immediately!

168
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,017
No physical exertion,
or it'll accelerate the spread.

169
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,517
- Spike, what do think it is?
- <i>Phosgene.</i>

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,969
It could be phosgene.

171
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:19,700
By the time you smell it,
it's already at its lethal level.

172
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,985
<i>So, daniel,</i>

173
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:31,923
You and Michelle finally gonna take

174
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:35,117
that round-the world trip
she kept asking for?

175
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:37,473
Well... Ah, maybe.

176
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,781
- Little hot in that?
- Mmm.

177
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,072
Yeah.

178
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,825
You know what?
No, I-i'm good, I'm good.

179
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:53,817
Anything I can help you with
there, daniel?

180
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,016
I'm fine, Troy. I'm really fine.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,140
I just wanna be left alone, okay?

182
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,581
I don't think that's a good idea.

183
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,534
Stand down. Stay back.

184
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,817
- <i>Stay back.</i>
- <i>Hey! Sergeant?</i>

185
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,155
Keep it cool, guys.
Everything's okay.

186
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,517
Okay, Troy, you're gonna keep your boys
at a distance.

187
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,612
- Sure. Sure, Daniel.
- You know how this works, boys.

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,357
Kira?

189
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,795
Kira, did you try to transmit?

190
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,602
- What's up, jules?
- I don't know.

191
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,300
This is not the way it was supposed
to happen, you know?

192
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,056
- Never is, right?
- No.

193
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,217
Look at me. I'm the subject.

194
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,311
<i>You don't have to be, Daniel.
We can work this out.</i>

195
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:47,604
Sorry, Troy.

196
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,023
Wait, she's sending
something through.

197
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:51,570
<i>Sarge.</i>

198
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,839
Kira?

199
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:57,601
<i>Kira, you copy?</i>

200
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,317
Jules, you're in charge.
Lean on Stainton if you need to.

201
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,017
Eddie, we got a priority call. I need
you, Sam and Wordy to come with me.

202
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,217
<i>Lewis, you cover Spike.</i>

203
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,817
Jules, let's get extra uniforms
and detectives.

204
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,217
Copy that. I'm on it.

205
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,163
Ed, the priority call?
It's at the station.

206
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,929
- Why don't you tell me what's...
- Don't...

207
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,936
Negotiate me.

208
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:25,338
Okay?
Now...

209
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,754
I'm gonna go in here,
i'm gonna shut the door.

210
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:32,491
I'm barricading myself in. You
understand what that means, don't you?

211
00:11:32,574 --> 00:11:33,317
I do.

212
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,217
And you're gonna leave me
to my own devices.

213
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,292
Otherwise, the situation is gonna get
dangerous. You know that, right?

214
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,073
Right.

215
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,858
I want you to consider me
a threat level red.

216
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,763
- You got that?
- I got it, boss.

217
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,048
I'm gonna stop talking now.

218
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,835
Threat level red.
Can you say that for me?

219
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,484
Threat level red.

220
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,119
That's good.
You're doing a good job, Troy.

223
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,117
<i>It's Daniel Rangford. He's armed and has
barricaded himself in the briefing room.</i>

224
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,929
- <i>Boss.</i>
- <i>Talk.</i>

225
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:51,790
- <i>He's got a beretta. 40 cal.</i>
- Panels hold up to that?

226
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:54,200
- Yeah, yeah, they're polycarb.
- So what's he doin' in there?

227
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:57,116
He disabled a security camera. He hasn't
talked since he shut himself in there.

228
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,917
Classified himself a threat level red,
negotiated me like I was a rookie.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,117
Are you surprised?

230
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,987
- Can your team cover the entrances?
- Yeah. We're all we got, though.

231
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,606
Most of my guys already clocked out.

232
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:09,279
Yeah, we're down three. The rest of us
are dealing with the bomb threat.

233
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:11,217
You want me to call my guys back in?

234
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,354
Eddie... Boss.

235
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,998
We keep this in the family.
We can handle it.

236
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,215
Okay, eddie.

237
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,917
Nobody gets in through the front.
Garage access only.

238
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,387
I'm assuming he's closed the blinds,
but we still need eyes in.

239
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,817
So grab some rangefinders,
go outside, double-check.

240
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,703
Copy that

241
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:33,317
Wordy? He's gonna be looking for
the snake, so let's use the fiber cam.

242
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,129
Got it.

243
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:35,508
Auto-transcriptor, boss?

244
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,193
- We don't need it.
- Jules has it anyway.

245
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,863
- It can just be for us, or...
- Or what, Greg?

246
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:46,450
We can decide that
when this thing is over, okay?

247
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,249
All right.

248
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:50,210
Let's use team three's. You set it up.

249
00:13:50,344 --> 00:13:52,219
But call his wife first.
Her name is Michelle.

250
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:54,817
Let's figure out what's been going
on at home lately, okay?

251
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,317
- On it.
- 'kay.

252
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,917
I want you to talk to him.
Okay?

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,465
None of us can stay objective.
But you know him best.

254
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:03,925
Yeah.

255
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,667
All right, good. Kira, walk with me.

256
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,617
- So what do we know about phosgene?
- It's not hard to make and it's nasty.

257
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,717
It could take 24 hours
to show symptoms.

258
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,979
So your victims don't even know
they've been exposed...

259
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,462
Until their lungs stop working.

260
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,468
Okay, well Stainton's
on top of the med reports.

261
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:28,581
I'll tell him to alert his units
for a potential chemical evac order.

262
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,117
<i>Maybe we need to block
incoming trains as well. Anything else?</i>

263
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,613
Get him to broaden the perimeter,
especially downwind.

264
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:35,417
Got it.

265
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,168
Okay, babycakes,
let's take a look inside.

266
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,715
Danny?

267
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,930
What's this I'm hearing about
you being in there with a gun? Huh?

268
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,400
Tellin' Troy it's threat level red?

269
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,171
Danny, come on. Last time we talked
threat level red was code

270
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:02,582
for "there's a wife in the station."

271
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,340
It's just me out here, Danny.
It's Eddie.

272
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,017
Kira, what happened?
He seemed fine when we left.

273
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,617
- I mean, how did he seem to you?
- Calm, at first. Well, sweating a lot.

274
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,117
Yeah, well, we all are, right?

275
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,696
But steady eye contact,
relaxed posture, chatty...

276
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,517
Then, when I wouldn't
get the file for him,

277
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,317
he came off the rails,
like that wasn't the plan.

278
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,917
What do you think the plan was?

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,717
???

280
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,908
Getting the file, preparing
a presentation in the briefing room.

281
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,391
He wanted privacy.

282
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:36,507
Think he wanted to leave
the station with that file?

283
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,710
No, I don't think so.

284
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,414
And he didn't want Holleran alerted?

285
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:40,529
<i>That's right.</i>

286
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,888
Remember anything about the file?

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,717
Name on it was Gehring.
1989.

288
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,017
'89. So there's no computer backup.
Anything about that case?

289
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,817
Just that it was his.
Sorry.

290
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,868
No, no, you did everything right, Kira.
Thank you.

291
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,603
You can go home. You're free to do that.

292
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:56,640
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm a cop too.

293
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,029
Okay. Put on a vest and radio.

294
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,783
Call Harvey Silver.
His name and number's on file.

295
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:06,146
He was on daniel's team,
they retired the same year.

296
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,817
Tell him we need him here
sooner than asap.

297
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,517
- Eddie, how's our friend?
- He's not talking.

298
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,770
<i>I got eyes in.</i>

299
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,271
Fiber optic neutralized.

300
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,517
- Troy, you got eyes outside?
- <i>He's moving.</i>

301
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,450
<i>Looks like he's closing the shutters.</i>

302
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:32,924
Wanna try the ball cam?

303
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:35,013
He's gonna be looking for that.
Let's get thermals.

304
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:36,600
Okay, I got it right here.

305
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,773
Danny?

306
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,277
You sticky my fiber optic camera?

307
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,627
Nice job. What'd you use, duct tape?

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
<i>Forgot how much you liked it low tech.</i>

309
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,439
Remember that corner store barricade?

310
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,758
<i>Day like today. Hotter than hell.</i>
<i>You remember that?</i>

311
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,416
You had me talk to those kids
for an hour and a half, danny.

312
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:08,617
Then you came in, turned up the heat,
20 minutes later, they came running out.

313
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,817
<i>And that was low tech all the way.</i>

314
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,417
- <i>Thought you were on a bomb call, Ed.</i>
- <i>We're on it.</i>

315
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,817
<i>Just came back here
to see what was going on.</i>

316
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,117
I'm not here to negotiate you, Danny.
I just wanna help you figure it out.

317
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,317
All you've done for me over the years?

318
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,517
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Back to your bomb call.</i>

319
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,717
Spike's on it.
Danny, you know the bomb guys!

320
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,704
<i>You know what's good for you,
you stay out of here.</i>

321
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,907
I'm not going anywhere.

322
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,900
<i>I'm gonna stay right here,
long as it takes.</i>

323
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,434
Danny, what're you saying to me?
How long?

324
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,066
Oh, uh... About 14 more ounces.

325
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,570
<i>11:27 am barricaded subject
Daniel Rangford.</i>

326
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,517
<i>Boss, how do you want me
to characterize the subject?</i>

327
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,017
Barricaded.
<i>Leave it at that.</i>

328
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,117
- You talk to his wife?
- <i>Yes. I called her,</i>

329
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,517
I told her husband was at the station,
she got really upset she hung up on me.

330
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,485
SRU!

331
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,917
<i>Boss, come and see this.</i>

332
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,985
... ow!

333
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:12,726
Eddie?

334
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,217
He's shooting at nothing. He's shooting
at a chair. I got thermals.

335
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,417
- <i>On the ground!</i>
- Danny!

336
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,917
On the ground!

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,655
Danny, our weapons are not raised!
We are not here to hurt you.

338
00:18:23,738 --> 00:18:25,717
Down! Down!

339
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,938
Danny, talk to me!

340
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,915
Danny, it's Greg Parker.

341
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,202
<i>What's going on, buddy?
What're you shooting at?</i>

342
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:53,760
What's going on?

343
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:55,606
He's shooting at somebody
who's not there.

344
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:58,917
- Is it an hallucination?
- Yeah, maybe a flashback or something.

345
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,917
- Where's Daniel? I wanna see him!
- Ma'am, I'm sorry!

346
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,786
What the hell is going on, guys?
No one through the front.

347
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:06,617
<i>Ma'am, you cannot go in there.</i>

348
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,417
Sam. Sam, it's okay.
Michelle...

349
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,117
- I wanna see him. Where is he?
- Let's just walk over here for a second

350
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,817
We can talk about it over here.

351
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,117
Where is he? I wanna see him.
You bastard! You bastard!

352
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,168
You did this to him!
All of you! You bastard!

353
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,735
Just calm down.

354
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,660
It's okay, it's okay.

355
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,217
Just go with kira and we'll find
you a place to sit down, okay?

356
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,217
And I promise I will come to you
as soon as I can, okay?

357
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,600
Michelle, let's sit down.
It's gonna be okay.

358
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,018
<i>Boss,</i>take a look.

359
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:49,117
All right, that's enough.
I'm gonna open it up.

360
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,442
He said he was gonna fire

361
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:53,233
You wanna spend the rest of your life
thinking about what we should've done?

362
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,255
Okay. Wordy, cover.
Sam, we're opening up.

363
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,600
<i>'Kay,? Go.</i>

364
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,085
I told you not to come in!

365
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,017
- Let's slow this down, danny.
- Close the damn door!

366
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,295
I'm not gonna be able to do that, dan.

367
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,097
One step closer? We're done.

368
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,917
- Okay.
- Let the subject set the pace, huh?

369
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,817
<i>Don't rush a negotiation.</i>
<i>'Cause I'm not finished here</i>

370
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,217
and I'm gonna get this thing right.
Okay, eddie?

371
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,053
Okay.

372
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,673
Back off.

373
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,734
Boss. I'll go talk to Michelle.

374
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,217
I think he's slowing up, so let's just
keep him on his timetable, okay?</i>

375
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,037
Okay.

376
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,047
Arriving now.

377
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,056
Harvey, I'm Sam, team one.

378
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,429
- Where is he? I wanna see him.
- That's not gonna happen.

379
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:01,157
I gotta talk to him. He'll listen to me.

380
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,588
- Harvey, this isn't a good idea.
- This is, this is garbage.

381
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,864
I can't just stand here.

382
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,799
There's not a guy here who
feels different, 

383
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:09,117
but we just need to streamline
the inputs a little, okay?

384
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,617
Ed lane is with him now.

385
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,800
- Eddie's with him?
- Yeah.

386
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,942
- Okay.
- Okay?

387
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,291
Good. We need your help.

388
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:21,771
We need you to remember everything you
can about the Gehring incident, 1989.

389
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,917
This is not good.
We got a possible I.E.D.

390
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,733
<i>Batteries, wire, pipe...</i>

391
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:42,417
<i>Is that shrapnel?</i>

392
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,617
<i>Could be.
It's not nails or ball bearings</i>

393
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,317
<i>some kind of small objects though.</i>

394
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,712
This thing could be on a timer,
it could be motion-sensitive,

395
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:51,717
- <i>so we're not taking it anywhere.</i>
- We detonate it here, in the square?

396
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,117
<i>Negative.</i>
Detonating will only release more gas.

397
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,217
We do a render-safe
with a water cannon.

398
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,317
Okay.
We gotta disrupt the mechanism.

399
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,213
<i>And turn the phosgene
into hydrochloric acid.</i>

400
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,031
<i>I promise you'll see him
as soon as we know it's safe.</i>

401
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,017
Safe?

402
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,317
Michelle, we need to understand
what he's doing, where he's coming from.

403
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,217
- Can you help us?
- Yeah. 'course I'll help.

404
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,755
<i>Thank you, 'cause I'm...</i>

405
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,617
'cause you're the one
who knows him best.

406
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,043
You think? I know the guy I married.
I remember him.

407
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,782
This guy?

408
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,443
I mean, I was counting the days
'til he retired.

409
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,380
'til he came back to us -

410
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,817
To me and Liam.

411
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,672
Wake up to the world, have a bbq,
put up his feet

412
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,318
Enjoy. Something.

413
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,624
- Didn't work out that way, huh?
- No.

414
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,977
'cause when he took off
the uniform...

415
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,245
It turns out there was
nothing left underneath.

416
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,669
Almost there.

417
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,489
All right, we just gotta get past
the part of him that sticks to a plan.

418
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:08,599
So... Maybe we bypass
the logic brain,

419
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,317
force him to run out of there.

420
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,867
Thinking about tear gas?

421
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,117
The animal instinct in the midbrain
<i>thinks it's drowning, running for air.</i>

422
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,921
- Well, I don't recommend it.
- Why's that, danny?

423
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,217
You'd have to evacuate
the whole building for 3 days,

424
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,953
just to breathe in here...

425
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,817
<i>And 3 weeks with a sanitation crew.</i>

426
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,717
We're not worried
about making messes, danny.

427
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,563
Think it through, boys.
You wanna cripple the SRU?

428
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,950
All on the gamble that I didn't think of
uh, packing a gas mask in this bag?

429
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,985
Does he let you touch him?

430
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,222
No he doesn't.

431
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,479
And I don't mean just in bed.

432
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,105
I try to hold his hand,
he pulls away.

433
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:58,136
The last time he touched me, I woke up
with his hands around my neck

434
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:59,771
and he was screaming at me.

435
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,222
<i>He's been hanging off a cliff
all these years.</i>

436
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,674
He won't talk to me.
Not about work, he never has.

437
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,891
And he won't talk to you
'cause he knows...

438
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,517
You'll shake your heads, "oh, so sad
to see the great guy fall.

439
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,218
What happened to him?
We thought he could hack it?"

440
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:22,382
<i>Then you'll turn your backs,</i>
<i>so that you can keep on pretending</i>

441
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:24,063
that he's the exception.

442
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,555
<i>Michelle, it's gonna be okay. It's okay.</i>

443
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,137
Danny,
we are not playing chess here now.

444
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:44,202
You're thinking about a permanent
solution to a temporary problem.

445
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,417
- I appreciate your faith, ed, but...
- All right, then you gotta appreciate

446
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,417
- Don't interrupt the subject!
- Don't "handbook" me, Danny.

447
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,367
<i>Danny, faith is what you need
when there is no proof.</i>

448
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,717
We don't need faith to know
that you deserve to live.

449
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,517
Oh yeah? That's something you can prove?

450
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,917
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can.

451
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,617
Let's talk about all the people whose
lives were made longer because of you.

452
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,802
Don't start.

453
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,052
The Gehring incident,
it was a home invasion

454
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:15,094
Regent Park, but this little place
was neat as a pin.

455
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:17,573
You know who's keeping house?
A little 18-year-old girl.

456
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:20,351
Parents are both deadbeats,
one's in jail, one's awol...

457
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,446
She's holding it all together, looking
after her little brother and sister.

458
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,231
What happened with the home invasion?

459
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:29,228
By the time we got on-scene, bad guys
had gone, the girl, she'd taken a whack

460
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,717
at one of the guys with a baseball bat,
scared 'em away.

461
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,517
So, team went back out on patrol

462
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,117
and Danny and I stayed behind
to write it up.

463
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,117
That was it?

464
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,217
The little guy, 10-years-old, he wanted
to show us his baseball card collection.

465
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,017
I said "no, we gotta go,"
and Danny said "no, let's stay."

466
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,617
He just bought a fresh pack for his own
son, went out to the truck to get them.

467
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,759
We sat crossed legged
on the floor...

468
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,342
Middle of the afternoon, summer day

469
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,016
Trading baseball cards
with the little guy.

470
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,131
It was good.

471
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,917
You remember this pretty clear
for such a long time ago.

472
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,517
Yeah, well, you would.

473
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,622
Two hours later it wasn't
our file anymore, it was homicide's.

474
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,661
<i>That little girl down by the dock.</i>

475
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,617
You remember her?

476
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,717
<i>She was turning blue,
she could hardly breathe.</i>

477
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,817
<i>You did mouth-to-mouth on her
in the ambulance,</i>

478
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,416
all the way to the hospital.
Buddy, you saved her life.

479
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:28,148
You stayed with her the whole time
and then they called from the hospital

480
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:30,546
To say "congratulations,
she's gonna live."

481
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,608
Danny, you got the silver shield
for that, buddy.

482
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,946
Proudest friggin' 9 seconds
of my career.

483
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,217
<i>'Cause then they give you
the punchline...</i>

484
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,687
Which is something
we don't tell the rookies...

485
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,624
About how the girl was brain damaged
from lack of oxygen.

486
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,726
Oh yeah, she's gonna live
Like a vegetable, shriveling up,

487
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,801
until her family decides
to pull the plug

488
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,745
to put her out of her misery.

489
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,917
Which I gotta say, seems to be
a good idea right about now.

490
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,817
Danny... Danny.

491
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,898
I know you're self-esteeming me
like crazy here, but you know what?

492
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,001
That's the last thing I need right now.
That's the last thing.

493
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,317
- Excuse me.
- Okay, Danny.

494
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,818
All right, let's take a break.

495
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,779
<i>He's almost at the bottom
of that bottle.</i>

496
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:23,540
<i>The more we talk the faster he drinks.</i>

497
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:26,617
Let's just...
Take a little pressure off, okay?

498
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,517
- Boss, i'm not gonna leave him.
- All right, you stay.

499
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,278
You stay, but let him do his thing.

500
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:33,917
I need to find out
what's going on in that file.

501
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,774
Okay.

502
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,793
- We got the homicide file yet?
- Squad car's flying it over.

503
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,317
Give you a deadline?

504
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,417
Yeah, what's left
of his bottle of scotch.

505
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,268
Harvey, what do you remember?

506
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,295
Two victims...
Older sister, younger boy.

507
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,317
Perps got away. Tragic as hell,
but it's nothing we don't see.

508
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,893
Yeah, but why did this one get to him?
What was different about it?

509
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:02,661
- Did you ever talk to him about it?
- I don't know. You know how it goes?

510
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:05,649
- I might've asked him how he was doing?
- And what'd he say?

511
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,039
"I'm fine."

512
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,983
"I'm fine."

513
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:25,305
Inspector, we're getting ready
to cannon the package here.

514
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,802
- No one comes close.
<i>- Perimeter is locked up.</i>

515
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,220
Thanks.

516
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,386
Danny, you thirsty at all in there?

517
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,120
<i>Huh?</i>

518
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,336
Danny? A little water, buddy.

519
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,313
<i>Just gonna roll it in there, okay?</i>
<i>No surprises.</i>

520
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,602
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

521
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,233
Incoming from homicide

522
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,017
Gehring, Jeremy, august 8th 1989.

523
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,000
- August 8th?
- That's today.

524
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,213
- <i>Find out why.</i>
- We got witness tape.

525
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,217
All right, dig out a vcr.
Let's get some answers.

526
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,200
Oh, you gotta be kidding me. It's beta.

527
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,517
Aw, he's almost finished that bottle.
I'm gonna open it up.

528
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,212
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we need more access.

529
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,100
Sam, I need you. Troy, grab your guys.
We're gonna open this up.

530
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,040
<i>What's happening?</i>

531
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:42,930
Michelle, I need you
to stay out of range.

532
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:45,436
I won't hide in there anymore.
He's my husband.

533
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,765
You know what? You're right.

534
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,763
You're right,
I want you to come with me,

535
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:52,900
I want you to hide behind the shields,
and I want you to stay close.

536
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,048
All right, we ready?
We ready? Sam?

537
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,676
Danny, listen to me now.
Danny, danny, don't do it.

538
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:10,317
- <i>Don't do it!</i>
- <i>Danny, put the gun down!</i>

539
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,222
Danny,

540
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,117
Michelle's here.

541
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,894
- <i>Daniel.</i>
- Michelle?

542
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,217
What're you doing? You can't be here?
Get outta here!

543
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,601
- You shouldn't be here!
- I'm not going anywhere, daniel.

544
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:24,780
- Get her out of here!
- <i>I'm not going anywhere!</i>

545
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:28,217
- Don't make me do this in front of her!
- Danny, just listen to me now.

546
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,484
Get her out, get her out of here!

547
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:31,817
Danny, put that gun down.

548
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,036
We're not leaving you, Danny!
We're not leaving you.

549
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,792
Come on!

550
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,317
In five...

551
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,317
<i>Four...</i>

552
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,317
Three...

553
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,317
<i>Two...</i>

554
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,156
One.

555
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,685
Fire in the hole.

556
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,982
Hold fire.
Hold fire.

557
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,519
- Daniel! Please!
- <i>Michelle, he's not gonna hurt me.</i>

558
00:31:00,602 --> 00:31:02,247
He's not gonna hurt me. Are you, Danny?

559
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,917
I'm crossing the line.
You think I won't do it?

560
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,217
<i>Cardinal rule.</i>

561
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,506
Gun's pointed at an officer. Hmm?!

562
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,114
Sometimes you gotta break the rules,
Danny. Remember?

563
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,375
Remember who taught me that?

564
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,525
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

565
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,379
- I have the solution.
- Wordy, dammit, go.

566
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,010
Hey.

567
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,598
Hey, hey, hey, hey-hey.
No-no-no, it's okay.

568
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,685
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

569
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,180
You know what you gotta do?

570
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:40,189
You gotta keep safe.

571
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,176
You ever seen this before?
Do you have any idea?

572
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:48,387
No. You gotta hide.

573
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,711
<i>It starts here.</i>

574
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,921
<i>I didn't want jeremy to find it.</i>

575
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,928
He told me to stay under the bed.
So I didn't see them.

576
00:31:59,726 --> 00:32:01,617
<i>But do you think
they might've been the same...</i>

577
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,695
<i>The same men that had come before?</i>

578
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,407
Don't know why they came back

579
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,263
'cause he said we'd be okay.

580
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,852
- Who said you'd be okay, petra?
- The policeman with the baseball cards.

581
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,735
<i>He said...
He said we'd be okay. Then he went away.</i>

582
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,517
<i>But he didn't know
that they'd come back, petra.</i>

583
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,913
But maybe he did.

584
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,885
Because... Because he told Jeremy.

585
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,624
<i>What do you mean "he told jeremy"?</i>

586
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,452
He said, "you know what you gotta do?

587
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,457
You gotta be brave
and show your sisters."

588
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,686
<i>And so Jeremy wanted to be brave</i>
<i>so he could save me and my sister.</i>

589
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,668
But it didn't work.

590
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,622
It didn't work.

591
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,572
<i>Boss, we got something.</i>

592
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,463
<i>Home invaders came back,</i>

593
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,036
boy stepped up to protect his sisters,
Daniel and his team were done,

594
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,517
daniel didn't do anything wrong,
it was something he told the boy.

595
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,608
Yeah. "You know what you gotta do?
You gotta hide."

596
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:17,953
<i>No, that's not what he said. He said,
"you know what you gotta do?</i>

597
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,373
You gotta show your sisters
you're brave."

598
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:27,452
What was the boy's name?

599
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,066
Jeremy.

600
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,800
Okay, thanks.

601
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,510
You hide, like...

602
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,334
Daniel?

603
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,710
Daniel?

604
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,415
Michelle, you gotta go.

605
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,217
- You can't see this.
- Daniel, I'm not leaving you!

606
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,781
<i>Daniel, let's talk about Jeremy.</i>

607
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,444
<i>Jeremy?</i>

608
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:01,773
The file you wanted.
Guessing it was about Jeremy, right?

609
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,800
'cause today's the day.
Isn't it? August 8th?

610
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,171
It's funny, those days
that stick in our minds.

611
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,592
<i>I'm guessing that jeremy
was a pretty brave kid, but...</i>

612
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,427
I don't know that for sure,
could you help me out with that one?

613
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,534
Daniel?

614
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,066
<i>Danny, you can't do this.</i>

615
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,274
You can't do this without...
Without telling us why!

616
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,927
<i>I know...</i>

617
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,826
<i>I know...</i>

618
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,028
About a kid...

619
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,543
Sitting on the floor.

620
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,100
<i>I went back.</i>

621
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,377
He didn't look any different
from the last time I saw him.

622
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,022
His eyes are open, he's looking at me,

623
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,482
Baseball cards spread around him.

624
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,054
But he's real quiet.
He's real still, and I'm thinking,

625
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,721
<i>"Why is he so still?
Why doesn't he say "hi"?"</i>

626
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:16,195
And then I see it...

627
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,813
An eight-inch screwdriver
buried into his throat.

628
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,317
- And I put it there.
- You didn't put it there, Danny.

629
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,839
- Criminals put it there.
- <i>If I hadn't been called there,</i>

630
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,696
- I wouldn't have said that to him.
- "You gotta be brave for your sisters."

631
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,017
If it wasn't me, he, he would've lived.

632
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,846
You don't know that, buddy.

633
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,432
Danny.

634
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,000
I spent my whole career screwing up.

635
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,117
Being too late, being too... Early,

636
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,207
<i>not saying the right words.</i>

637
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,427
I spent my whole career...

638
00:36:01,484 --> 00:36:02,338
Looking at

639
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:06,792
the worst 20 minutes
of other people's lives

640
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,517
and I can't take it anymore.

641
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,721
Danny, how about remembering
the good stuff?

642
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:12,649
The good stuff,
all the lives you saved,

643
00:36:12,732 --> 00:36:15,681
all the people whose lives were made
better, their lives were made longer

644
00:36:15,764 --> 00:36:17,639
because you were there
for those 20 minutes.

645
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,400
I can't remember. You see?
I can't remember. I can't remember!

646
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,430
All I see are the ghosts.

647
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,852
<i>All I got are the ghosts, the ghosts,</i>

648
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,444
and I can't take it any more.

649
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,321
- <i>Daniel!</i>
- Eddie...

650
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,994
<i>Please. Please help me.</i>

651
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:44,576
Pull the plug.

652
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,413
- Pull the plug.
- Okay, Wordy.

653
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,470
<i>Okay?</i>

654
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,642
<i>Danny, this...</i>

655
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,291
This isn't about Jeremy.

656
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,682
These guys think

657
00:37:08,314 --> 00:37:11,858
it's all about him,
but it's more than that. Isn't it?

658
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,312
<i>Jeremy's just...</i>

659
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,516
Who you always think about.
I get it.

660
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,650
I get it.

661
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,267
You know what, buddy?

662
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,150
Every time...

663
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,355
<i>Every time I look out
that damn scope,</i>

664
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:39,677
I see a kid runnin' across,

665
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,381
I see a spray of blood...

666
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,449
And you know what else, danny?

667
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,252
You know what else I see?

668
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,661
<i>All the calls we didn't get to in time.</i>

669
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,242
The mothers that we couldn't talk down

670
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:08,463
The kid who thought it'd be fun
to pull a gun on a cop.

671
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,821
You're not the only one
who sees ghosts, Danny.

672
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,602
I gotta tell ya, I don't know where
to put 'em anymore either.

673
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,173
Eddie, please, no.

674
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,817
You taught me everything I know.

675
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,178
You made me who I am, Danny.

676
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,296
You can't...
You can't tell me...

677
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,252
That this is how it ends.

678
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,703
<i>You can't. Give me the gun.</i>

679
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,123
No...

680
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,250
You'll be okay.

681
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,078
<i>Stand down. Stand down.</i>

682
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,350
- It was harmless.
- He just wanted to keep us busy.

683
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Inspector Stainton,
those witnesses are free to go.

684
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:31,581
Hay and grass.

685
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,328
I'm gonna take you to a place,
a place I've been myself.

686
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,678
And we're gonna get through this.
We're gonna get through this.

687
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,913
* and if I don't make it home
tonight *

688
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,717

689
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,322

690
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,963

00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:50,017

* is love like this always? *

699
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:06,500
* is love like this always? *

700
00:41:09,153 --> 00:41:12,017
I thought we were gonna keep
this one in the the family?

701
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,971
Well, families and secrets,
you know?

702
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,399
I don't think that's
such a good thing.

703
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,217
* there's nothing left
that I won't do *

704
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:32,517
* to make it feel brand new *

705
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:39,217
* so, oh, i'll leave it up to you *

706
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,117
* so, baby, when you tell me
everything's all right *

707
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,917
* but I stay up all night *

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,517
* and baby when you tell me
