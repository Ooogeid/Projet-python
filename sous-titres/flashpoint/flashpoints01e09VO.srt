00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,760
The mind is its own place, and in itself
can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,820
The mind is its own place, and in itself
can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,840
The mind is its own place, and in itself
can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Come on. Pick up the phone.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,970
I swear to God I will kill
her and I will take you down.

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,850
The mind is its own
place, and in itself can...

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,830
- Penny?
- No!

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,190
It's time.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,040
* When the blazing sun is gone *

10
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:42,770
* When he nothing shines upon *

11
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:46,385
* Then you show your little light *

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,279
* Twinkle,twinkle all the night.*

13
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:52,239
Hey, Pips.

14
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:55,093
Check this out.

15
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:58,772
Globular cluster. Messier 3, I think.

16
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:04,863
Who ate the ketchup chips?

17
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:07,070
Must've been the coyotes.

18
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:10,540
Grape juice? Coyotes
drink grape juice, too?

19
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:14,550
Hey, Pips, see if you can find
Saturn. I'm going for more grape juice.

20
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:18,433
For me. Not you, me.

21
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:24,431
* When the traveler in the dark *

22
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:27,880
* Thanks you for your tiny spark *

23
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:31,802
* He could not see which way to go...*

24
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:35,222
That was fast, Dad.

25
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:38,963
Dad? Dad?

26
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:42,171
"Long is the way, and hard,

27
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,950
that out of hell leads up to light."

28
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:54,801
Good morning, Sunshine.

29
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:59,392
You can call me Sunshine
as long you promise to...

30
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:02,440
Ah, yes, letter of application.

31
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:05,852
Basic Tactical Operations course.

32
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:07,633
I'm signing it right now.

33
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:10,321
- Thank you, Sarge.
- My pleasure, Kira.

34
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:16,292
Everything okay?

35
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:19,660
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine. Just...

36
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:22,470
just the way it always is.

37
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:41,210
Gerald?

38
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,621
Hey, babe.

39
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:43,361
Where are you?

40
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,783
Nearly home. How'd you sleep?

41
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:47,612
I didn't. I kept hearing noises.

42
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,270
- But you know you're safe, right?
- I know.

43
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,671
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

44
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:55,182
I've got a surprise for you.

45
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:03,132
- You okay?
- I'm gonna wet my pants.

46
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:07,761
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

47
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,792
She's been missing for 12 hours.

48
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:17,933
Police say she was abducted last night
from a playground in Sault Sainte Marie.

49
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:23,580
Her mother says her back was turned for only
a second, and then, Lilly Deacon vanished.

50
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:26,270
Lilly was wearing a yellow
dress and pink sandals.

51
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:31,771
She has long blonde hair, and has a birthmark
under her chin shaped like a teardrop.

52
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:33,601
Hey, guys.

53
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:36,143
- Hi, restroom?
- Yeah, out back. Hang on.

54
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:39,050
- You need a key. There you go.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,030
Hey, Sarge, Wordy said
you wanted to see me?

56
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:45,250
Hey, Jules, grab a seat, will you?

57
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:47,573
Ooh, that bad?

58
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:50,801
Psych evaluations, you know
they're mandatory, right?

59
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:52,032
Yeah, I do. I just, uh...

60
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:54,983
You just haven't signed up for one yet.

61
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:58,903
Everyone else has done theirs already, and
I wanted to make sure things were copacetic.

62
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,651
Everything's copacetic.

63
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,243
Look. Look at me. I'm
signing up right now.

64
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:05,961
You know it's like this
with you every year, Jules.

65
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:09,430
It's like, uh, nobody likes to do this.

66
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:13,043
I know, they just freak me
out. All those questions.

67
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:15,251
Who do you like better: your mom or dad?

68
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:20,212
You want to garden or paint?
Fly a plane? Jump on a train?

69
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:23,623
They're just questions.
No right or wrong answers.

70
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:26,123
That's the problem:
I like right or wrong.

71
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:28,733
You shoot. There's a target. You hit it.

72
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,611
Bull's-eye. Bam. You go home.

73
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:32,731
That's true. You can be perfect.

74
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:35,801
Scared to make mistakes--
it's going to get in your way.

75
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,581
We're human. We're going
to get things wrong.

76
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:47,453
Hey, great. So pump #2?
That's, uh, $47. 28, please.

77
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:49,891
Hey, who's this? What's your name?

78
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:53,061
Jack. He's a little shy.

79
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,373
Hey, Jack, uh, tell me.

80
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,673
What's your favorite flavor
here: cherry or grape?

81
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:05,521
It's okay. It's on the house.

82
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:09,332
Cherry.

83
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:12,852
Okay, but here comes
the cherry airplane.

84
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:16,951
Up it goes.

85
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:22,242
How about some change?

86
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:25,843
Sure. Sorry about that.

87
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:29,841
And here we go.

88
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:42,881
911?

89
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:46,172
Uh, yeah, um... The-the missing
girl? Lilly, Lilly something?

90
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:48,381
Um, she's here. She's
here at my gas station.

91
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,990
And she's, she's with
a man and he has a gun.

92
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:52,740
Ma'am, are you certain it's the child?

93
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:53,993
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

94
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:57,231
She's wearing boy's clothes, and she
has a birthmark underneath her chin.

95
00:06:57,248 --> 00:07:00,903
Okay, ma'am, I need you to stay calm,
but if you can get a license plate...

96
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:04,082
License plate... License plate.

97
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,173
Team One, gear up.

98
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:09,041
We have a sighting of
missing child Lilly Deacon,

99
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:15,681
traveling in a car license plate:
Romeo 1 Bravo Uniform 4 Hotel 8.

100
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,790
Registered to a Gerald Duglin, 60
Red Brick Lane, East Scarborough.

101
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:48,633
Penny?

102
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,003
You're home.

103
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,593
I told you I was close.

104
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:02,243
Hello?

105
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:11,083
I want you to meet someone.

106
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,380
Surprise.

107
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:24,072
Penny, this is Lilly.

111
00:08:57,128 --> 00:09:00,161
Team One, Child Services have been
notified and they're standing by;

112
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,661
uniform units are en route
to secure the perimeter.

113
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:06,281
Copy that. Advise those
units to use radio code only.

114
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:11,423
Media will be on their scanners, and this girl's
been going through enough without all that.

115
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:14,193
This guy's been driving all night.

116
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:18,232
Lilly Deacon was abducted,
what, 500 miles north of here.

117
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:21,631
You did a beautiful job, Penny.

118
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,393
It's clean, huh?

119
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,150
You could eat off the floor.

120
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,491
Why?

121
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:29,921
Why what?

122
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:34,052
Why is she here? Did I do something?

123
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,153
All right, what's going on?

124
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:44,673
Nothing. My son-- he sent back another
letter, return to sender, big surprise.

125
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:48,641
You've got to see him in person.
Where... He's in Dallas, right?

126
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:52,513
You've got to go there. It doesn't
matter if they slam the door in your face.

127
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,850
Ah, I think I'm done, you know?

128
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:01,991
Lilly...

129
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,962
follow me. Come here.

130
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:10,020
This is really special, okay?

131
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:12,983
You are very important to me.

132
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:15,760
And this is going to help keep you safe.

133
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:23,410
There. Now what do you say?

134
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:29,741
What do you say when
someone gives you a present?

135
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:31,990
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

136
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:32,971
Here's how it works.

137
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:36,420
You get too close to a door or window,
and you're going to feel a little buzz.

138
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:37,600
That's a warning.

139
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:39,812
And what happens if we don't
pay attention to the buzz?

140
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,563
What happens if we go outside the house?

141
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:45,203
You cross the underground wire and the
bracelet electric-shocks you and you die.

142
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:47,543
But you know what?

143
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:50,330
It's better to die than
to get caught by the police

144
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:54,045
'cause you know what happens
if you caught by the police?

145
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,189
They'll hurt you so bad,
you'll wish you were dead.

146
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,369
11:32 a.m. Armed abduction of a child.

147
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:11,910
Subject Gerald Duglin presumed to be
in the residence at 60 Red Brick Lane

148
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:14,590
with the abducted child, Lilly Deacon.

149
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:17,570
This is where we have to stay
until it's safe to go out again.

150
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:18,882
We have no choice.

151
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,413
It's what your parents wanted.

152
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:23,523
It's why they asked
me to bring you here.

153
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:25,472
They didn't.

154
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,231
Yeah, they did.

155
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:32,443
Your dad and I had a long
talk before we left last night.

156
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:35,142
My daddy wasn't there last night.

157
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:38,500
He was in Buffalo with my grandma.

158
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:41,150
We talked on the phone. Come here.

159
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:44,221
First rule of the house.

160
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:47,030
No talk-back.

161
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:54,501
You're probably hungry, huh?
That's good. You know why?

162
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:58,183
'Cause Penny's going
to make us lunch. Penny.

163
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:05,881
Teenager next door confirmed Gerald's
car pulled in ten minutes ago.

164
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:07,282
He didn't notice a child.

165
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:12,403
As far as they know, he has no family, no children,
and he is, quote, "quiet and keeps to himself."

166
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:13,791
Yeah, I'll bet.

167
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:15,070
You see his windows?

168
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:17,403
Every single one frosted, shuttered.

169
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,881
Apparently, he's a contractor.
Built this whole development.

170
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,431
Mug shot.

171
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:28,013
Okay. The guy's got two
priors for sexual assault.

172
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,811
Spent a couple months
in jail a decade ago.

173
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:34,112
And he's got no weapons registered.

174
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,201
Except he's got one.

175
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:37,632
We have to have rules here.

176
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:38,662
Rules keep us safe.

177
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:41,812
It's all really, really simple.

178
00:12:47,785 --> 00:12:51,481
Why don't I show you the
rest of the house? Come on.

179
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,991
- I'll take you upstairs.
- Gerald...

180
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,100
Yes, Penny?

181
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,500
Um, let me show her around.

182
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:05,752
You're making lunch.

183
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:08,253
- I can make it later.
- What?

184
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:11,511
She's tired. She-she
only just got here.

185
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,661
I hear your voice one more time...

186
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:16,381
Please just let me take care of her.

187
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:18,732
Lilly, no!

188
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,040
Lilly!

189
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:26,173
Lilly, come here.

190
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:34,930
She's just scared, Gerald.

191
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,781
Penny, get in the closet.

192
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:38,242
No... Gerald, no.

193
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:39,542
In the closet.

194
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,581
Please, please, she
didn't mean it. Gerald, no!

195
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:46,363
Enough. I've had enough. That's enough,
okay? That's it. I've had enough of you. Okay?

196
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:09,221
The mind is its own place, and in itself
can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.

197
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:17,022
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
show you the rest of house first.

198
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:20,781
We can explore. You
want to see upstairs?

199
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,880
Come on.

200
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:48,623
Come on. Pick up the phone.

201
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,082
Hello?

202
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:57,590
Hello, Mr. Duglin?

203
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,882
This is Sergeant Gregory Parker, with
the Police Strategic Response Unit.

204
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:04,412
Am I speaking with Gerald Duglin?

205
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:11,061
Mr. Duglin, a little girl has been abducted and we
have reason to believe that she's inside your house.

206
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,870
Now if you and the other
occupants can please exit,

207
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:17,483
we can start talking about how you
can safely return Lilly to her parents.

208
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:21,131
If you're interested in her safety,
then you stay out of my house.

209
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:25,831
You step one foot in this house, and I swear
to God I will kill her and I will take you down.

210
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,112
No!

211
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:47,682
It's time. They're here.

212
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:50,061
You know what to do.

213
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,531
I know what to do.

214
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:59,590
Come on. Pick up the phone.

215
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,480
Like we practiced, like I showed you.

216
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:05,870
What's happening?

217
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,031
They've come, okay.

218
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:10,461
- Who's come?
- Don't worry. I'll protect you. Come on.

219
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:11,781
Quick, Penny.

220
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,201
Okay, take that. Take that.

221
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,891
Well, you're staying with us though...

222
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:16,991
We're going to need more ammo, okay?

223
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,701
- We've got more in the basement.I'll be right back.
- No, we don't have any time.

224
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:23,172
Two minutes. I'll be
right back. I promise.

225
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:27,902
Without you, no life. Okay?

226
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:33,910
No. Let me come with you.

227
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:39,112
- No! Gerald! Gerald!
- Please don't leave me!

228
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:40,311
11:43 a.m.

229
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:43,040
First telephone contact
terminated by subject.

230
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:45,683
Threats uttered to
hostage and police units.

231
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:48,062
All right. He's not reestablishing.

232
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,142
Hey, Ed?

233
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,382
Holding in position.

234
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:52,313
I can't reestablish. If you go in...

235
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:54,420
Dangerous for the girl,
but if we don't go in...

236
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:56,880
Dangerous for the girl.

237
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:58,962
Copy that.

238
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,152
Spike, head to white, keep
your eyes on the front.

239
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,973
Copy that.

240
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:17,391
We're in the garage.

241
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:20,303
Help me. Help me tip the table.

242
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,483
Close the door.

243
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:26,712
We can't. He's coming back.

244
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:29,291
How long do we have to stay in here?

245
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,912
As long as it takes.

246
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:40,442
Garage door breached.

247
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,202
Entry clear.

248
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:17,080
Kitchen's clear.

249
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:20,060
Boss, table's set for three.

250
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:21,383
Clear.

251
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,633
Living room's clear.

252
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:26,682
He saw us coming.

253
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:28,722
Sarge.

254
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,633
I'm looking at a box for
an electric dog collar.

255
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:33,522
He might have a containment
around the house.

256
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:34,692
So let's cut the circuit.

257
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,803
First floor clear.

258
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,442
We got something downstairs.

259
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:19,450
We got eyes.

260
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:32,550
Okay, we've got Lilly Deacon with another
young woman, approximately 16 years of age in...

261
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,342
looks like the master bedroom.

262
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:37,053
No sign of Duglin.

263
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:40,341
Let's transmit that to Kira, see
if she can ID that other girl.

264
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,901
Possible accomplice.

265
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,781
Hey, Sam, can you get
another angle of the bedroom?

266
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:46,032
See if Duglin's in there?

267
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:48,691
Copy that.

268
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:55,413
He's not in there, boss.

269
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,952
Boss, Lilly's upstairs, correct?

270
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,852
That's affirmative.

271
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:02,021
Where are you?

272
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:03,742
Basement steps.

273
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,312
- Police Strategic Response Unit!
- Police!

274
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:06,471
- Get down!
- Weapons on the ground!

275
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:10,122
- Hands in the air! Weapons on the ground!
- Let me see your hands!

276
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:16,951
Looks like somebody's been
transcribing a book. By hand.

277
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,502
Paradise Lost.

278
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:23,312
Milton. Adam and Eve
in Paradise. Good stuff.

279
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:26,653
Fire and brimstone,
my dad's kind of book.

280
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,601
How long have you lived here?

281
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:32,051
A long time.

282
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,612
Don't you ever want to go home?

283
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:39,222
Get down.

284
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,743
Guys, she's armed.

285
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,940
Yes, she is. Camera's down.

286
00:20:47,185 --> 00:20:50,271
All right, stand by for immediate
action. Let's get up closer to the house.

287
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:52,583
We're on the move. We're gonna
need two units lead us up.

288
00:20:52,597 --> 00:20:54,412
Eddie, check in. Where are you?

289
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:57,840
Boss, I don't know how he did it,
but he's completely disappeared.

290
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:58,873
We lost him.

291
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:02,472
Go careful. Duglin's not
upstairs. We're on the move.

292
00:21:02,488 --> 00:21:04,100
You heard that, right?

293
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,201
It's like a... like
a scraping sound or...

294
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:09,923
Ed, look at these marks on the floor.

295
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,273
Go, go, go.

296
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:14,762
Sarge, we found a tunnel.

297
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:18,210
We're going in.

298
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:21,323
Okay, you go for it, but keep me posted.

299
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:28,290
Sarge, I think I got
a match on your girl.

300
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:29,403
I'm sending it through now.

301
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:30,651
Rap sheet, any priors?

302
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,553
No, sir, found her in Missing Persons.

303
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,771
Matches an aged-up
picture of Penny Westler.

304
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:35,683
Who?

305
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:40,603
Missing child taken from her own backyard
eight years ago: stranger abduction.

306
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:43,560
- No arrest made.
- Oh, my God.

307
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:46,043
She must be 17 by now.

308
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,661
Okay, team, subject is on foot.

309
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,513
Constables Lane and
Wordsworth are in pursuit.

310
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:06,733
We've got the neighborhood contained.

311
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:09,670
We need to get this under control now.

312
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:14,093
We're in front of the house now.

313
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:16,960
Change of plans: we're
gonna talk this girl down.

314
00:22:17,238 --> 00:22:18,851
Jules, I want you to do it.

315
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:24,012
Oh, Sarge, if you're right, this
girl's been in here, like, eight years.

316
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:27,200
We're dealing with some
serious Stockholm syndrome.

317
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:29,003
She probably doesn't even
know who she is anymore.

318
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:33,791
I know, and my bet, he's conditioned her to
fear the police, and that's why she's firing.

319
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:35,641
Now, you're gonna be fine.

320
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:38,802
This girl has spent eight years
in captivity at the hands of a man.

321
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,361
What she needs now is a female voice.

322
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:43,942
All right, we're starting
at ground zero. I mean, I...

323
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,750
I don't know if I know how to do this.

324
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:48,891
All right, I'm coming in.

325
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:51,013
Okay, wait.

326
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:54,450
Can you help me with the Stockholm?

327
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:57,272
Yeah.

328
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:59,793
Now, the first thing to remember...

329
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:03,430
there will be nothing simple
about her feelings for her captor.

330
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:07,381
Just follow the same rules
as always: connect, respect...

331
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:08,880
Protect. Okay.

332
00:23:08,897 --> 00:23:11,242
Okay, just keep it simple.

333
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:15,921
By now, Penny's got a belief system that has
helped her survive whatever it is she survived,

334
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,670
and it's not your job to tear that down.

335
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,313
It's your job to get these
two girls out of there safely,

336
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:25,072
and I'm gonna stay right here and be your
second inside your ear the whole time, all right?

337
00:23:25,556 --> 00:23:27,003
Copy.

338
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:30,240
Spike, you go with Sam; you cover Jules.

339
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:34,150
Lou, we need to track
down Penny's parents.

340
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:36,820
Get them here fast, but I
need to talk to them first.

341
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:38,862
- Copy.
- Eddie, what's your 20?

342
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,242
We're in a tunnel heading west.

343
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:43,362
Okay, stay on it.

344
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:46,972
Kira, you want to map this out for
us, tell us where the hell we are?

345
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:58,913
He's up ahead. Go, go, go.

346
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:02,040
Hey, girls, my name is Jules.

347
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:05,651
Slow down, Jules. Just
work against the adrenaline.

348
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:10,843
Your names are Penny
and Lilly. Is that right?

349
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:17,053
Well, I'm a police officer,
and I'm here to help you both.

350
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:22,473
You know, I'd really like to open
these doors so that we can speak easier.

351
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:25,372
Is that okay?

352
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:34,732
All right, I'm opening the door, but I promise
you, I'm gonna stay back here, all right?

353
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:39,211
Penny, is that right?

354
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,413
The little girl that you have
with you, her name is Lilly Deacon,

355
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:48,470
and I'm really hoping that we can
return her safely to her mom and dad.

356
00:24:49,628 --> 00:24:52,090
Can we can work that out?
Can you help us out with that?

357
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:54,403
Get away from us!

358
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:57,252
Team status--
everybody.

359
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:58,172
No harm.

360
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:00,240
- No harm, no harm.
- No harm.

361
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:03,642
Sarge?

362
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:05,803
De-escalate,
Jules, de-escalate.

363
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:10,242
Whatever Penny's world was an hour ago, it's
a whole lot more confusing now, so just...

364
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,810
just keep doing what you're
doing. Just stay covered.

365
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:17,220
How do they know my name?

366
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:20,220
Everything they say is a lie.

367
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:31,172
Penny?

368
00:25:31,187 --> 00:25:33,901
I know that you are
very scared right now.

369
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:36,780
I mean, you've got a gun with you.

370
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,932
And guns are always scary.

371
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:44,170
But I... but I really believe
that you don't want to hurt anyone.

372
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:46,890
I really believe that, Penny.

373
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:49,010
So what do you think?

374
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:51,780
What do you think? Can
we get rid of the gun?

375
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:55,302
So that we can talk
without being scared?

376
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,540
Penny, if you and Lilly don't say anything,
how am I gonna know that you're okay?

377
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,423
Leave us alone!

378
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:07,442
Gerald? Gerald! What did you do to him?

379
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:11,533
Okay, okay, okay... Sergeant, I
got Penny's parents on the line.

380
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:12,882
Squad car's got them en route.

381
00:26:12,895 --> 00:26:15,131
Jules, Jules, you're doing
great. That's great news.

382
00:26:15,147 --> 00:26:19,480
She made her first request. She
wants to know about Gerald, okay?

383
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:23,891
So remember, just take your time,
slow it down, and get her to yellow.

384
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:29,290
Penny, I know that you want
Lilly and Gerald to be safe.

385
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:32,561
So you know what... you
know what I'm gonna do?

386
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:39,220
I'm gonna find out for you. I'm gonna
see where he is and how he's doing.

387
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:44,382
'Cause I think the guys I
work with, they might know.

388
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:46,992
Do you want me to ask?

389
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,172
Yeah.

390
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:52,670
Okay.

391
00:26:56,545 --> 00:26:58,731
Guys, any word on Duglin?

392
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:01,833
Guy tapped into some tunnel
system in the basement.

393
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,321
Guy knows what he's doing.

394
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:11,752
Kira, we're in a tunnel
with railroad tracks.

395
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,961
Where are we?

396
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,821
Brickworks-- whole subdivision
used to be a brick factory.

397
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,172
Red Brick Lane, Kiln Avenue...

398
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:22,600
What's up ahead?

399
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:24,323
Which way you going?

400
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:26,582
Still heading west.

401
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,623
Westbound, tunnel ends in a warehouse.

402
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,903
You're gonna have to go up a level.

403
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:34,340
Where is he?

404
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:36,430
Where is he?

405
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:52,620
Mrs. Westler, Mr. Westler, I'm
Greg Parker. We spoke on the phone.

406
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:53,993
Where is she?

407
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:58,572
She's in that house, but we need
to be incredibly patient here.

408
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:00,923
We haven't seen our
daughter in eight years.

409
00:28:00,937 --> 00:28:02,582
You can't imagine...

410
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:08,743
I understand, but Penny's exit from that
house has to be on her terms, at her pace.

411
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:12,763
If she's rushed in any way, she
may freeze up, she may escalate.

412
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:18,021
The only way we can get your daughter out of
there safely is if we help her choose to come out.

413
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:21,480
She seems nice.

414
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:23,021
Why can't we just go?

415
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:24,792
Because...

416
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:28,693
they'll capture us, and
what happens after that is...

417
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,422
What? What?

418
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:34,882
It's complicated.

419
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:37,063
Have you heard of Anne Frank?

420
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:41,603
She was a little girl who lived
with her family in an attic for years

421
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:46,803
waiting for it to be safe to go outside
because bad people were in charge,

422
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:51,433
and they sent police in to drag
people away to barbwire prisons.

423
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:54,151
It was just like hell, but on earth.

424
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:59,201
Like devils and fire and people burning?

425
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:00,833
Exactly.

426
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:03,493
So that's just like now.

427
00:29:03,786 --> 00:29:08,680
So we have to be brave and wait
for Gerald to come back for us.

428
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:14,532
Penny, I found out about
Gerald. Do you want to hear?

429
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,290
Yeah.

430
00:29:19,336 --> 00:29:23,612
Okay, well, this might sound kind of
funny, but we... we don't know where he is.

431
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:28,003
No. No, you've captured him.

432
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:31,422
You had the house surrounded; we saw it
on the alarm screens; you surrounded us.

433
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,502
I know... I know that this
seems impossible, but he left.

434
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:35,833
No, he wouldn't leave.

435
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,332
Penny, I promise you.

436
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:39,692
There's a tunnel that
leads out of the basement.

437
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:40,992
You're making fun of me?

438
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:42,212
No, I'm not.

439
00:29:42,228 --> 00:29:45,011
Penny, I would not make fun of you.

440
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:46,911
I know that you're waiting
for Gerald to come back.

441
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:48,971
I can tell that you
care a lot about him.

442
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:52,883
"So dear I love him that with him all
deaths I could endure, without him no life."

443
00:29:52,898 --> 00:29:54,821
It's from the book.

444
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:03,472
He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

445
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:06,051
- Penny?
- it's okay.

446
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:09,640
It's gonna be okay...
It's gonna be okay.

447
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:10,791
I want to go home.

448
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:14,102
No, no, no, no.

449
00:30:14,118 --> 00:30:15,661
I want to see my mommy and daddy.

450
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:17,803
No, they sent you here to be safe.

451
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:19,973
No, they... they didn't.

452
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:22,380
He made that up.

453
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,650
I'm going home.

454
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:27,060
No, Lilly, what are you doing?

455
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:30,560
I want to go home... now.

456
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,493
Sarge, Lilly wants to come out.

457
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:45,093
No, you can't walk out there.

458
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:46,923
They're going to send you to prison.

459
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:50,510
Lilly, we're not going to hurt
you, I'm promise you on my life.

460
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:52,363
We're not going to hurt you.

461
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:53,521
Lilly, you can't walk out there.

462
00:30:53,536 --> 00:30:56,112
Lilly, your mom and
dad-- they're on a plane.

463
00:30:56,127 --> 00:30:59,941
They're coming in from Sault Sainte
Marie. They're so excited to see you.

464
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:01,972
- I'm going home.
- Lilly!

465
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:04,280
I won't let them take you away!

466
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:12,233
What's going on, guys?

467
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:13,803
Penny's holding her gun on Lilly.

468
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:15,413
She thinks Lilly's going into a trap.

469
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:16,443
Jules, I don't have eyes in.

470
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:19,002
This is your call, but if
Penny is threatening Lilly...

471
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:21,921
She's not going to hurt her.

472
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,012
Jules, stand down.

473
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:30,450
The little girl's the priority. Sam?

474
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:31,312
I have it.

475
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:33,061
She's not going to hurt her.

476
00:31:33,078 --> 00:31:34,950
Lilly? Stay here.

477
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:39,031
Penny, we're not going to take Lilly
anywhere, unless she chooses to go.

478
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:40,202
There is no choice.

479
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:41,632
That's what the book says.

480
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:43,852
Okay, I didn't read that book, Penny.

481
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:47,340
But this what I know about choice. Okay?

482
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:50,513
Gerald made a choice today.
He chose to leave you.

483
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:55,041
And Lilly-- Lilly's making a choice.
She wants to see her mom and dad.

484
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:58,103
And you made an amazing choice.

485
00:31:58,118 --> 00:31:59,391
The most amazing choice.

486
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:04,392
Because you just met this little girl, and you're
protecting her, and not everybody would do that.

487
00:32:05,787 --> 00:32:10,343
Penny, please, let her choose.

488
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:15,172
Please.

489
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:19,043
She's not going to hurt her.

490
00:32:19,677 --> 00:32:23,213
Lilly? Don't go outside! You'll
cross the underground wire...

491
00:32:23,228 --> 00:32:26,770
Penny, she's going to
be fine. We cut the wire.

492
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,820
Why don't you look for yourself.

493
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:32,861
Why don't you look
out the window, Penny.

494
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:37,581
Sam, hold off.

495
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:39,661
Lilly?

496
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:42,351
I have the solution.

497
00:32:52,285 --> 00:32:58,350
Lilly, it's okay. Okay, right down the stairs, okay?
There you go. That's great. Good, good. All right?

498
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:01,753
Right over here, okay?

499
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:04,131
You're going to be okay.

500
00:33:05,726 --> 00:33:07,703
You're going to be fine.

501
00:33:19,437 --> 00:33:21,361
Ed.

502
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:24,271
That's a revolver, right?

503
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:27,132
Six in a chamber, that's number three.

504
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:29,221
Four.

505
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:32,350
Five.

506
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:35,502
Where's six? Where's six? Where's six?

507
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:45,942
Penny! Penny! Oh, my God.

508
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,283
You got it?

509
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,631
I got it.

510
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:59,072
Gerald, it's over.

511
00:34:02,026 --> 00:34:05,460
Just put the gun down
and come down those steps.

512
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,573
Hands in the air. Hands
where we can see 'em.

513
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:10,833
Stop! Okay? Just stop.

514
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:12,840
All right, it's up to you.

515
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:15,343
Just put the gun down and come
down or we will come in there.

516
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:17,662
You have five seconds.

517
00:34:17,678 --> 00:34:19,280
You don't understand.

518
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:21,210
No one does.

519
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,252
Explain it to me, Gerald.

520
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:26,051
This isn't what I wanted.

521
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:29,170
Yeah? What did you want?

522
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:32,100
To be happy.

523
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:33,891
Just like anybody else.

524
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,851
You're not like everybody else, Gerald.

525
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:40,602
Put the gun down.

526
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:43,860
I can't.

527
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:47,180
Without her no life.

528
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,071
There's six.

529
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:02,411
- Jules...
- It's okay.

530
00:35:03,157 --> 00:35:04,842
Penny.

531
00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:09,980
Thank you for letting Lilly choose.

532
00:35:11,018 --> 00:35:14,283
He said I'd die if I left the house.

533
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:17,112
Penny...

534
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:19,570
No. No! You have him.

535
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:20,710
We don't. We don't.

536
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:23,081
You have him and he isn't coming back!

537
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:24,312
We don't. We do not have him.

538
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,602
No! Without him no life!

539
00:35:26,615 --> 00:35:30,211
Okay, Penny. Penny, please. Please.

540
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:31,992
Two minutes.

541
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:33,460
That's what he said.

542
00:35:33,477 --> 00:35:35,762
He said two minutes. He promised.

543
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:38,143
He said he was coming back.

544
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:43,551
It's not true, is it?

545
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:45,341
He isn't coming back, is he?

546
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:47,001
Sarge, she's got her gun on Jules.

547
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,911
Jules, you gotta control this thing.

548
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:50,151
I have the solution.

549
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,750
Copy that, Sam. Your
call. It's your call.

550
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:54,850
No. Please.

551
00:35:55,595 --> 00:35:59,082
Sarge, you gotta let me do
this. She's going to be okay.

552
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:05,931
Okay, Penny, I want to help you go home.

553
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:11,400
I want to help you remember
the girl that you used to be.

554
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:15,911
Good thinking, Jules. I'll get the
mother on it. Feed her memories.

555
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,491
Sarah, I need you to
tell us about your child.

556
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:23,251
Any time that she felt joy or safe
or loved or thrilled or anything.

557
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:25,471
I remember the snowstorm in the country.

558
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:27,720
We were walking, uh,
trying to get to the house.

559
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:29,441
There was a snowstorm.

560
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:31,300
You and your parents.

561
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,883
And then we lost her.
Remember we couldn't find her?

562
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:35,741
And my heart was pounding.

563
00:36:35,757 --> 00:36:39,381
Only for a minute they-they couldn't
see you because of all the snow.

564
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,623
Yeah, and then we did.

565
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:42,850
We scooped up Pips,
and we took her home.

566
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,931
And you got to stay up late.

567
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:46,623
Do you remember that?

568
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:48,101
And they gave you three desserts.

569
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:49,533
Oh, mosquito netting.

570
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:51,561
She used to have it over
her bed like a canopy.

571
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:53,020
A canopy that was like a tent.

572
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:55,361
And there were all these
stuffed animals underneath.

573
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:58,510
The telescope she got when she turned nine--
it's still there; it's still in her room.

574
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:02,081
Man, I wanted a telescope
so bad when I was a kid.

575
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,773
Saturn.

576
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:07,890
I don't even know where
that is, but I guess you do.

577
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,350
'Cause that's what
your parents are saying.

578
00:37:13,637 --> 00:37:16,282
They're right outside, Penny.

579
00:37:16,296 --> 00:37:19,472
They're right outside.
They're waiting for you.

580
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:25,301
Come on, Pips. Come on.

581
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,891
Come on, Pips.

582
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:33,911
Pip... Pip-squeak?

583
00:37:36,517 --> 00:37:40,483
- That's what that means, right?
- Yes. That's what that means.

584
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:46,780
I know you're really scared,
Penny. I know. I totally understand.

585
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:50,971
But outside-- that
great big world--

586
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:54,890
it's even prettier than
the one in your room.

587
00:37:58,425 --> 00:38:03,631
It's your choice. It's
your choice. It's up to you.

588
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:10,741
Yes?

589
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:17,121
Yeah. Okay. You're safe.

590
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:21,112
They're outside.

591
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:26,492
They're right outside.

592
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:45,461
On her time. Her time.

593
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:17,533
Let her come to you.

594
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:53,621
Julianna Callaghan, you made me proud.

595
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:55,830
Yeah, and I wasn't even perfect.

596
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:57,640
No, you weren't.

597
00:39:57,658 --> 00:40:00,101
You were human. That's
what those girls needed.

598
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:02,982
That's what they both
needed to get out safe.

599
00:40:02,998 --> 00:40:05,643
Screwing up and being human.

600
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,540
My biggest fear.

601
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:11,513
Copy that. Look what happened.

602
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:15,412
Planets aligned. It
was a good day. Right?

603
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,960
You coming for a drink? I'm buying.

604
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:20,833
Nah. Actually, I'm
going to go do something.

605
00:40:21,445 --> 00:40:22,641
But I'll see you Monday?

606
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:26,701
Yeah. Yep. Right.

607
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:37,922
Your e-ticket and credit card.

608
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:40,183
Better hurry. It's the last flight.

609
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:44,030
Dallas. Long way to go for two days.

610
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:48,351
Not as long as it took me to do this.

611
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,632
This one's for focus, right?

612
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:16,703
Yeah. Yeah, that's for focus.

613
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,761
Dad.

614
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:37,183
The stars--
they're still there.
