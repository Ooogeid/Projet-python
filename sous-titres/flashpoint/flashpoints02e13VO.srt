1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,980
I told you what I had to do.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,030
Derek, I know where you
are. Wee coming there now.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,190
Stay away.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,550
Alpha team on our way.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,500
Bravo on two. East stairs.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,200
You got to trust yourself,
derek. You don't want to do this.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,490
No, I don'T. But I have to.

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,050
No way. It's not goingppo haen.

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,560
If you guys want to do this, you're
going to have to go through me.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,780
{a6}<i>******</i>

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,370
All right, bring it. See what you got.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,660
Go ahead, go pass. What
you got? Oh, the fake!

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,250
What you got?

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,220
Oh, nice one! Schooled me.
Good job. That was good.

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,120
Okay, nash and shaq, all right.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,390
My dinner's getting cold,
but good teamwork, guys.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,210
Derek.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,550
Mattie, how many times I got to tell you to
lock the door behind you when you get home.

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,490
mattie, come on, volume, please.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,950
Hope you're hungry. I stopped at
burger shed, picked you up sdoublepicy.

21
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,130
Oh, gee, derek, thanks,
man. My favorite.

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,560
I mean, I know you had classes all day.

23
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,300
And you gotta work at the hospital in
a few hours-- but, hey, thanks, man.

24
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,110
You can have some fries, but you
got to finish your salad first.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,530
- And then I want to see some homework.
- I'm not hungry.

26
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,850
Not hungry?

27
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,920
You okay?

28
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,610
What's wrong? You sick?

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,420
- Mattie, what happened?
- Nothing.

30
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,450
Whu do yo mean nothing? Don't
tell me nothing! What happened?

31
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,140
Nothing. It was an accident.

32
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,850
Mattie, talk to me.

33
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,960
Come on, it's a bullet wound.

34
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,940
I know a bullet wound when I see one.

35
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,740
- got to get you to the hospital.
- No, I can't go to the hospital. If the cops find out...

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,520
if you don't go to the hospital, this
could open up and you'll bleed to death.

37
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,750
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- We're going.

38
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,300
All right, hold on.

39
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,570
Tug man, move your ass.

40
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,470
- It's shane, it's shane. It's shane.
- What?

41
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,290
Go, go, go, go.

42
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,680
- What floor you say he's at?
- Eight I think.

43
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,560
- You think?
- I mean, yeah, eight.

44
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,600
All right, come on.

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,170
shane thomas. He shot you.

46
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,750
What the hell you
doing with him, mattie?

47
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,280
With all that we have been through, tell
me you're not running with these guys.

48
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,970
I'm sorry, D. You've been working
so hard and I wanted to ...

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,690
come on, mattie.

50
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,540
When you was my age, you was already
running with the east side crew.

51
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,280
Yes, and look where that got us.

52
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm sorry, all right? It
was an accident, I swR.

53
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,450
Derek, we can't tell
nobody. Derek, please.

54
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,630
I know someone at the hospital
who can help us. All right?

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,200
- I got your back.
- You got my back.

56
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,150
reyou' not doing it right.

57
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,530
I'm doing it how you told me to do it.

58
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,190
No, you're doing it like someone who
didn't listen to how I told him to do it.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,380
- Okay.
- Communication, repetition, affirmation.

60
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,540
The secret to every great marriage.

61
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,200
boss, we up for a
drink tonight, or what?

62
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,820
I can'T. I got to finish this
article-- critical incidence newsletter.

63
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,570
Who says greg parker doesn't
know how to have a good time.

64
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,820
Spike.

65
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,610
I don't get it. I gave her a new gyro
just last week. I thought we were good.

66
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,360
Maybe it's not you, maybe it's her.

67
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,560
- Officer callaghan, how you doing?
- You really want to know?

68
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,090
Well, unless the answer is
"outstanding," not really.

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,420
I get it. I mean, eight gun calls,
two warrants a day-- it's exhausting.

70
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,020
- what?
- It's been a long week.

71
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,020
Copy that.

72
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,260
- But it's what we do though, right?
- Yep.

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,450
- He's gone, man.
- I can see that.

74
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,030
Looks like you tagged him pretty good.

75
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,800
Obviously not good enough.

76
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,880
Yo, give me some of that.

77
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,170
Man, it's a spicy burger. You
don't even eat spicy burgers.

78
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,750
- Don't tell me I don't eat...
- y'all shut up? God!

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,760
Yo, I say we wait for him here, man.

80
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,920
Whatever. Shane what do you want to do?

81
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,690
It ain't about what I
want. The kid's a loose end.

82
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,310
Yeah, the kid's a loose end. So?

83
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,380
So we chill. Wait for him to come home.

84
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,800
We're going to him.

85
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,710
It's okay. Come on.

86
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,880
You all right, buddy? Hold
on. Let's go find trudy.

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,570
- Trudy.
- Hey, you're early.

88
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,170
Trudy, listen...

89
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,970
are you mattie? Your brother
talks about you all the time.

90
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,130
Listen, I need a favor.

91
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong?

92
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,380
Can you just look at my
little brother, please?

93
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,410
But I need you to keep
it quiet. He's been shot.

94
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,290
What?

95
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,700
He was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

96
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,550
D, what's going on?

97
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,350
Can we just fix him up
and get him out of here?

98
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,640
Gunshots have to be reported.

99
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,210
Tru, I can't do that.
You know how it works.

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,100
You said you were done with all that.

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,830
He didn't do anything.

102
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,930
It's okay. Look, I just
need you to trust me.

103
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,170
He's my little brother.

104
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,480
I can't have social services
take him away from me.

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,060
Please.

106
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,450
This needs sutures. We need a doctor.

107
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,910
- Can't do that.
- Derek...

108
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,790
hey, I will make it up to you big time.

109
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,650
Supply room in e wing.

110
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,670
Get me some butterfly
bandages and some saline.

111
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,920
- We're going to have to flush it out.
- Okay.

112
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,070
Just don't let anybody see you, okay?

113
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,740
Oh, don't worry.

114
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,140
Be back, okay?

115
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,450
Make it up to you big time?

116
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,450
Quiet.

117
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,070
ttie ma, get the hell out of here!

118
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,270
matt! trudy!

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,760
Can we get some help here please? Help!

120
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,040
Tru, tru... tru, I'm so sorry. Tru.

121
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

122
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,290
- Get some pressure dressing.
- Got it, got it.

123
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,470
Let's clear trauma one now.

124
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,830
Sir, sir, give us some room.
We've got some work to do here.

125
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,900
Code red. Code red. O.R.

126
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,260
Mattie!

127
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,830
team one, hot call. Shots
fired. Saint patrick's hospital.

128
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,380
Once staff member
down-- criticalonditi.

129
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,570
Active shooter at large.

133
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,120
Jules, you spent a lot of time
here after you got shot. You goah?

134
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,920
Ye, kind of hoping not to
see this place again so soon.

135
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
Uncontrolled entrances,
hundreds of rooms.

136
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Pete, we've got a major
containment challenge here,

137
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,710
and we need all the
extra uniforms we can get.

138
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,070
Metro's sending everyone they
have. Calling people off shift.

139
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,860
Good. Put team four on alert.

140
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,550
And let's reach out to our
neighbors in york and durham regions,

141
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,730
see if they can spare any
brothers and sisters in blue.

142
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,210
- Copy.
- What do you got?

143
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,580
Hospital's in partial lockdown.

144
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,350
Uniforms are checking
people coming in and out.

145
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,720
Not all the entrance points have
been covered yet. Not enough bodies.

146
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,870
Reinforcements on their way.

147
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,400
How long since our
shooter's been active?

148
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,670
They said 12 minutes of quiet.

149
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,030
Quiet is good. We like quiet.

150
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,590
Jules, talk to any contacts
you might have in there.

151
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,420
- We need more intel here.
- Got it.

152
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,970
Pete, you got the name of
the nurse that got shot?

153
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
- Trudy vargas.
- I know her.

154
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,770
Okay, let's see what
kind of shape she's in.

155
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,000
Maybe she can tell us what happened.

156
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,520
I understand, but there are
armed men in my emergency room

157
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,100
getting in the way of patients who
need treatment. Now who's in charge?

158
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,520
I am.

159
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,900
Sergeant greg parker with the sru.

160
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,380
- Dr. Redfield.
- Hi, doctor.

161
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,640
We need to set up a command post.

162
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,790
Okay, you can do that in the admit office.
It's just through the E.R. I'll take U.

163
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,580
Thank you. How's trudy vargas doing?

164
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,860
We're stabilizing her. She's
going to or in a few minutes.

165
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,280
It would help us if we
could have word with her.

166
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,960
Don't get in the way,
don't stay too long.

167
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,050
That's her right there.

168
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,520
We tried to contain the panic, but...

169
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,080
but gunshots are loud, word gets around.

170
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,010
What if we evacuate the hospital?

171
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,260
400 patients? Ten in surgery as
we speak, another dozen in icu.

172
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,810
Now one of my best nurses
is out commission. No way.

173
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,110
What if we put the patients in a
secured area with lockable doors?

174
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
Sounds like a plan.

175
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,700
You'll need to close shop for a while.

176
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,940
Already rerouting calls to the mount,
but they're at capacity as it is.

177
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,490
I set up a triage area in the west
parking lot for more critical cases.

178
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,810
I know it's not ideal.

179
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,220
City hospital, sarge. It's never ideal.

180
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,850
- Through there to the right.
- Thank you, doctor.

181
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,250
All right, good luck. Excuse
me. I got to get back to my team.

182
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,510
Kinda reminds me of you.

183
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,840
- Really?
- A little bit.

184
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,070
Shane, man, five-o's all over
the place, man. We should bail.

185
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,230
- Give me your nine.
- My nine? But there's cops...

186
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,330
man, give it to him.

187
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,830
I know the kid saw what you did, but...

188
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,420
what I did? What I did?

189
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,600
You better believe anyone
finds out, we're all going down.

190
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,230
What, you think mattie's
gonna go to the cops?

191
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,750
The cops? I don't care anything
about the damn cops, all right?

192
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,490
Those...

193
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,460
we need to silence that
kid, you understand me?

194
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,050
We need to do it now
before he talks to anyone.

195
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,210
You think he talked to his brother?

196
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,410
Well, if he did, then, uh...

197
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,650
we gotta take care of him, too.

198
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,920
You got a better idea?

199
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,000
All right then.

200
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,790
- hector!
- Mattie, you okay?

201
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,270
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right. We gotta get outta here.

202
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,900
There's too many cops. We can'T.

203
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,540
Okay. Uh, upstairs.

204
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,380
5:17 P.M. Establishing command post.

205
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,170
Single shot fired, gunman
at large, but gone to ground.

206
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,290
We got a central building, four wings.

207
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Ten floors, 16 stairwells.

208
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,280
North wing, most vulnerable
patients: Icu and maternity.

209
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,870
- Lewis, wordy, you guys cover icu.
- Copy.

210
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,560
Sam and I'll go take maternity,
work our way downwards.

211
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,720
Clear each floor till
we flush the subject out.

212
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,410
Leave a uniform sentry behind each secured area
after we've cleared it, okay, so it stays that way.

213
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,100
Spike, any visuals on our shooter?

214
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,120
Sorry, boss. Limited camera coverage.
He must have been in a blind spot.

215
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,820
Okay, that's not a lot
to go on here, gentlemen,

216
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,730
so let's make the priority anyone not
wearing a hospital gown or a unifo, ok?

217
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,160
- Let's get this guy while he's still quiet.
- Copy that.

218
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,100
There. That should hold for now, anyway.

219
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,170
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know yet!

220
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,060
Mattie, what the hell is shane
and his boys after you for?

221
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,370
I'm tired of this! What did you do?

222
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,570
- Nothin'.
- Nothing?

223
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,440
Put these on. We gotta blend.

224
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,100
These are girls.

225
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,800
You worried about the clothes?

226
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,020
They're trying to kill you, and
you're worried about the clothes?

227
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,680
And they shot my friend who
was just trying to help us!

228
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,210
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

229
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,860
Look, mattie, you need
to start talking to me.

230
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,510
What's going on?

231
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,170
Shane wouldn't be coming at you like
this unless it was something serious.

232
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,570
I di't steal anything!

233
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,080
I didn't do anything.

234
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,710
You saw something, didn't you?

235
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,520
Did he pop somebody? Mattie?

236
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

237
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,960
he said he's gonna kill me.

238
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,750
He's gonna kill me. He's gonna
kill me. He's gonna kill...

239
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,560
mattie, mattie, mattie, mattie, relax.

240
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,880
He's not gonna kill you.
He's not gonna kill you.

241
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,840
Look, look, I'm not gonna
let that happen, okay?

242
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,600
Little brother, I'm not gonna
let that happen to you, okay?

243
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,890
- Okay.
- All right? Okay.

244
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,190
Excuse me.

245
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,830
- You can't be in here right now.
- I know. This is only gonna take a minute, though.

246
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,670
It's very important, okay?

247
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,560
Okay. Okay.

248
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,580
Hey, julianna.

249
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,240
Hey, trulianna. How you doing?

250
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,500
- You're back?
- Yeah. Wearing the cool pants this time.

251
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,740
Can you tell me what happened?

252
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,280
There was yelling. A-a fight.

253
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,290
Okay, did you see who was it was?

254
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,080
Derek. Is he okay?

255
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,770
- Who's derek?
- Medeiros.

256
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,060
He's a, he's a night
orderly. Is he okay?

257
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,940
- Tell me he's okay.
- You're gonna be okay.

258
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,710
Please.

259
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,410
- Did you get that?
- Yeah, copy.

260
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,720
- Boss, maternity's secure.
- Copy that.

261
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,280
Derek medeiros, he's has a record: B and e,
vandalism, all from a couple of years ago.

262
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,190
Anything violent?

263
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,970
Not that he was arrested for, but it says
here he was affiliated with the eastside crew.

264
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,260
If this guy's eastside, he probably
did a lot worse than he got busted for.

265
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,170
Gangbangers don't usually work
the night shift ospi a htal.

266
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,350
Sounds like he got out of the life.

267
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,120
If he did, he's one of the few.

268
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,680
Once you're in, they make it real
hard for you to get out in one piece.

269
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,800
Yeah, I hear you, lou, but we have to consider
him armed and dangerous until we know more.

270
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,040
If this is some kind of gang payback,
we got more than one party at play here.

271
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,120
Got a picture here of derek.
From the employee file.

272
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,850
Sending it out.

273
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,520
- We'll be moving her to surgery now.
- Okay.

274
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,300
Trudy, do you know if
this was a gang fight?

275
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,730
He brought his little brother matt in.

276
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,300
It was a gunshot.

277
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,310
He wanted me to keep it quiet. But...

278
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,120
he's been, he's been taking
care of matt since his mom died.

279
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,610
He's been, he's been
turning himself around.

280
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,640
- Is he in trouble?
- We're gonna do everything we can.

281
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,320
- Please, please, julianna. Keep him safe.
- All right.

282
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,840
sounds like maybe the little
brother is the gang conneioN.

283
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,090
Peter, anything on him?

284
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,780
No juvie file on a matt medeiros.

285
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,420
Looks like he's never been picked up.

286
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,550
Okay, team, let's
assume multiple subjects.

287
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,120
Peter, you focus on the brothers.

288
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,430
Let's find out if anyone
has a beef against them.

289
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,570
Okay, hold on a sec. Boss,
there's a call asking about trudy.

290
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,100
Nurse at the front desk says
it sounds like derek's voice.

291
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,690
Okay. Line two.

292
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,840
- Ready?
- Yeah.

293
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,940
- Is this derek?
- Yeah.

294
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,030
Hey, derek, my name is
sergeant greg parker.

295
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,350
I'm with the police
strategic response unit.

296
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,680
- You wanted to know about trudy?
- Yeah.

297
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,970
Uh, how is she?

298
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,470
She's doing okay. They're
taking good care of her.

299
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,250
Did you see who shot her?

300
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,350
Okay, can you tell me this.

301
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,810
Was it the same person
who shot your brother?

302
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,250
Eah.

303
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,270
Okay, how many guys we
talking about, derek?

304
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,190
Three.

305
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,690
And is matt still with you?

306
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,850
- Yeah, he is.
- Who is that, the cops?

307
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,370
And you guys are still
inside the hospital?

308
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,080
- Yeah, we are.
- We can't go op the cS.

309
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,250
Great, derek, okay.

310
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,670
I know you're trying
to protect your brother,

311
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,910
but if someone's after him, you'll
both be safer with us, buddy.

312
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,000
You just think about this: Your
brother's injured, he needs treatment.

313
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,700
You tell me where you are, we'll get him out
of there safely, give him the help he needs.

314
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,370
You can come to us?

315
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,570
You, you promised.

316
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,590
You bet, buddy, right away.

317
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,450
North wing, fourth floor supply room.

318
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,650
That's it, I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead!

319
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,190
Mattie, what are you doing?

320
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,910
Okay, guys, north wing, fourth floor
supply room. Let's bring him in.

321
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,330
Copyalpha team on the move. Bravo?

322
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,490
Closing in.

323
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,810
Matt! Hey, where do
you think you're going?

324
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm not going to the cops!

325
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,700
Listen, I got to get you to
a doctor and get you safe.

326
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,360
Come on.

327
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,640
Run. Run!

328
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,500
Don't stop! Don't stop!

329
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,590
Run! Keep running!

330
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,730
Gunshots reported in
geriatrics, third floor.

331
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,300
Jules?

332
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,130
Bravo moving.

333
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,000
on my way.

334
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,660
Shane, this is crazy!

335
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,160
Medeiros, man, you shouldn't
have got yourself involved.

336
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,270
This had nothing to do with you!

337
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,870
Listen, listen, you
don't have to do this!

338
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,760
You think I want this?

339
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,870
It ain't nothing personal, man,
it's just... it's him or me!

340
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,320
And it ain't gonna be
me, man, that's all!

341
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,790
Come on, shane, listen,
nobody has to die, man, okay?

342
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,080
Let's just chill! Let's talk about this!

343
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,510
All right, let's talk.
Go ahead. I'm listening.

344
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,570
No joy.

345
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,650
My brother, he didn't
see anything, okay?

346
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,380
He wasn't there. You've got my word.

347
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,720
Man, I want to believe you.

348
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,360
But when his boys start asking, how I
know mattie won't crack under the pressure?

349
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,680
When whose boys start asking?

350
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,480
T-T.J.'S.

351
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,870
T.J.? You saw shane pop
T.J.From the dragons?

352
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,010
Oh, mattie!

353
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,810
Talk and he knows he's a dead man!

354
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,090
Second floor! Let's go.

355
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,590
Eddie, what the hell was that?

356
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,350
- Police! Freeze!
- Come on, man, let's go!

357
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,000
Put the gun down! Stay where
you are! Put the gun down!

358
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,530
come on, man, let's go!

359
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,330
Sam, get the fire.

360
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,430
Wordy, lewis, take the door.

361
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Right there, let's see some hands!

362
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,830
Let's see some hands.

363
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,530
- I got matt.
- What about derek?

364
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,850
Negative. He's still out there.

365
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,230
6:31 pm, fire from explosion contained.

366
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,460
Four armed subjects still at large.

367
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,720
One subject in custody.

368
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,060
- Subject's headed to ward six.
- On my way.

369
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,500
Freeze! Police! Get your
hands up! Get your hands up!

370
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,870
Get down! Hands against
the wall! Hands on the wall!

371
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,630
Lou.

372
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,930
I got it. I got it.

373
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,950
subject contained.

374
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,730
Gun's out. Your pants
sliding a little bit?

375
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,300
Let me get that for you.

376
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,740
yeah, don't mention it. Come on.

377
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,340
Lou, wordy, good job.

378
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,620
Sam, jules, two subjects west corridor.

379
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,440
- Wordy, east.
- On it.

380
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,080
- Get him down to the boss.
- Copy that.

381
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,970
- Wordy, I'll catch up.
- Copy, lou.

382
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,640
Boss, we're bringing down two subjects.

383
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,580
Eddie, stay with the kid. See if
you can get anything out of him.

384
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,490
I'm on it.

385
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,780
It's mattie, right? I'm ed.
Let's get you somewhere safe.

386
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,900
- getting any deja vu?
- Yeah. Mostly the smell.

387
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,240
Spring blossom meets
industrial disinfectant.

388
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,650
You in that hospital
gown and bunny slippers.

389
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,070
Panda slippers.

390
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,130
Couple hundred times around these
floors, you leaning on my arm.

391
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,900
Yeah. You did always like me
best when I needed you, huh?

392
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,830
Come on. Everyone needs to be needed.

393
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,100
Gives you something to shoot for.

394
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,660
- Ward five clear.
- Copy.

395
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,340
Very impressive, matt.
It's very impressive.

396
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,410
How many guys after you?
Three? You're what, 14?

397
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,000
You want to tell me why
they want to shoot you?

398
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,450
I spent a lot of time
on the street, matt.

399
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,300
They want to keep you quiet.

400
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,950
I get why you don't want
to talk to me. I get that.

401
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,530
It's just, I'm worried
about your brother.

402
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,990
Name's theo watts. Street name tug.

403
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,600
Works as muscle for a meth
dealer named shane thomas.

404
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,080
What crew they run with?

405
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,590
Oh, they're independent.
They're trying to make a name.

406
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,620
That's not good.

407
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,910
Okay, spike. Keep talking to the guns
and gangs guy. Get peter on it, too.

408
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,480
Any red flags they might
pull for today, today.

409
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,560
- Copy.
- Okay.

410
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,630
Mr. Watts. How you doing? Okay?

411
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,190
My officer said...before
he arrested you,

412
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,910
he said that you reached behind
you, the back of your pants.

413
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,690
Now, I can interpret that two ways.

414
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,660
One, you were hitching-- you
were hitching your pants up.

415
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,240
Or you were drawing the concealed
weapon you had back there.

416
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,630
Now, wearing big baggy pants,
that's not a serious offense,

417
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,770
but drawing a gun on one of
my officers, that really is.

418
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,100
I wasn't going to draw on anybody.

419
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,830
Tell me why you shot
a kid earlier today.

420
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,360
- Man, I didn't shoot no one.
- No? 'Cause somebody did.

421
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:43,130
And now here you are, running around
with a gun, shooting at that same kid.

422
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,690
You trying to finish the job?

423
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,640
- Shane shoot him?
- I don't know. Go ask him.

424
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,020
No, son, I'm asking you.

425
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,690
Robocops, man!

426
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,700
- Yo, what is that, aks they're carrying out there?
- Calm the hell down.

427
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,180
No, man! They can shoot through
walls with that stuff, man!

428
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,430
Yo, yo, I'm out of here, man.

429
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,140
Come on, remo, you know I
can't let you do that, man!

430
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Look, I already shot three people today, so I'm
kind of running out of things to lose. You feel me?

431
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,310
So I need you to stop and think about what it is
you're really trying to say to me right now, bro.

432
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,390
You know I got yck, r baman. Always.

433
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,210
- What about t, man?
- What about him?

434
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,950
He still hasn't called,
man. What if he got busted?

435
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,450
Then he better know how to
keep his damn mouth shut.

436
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,420
All right. We need to split
up. Might find them faster.

437
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,000
No, man.

438
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,100
You see them, you holler at me.

439
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,600
Yo, shane, you got my piece, man.

440
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,930
It's nothing to do with him.
Derek didn't do anything.

441
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,020
So, it's just the two
of you guys, right?

442
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,650
Yeah.

443
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,380
Since our moms got killed.

444
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,880
I'm sorry to hear that, matt.

445
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,130
But you guys are doing okay, right?

446
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,140
I mean, your brother's got a job.

447
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,600
And he is trying to look out for you, but
right now, he's in danger of getting shot.

448
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,640
Matt, of getting shot. Okay?

449
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,570
And if you can just tell me
what happened, I can help.

450
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,070
It doesn't matter.

451
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,600
Me and my brother are dead.

452
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,910
If it's not today, it's tomorrow.

453
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,690
That's the way it is.

454
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,050
You cops can't do nothing about it.

455
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,680
Let's go.

456
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,570
Boss, got something from the guns
and gangs unit. Could be relevant.

457
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,110
Yeah. Go ahead, peter.

458
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,040
42 division found a bo about an
hour ago ided as one john chen.

459
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,530
Aka tj chen, riverside dragons.

460
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,830
Oh, yeah? I'm guessing
it wasn't natural causes.

461
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,900
That's right. Single
gunshot to the head.

462
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,730
Body was in an alley off queen and pape.

463
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,670
Okay. Copy that, eddie?

464
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,310
Officer. I need you to stay
here with this young man.

465
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,340
I need you to get a doctorooto
lk at him immediately.

466
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,520
Mattie, I'm going to be
back to get you, all right?

467
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,220
Tj chen's head of the dragons.

468
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,270
They run the meth trade,
broadview to woodbine.

469
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,510
So, if shane and his crew were trying to do
business down there, they'd have some friction.

470
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,510
Yeah, but taking out tj's
asking for serious payback.

471
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,100
The dragons find out it's shane,
he won't live to see the weekend.

472
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,710
Unless there weren't any witnesses.

473
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,300
Or the witnesses disappeared.

474
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,310
And we're sure this relates to tj?

475
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,260
I don't know. Let's find out.

476
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,190
Okay.

477
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,070
Mr. Watts. A couple more questions.

478
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,360
Whatever, man. I ain't talking.

479
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,980
Right. I get it. Okay.

480
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:13,450
I thought you might know something
about a body they found today-- tj chen.

481
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,100
I don't know nothing about
that. So, I can't speak on it.

482
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,780
Okay, so you don't mind
if we double-check that?

483
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,110
Spike, let's get a picture of mr.
Watts here down to guns and gangs.

484
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,050
Have them pass it around, see if anybody
recognizes him from the neighborhood.

485
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,810
Copy that.

486
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,400
Should probably run it by the
dragons, too, just to make sure.

487
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,450
- Copy.
- Hey, hold up.

488
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,950
Man, I wasn't there. I swear.

489
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,790
I found out after it all went down.

490
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,530
Okay. It was shane.

491
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,110
And the kid saw him do it.

492
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,300
Get him out of here.

493
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,760
Look, it was that kid's own fault, man.

494
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,970
He wasn't supposed to be
there in the first place.

495
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,210
Let's go talk to the kid, ed.

496
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,850
Sarge, somebody raided a supply
closet, lost a lot of blood.

497
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,630
It's got to be our subject.

498
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,960
Hey, guys. We found derek's locker.

499
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,540
Uh, looks like he was taking
his medical career seriously.

500
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,200
He's making plans.

501
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,250
Got a life ahead of him.

502
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,230
At least, this morning, he did.

503
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,280
Can I have just a second?
Thank you. Hey, matt.

504
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,300
I'm sergeant parker.
You remember ed lane.

505
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,930
Matt, does your brother know
that you saw shane shoot tj?

506
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,390
- It's all right.
- Matt, it's important.

507
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,860
And does your brother know
that you saw tj get shot?

508
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,560
Yeah.

509
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,540
Okay. Okay, good man.

510
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,910
We're going to leave this
officer here to look out for you.

511
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,570
No, you got to let me...
got to find my brother.

512
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,820
Listen to me. Matt, we're
going to find him, all right?

513
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,840
We're going to make sure he
gets safe. That's our job.

514
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,820
- Sergeant parker.
- Hey, doctor. You got time to take care of our friend here?

515
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,400
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

516
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,570
I need the cuffs off to treat him.

517
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,350
Hey, matt, how you feeling?

518
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,480
so, matt saw too much.

519
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,280
Now he's the only thing
linking shane to a murder.

520
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,430
He's got to get to him before
it gets back to the dragons.

521
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,550
So derek's going after
shane to save his brother?

522
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,690
Yeah, his only family. Wouldn't you?

523
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,440
Derek? Greg parker again.

524
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,050
Where's my brother?

525
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,850
He's safe. Doctor's taking care of him.

526
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,300
And I want to keep you safe, too.
We can protect you from shane.

527
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,710
Even if you find him, he'll
be back on the street tomorrow.

528
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,370
No. We're not going to let that happen.

529
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,510
Listen, the system is broken.

530
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,940
Only one way I can make
sure my brother is safe.

531
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,020
Do this, you'll throw away
everything you've done.

532
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,570
I'm sorry. I got to do this.

533
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,480
he's left the life.

534
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,090
But he still won't trust cops.

535
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,440
Matt said their mom got
killed. It's personal.

536
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,200
Spike, let's find out
what happened to their mom.

537
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,170
- Copy.
- We step this up, guys. Okay?

538
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,600
Derek's a good kid. He's worked
hard to get where he's at.

539
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,440
We got to stop him before he crosses
a line we can't pull him back from.

540
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,830
It's over.

541
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,350
N't keep the hospital contained, doctor,
we lose the integrity of the sweep.

542
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,980
All I'm saying is other
ers are at capacity.

543
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,860
They're overwhelmed out there in triage.

544
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,050
We need the building back as soon as
possible or people are going to die.

545
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,150
Okay, doctor.

546
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,920
Guys, I got info on the
boys' mom. Serena medeiros.

547
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,580
Fatally wounded in a
shooting three years ago.

548
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,440
Place called pete's top slice.

549
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,620
- Pete's?
- No wonder he doesn't trust us.

550
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,770
What happened?

551
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,700
One night, a gangbanger named johns walked
into pete's looking for a guy who snitched on M.

552
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,340
He sprayed the whole place.

553
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,140
Six dead including a little girl.

554
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,280
And serena medeiros.

555
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,260
He shouldn't even been on the street.

556
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,890
After the guy snitched on him,
cops busted him. Didn't stick.

557
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,550
24 hours later, he's back on the street.

558
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,640
- North wing's contained. Keep it locked down.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,320
- Police!Don't move!
- Don't move!

560
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,950
Stay where you are!

561
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,440
- Have you been shot?
- No.

562
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,830
Derek do this to you?

563
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,100
- Where'd he go?
- How do I know?

564
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,920
So he just tied you
up and left you here?

565
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,400
Nk acould've capped
me. Just took my phone.

566
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,450
Boss, we've contained another
subject. His name is remo benzina.

567
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,010
Derek's still on the
run. He's got reme.S phon

568
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,460

569
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,090
- what's up?
- Remo's text message. Check it out.

570
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:14,300
The message was sent at 6:42 P.M., And
jules and sam found him at 6:39 P.M.

571
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,250
- He'd already had his phone taken by derek.
- Yeah, yeah.

572
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,670
West basement? Boiler roo west stairs.

573
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,740
I told you what I had to do.

574
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,230
Derek, we know where you are
and we're coming there now.

575
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,810
No, no, no, stay, stay away.

576
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,570
Bravo, alpha team, boiler room.

577
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,710
West-most stairs.

578
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,540
Derek, I know what happened to your mom.

579
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,290
Then you know why I don't trust cops.

580
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,490
I'm not talking to you as a cop.

581
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,930
I'm not talking to you as a
man who wants you to succeed.

582
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,260
And you made a choice
to be somebody different.

583
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,290
Don't quit. Don't quit on that choice.

584
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,300
Don't quit on the guy that you set
out to be, who matt needs you to be,

585
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:07,060
and who your mom would
have been so proud of.

586
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,490
You gotta trust yourself, derek.

587
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,390
You don't want to do this.

588
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,810
No, I don't, but I have to.

589
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,780
Remo.

590
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,530
you ought to know better.

591
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,890
Get down! Get down!

592
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,370
Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down on the ground!

593
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,830
Esm, jul, keep him contained!

594
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,790
Eddie, take that catwalk.

595
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,190
Who's got a 20?

596
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,840
No joy.

597
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,250
Police! Don't move! Don't move!

598
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,710
Police! Freeze!

599
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,080
- Stay down!
- Let's see some hands!

600
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,730
- Hands behind your back!
- Stay down!

601
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,430
Let's see some hands!

602
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,110
Okay. Nice work.

603
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,570
Sam, let's get some medical
personnel down here right away.

604
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,590
Hey, derek.

605
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,070
Mattie, where's mattie?

606
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,310
I need to talk to him.

607
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,750
He's doing okay.

608
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,740
Multiple shots fired, west
boiler room. Sru on scene.

609
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,170
I need help!

610
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,280
officer, I need a hand. Come
over here. I gotta get an iv in.

611
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,150
Here, hold him. Pressure. Don't let go.

612
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,170
You did the right thing.

613
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,090
You took care of your brother
the best way you could.

614
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,250
I just need to talk to him,
let him know I'm all right.

615
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,760
You will. You just stay put. We're
gonna have you taken care of first.

616
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,510
Hey, eddie, let's keep our
friend here inside a cruiser.

617
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,340
- I'm gonna stay here with derek.
- Copy that.

618
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,530
Good man.

619
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,510
Whoa, matt. What are
you doing with that gun?

620
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,780
You shot my brother.

621
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,370
Matt, your brother's gonna be okay.

622
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,170
No, I heard about the
gunshot. You're lying.

623
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,900
No, he's getting fixed up.

624
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,570
I wouldn't lie to you about that.

625
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,980
No, I gotta finish this now.

626
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,930
Matt, this isn't the way to do it.

627
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,180
Yeah, well, you guys ain't gonna do it.

628
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,720
He's going to jail.

629
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,760
Yeah, yeah, like the guy
killed my mom went to jail?

630
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,470
- I hear you, matt.
- You don'T.

631
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,480
You don't know nothin' about that.

632
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,680
You're right, I don'T.

633
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,010
But I do know how it feels when
I see these guys out on the street

634
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,410
who have no right to
be and it makes me mad.

635
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,340
It makes me feel like thing's not safe.

636
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,650
Okay, then! So then you
know why I gotta do it!

637
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,620
I do.I do, but matt, listen,

638
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,940
infive mgoutes a, your brother derek
had the same choice to make, matt,

639
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,870
and he put the gun down. He put it down.

640
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,870
And I know that he would want
you to make the same choice.

641
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,590
You guys made it this far
because you stuck together, matt.

642
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,450
You stuck together. You
looked out for each other.

643
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,070
Now, derek's been there for you, matt.

644
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,650
He's been there for you. Now
you gotta be there for him.

645
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,340
matt, it's okay, matt.

646
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,930
It's okay. It's okay.

647
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,970
It's okay.

648
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,730
we're gonna get through this, matt.

649
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,150
I'm not gonna let you down.

650
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,090
T I'm nogonna punch outat
the end of this shift.

651
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,590
You have nothing to be sorry about.

652
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,910
You have nothing to be sorry about.

653
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:30,660
<font color=#00FFFF>JJ Grey &
Mofro "Sun Is Shining Down"</font>

654
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,450
okay, no way, no way.

655
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,580
I'm tired. I'm going home.

656
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,900
I'm not doing the greg parker
review from hell. Simple as that.

657
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,240
- What the...
- What about the review?

658
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,520
You guys want a review?

659
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,480
How's this?

660
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:41,750
Officers callaghan, braddock performed
admirably in securing assigned areas

661
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,720
and gathering key intel without
any public displays of affection.

662
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,720
Officer scarlatti's skill in
computers and other geeky toys

663
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,760
was augmented today by a
truly spectacular takedown...

664
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,850
Of a dangerous subject.

665
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:03,810
Officer young provided crucial backup and insight
into the psychology of yet another subject.

666
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,820
And officer wordsworth, well,

667
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,030
he's just plain and
simple the toughest sob

668
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,420
I have ever had the
privilege to command.

669
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,100
Thank you.

670
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:21,150
And that leaves uswith officer
ed lane, who, truth be told,

671
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,620
has always been a bit of
a problem for team one...

672
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,400
let's have it.

673
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:30,710
'Cause when everybody's
struggling, he's pushing through.

674
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,890
When everyone's lost, he finds our way.

675
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,670
And when we falter, he picks us up.

676
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:43,060
The problem is is after he's done
all that, who picks him up, right?

677
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,240
You saved that kid today, eddie.

678
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:54,220
At one time or another, you've
saved every person in this room.

679
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,040
Yep.

680
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:02,770
So, today is ed lane's fifth
anniversary as team leader.

681
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,570
All right!

682
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,590
- cheers to that.
- Cheers.

683
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,160
Five more years.

684
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,860
Yeah, finally shut him up.
