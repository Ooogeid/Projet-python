00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,950
dad,please,you d't have...

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,980
go on. You say one more word. Just one.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,000
okay,if this is what you want...

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,670
I work for the strachan
family in rosedale.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,070
They have a son.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,460
He's going to kill mr.
Strachan. He's got a gun.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,960
oh,my god,rolland,what have we done?

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,460
This is the police
strategic response unit.

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,470
Everyone in the strachan house
needs to stay where they are.

10
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,320
Clear on your count.

11
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:49,266
Three,two,one.

12
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:52,935
three,two,one.

13
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,867
<i>2 hours earlier</i>

14
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:17,801
comfy there,samo?

15
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:19,783
I'm very comfortable,sir.

16
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:21,050
Get you some more coffee?

17
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:23,390
All good,sir,but thank you for asking.

18
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:25,541
What are you doing here,anyway?

19
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:27,321
'Cause you just had to bring it up?

20
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:31,051
Well,constable callaghan,that
would be because yesterday I got...

21
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:35,412
Tightest grouping at both long range
and short range firearm practice.

22
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:39,540
Meaning you get to do monthly
cleanup,and I get to do this.

23
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:41,681
- Missed a spot there,ed.
- Yeah,whatever.

24
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:44,693
Actually,what I meant
is,why are you down here?

25
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:50,211
Why aren't you upstairs training,you
know,at something dangerous and exciting?

26
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,970
Sam,everything okay?

27
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:58,160
Yeah,I... I just gotta go do something.

28
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,393
<i>Final Homecoming for Three Heroes</i>

29
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,323
Wake up,boy.

30
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:16,631
Rj?

31
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:20,801
Hello?

32
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:22,863
Jay,it's braddock.

33
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,910
Sam,the hell time is it?

34
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:26,923
0600,soldier.

35
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:28,560
You out of special forces now or what?

36
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,151
No,no,uh... in-between tours.

37
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,642
Back to the sand in a week. You?

38
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:35,140
Police force.

39
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:36,781
Got tired of working for a living,huh?

40
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:39,440
Yeah,I guess.

41
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:42,572
So,dave haverlik... you hear?

42
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:47,413
anyways,figure I'll go
up on the highway tonight.

43
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:48,411
You will?

44
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:49,631
Died in the field,didn't he?

45
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,083
He wasn't in the field; he was at camp.

46
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:53,182
They hit the camp?

47
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:56,103
Come on,man. You gonna make me say it?

48
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,892
All right,chris geordie found him.

49
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,372
Own sidearm and everything.

50
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:03,170
I just know I ain't going up there.

51
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,753
Just like we said,right?

52
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,102
Right.

53
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,690
What are you talking
about? Where up north?

54
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:17,163
It's a surprise.

55
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:21,041
What are you so up about?
What do you have in there?

56
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:23,283
Uh,you know,a little fun and games.

57
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,700
I guess it's me that gets to
tell them your travel plans.

58
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,671
No,man.

59
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:29,872
Why do you think I'm here?

60
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm getting you out of
here. You're coming with me.

61
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:35,471
Where,up north? Why... why
would I want to do that?

62
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:41,043
Are you serious?

63
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:42,701
Don't forget your bank card.

64
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,000
The units canceled mine.

65
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,772
Dude,no. I just got
my acceptance letters.

66
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,033
- U of t,mcgill,yale...
- yale?

67
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,800
- Wow,what,you get into harvard,too?
- No.

68
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:54,261
Dummy.

69
00:04:54,275 --> 00:05:00,050
Yeah,'cause nothing says "scholastic achievement" like
the baden-highsmith military academy for young men.

70
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:05,902
Yeah,well,bh and I decided to reassess
our educational relationship yesterday.

71
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:09,102
You had one year,rj. One
year,and you were home free.

72
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:10,741
Have to toughen you up,obviously.

73
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:11,781
So,you gonna do what
your big brother says?

74
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,163
- You gonna come with me?
- No.

75
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:14,733
No? Oh,okay,well,sure.

76
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:18,080
That's the way you feel,but why are
you hitting yourself there,buddy?

77
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:20,221
- It's okay,don't beat yourself up.
- Rolland?

78
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,473
What are you doing here?

79
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:25,210
Hey,ma.

80
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:26,913
Rj,you can't be here.

81
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,260
He doesn't know.

82
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,483
I don't care.

83
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,773
Hilary? What are you doing out there?

84
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:36,682
Well,he's up now.

85
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:39,261
Margarite will set you
a place for breakfast.

86
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:42,941
I'm not sitting down with
you and him for breakfast.

87
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,733
There's no way.

88
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:54,121
So,uh,maybe later we can all
go for a walk in the ravine.

89
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,323
I mean,we haven't done that in
forever. Or maybe we could...

90
00:05:57,338 --> 00:06:00,601
why,I'm fine,dad. And how are you?

91
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:03,362
Could we please not do this,just once?

92
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:08,222
What I am doing is exerting every ounce of
self-control I have not to ask the obvious question.

93
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,410
Oh,well,the answer is,uh,no.

94
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:14,042
Your tie doesn't make your ass look fat.

95
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:16,033
You idiot.

96
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:17,401
This is what I mean.

97
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:22,340
You contemptible,ungrateful,
stupid,vicious idiot.

98
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:25,412
oh,it's funny,is it? You think
it's funny? Well,then,laugh at this.

99
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:28,811
Fully taxable,non-refundable.

100
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:33,702
$36,000 we spent to send you to that place,
and if you think you are gonna drop out,

101
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:38,730
then you will pay us back every
single penny,do you understand?

102
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:45,390
- do you understand?
- no.

103
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:48,661
No,you don't understand?
Even you can't be that stupid.

104
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,531
No,I'm not gonna pay you back
because I never wanted to go there.

105
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,610
Rolland,where else could you go?

106
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:56,691
They were going to press
charges for the fire...

107
00:06:56,715 --> 00:07:00,461
so,then,let them press
charges. Or don'T.

108
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:04,210
Protect the precious
strachan family name.

109
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,341
Do what you feel. Send me a
postcard. I'll be in the yukon.

110
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:08,610
Who do we know in the yukon?

111
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,232
Oh,hilary,shut up.

112
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:14,531
Simon's coming with me. He's the only
reason I'm still here. Right,simon?

113
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:17,521
No. Simon is going to a real school.

114
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:20,023
Simon is going to do
what's expected of him.

115
00:07:20,036 --> 00:07:23,250
Because he is not a liar and
a stupid fool and a coward.

116
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,250
Dad,please,you don't have to...

117
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:30,201
go on. You say one more word. Just one.

118
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:46,930
Okay,if this is what
you want... here it is.

Rj,look at me.

123
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,770
You think i won't do this.

124
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:29,563
You don't think I'll do this?

125
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:32,351
If you had the guts,I might be afraid.

126
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:35,252
Rj. Rj,look at me. Rj!

127
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:37,153
You are so far in over your head.

128
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:40,090
You have no idea what
you're doing,do you?

129
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,542
I work for the strachan
family in rosedale.

130
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:51,932
They have a son.

131
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,753
He's going to kill mr.
Strachan. He's got a gun. Hurry.

132
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:10,620
So,I saw the paper. Is
that guy from your team?

133
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,460
Brave guys.

134
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,510
Did I miss something?

135
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:20,283
He wasn't brave. He did it himself.

136
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,080
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,290
Were you close?

138
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:29,080
Spend enough time,
think you know someone...

139
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:32,882
and you had no idea,huh?

140
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:35,872
Sam,I'm just trying to help.

141
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,553
So,you gonna go to the highway
and watch the procession?

142
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:43,793
- No.
- No? Don't you usually go?

143
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:49,960
On our team,the only thing protecting
you is each other,so we made a deal.

144
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:54,546
You give up like that,you don't
mean anything to us anymore.

145
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,855
Team one,team one,hot call,gear up!

146
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,317
Sam,if you want to talk after...

147
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,442
take your truck?

148
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:04,180
Absolutely.

149
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,321
Team leader,talk back.

150
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,123
Go ahead,boss.

151
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:17,921
Stealth approach,low prof E.
Absolutely no noise,you copy?

152
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,903
We copy,boss.

153
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,552
Okay,rj.

154
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:23,233
Okay,it's you and me.

155
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,362
- We can work this out together.
- Yeah,how?

156
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,580
Yeah,simon,please,
come on,tell us all how.

157
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:30,450
Okay,rj.You're gonna give me
the gun,we're gonna put it back,

158
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:32,491
and then you're going back to bh.

159
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,682
No,I can't go back.

160
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:35,400
It's only for a few more
months,you can hand it.

161
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,301
No,I mean,I can't
go back-- ask mom.

162
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:39,080
Oh,well,what a surprise.

163
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,440
Dad,shut up!

164
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,281
Rj,you can trust me,okay?

165
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:46,010
Whatever it is,we can do this.
Please,just give me the gun.

166
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,733
oh,dear lord,no. Now
look what you've done.

167
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,903
Rj,it's okay.

168
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:56,050
This is it.

169
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:58,510
What's he doing?

170
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,560
So much for the stealth approach.

171
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:12,960
Sru on the scene.

172
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:14,051
Speak to you for a second?

173
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:15,493
Yes,sir,there's an armed teenager...

174
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:17,802
I assume you're new on the job.

175
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:18,462
Yes,sir.

176
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:23,580
Here's today's lesson: Armed and barricaded subjects
tend to get freaked out by sirens and flashing lights.

177
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:24,972
You get me?

178
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:27,050
- I'll turn the lights off.
- All right,move your car.

179
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:28,171
I'll move my car.

180
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,882
Sam,take the back entrance.

181
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:33,710
Rolland strachan.

182
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,910
Recognize the name?

183
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,630
Crown V. Porter,trial of the century?

184
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,402
Right,right. The defense attorney.

185
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:41,741
Right,hence the mansion.

186
00:11:41,756 --> 00:11:45,221
Well,the family was loaded
from way back. Gold mines.

187
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,450
Anything you don't know?

188
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:48,053
Okay,that's it. I've had enough of this.

189
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,013
- Dad!
- Rolland!

190
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:52,610
Your great-grandfather carried
that gun across the chilkoot pass.

191
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:54,841
Your grandfather wore it on juno beach.

192
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:57,491
Does that mean anything to you at all?

193
00:11:57,506 --> 00:12:00,031
It means that that gun was
meant to be used by a man,

194
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,362
which is why you can't
do anything with it!

195
00:12:02,395 --> 00:12:04,900
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Simon,listen to me. Get out of the way!

196
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:07,002
No! Simon!

197
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:10,041
shot fired. Sam,you
cover that back entrance.

198
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:15,523
Team will attempt phone contact,
but be ready for immediate entry.

199
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,982
no more.

200
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,902
Rj,no! What are you
doing? Get out of the way!

201
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:24,603
Wait,we can fix this! Okay?

202
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:33,203
team,you have eyes on subject?

203
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,070
Negative.

204
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:38,833
All right,prepare for entry.

205
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:47,041
Oh,my god,rolland!

206
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,821
This is the police
strategic response unit.

207
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:53,140
Everybody in the strachan house
needs to stay where they are!

208
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:54,802
Clear on your count.

209
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:57,830
Three,two,one.

210
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:11,860
I've got action here,smoke
bombs! I need backup here.

211
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:15,843
I'm blind. I repeat. I need
backup. I'm completely smoked out.

212
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,243
stop! Police!

213
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:42,701
Team,subject's in the ravine.

214
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:45,470
Looks like we've got a manhunt.

215
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:49,411
Wordy,containment?

216
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:53,122
Can't really block off a ravine,but we've
got all the bordering roads contained,

217
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:57,201
checkpoints at every exit,uniforms
are already out beating the bush.

218
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:58,360
All right,good.

219
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:00,823
We've got a few dozen hikers,
bikers and family strollers.

220
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:04,282
Let's clear them out,keep them safe in case
our subject decides to do something stupid.

221
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:06,241
Spike,how's the new toy?

222
00:14:06,255 --> 00:14:07,752
Acoustic detector's good to go.

223
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,803
He fires anywhere within
earshot,we've got him.

224
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:10,762
- Excellent.
- Yeah.

225
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:12,602
Wordy,I want you inhe hummer.

226
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:16,190
The rest of us,we will be heading
into the bush,diamond formation.

227
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:18,080
One dog per unit.

228
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:21,450
Let's keep to the grid.
Let's clear it quad by quad.

229
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:24,963
keep in touch with the
cp and the other uniforms.

230
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,890
Boss,how's the infrared coming?

231
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,961
Chopper arrive?

232
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:29,580
Yeah,it's messing up my hair.

233
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:30,561
Better you than me.

234
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:33,130
Infrared,two minutes away,eddie.

235
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:34,303
Outstanding.

236
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:37,023
Yeah,well,let's not forget
our subject's 18 years old,

237
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:39,081
emotionally distraught and afraid.

238
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:41,810
He may be armed,but he isn't rambo.

239
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:45,802
Let's see if we can bring him back
to his family in one piece,okay?

240
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,443
I'll try,boss.

241
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,813
But those smoke bombs
were pretty clever.

242
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,481
This guy's from around
here. He knows the area.

243
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,601
All right,infrared coming at you.

244
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:57,361
Gentlemen and lady...

245
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,493
this is our forward looking infrared.

246
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:06,501
Every dot is a heat signature,every
heat signature could be our subject.

247
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:09,160
Don't suppose they have an armed
18 year old filter for that thing?

248
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:12,093
'Fraid not. Quad by quad.

249
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,203
hey,doc.

250
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:20,121
What do you know about the
baden-highsmith academy for young men.

251
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,980
The military school? Not
much. Your shooter from there?

252
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:24,852
Yeah,he was expelled recently.

253
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:26,802
A fight with another
kid,the mother's saying.

254
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:28,372
Expelled just for a fight?

255
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:31,820
You know,I was wondering the same thing,
too. The parents aren't talking a lot.

256
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:33,310
Preliminary profile?

257
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:39,491
Pretty textbook: Well-to-do family,
successful parents... one sibling.

258
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,782
He's got a history of antisocial
acts begining in adolescence:

259
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:47,881
Fights,petty theft,and,uh,last year he was
accused of starting a fire at his private school.

260
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,142
Steady escalation.

261
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:53,241
You want to know,is this kid just a danger
to himself,his family,or everybody else,too?

262
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:55,633
I love it when you read my mind.

263
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:57,893
- Just call when you know.
- Okay.

264
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:02,612
- If we could just go over what happened,mr. Strachan.
- No.

265
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:08,890
Remember who you are.

266
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,722
Infrared's up and running.

267
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:24,573
I'm headed east along the
main road by the ravine.

268
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,291
What's your problem?

269
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:28,972
Woods. My people don't like them.

270
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:32,091
Your people? From woodbridge?

271
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:33,631
No,romans.

272
00:16:33,646 --> 00:16:37,463
Few times we fought in the forest
against the huns didn't go so good,okay?

273
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:41,640
Team one,I've got two sigs
northeast of your position.

274
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:49,682
Heads up,25 meters and closing.

275
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:55,060
20 meters. 18 meters... 17...

276
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:59,562
sixteen. 15,they're right on you.

277
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:08,431
Wordy,we've got two
more negatives. Jules.

278
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:12,372
All right,girls. Come
on,time to go home.

279
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:14,961
Dozen more hot spots out
there. Keep at it,guys.

280
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:19,492
Mrs. Strachan. My mom's exhausted.
I can tell you everything.

281
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:23,062
My dad was sitting right there.

282
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:27,110
He was showing us our great-grandfather's
old gun-- it's a family heirloom.

283
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,050
I know you're supposed
to check if it's loaded.

284
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:33,151
I guess they didn't,and my
brother took it,it just went off.

285
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:35,701
I mean,thank god it only
hit my dad in the arm.

286
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:37,472
It was really just an accident.

287
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:40,963
All right,well,if it was just an
accident,how come your brother took off?

288
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:45,893
Uh,well... my brother's
had a rough year. I guess...

289
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,522
when he saw my dad
hurt,he just panicked.

290
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:52,102
But,but he honestly didn't
mean it. I know my brother.

291
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:52,912
Okay,one more thing.

292
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:56,383
You're saying your father and brother
were sitting here when the gun went off?

293
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:57,372
Yeah.

294
00:17:57,398 --> 00:18:01,090
Okay,well,if he was hit here, and
your brother was sitting there,

295
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:05,152
then the bullet would
be somewhere around here.

296
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:10,731
But if they were standing,and your
brother was pointing the gun...

297
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:16,580
then the bullet would be about here.

298
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,730
You want to try this again?

299
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:24,043
yeah,yeah,fine. Just,do you
mind if I check something?

300
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:34,060
Where the hell are you?

301
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:35,252
You've got to help me,simon.

302
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,762
What am I supposed to do,huh?

303
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:37,852
I mean,the cops are here
and they've got,like,

304
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:40,920
an entire army out looking
for you,just come home.

305
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:43,042
Mom's freaking out,
dad's in the hospital.

306
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,541
Is he going to be okay?

307
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,270
- Yeah,I think so.
- That's too bad.

308
00:18:48,316 --> 00:18:49,710
Rj,what's going on with you?

309
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,743
Hey,don't worry about me. I'm fine,okay?

310
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,813
We just got to get up
north and we'll be okay

311
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:57,431
what "up north"?I don't
even know what you mean.

312
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:00,250
Come on,you remember those stories
that dad told about the chilkoot pass?

313
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:03,323
And his grandfather being up there,
and how he made his name up there?

314
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:04,872
- Remember?
- Yeah.

315
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:07,750
That's what we're gonna do; we're gonna
go up there,we're gonna make our name.

316
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:10,543
Making our names? What
are you talking about?

317
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,250
- what's going on?
- It is,right?

318
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,031
We lose the trail?

319
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:19,050
There's ammonia splashed all over
the place. Throws off the dogs.

320
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:23,283
I mean,what? This kid's holding
ammonia in case of a manhunt?

321
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:27,193
Ammonia's good for a lot of stuff:
Fertilizing,cleaning,bombs...

322
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,513
you getting this,boss?

323
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:30,071
Yeah,copy that.

324
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,133
I mean,we can be whatever
we want to be up there.

325
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:33,492
Nobody will know us.

326
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,170
Okay,you'll be safe.

327
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:37,153
I've just got to get you away from them.

328
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:40,653
Yeah,but I am getting away.
I'm going to school,remember?

329
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:43,683
Rj?

330
00:19:43,698 --> 00:19:48,502
Yeah. Yeah,yeah,yeah. You're right,um...

331
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,863
what about me?

332
00:19:57,207 --> 00:20:00,901
That's fine. You know what? It's fine.
Don't worry about it. Do what you want,um...

333
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:03,283
the least you can do
is help me out,though.

334
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:04,570
I'm trying to help.

335
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:06,700
No,I need money to get up there.

336
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:10,890
You know what? Meet me at the
place. You know where,by noon,okay?

337
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:14,430
Do it or else... I gotta
do something else,you know?

338
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:24,752
Where are you going,simon?

339
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,960
Uh,I don't know. I have to go out.

340
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,870
Yeah? Where? Mind if we tag along?

341
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:33,451
No,it's... nah,it's not that important.

342
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:34,982
your phone's buzzing.

343
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:36,423
Is that your brother,simon?

344
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:39,663
- No. I don't know.
- You didn't even check it.

345
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:43,863
Let's get a listing of all the strachan
family phones,including rj's cell.

346
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:47,681
You... you know I'm not
going to tell you anything.

347
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:51,942
You might not mean to,but you are.

348
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:55,653
We're just trying to help
your brother. You can help,too.

349
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,141
Of course we want to
help in any way we can.

350
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:07,821
Then it would be helpful if you could
tell me more about why you expelled rj.

351
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,850
And as I've already explained,

352
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:14,551
all I can tell you is that he was de-enrolled
following an altercation with his cadet team leader.

353
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,070
Well,was he alone in the altercation?

354
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,732
Any other boys involved were
dealt with appropriately.

355
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,800
To say anything more...

356
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,363
requires written consent of his parents.

357
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:22,930
We don't have time for that right now.

358
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,633
If you want to help rj,you'll help me...

359
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:27,063
I'm sorry,doctor, I've
told you all I can.

360
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,641
Now,you're welcome to
take cadet strachan's file.

361
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:34,103
And please,give my regrets,
and regards to his father.

362
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:38,753
It's about rj?

363
00:21:38,768 --> 00:21:41,072
You know rj?

364
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,881
We're heading north
on those coordinates.

365
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:49,933
Triangulated signal from the
kid's cell phone's up ahead.

366
00:21:50,348 --> 00:21:53,592
Only you guys showing
up on infrared. Sorry.

367
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:04,473
Got a visual on a domicile,
50 meters from our position.

368
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:06,471
Still no infrared,guys.

369
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:09,353
The kid's got survival
training,knows about camouflage.

370
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:14,363
He gets enough cover on top of him,he
can hide his heat signature,so be careful.

371
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,972
this is the strategic response unit.

372
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:49,491
Rj,come on out,we don't want
to hurt you. We can help.

373
00:22:55,845 --> 00:22:58,762
Give him a blast of cs gas.

374
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:10,150
Boss,you sure about that reading?

375
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:13,232
He hasn't moved. Kid's playing possum.

376
00:23:57,996 --> 00:24:00,281
we've got some news about rj.

377
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:01,223
Is he okay?

378
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:04,230
Did you know he's been using
crystal methamphetamine?

379
00:24:04,247 --> 00:24:07,071
no,no,there's no way.

380
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:11,681
Right now he's in an unstable
state-- euphoria,paranoia,mania.

381
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:13,551
The fact that he's been using
in the middle of all this,

382
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:17,430
that tells us that he's bingeing,and
he's headed for a major crash,okay?

383
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:20,570
So,we need to bring him back
before he hurts himself anymore.

384
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:23,570
Or anyone else.

385
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,683
I can't deal with this right now.

386
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,122
Mom,please,what am I supposed to do?

387
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:31,441
You should leave. While you can.

388
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,393
Before your father comes back.

389
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:41,702
All I can do is say I'm sorry.

390
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:47,821
What else have I ever done?

391
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,352
Hold it,I can help you with this.

392
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:03,533
Okay. How?

393
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:07,953
I can show you where
my brother's hiding.

394
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:18,200
just around that bend.

395
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:23,831
No trail here.

396
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:26,402
He's saying go through the thicket.

397
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:31,341
All right,it's pretty heavy brush.

398
00:25:31,377 --> 00:25:35,452
Extended line formation,ten
to 15 meters apart. Let's go.

399
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,733
Hey,sam. Walk away from the kid.

400
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,903
Jules told me about your
buddy. My condolences.

401
00:25:56,915 --> 00:26:00,720
Anyway,you and the kid seem to
have a good connection going.

402
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:06,171
He may open up more to you,and if he does
I just need you to listen for some things.

403
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:08,951
I don't... that's really
not my thing yet,boss.

404
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,073
No,no,no,you're doing fine. You're
doing fine. Just trust your instincts.

405
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:17,321
This secret trail,hiding place
from when they were kids,you buy it?

406
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:20,373
Yeah. He knows his
brother. Where he's going.

407
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,963
Okay then.

408
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:25,533
I think you need to ask him something.

409
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:29,121
Whether he answers or not
here's what we're looking for...

410
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:31,052
I've been worried about him. Is he okay?

411
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:34,123
Hard to say. Cops haven't
brought him in yet.

412
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,922
He's in a lot of trouble.

413
00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:40,401
So you want to tell me
about the meth,torley?

414
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:44,051
Look,I could care less about
the "how" and "who" of this.

415
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,800
I just need to know "why."

416
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,721
Rj was different from the rest of us.

417
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:50,352
He worked hard,stayed out of trouble.

418
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:54,433
Kept saying: One year and
I'm outta here,one year.

419
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,450
Was a good guy.

420
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:58,741
Then one night he comes
to me,he can't sleep.

421
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:00,351
He's having nightmares.

422
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:02,702
It turns out he doesn't want to sleep.

423
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:05,182
- He wants to stay up.
- So he starts taking meth?

424
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:08,080
Taking it and making
it; he loves chemistry.

425
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:13,620
But he didn't really lose it until the
thing with the cadet leader,simpson.

426
00:27:17,556 --> 00:27:22,400
Two nights ago,it's me,a couple
other guys,rj,we're partying.

427
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:27,113
Simpson finds us,goes berserk,we're
all going home,blah,blah,blah.

428
00:27:27,135 --> 00:27:28,863
Of course he comes at me first.

429
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:29,890
Why of course?

430
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:32,840
Because I'm half his size.
He's just a douche that way.

431
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:37,501
But,so he-he grabs me, and
rj just goes off on him,

432
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:41,682
starts kicking his ass,total hardcore.

433
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,622
Simpson's still in the infirmary.

434
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:45,522
I guess that was enough for the school.

435
00:27:45,535 --> 00:27:49,381
And that was it for rj.

436
00:27:49,397 --> 00:27:52,072
I hope he's got good friends out there.

437
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:55,591
'Cause none of us were
much good for him in here.

438
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:03,611
I've got his shoes again.

439
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:05,260
You're not at the trail yet.

440
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:08,151
I know. And they're
heading that way,but...

441
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:14,050
sam,lines of force are supposed to go in
the opposite direction of the track,correct?

442
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:14,872
Yeah.

443
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:17,502
Well,these are going the same way.

444
00:28:17,516 --> 00:28:20,742
Doesn't make any sense.

445
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:24,782
Unless he's wearing his shoes backwards,
and bringing us on a goose chase.

446
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:28,211
Ed,you want to follow
the footprints back?

447
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:30,502
Good plan,sam.Let's go back

448
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:34,062
500 meters,if nothing we turn back.

449
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:37,403
Sam,bring the hummer around and meet us.

450
00:28:38,198 --> 00:28:41,142
Good,deeper.

451
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:47,501
Why are they going that way?
The trail's the other way.

452
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:52,193
My boss... he's a really smart guy.

453
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,983
He can tell things about people.

454
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:57,243
He wanted me to ask you...

455
00:28:57,258 --> 00:29:01,683
your old man--
he hit you and rj?

456
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:09,430
So you grew up around here,huh?

457
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:13,500
Running around,hide-and-go-
seek,that kind of thing?

458
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:19,422
Okay,team,heads up,eyes sharp.

459
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:20,911
This kid's headed for a crash.

460
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,011
When he does,it's
gonna be fast and ugly.

461
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:29,610
I never had a brother. Must be nice.

462
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:31,462
It kind of depends.

463
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:35,930
When he shoots your dad and gets the
cops coming after him,not so much.

464
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:40,781
a lot of guys I know,same
thing-- out of control.

465
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:43,340
They just needed a little
guidance. They turned out okay.

466
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:45,352
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Sure.

467
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,693
This one guy I knew,basic
training-- loud,dumb,fat.

468
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:53,512
Everybody says,this is the guy who ditches
out in a week. We took bets and everything.

469
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:57,053
Six months later,he was at
the head of the grad parade.

470
00:29:57,068 --> 00:30:00,691
Wasn't a guy there who
wouldn't follow him anywhere.

471
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,871
I spent a week on a
mountainside with him.

472
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,903
He told me about his family.

473
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,692
Believe me.

474
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:13,190
I figured,"man,if you can get through
that,you can get through anything."

475
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:16,251
So he turned out okay?

476
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,791
Yeah. Sure he did.

477
00:30:21,968 --> 00:30:25,143
Somewhere you need to be,simon?

478
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:35,822
shot fired.

479
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,111
Anybody see the flash?

480
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:39,041
- Negative.
- Negative.

481
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:40,203
What's happening? What are you doing?

482
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:42,163
If that was rj,we're
gonna find him with this.

483
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:44,682
Please don't hurt him. Do not hurt him.

484
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:46,303
got it!

485
00:30:46,318 --> 00:30:50,720
Okay,team,shot signature's coming from
quadrant 4-c,that's 100 meters due east.

486
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:52,233
We're gonna do a pincer formation.

487
00:30:52,245 --> 00:30:56,742
Ed,jules,wordy,you're alpha,head
northeast around 25 degrees,100 meters.

488
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,393
You'll be in quadrant 4-B.

489
00:30:58,428 --> 00:31:03,951
Spike,lewis-- bravo,southeast
120 degrees,hit him from below.

490
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:10,722
Alpha,we got a sig coming right at you.

491
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:19,323
Jules.

492
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,830
Okay,you're okay. You're okay.
Can you tell me what happened?

493
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:25,340
I was running,and-and-
and he had a gun,

494
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:30,292
and I didn't have any money and he went to
hit me and so I ran and then he shot at me.

495
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,882
Bravo team,you're almost
on another sig,be careful.

496
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:40,461
- Hold up,hold up.
- What?

497
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:43,011
You hear something?

498
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:49,660
- Lew,I'm on fire! I'm on fire!
- Spike!

499
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,903
Officer down! Officer down!

500
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:56,190
Quad 4-c! We need assistance!

501
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,142
officer down! Officer down!

502
00:31:58,158 --> 00:31:59,030
I'm fine.Thanks.

503
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:01,333
Ammonium trilodide.

504
00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:05,753
Homemade explosive of every
anarchist jackass and troublemaker.

505
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:08,461
Kid hits me with ammonium triiodide.

506
00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:09,930
Unbelievable.

507
00:32:09,948 --> 00:32:13,502
I'm sorry,man. I should
have seen him. I'm sorry.

508
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,680
Bro,seriously,shut up.

509
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:18,941
But I will say,this one
last time-- romans and woods.

510
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:21,460
All I'm saying.

511
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:30,923
All right,I'm here.

512
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:34,042
According to the doc,the kid
didn't just attack the cadet leader.

513
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:38,260
He attacked the cadet leader
after he saw him grab another kid.

514
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:40,333
Abused kids lash out.

515
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:45,183
But this looks like a kid who got used to lashing
out to protect someone else,like a baby brother.

516
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:49,712
The path simon marked for us was the
exact opposite of where rj was headed.

517
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:51,923
Kid lied to us. I guess I was wrong.

518
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,261
I got a man down.

519
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:55,760
And I could care less about
this kid's psychodrama.

520
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:57,682
This game is over now.

521
00:32:57,698 --> 00:33:00,683
I don't want you
rushing back in angry, Ed.

522
00:33:00,697 --> 00:33:01,923
It's a little late for that,boss.

523
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:03,773
Let me talk to the kid.

524
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:06,521
You know what? I appreciate
the effort,sam,but...

525
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:08,253
this is their bond.

526
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,433
You're never gonna get brother to
turn on brother. The kid's a lost lead.

527
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:14,772
No. I just didn't get it
before. Let me try one more time.

528
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:26,151
You just gonna let him hang,
like everybody else has?

529
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:29,732
You don't know anything about us.

530
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:32,841
I know this: Your
brother's gonna get killed.

531
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,250
Maybe that's what he wants.

532
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:38,693
Is that what you want?

533
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:42,803
Whether it was A...

534
00:33:42,815 --> 00:33:46,561
belt,or a cane,or
sometimes just a fist...

535
00:33:47,205 --> 00:33:52,621
rj was always there,standing right in front
of me,taking the worst of it every time.

536
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:59,130
He'd say,"what are you so scared
of,huh? I'm still here,aren't I?"

537
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:09,470
How am I supposed to turn
him in after that,huh?

538
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:12,321
I-I can't tur...

539
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:24,123
you'll be saving him by bringing him in.

540
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:28,201
Or you're going to spend the rest of your life
wondering what might have happened if you just tried.

541
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:32,781
Look,I...

542
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:39,263
I promise you this: Together,we
can bring your brother back alive.

543
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:43,090
Because so long as he's alive,
there-there's hope,right?

544
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:06,090
Hey,I knew you'd come.
Remember this place?

545
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:07,552
- Remember the summers we used to have here?
- Yeah.

546
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,520
- Remember that?
- Yeah. Sure.

547
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:15,462
- You burned up that cop pretty bad,rj.
- Yeah. Okay,well...

548
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:17,640
he shouldn't have come after me then.

549
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:20,063
You know,that's what you get.

550
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:29,543
it's okay,man. It's me,buddy.
What are you so scared of?

551
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:35,061
Meth? Blowing up cops in the woods.
I mean,who does this? Who are you now?

552
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:40,510
The same guy who was there for
you every night... every time.

553
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:43,560
Do you remember him?

554
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:48,772
Yeah. I just... that guy
never scared me before.

555
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:53,233
I am... I'm just tired,simon. You know?

556
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:55,951
Yeah. I know,man.

557
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:00,133
I was up there,and,uh...

558
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:03,753
well,I was doing good. I was.

559
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:09,590
I started getting these nightmares,and I just figured
if I stayed up,you know,I'd just... I'd be okay.

560
00:36:09,606 --> 00:36:11,680
You know,I'd just get through the year.

561
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:16,492
Come back to you. We'd get out
of here. We'd be safe,you know?

562
00:36:17,346 --> 00:36:19,261
Rj,no matter where we
go,it'll still be us.

563
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,913
Okay. Good. Okay,well,
let's go then. Come on.

564
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:24,900
No,rj,just listen.

565
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,150
Remember that time dad lost
his watch and he blamed me?

566
00:36:29,845 --> 00:36:30,861
Yeah.

567
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:34,110
And he came at me at dinner,
and he had that old belt.

568
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,961
You jumped in and you
grabbed it,remember that?

569
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:38,113
Yeah,sure. Of course.

570
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:41,080
- It hurt like hell.
- Yeah.

571
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:44,952
And you grabbed it even though
it almost ripped off your hand.

572
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:47,611
- You wouldn't let go.
- Yeah.

573
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:49,530
He was pulling on it,
and he was going crazy,

574
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:52,803
and mom was crying and I was
crying,but you wouldn't let go.

575
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:54,823
Okay.

576
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:57,203
I just want you to know,
I'll never forget that.

577
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,871
- Yeah,okay.
- That you wouldn't let go.

578
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:03,982
I'm never going to let you go,either,
rj,no matter what happens. All right?

579
00:37:05,276 --> 00:37:07,452
Okay. Sure.

580
00:37:07,465 --> 00:37:10,540
I don't know what you're talking about,man,
but,uh,we should really get out of here.

581
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,970
No,no. No matter what happens.

582
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,200
What do you mean,man?

583
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:20,801
I just,I'm...

584
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,291
- no way.
- Rj... rj...

585
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:23,691
- no way.
- Rj,just...

586
00:37:23,705 --> 00:37:24,911
no way

587
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:28,861
rj...

588
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:33,822
rj!

589
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,701
No,rj! Rj,no!

590
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:42,010
- Settle down,settle down.
- Rj! Rj! No!

591
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,151
Hey,hey,I got him. I got him.

592
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:47,320
- It's okay.
- Rj!

593
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:51,821
- Let go of him! I'm sorry!
- It's okay now. It's over.

594
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:55,122
- Get off of him!
- I'm sorry!

595
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:59,372
I got you. It's okay,
soldier. I got you.

596
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:08,573
Excuse me.

597
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,103
Yeah,I'm sorry,sir. That's just,
uh... that's not gonna happen.

598
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:14,340
And why is that exactly?

599
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,482
That's a good question.

600
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:19,033
Here's a better question,sir.

601
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:23,060
Who does the big-time lawyer call
when he needs a big-time lawyer?

602
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:29,100
I've had just about enough of this.

603
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:31,623
Haven't we all.

604
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:44,401
Lewis and spike are out of
the hospital. You seen sarge?

605
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:45,702
Yeah,he met up with a doctor.

606
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:47,222
They're gonna get that
kid a psych evaluation.

607
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:49,323
They don't think he belongs in jail.

608
00:38:49,336 --> 00:38:50,663
Where's sam at?

609
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:53,521
Oh,had,um,he had some personal stuff.

610
00:38:57,428 --> 00:39:04,992
* You...you and I made a pact *

611
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:11,540
* a deal that as we lay dying *

612
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:17,261
* we'd think about each other then *

613
00:39:18,677 --> 00:39:22,181
* and smile as we're taken in *

614
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:29,140
* I...I listen like a little child *

615
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:36,560
* to the story of
your earthbound pilot *

616
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:41,350
* he plummeted so violent *

617
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:48,930
* a parachute not opening *

618
00:39:50,508 --> 00:39:54,933
* and rushing to oblivion *

619
00:39:56,225 --> 00:40:01,290
* he broke into that knowing grin *
