Um, like iaid,

Yeah?
how were they behaving?

242
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,160
They were making the other

<i>ed:

Off-balance.

249

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,300

What's your take,

260
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,460
Looking like
substance abuse.

261

Looking like, huh?

262
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
Well, they could've cleaned out
the whole place,

263
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
But they didn't.

264
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,760

And get home?

272

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,030

274
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,400
Okay,
then we're okay.

275
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,660
Unless there were cameras
at that place.

276
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,360
So, you really don't think
they can track us down?

277
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
I don't want to risk
being at home if they do.

278
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,260
But if we can't get home
then...

279
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,860
Then the plan changes.

280
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,200
But we don't,
we don't have...

281
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,530
Yeah, so, we improvise.

Evan:
we don't need your help!

641
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,700
We just need to be
left alone!

642
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,960
Okay, why's that?

643
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Just...

644
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,130
10 minutes.

645
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,430
We just need 10 minutes,

No, sir.

652
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,830

<i>no.</i>

What's your take
on theses two?

656
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,430
I know what people
who are high look like.

657
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,960
How they smell,
how they talk.

658
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,430
These two...

659
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,630
Right, go on.

660
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,730
She said
they were short on time.

661
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,730
She said
it was their last night.

662
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,030
They wanted to dance together.

663
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,130
They wanted to dance
and that's it?

664
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,660
The rest is not for me
to say.

665
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,660
Okay.

666
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,600
<i>guys, the cab driver's
saying the same thing </i>

667
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,100
That the couple
in the pawn shop said;

668
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,460
That they are "short on time."

669

<i>spike:

<i>it's not about getting high.</i>

671
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,600
That doctor's appointment?
it was with a neurology clinic.

672
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,060
It took a bit of twisting,

673
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,660
But i got dr fylin
to release the diagnosis.

674
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,760
Laura has cjd.
creuzfeld-jakob disease.

675
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,100
Slurred speech, dizziness,
hallucinations.

676
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
A brain disorder.

677
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,630
Spike,
i need to know more.

678
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,830

Jules, how much morphine
is in those vials?

681
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,360
120 milligrams.

682
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,130
That's a lethal dose.

<i>spike:
she has spontaneous cjd.
it's very rare.</i>

684

It's like one in a million.

685
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,530
Your brain starts
literally disintegrating.

686
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,030
<i>there's no treatment,
there's no known cure.</i>

687
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,360
You can go from diagnosis
to death

688
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,560
In the space of two weeks.

689
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,900
It gets worse by the day.

690
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,560
<i>laura's losing her memory,
her balance,</i>

691
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,030
Her motor skills,
all her major brain functions.

692
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,360
Ed:
cab driver said
all they wanted to do was dance.

693
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,030
And then they were gonna
go home for the morphine

694
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,500
And that's how the night
was supposedo enen

695

Yeah.

<i>parker:

698
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,000

707
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,660
Parker:

what that must be like.

708
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
I'm sorry.

709
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
I'm gonna keep him talking.

710
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,930
Can you get it ready,
can you do that, lo?

711
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,130
Yeah.

712
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,730
Parker:
that you and evan
are very strong

713
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,260
And you're very brave.

714
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,530
You're not gonna take us
apart.

715
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,560
Boss, she's opening her bag.

716
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,030
What do you see?

717
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,560
<i>sam:
she's doing something
inside it.</i>

718
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,400
It's the morphine.
they're cutting to the chase.

719
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,030
Ed, what's your take?

720
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,900
Sam, you got the shot?

721
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,930
<i>sam:
multiple hostages,
it's high-risk.</i>

722
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,460
Less lethal,
n you do it?

723
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,630
Do we wanna do it?

724
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,760
There's a risk
we hit the hostages.

725
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,130
We go less lethal,
we're looking at an injury.

726
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,860
We let her do
what she wants to do

727
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,760
And we are looking
at a death.

728
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,730
<i>we can't let her kill herself.</i>

729
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,700
Yeah, copy.

730
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,060
Morphine's painless.

731
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,300
What are you saying,
spike?

732
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,060
Isn't this her life,
what's left of it?

733
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,430
I'm just saying maybe we should
be looking the other way?

734
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,500
Maybe it's better we let her
have what she wants.

735
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,900
Can't do it.

736
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,930
We interfere,
subject could start shooting.

737
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,130
So we put lives at risk

738
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,500
To save somebody
who's already dying?

739
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,400
<i>ed:
our job's to save lives.</i>

740
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,060

Boss?

742
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,100

I'd like to solicit
his legal opinion here

748
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,930

I mean he calls
his favourite judge

00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,400
And he works his famous
powers of persuasion.

756
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,360
You hear me?

757
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,900
<i>ed:

He's still armed.

00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,400
We can use the distraction

Copy that.

761

She's filling the syringe.

762
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,400
Sam, take the shot

763

You ready, lo?

764
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
I'm ready.

00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,930
But this choice is mine.

820

<i>we... we've talked about it
for 4 days, 4 nights.</i>

821

We, we made a video,
it's at home,

822
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,200
So that when i'm gone,
evan won't be blamed.

823
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,260
Oh god.

824
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,430
This is why.

Mrs. hewson...

826
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,160
Last week...
he came to see me.

827

Just dropped in,
wanted to go for a walk.

829
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,160
He held my hand.

830
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,200
He never does that
any more.

831
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,330
He told me he loved me
like it was goodbye.

832
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,560
Why would he do that?!

833
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,100
Jules, how much morphine
did you find at their place?

834
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
How many doses?

So, since you were, what?

844
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,130
Fifteen.

I know something about memories,

850
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,300
And i know a little something
about what happens

851
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,530
When someone shoots
someone else.

852
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,100
It's not like you
think it is,

it's messy as hell.

<i>and when...

Before he goes to sleep.

861
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,800
Don't believe him.

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,160
But i gotta be honest with you,

<i>ed:

00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,430
Ev?

884
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,630
But why?

885
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,400
<i>ed: (quietly)
hold off, guys.
let's give 'em some space.</i>

886
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,930
I can't.

887
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,200
I don't want to.

888
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,860
I don't want to live
without you, lo.

889
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,100
You have to, okay?

890
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,830
You have to.

891
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,830
Please.

892
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,830
I can't,
i can't.

893
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,600
You have so much time
still.

894
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,960
Your mom,
she needs you and...

895
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,660
And your family needs you.

896
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,900
You are gonna love
someone else some day.

897
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,700
No, that's not gonna happen.

898
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,130
Yes it is.

899
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,530
Yes it is.

900
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,330
Ev, how am i gonna live on
if you don't live?

901
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,800
<i>jules:
sarge.</i>

902
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,730
<i>i just heard back
from mcandrew,</i>

903
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,400
He thinks they can swing it.

904
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,200
Copy that.
good work, eddie.

905
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,130
Evan?

906
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,200
No matter how much time
you have left,

907
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,560
Two days or two weeks,

908
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,730
We're gonna make sure
the two of you stay together.

909
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,030
We're not gonna
split you up.

910
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,960
Laura:
are you with me?

911
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,300
(breathes a sigh of relief)

912
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,830
So that's the story.

913
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,160
I'm sorry, mom, dad,

914
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,430
All you guys,
for not giving any...

915
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,700
Advance warning.

916
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,930
* i will be here
by your side *

917
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,960
<i>laura:
i guess i didn't really
get much warning myself.</i>

918
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,960
* no need to be afraid *

919
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,230
<i>laura:
i just don't want a fuss.</i>

920
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,230
<i>you know, you get that,
right?</i>

921
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,800
* close your eyes,
close your eyes *

922
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,460
I don't want pity or...

923
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,000
Two weeks of goodbyes.

924
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,160
* and when you do *

925
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,300
* i look at you and wonder *

926
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,900
* i wonder *

927
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,360
* can you truly be mine? *

928
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,930
* be mine *

929
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,800
* be mine *
