1
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,011
<i>Attention, shoppers, may I
have your attention, please?</i>

2
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:33,744
<i>My name is Sergeant Gregory Parker
with the Police Strategic Response Unit.</i>

3
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:35,874
<i>There have been security
concerns in the mall,</i>

4
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,118
<i>and we are working quickly
to ensure your safety.</i>

5
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:46,535
Okay, let's sweep and clear with extreme
caution. Subject is armed and volatile.

6
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:56,476
Police want everyone out now.

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,823
Please hurry! Anyone else here?!

8
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:24,196
<i>Tasha.</i>

9
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:27,183
I just killed a girl.

10
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:29,370
<i>Tasha, where are you?</i>

11
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:34,816
So... I just wanted to say...

12
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:41,335
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

13
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,087
<i>5 hours earlier</i>

14
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,302
Hi, how did... how'd it go last night?

15
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:51,221
Oh, I had her in the palm of my hand.

16
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:53,032
Candles, a little Egyptian musk.

17
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,663
A little boom-shacka-lacka
on the iPod.

18
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,642
- So, what went wrong?
- Steaks.

19
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:59,752
I might as well have
cooked her my shoe.

20
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,823
I told you before about
the charcoal grill.

21
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,871
- Yeah.
- Charcoal: no wonder.

22
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,851
You can't control the heat.

23
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:09,083
Gas, all the way. And you
marinate the thing overnight.

24
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,652
Yeah, you do. You marinate it.

25
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:14,831
- If you're gonna be like that.
- T-bone, there's a nice cut.

26
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:15,991
Be like what?

27
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:17,921
My steaks got nothing but
the juices they're born in.

28
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,370
Marbled with fat.
Porterhouse, rib-eye.

29
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:23,620
Some olive oil, tomato paste.

30
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,222
Mom?

31
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:53,482
Mama, I gotta go to work.

32
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:55,860
What time is it?

33
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,123
It's almost 5:00.

34
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:01,800
I don't want to be late.

35
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,841
Tasha...

36
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,143
Dinner's in the microwave.

37
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,400
Just gotta rember to take
the tinfoil off before you...

38
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:16,511
I know how to do it.

39
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:20,303
Are you up?

40
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:22,771
Or do you want me to set an alarm?

41
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:26,651
I'm fine, all right?
I just need another hour.

42
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:35,300
Mom...

43
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,821
I know it can be hard sometimes,
but if you just get up,

44
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:46,213
you're going to feel better.
Okay, I know you can do this.

45
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:49,963
Not right now.
Please.

46
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:53,332
Okay.

47
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:57,223
Yeah.

48
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,231
So, I'll see you later?

49
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,803
- What's happening?
- We've got a visitor.

50
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:34,501
- What's going on, liar?
- What's up, slut?

51
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:47,563
- Sam, vest.
- I just qualified.

52
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:49,013
That was last week. Come on.

53
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:52,821
Start hanging out in the
donut shop, we're gonna know.

54
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:57,713
- You gonna get that?
- None of your business.

55
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:01,053
- Who is it? Parker, 205.
- It's no one... Ed...

56
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:02,622
Hello. Jules' phone. Who's this?

57
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:04,180
Carlotti, 175.

58
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:07,362
Todd? Oh, Scott. Scotty. Oh,
it's just Scott. Okay, sorry.

59
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:10,503
- Wordsworth, 190.
- No, it's Edward, her personal assistant.

60
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:13,412
Well, I will ask her.

61
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,301
You, uh, you want to
go out with him tonight?

62
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,153
You... is this... second date?

63
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,921
It's the... it's the third.

64
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:24,830
She would love to see you tonight,
Scooter. Yeah, I'll ask her.

65
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:29,250
Movie? You know, we can't do that.
We're working late. What about...

66
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,873
what about, uh, bowling?

67
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:36,130
Excellent, I'll have her call
you. Thank you, sir. Bye-bye.

68
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:38,283
- Braddock, 180.
- What's the word?

69
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,403
- Sorry, Greg, you're it.
- What?

70
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,721
- Oh, an outrage!
- Oh, come on.

71
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:46,520
- I demand a reweighing.
- You're first, Mr. Wordsworth. Let's go.

72
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:49,072
- You're first up.
- Come on, boss, you and me.

73
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:50,420
Let's go, chubby.

74
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:53,941
If you can drag the heaviest guy,
you can save everybody on your team.

75
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,360
Okay.

76
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,981
All right, be gentle.

77
00:05:58,027 --> 00:06:01,162
It'll hurt me more than it
hurts you, you know that, right?

78
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,852
Yeah.

79
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,491
Yeah, Jules.

80
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:13,102
What? That was great. She just moved
like 250 pounds. I was being supportive.

81
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:16,301
Hey, rember what you saw.
Girl just saved your life.

82
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:23,271
You don't have to close tonight.
I can do it. You look tired.

83
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:26,472
No, it's... it's my
turn. I'll... I'll close.

84
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:29,583
Jackie, I'm fine.

85
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:34,220
It's been two weeks now
like this. What is going on?

86
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:37,383
Tash.

87
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:41,411
Mom's a nightmare. School's worse.

88
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:43,331
Same old.

89
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,690
Can I take my break now?

90
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,852
Yeah, sure.

91
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:51,140
I'll be here.

92
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:15,963
- Hey, Tasha.
- Hey, I gotta go.

93
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:19,410
Tasha doesn't wash her hands
after she goes to the bathroom.

94
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:20,773
Spreading her germs everywhere.

95
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,983
Yeah, just like her lies.

96
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,231
So, why'd you do it, Tasha?

97
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:37,800
Why'd you open your mouth to the cops?

98
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,893
Yo, she ignoring you?

99
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:45,350
She said, "Why did
you lie to the cops?"

100
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:48,342
Wasn't a lie.

101
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:52,743
No way Michael would do that.

102
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:55,631
Believe what you
want. My break is over.

103
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,263
Oh, you gotta go, huh?

104
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,811
Hit her head!

105
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,181
Yeah, punch her!

106
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,581
- Grab her arms.
- Bring her over here.

107
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:13,471
- Get off of me.
- Over here.

108
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:15,333
- Get off of me!
- Hold still.

109
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,480
Hold her down.

110
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:23,103
When we're done with you,

111
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,823
no one will want to
get with you ever again.

112
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,730
- Help! Help me, please.
- Shut up! Keep your mouth shut.

113
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,930
- Bitch!
- Cassaundra, watch the door.

114
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:36,633
- No, no!
- Erin, keep her still.

115
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,722
Shut up, bitch!

116
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:41,061
- Get off me, please.
- Hold still.

117
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:50,200
- Somebody help me!
- Shut up.

118
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:57,291
Oh, no, look at her.

119
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,953
And this...

120
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,680
this is nothing compared
to what I'm gonna

121
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:06,383
do to you if you ever
lie to the cops again.

122
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:10,760
Maybe we should just do this now.

123
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:15,391
Michael's heat. You're going to come.

124
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:19,291
Now nobody has to look at
her nasty little face again.

125
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:23,513
Brianna! Brianna!

126
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,783
- Oh, man.
- Come on. We have to go.

127
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:41,301
- We have to go right now.
- What about Cassaundra?

128
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,990
- We can't leave her here!
- We got no choice.

129
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:46,900
We find Tasha right
now, and we kill her.

130
00:09:47,126 --> 00:09:49,181
Let's go.

131
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:50,190
CREDITOS

132
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:33,320
<i>Team One, gear up. Paradise Square.
Shots fired. Unknown subject.</i>

133
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:36,443
<i>First responders have
established a perimeter.</i>

134
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:51,840
- Head of security?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,131
All the exits are locked.

136
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:56,373
That's good. You probably
trapped our shooter or shooters.

137
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,882
Along with about four or 500 civilians?

138
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,861
The mall employees are
on alert, but the shoppers

139
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,801
are starting to realize
they can't get out.

140
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,561
- Got anything else?
- That's it.

141
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:07,060
- I'm going to need your P.A.
- You got it.

142
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:09,521
Let's find out who and
what we're dealing with.

143
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:11,810
What do you got, Lou?

144
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:13,356
She's gang.

145
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,325
Numbers on her arm.

146
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:17,287
Definitely not random.

147
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,383
All right, Lou, you're
going to be with me.

148
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:25,010
Jules, Sam, take a look at the scene.

149
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:26,113
- Got it.
- Sir.

150
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:27,730
- Spike, Wordy, witnesses.
- Copy.

151
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,752
Hey, buddy, we're going
to need need full access to

152
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:32,603
floor plans and CCTV footage
for the last 30 minutes.

153
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:35,442
No problem. Follow me.
The security office, top floor.

154
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,911
Needle in a haystack.

155
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:13,722
Critical incident: Paradise
Square. Shots fired, 7:51 PM.

156
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,072
- Establishing command post.
- Start sweeping street level.

157
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,522
<i>Copy that.</i>

158
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:20,742
Sally, call in Team Two.

159
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:21,720
<i>Copy.</i>

160
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:24,811
And we're going to need extra
coppers on the escalators,

161
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,760
the elevators, and the street parking.

162
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:35,421
But you don't know whether it was three or
four girls that ran past you on the stairs?

163
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,270
Okay, now think back. Try and
narrow it down a little bit.

164
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:39,112
These kids... are they about this big?

165
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,760
- I don't know.
- This big?

166
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:43,533
- I don't, I don't know what I saw.
- It's all right. It's okay.

167
00:12:43,577 --> 00:12:44,922
All right, thanks, thanks very much.

168
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:48,992
Boss, witnesses saw teenagers bolt
out of a restroom and up the stairs.

169
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,863
Three teenage girls,
four teenage girls,

170
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:53,560
three girls and a boy,
could be seven orangutans.

171
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,892
How about a little less information
and a little more intelligence?

172
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:58,191
<i>Copy.</i>

173
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,111
- Lou, you crack the tatt?
- No, not yet.

174
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,471
<i>Sarge, we're starting the
sweep, but we have people moving</i>

175
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,642
<i>all over the place. How
about a little crowd control?</i>

176
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:06,801
Negative. Not yet. Our
shooters might still think

177
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,801
they're getting out of
here tonight, and if I

178
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:10,813
announce our presence to
the whole mall, we'll have

179
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,770
mass panic. They might
try to fire their way out.

180
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:15,750
- They're dormant; we wait.
- Yeah, give me more who and why.

181
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:17,430
<i>Copy that.</i>

182
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:22,290
Okay, our victim's tattoo
is a number. 2-3-3-1-8-5-2-3.

183
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:24,392
It's code for W-CREW.

184
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,311
Winchester Crew. Nice, Lou.

185
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:28,172
Jules, Sam, what you got?

186
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:31,750
Single bullet hole. Looks like
a. 38 There is also a stray

187
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:35,290
backpack left behind, but
there's no wallet or apparent ID.

188
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:38,512
All right. Copy that.
We'll get K-9 down.

189
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:39,412
<i>Sarge.</i>

190
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:40,830
Yeah, Jules.

191
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:44,441
There's blood on the floor, blond hair.

192
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,930
I'm guessing a makeover,
I'm guessing female,

193
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:48,992
and I'm guessing that
it was not voluntary.

194
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,023
<i>I've checked security's
photos of known gang members.</i>

195
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:54,091
She's not up here, but she's
definitely Winchester Crew.

196
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:57,733
So if her shooter's in a rival gang,
we're looking at a high-risk subject.

197
00:13:58,018 --> 00:13:59,980
Not averse to hands-on violence.

198
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:03,301
<i>Could be inter-gang stuff,
vendetta maybe, but...</i>

199
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:06,553
I don't know, I'm thinking that
there's another victim here,

200
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,862
and it feels personal to me.

201
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,490
It's not random; it's
not Trolley Square.

202
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:13,192
Possible grudge match. Okay,
time to go wide. Go ahead.

203
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:18,570
Attention, shoppers, may I
have your attention, please.

204
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:22,402
<i>My name is Sergeant Gregory Parker
with the Police Strategic Response Unit.</i>

205
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:24,453
<i>There has been a security
incident in the mall,</i>

206
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:27,302
<i>and we are working quickly
to ensure your safety.</i>

207
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:30,283
You can help us by exiting all shops

208
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:34,133
and calmly walking toward
the central areas of the mall.

209
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:37,942
<i>Once in the central areas,
kindly sit on the floor</i>

210
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:40,332
<i>and clasp your hands behind your head.</i>

211
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:44,662
<i>This will make our job much easier, much
faster, and we can all get out of here.</i>

212
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,292
Thank you.

213
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:50,343
Bri, come on, we got
to get out of here.

214
00:14:50,376 --> 00:14:51,800
Yo, lockdown.

215
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:55,572
It doesn't matter either way.
We have to find Tasha now.

216
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,381
Look at your arm, Erin.

217
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:59,101
What if you were two
inches to the right?

218
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:01,552
- Bri, come on...
- This is on us.

219
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:03,613
All right, Crew finds out
we didn't deal with this,

220
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:05,421
we're the ones they're going to blame.

221
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:09,020
So you want to live your life?
Huh?! You want to live your life?

222
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:14,090
Nothing's changed.
We kill Tasha now.

223
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,922
K-9's got a scent.

224
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,923
All right, let the dogs go.

225
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:26,883
<i>Jules, paint me a picture.</i>

226
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:31,932
Okay. A textbook, grade
11, Junction High, no name.

227
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:35,471
A few books, she's a reader.

228
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,781
Keychain, two keys...

229
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:42,681
Sally, get me names of kids at Junction
Street High with known gang association.

230
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:44,432
<i>Copy.</i>

231
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:48,770
- Sergeant, we got it. There's our. 38.
- Roll it back.

232
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,483
There.

233
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,431
Freeze it there.

234
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:08,023
Lewis, check those
images against the wall.

235
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,603
Team One, we got four females:
one shooter, three witnesses.

236
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:15,690
<i>ED 5'4" to 5'8", jeans and hoodies.
Sweep and clear... fast is good.</i>

237
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:18,501
<i>Fan out from the hot spot:
Jules and Sam: north end.</i>

238
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:19,851
- Copy.
- Copy.

239
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:21,731
<i>ED Wordy and Spike, South.</i>

240
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,343
<i>- Copy.
- Copy.</i>

241
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,770
They're all hoodrats,
Sarge. It's hard to say.

242
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,031
Then you're with me. Let's go.

243
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:32,993
Sally, names of female Winchester Crew
first and put Dr. Luria on standby.

244
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:58,103
Eyes on possible primary subject.
Lower level, near the escalator...

245
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,773
- proceeding north.
- Copy that.

246
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:03,501
- Stay concealed until my go.
- Copy. Can't see her yet. On our way.

247
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:06,673
Careful, guys. Subject is armed.

248
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:18,000
I see her. Stand by. When she
reaches the center, verbals on my go.

249
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,852
Go, go, go!

250
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:39,200
<i>All units...</i>

251
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:42,971
All units, tighten perimeter around
lower concourse area near the market.

252
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:46,740
<i>We've got an active
shooter! Civilians! Move!</i>

253
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,660
Go! Go, go, go!

254
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:56,172
Out of the way! Come on, move! Move!

255
00:17:57,047 --> 00:18:01,180
- No joy.
- No joy.

256
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:02,682
No joy.

257
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:05,121
<i>Boss, we've lost sight of her.
Keep your eyes on the cameras.</i>

258
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:07,043
<i>Keep the exits tight.</i>

259
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:08,930
Wordy, where are you?

260
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,763
I've got a subject, north of you.

261
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:20,091
Hold still. Come on.

262
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,523
- One in custody.
- Wordy, good job.

263
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:26,450
Lewis, get her up here fast.

264
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,300
Sarge, we got a problem.

265
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,432
We need to get everyone
out where we can see them,

266
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:32,913
but, uh, but they're spooked.

267
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,192
You feel like talking down a crowd
of about 500 over the P.A. system?

268
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:39,353
- Yeah. Copy that. Help me out?
- Yeah.

269
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:44,302
Can I have your attention, please.
Again, this is Sergeant Gregory Parker

270
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:46,563
with the Strategic Response Unit.

271
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:49,303
While I understand
that you're frightened,

272
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:52,013
I must insist on your
immediate cooperation.

273
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,002
Shopkeepers...

274
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,120
We got to ditch the gun
and get some clothes.

275
00:18:57,116 --> 00:19:00,172
- Where's Erin?
- Shoppers, please...

276
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:04,851
calmly walk to the central
area and form a single line,

277
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,341
and we'll let you out shortly.

278
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,750
The police want everyone out now.

279
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:11,582
<i>Again, we thank you for your patience
as we investigate this incident.</i>

280
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:18,880
Please hurry! Anyone else here?!

281
00:19:56,426 --> 00:20:01,190
Okay, let's sweep and clear with extreme
caution. Subject is armed and volatile.

282
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,350
Kiddy Kidswear secure.

283
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:04,301
<i>Copy.</i>

284
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:05,910
15-year-old
girls.

285
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,680
One day they're playing with
Barbies, and the next, it's a semi.

286
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:12,783
Better to be in the gang than to get
beat up by the gang. Tall Girls, secure.

287
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:14,091
<i>Copy.</i>

288
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:20,553
8:48 P.M.: Sergeant Parker
interviews Erin Perretti.

289
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:26,212
Here, take it.

290
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:28,240
In your hands.

291
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:32,960
You know her, right,
Erin? What's her name?

292
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:35,042
- Tasha Redford.
- Tasha Redford.

293
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:37,411
Thank you very much, Erin.

294
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:39,390
She go to school?

295
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:42,923
- Yeah, she goes to Junction Street.
- Lewis, call Dr. Luria.

296
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,623
Hello, Doc. We finally got a
name on the primary subject:

297
00:20:48,657 --> 00:20:50,603
Tasha Redford, Junction Street High.

298
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:53,070
<i>Tough school. You got a
home address for me yet?</i>

299
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:54,610
Hold on.

300
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,090
Sally, I need you to run that name, Tasha
Redford. We're looking for an address.

301
00:20:58,137 --> 00:20:58,960
<i>Copy.</i>

302
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:01,242
I want you to know you're
being very cooperative, Erin,

303
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:03,480
and I really appreciate that.

304
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:08,482
We were just there in the bathroom,
going about our business, you know?

305
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,972
And then she comes in.
Tasha's pulling out a gun.

306
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:14,110
She's like a psychopath or something.

307
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:18,020
She killed Cassaundra.
Shot me in the arm, too.

308
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:20,192
She did, huh?

309
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,793
Mind if I take a look?

310
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:26,321
I mean, Erin, you might
need a bandage or something.

311
00:21:30,018 --> 00:21:34,522
Okay, Erin, now you're going to give
us the names of all your friends.

312
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:37,112
I'm assuming they're
Winchester Crew, too, right?

313
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:41,751
So take a look at the board
here. You recognize anybody?

314
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:50,883
- Brianna Tulley.
- I didn't say that.

315
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:55,302
So, now let's talk about what happened
after you gave Tasha the haircut.

316
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:59,683
These girls are tough as nails.
They hold the guns, the drugs.

317
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:01,802
Their boyfriend gets in
trouble, they take the fall.

318
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:03,283
So what, she moves up the ranks?

319
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,863
Yeah, and maybe she
doesn't have to do all those

320
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:08,401
booty calls for all
her boyfriend's buddies.

321
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:28,900
Police. Come out now with
your hands on your head.

322
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:37,320
- Easy, I'm coming. I'm coming.
- Out! Come on.

323
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:42,610
Come on. All right, you
guys go out with the others.

324
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:45,923
After you put the cameras back.

325
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:01,961
Bri, we gotta dump it.

326
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,780
Michael got it from Dee-Mac.
I lost a gun already.

327
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:08,012
He'll kill me if I don't bring it back.

328
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:11,201
I don't know you. Go sit down. Sit.

329
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,692
My stores are clear. Headlines, boss?

330
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:31,920
<i>Girl with the haircut is Tasha Redford.
These girls are all the same gang.</i>

331
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:34,691
- Except for Tasha Redford.
- That's not confirmed.

332
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:37,781
- Initiation gone wrong?
- That scene in the washroom...

333
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:42,180
The girl's not a follower. She fought
back. Maybe they're after her for something.

334
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:48,131
Boss, I got Tasha Redford's name
flagged on an attempted rape.

335
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,210
Guy named Michael Donacosta, who is...

336
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,002
- that guy.
- Tasha went to the cops about that guy?

337
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,720
Yeah.

338
00:23:58,377 --> 00:24:02,443
Well, I smell the revenge a mile away.
Hey, Jules, you were right about Tasha.

339
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:04,881
Good job.

340
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,653
<i>Redford house. Leave a message.</i>

341
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:15,501
Mom.

342
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:19,800
Are you there? Mom?

343
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:26,341
Pick up the phone. Please.
Please. Pick up the phone.

344
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,433
Okay.

345
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:38,721
I love you.

346
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:44,801
You're looking for
Tasha's mom? Try the bar.

347
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:48,983
Quite the welcome mat.

348
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:02,631
I don't think so. Hands
on your head. Turn around.

349
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:06,083
Come on. That's it.

350
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:10,922
Get this to forensics.
Bag her hands for residue.

351
00:26:10,955 --> 00:26:14,242
- We didn't do nothin'.
- You didn't do anything.

352
00:26:14,276 --> 00:26:16,913
Get 'em up to Parker.

353
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,193
Okay, thanks, Doc.

354
00:26:25,228 --> 00:26:27,461
Single mom, drinking problem.

355
00:26:27,498 --> 00:26:29,890
Multiple calls to Family Services.

356
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:33,182
Kid keeps her room tidy, but the
rest of the place is a disaster.

357
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,523
Well, that's good. She's
trying to control her own space.

358
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:38,253
Still has hope for the future.

359
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:49,161
Tasha!

360
00:26:50,257 --> 00:26:52,541
I just killed a girl.

361
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,833
<i>Tasha, where are you?</i>

362
00:26:56,408 --> 00:27:00,580
So... I just wanted to say...

363
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:05,683
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

364
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:08,913
<i>Tasha, where are you?</i>

365
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:14,291
- Thank you for being so nice to me.
- I can help you.

366
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:17,843
- I... I'll come get you.
- Bye, Jackie.

367
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:20,113
<i>Tasha...</i>

368
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:30,660
There's a girl. She's in trouble.

369
00:27:45,355 --> 00:27:49,162
Police! Anybody still in here?

370
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,770
<i>Hey, team, listen up.</i>

371
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:20,863
Primary subject works
in this mall. She was on

372
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:23,920
shift at one of the kiosks
earlier this evening.

373
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,203
Copy, boss.

374
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:03,101
Found the. 38. in the fitting room.

375
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:04,593
She's gone.

376
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:06,750
She probably knows
this mall inside out.

377
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:09,390
<i>Tracking heat prints.</i>

378
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,060
Let's go.

379
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:34,672
Step right up, ladies, right here.

380
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:40,383
You know this guy,
right? Michael Donacosta?

381
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:43,701
Michael?

382
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:45,583
Donacosta?

383
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,492
There's no way I'll be able
to fit. I'll find another way.

384
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:57,341
Okay.

385
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:11,230
Tasha's a good kid. She works
hard. She's not in a gang.

386
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:15,163
She's not doing drugs. She's
trying to do it the right way,

387
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:17,672
which is hard when you
live where she lives.

388
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,140
It's kids like that they
should give medals to.

389
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:23,193
- Jules, you get that?
- Copy.

390
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:38,722
Tasha, stop!

391
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,223
- Stop, Tasha!
- Get away from me!

392
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:18,413
Get away from me!

393
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:27,023
She's out on a ledge.

394
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:35,852
<i>Where are you?</i>

395
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:40,400
The media tower, level eight,
the edge facing Young Street.

396
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,652
Jules, we're on our way up.

397
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:47,271
Jules, don't go
face-to-face if she's armed.

398
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:52,171
No visible weapon, just a girl
and the pavement 200 feet below.

399
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:55,012
Excuse me. Excuse me. There!

400
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:56,602
- Everybody, move back.
- Back it up.

401
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:58,912
- Back! Back!
- Back it up! Back it up!

402
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:01,180
- Clear the area!
- Everybody, back!

403
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:06,642
- You up to intervention?
- Copy.

404
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:09,821
<i>Okay, you're talking to a
victim of an attempted rape.</i>

405
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:12,940
<i>She was brutalized in
retaliation for going to the cops.</i>

406
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:17,340
<i>She's got no home support. But from
what Luria says, she was holding on.</i>

407
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:20,452
<i>She was doing everything she
could to keep her life together.</i>

408
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:23,320
All right? And I'm here if you need me.

409
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:26,201
Tasha.

410
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,530
My name is Jules.

411
00:32:33,247 --> 00:32:35,711
Tasha.

412
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:41,281
You don't have to talk to me, but
I would really like it if you would.

413
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:45,340
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here to help.

414
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:51,750
I'm gonna step closer so
that you can hear me better.

415
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:55,110
I'm stepping closer.

416
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:00,652
Good.

417
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,223
So...

418
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:05,783
thanks for not jumping.

419
00:33:07,515 --> 00:33:10,360
Are you thinking you might?

420
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:14,883
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

421
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:18,382
You know, I've never seen
somebody who's ready to die

422
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:22,780
put up such an awesome
fight to stay alive.

423
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,681
Yeah.

424
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:34,470
Can you tell me what happened
today? With those girls.

425
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:39,160
Why don't you ask them?

426
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:47,672
They gave you quite a
haircut, didn't they?

427
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:59,131
I thought they were gonna kill me.

428
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:03,640
I know. I know. You were
really scared, weren't you?

429
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:08,782
They think I lied to the cops
about Brianna's boyfriend...

430
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:13,902
- about what he did to me.
- But you didn't, did you? You didn't.

431
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:20,672
- It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
- Tasha, it matters. It does matter.

432
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:25,220
It was so brave what you did.

433
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:28,522
You told the truth about
what happened to you.

434
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:31,790
You stood up to that
guy. You fought back.

435
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:38,782
Same with those girls. Come
on, Tasha. Stay with me.

436
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:41,172
Stay with me.

437
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,593
I killed a girl today.

438
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:51,692
<i>That's negative. The girl's
in surgery. She's doing fine.</i>

439
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:58,661
No, you didn't. You didn't.
You did not kill anyone.

440
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:03,501
The doctors are fixing her
right now. She's gonna be okay.

441
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:10,333
Yeah. Come on, Tasha. Please.
Will you give me your hand?

442
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:12,600
Let's climb over.

443
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:16,342
I can't. I can't. I
can't. I'm dead anyway.

444
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:22,301
Tasha, I know that it feels like
that. I know, but you're not.

445
00:35:22,348 --> 00:35:26,072
It is. It's just how it is.

446
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:31,452
I can't... I can't go to school.
I can't go to work. I can't go home.

447
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:36,253
For what?! My mom? I got
nobody! I have nobody!

448
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:40,981
You don't understand!
You don't know how it is!

449
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:45,031
- Okay, actually, Tasha...
- Look at me! Look at me!

450
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:47,980
I do understand. Actually, I do.

451
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:52,401
I do, and that's why I'm standing
right here. That's why I'm here.

452
00:35:52,438 --> 00:35:53,911
Okay?

453
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:57,673
And I want you to take my hand,
and I want to help you over.

454
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:01,162
And you are gonna get through this.

455
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:07,051
It might feel impossible, but you
have the rest of your life, okay?

456
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:13,453
And it's gonna be tough, but it's
also gonna be really, really amazing.

457
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:21,273
If you get through this,
you can get through anything.

458
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,851
I promise.

459
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:30,691
Will you give me your hand?

460
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:34,852
Give me your hand. Okay?

461
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:42,371
Come on, Tasha. Come on.

462
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:58,993
We're okay!

463
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:02,073
- They're okay. She's okay.
- Hang on.

464
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,880
<i>Jules caught her. We're
gonna pull them up.</i>

465
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:10,061
Let's get her up.

466
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:35,350
- Hey!
- Hey.

467
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:41,653
Why did you do that for me?

468
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:46,330
'Cause I don't give up
without a fight. Just like you.

469
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:53,890
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't be. Okay?

470
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:01,471
These guys are gonna fix you up.

471
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:06,313
- Okay?
- Thanks.

472
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:18,572
Hey, Jules...

473
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:23,091
- Um, welcome.
- Sorry. I knocked.

474
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:26,731
- You use a curling iron?
- Sam...

475
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:32,191
I, uh, I just wanted to say...
nice save out there.

476
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:35,571
Didn't know you could fly.

477
00:39:37,688 --> 00:39:39,322
It was a...

478
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:43,002
long four seconds before
we knew you were okay.

479
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:44,693
And I'm okay.

480
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:48,143
Smashed hard against
the side of that tower.

481
00:39:48,175 --> 00:39:50,721
And I'm okay.

482
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:54,453
You want a second opinion?

483
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:10,093
- How's it look?
- Like a double bacon burger.

484
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:15,001
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

485
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:20,262
So we're going to the diner
for breakfast. You hungry?

486
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:23,120
- You can bring, uh... what's his name?
- Scott.

487
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:26,911
Scott. If you want.

488
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:33,821
- Are you riding with Wordy?
- Minivan express.

489
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:37,423
Will you save me a seat?
