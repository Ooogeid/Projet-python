1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Where is he?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,400
What do you want
from joel graves, stan?

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,700
I want him in here.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,300
You know what i think
you really want?

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,000
What you really want,

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,800
You know he can't give it
to you.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,900
You got ten seconds.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,900
This isn't the way, stan.
It's not the way.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Your friends know that.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,300
Your friends know
when it's time to stop.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,700
You get him in here

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,200
Or this ends right now.

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,600
Just don't do it, stan.

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,700
Just don't do it.

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,200
No!

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,700
Okay, explain this to me.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,100
Flowers in a hospital.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,600
Wow, thanks so much,
they're so pretty.

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,200
Now you get to leave
and i get to sit here

20
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,600
And watch them die.

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,100
It's a gesture.
It's the thought.

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,700
Mm.

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,400
Short term thought.

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,000
That's why i got you
the plant;

25
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm thinking long term.

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,300
How long you thinkin'?

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,700
As long as it takes,
i'll be here.

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,500
Well, i don't plan on staying
here for very long.

29
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,800
Good.

30
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,400
That's good,
we're missing you bad.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,300
Oh, yeah? How bad?

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,300
Really bad.

33
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,900
Yeah?

34
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,200
Not so bad that the team's
not looking for somebody

35
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,000
To fill my spot.

36
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,500
Final round of recruiting
is today.

37
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Anybody good?

38
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,200
They're down to six.

39
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,700
From?

40
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,300
From three hundred, so...
yeah, they're good.

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,900
308 round projectile travelling
at 2750 feet per second,

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Projectile weighs
168 grains...

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Eyes on the target.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,600
Target sierra
at 100 yards.

45
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,500
Use standard atmospheric
conditions at sea level.

46
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,700
What's the drop
at 200 yards?

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
Drop at 200 yards?
3.8 inches.

48
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,900
Double the weight
of the projectile.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's the drop?

50
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,100
3.8. Inches.

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
The drop is constant.

52
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,100
Donna sabine.

53
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,900
You looking for a change
of scenery of what?

54
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,500
Change of wardrobe.

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Trying to get in
the cool pants

56
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
A long time.

57
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,799
Nice to meet you, donna.

58
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Nice to meet you, sir.

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,100
I'm not spying.

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,900
Yet, he's taking
digital pictures

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,600
With a zoom lense.

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,300
Personally,
if i've got a gun to my neck,

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,500
Your promise comes
from your heart, right?

64
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:21,800
Right.

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,000
So you see where i'm going
with this?

66
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
You gotta put the gun down

67
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,400
So he can think straight.

68
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Right down.

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
Nice.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm telling you,

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,900
You can't just walk in herelike this.
-You're trespassing.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Look... i'm working,
i'm working on it

73
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,300
Registered letters have been
delivered to this address.

74
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,700
And i've been telling you
for weeks

75
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
That if you just give me
a little bit more time

76
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,100
And you just...
out of the blue?

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not my call, mr. Wilks.
It's not my call.

78
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,600
Right.

79
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Look, you might want to look
into some storage options.

80
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,800
The weather's
not looking good.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,600
Lorne.

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Kira, i don't want the kids
to see anymore of this.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Why don't you go upstairs
and get your things?

84
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,600
You're gonna stay
at nana's.

85
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,600
That's a good boy.

86
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,500
I'll call you tonight.

87
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,300
We'll turn it around.

88
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,200
Hey, brian?

89
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,200
Lorne.

90
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Okay, great.

91
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll call stan
and i'll call you back.

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,400
Yeah.

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Good.

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll see you there.

95
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,200
Ready?

96
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Stan?

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,100
All the way.

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Let's go.

100
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,300

101
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,200
Excuse me,

102
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Morning.

103
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,500
Hey, cover me,
i'm gonna check this out.

104
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Meanwhile, some retail giants
are suffering

105
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,000
As a result of debt-Funded
stock buybacks,

106
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,000
Now having to deal with...

107
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,200
I'll take that again.

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,400
Excuse me, sir?
Hey, how you doing?

109
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,700
Um, i'm going to have
to ask you guys to leave.

110
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Oh, i-I'm sorry, um...

111
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,200
Really, i don't want
to inconvenience you,

112
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,900
But, uh... look,
we'll be out of your hair,

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
But first we want to talk
to joel graves.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,900
Here, this guy.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,900
Ceo of the year?

116
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,000
You'd be doing us a big favour
if you just...

117
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,000
Radio that request upstairs
for us, all right?

118
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,600
Right, right.
Okay.

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
Sector 2, i'm gonna need
some assistance

120
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,400
In the media center.

121
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,800
That's not code for
you wanna kick me

122
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,100
And my friends
out of here, is it?

123
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,500
No-No, no.
Account holders.

124
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,300
Excuse me,
i'm celia westfall,

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm with the cwgt
money report.

126
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,800
Do i understand you want

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,200
Yeah, i do. Can you turn
that camera off, please?

128
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,100
No, keep it rolling.

129
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,200
We're gonna push back
on your print proposal, john.

130
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,800
We're gonna go
exclusively digital.

131
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
It's lower cost and,
uh, research shows,

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,300
The internet is one of the last
"give-Ups" of the consumer.

133
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
????Your future first.

134
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,800
Sorry to interrupt, joel.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, howie?

136
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,300
You might wanna hear this.

137
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,300
There's a situation at
the stock exchange media centre.

138
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,700
Some kind of protest.

139
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
Okay... so?

140
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,100
They say they're grayson kearns
account holders;

141
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,000
They want you to come down
and talk.

142
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,700
"Homeless,
thanks to grayson kearns."

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,700
Thoughts?

144
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,100
Well, you could go down,

145
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,900
Put in some face time before
this turns into something.

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,900
Yeah, i could.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
You know,
you wanna gift-Wrap me

148
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Before you send me down there
to be a scapegoat, howie?

149
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,700
They're calling your bluff
on live tv

150
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,900
And they've got a headstart.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Look, i'll go down there,

152
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
But what am i supposed
to say to these guys?

153
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,500
Listen, fellas,
i'm really sorry.

154
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,800
This is just the price you pay
for not planning ahead.

155
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
Yeah, they're going to enjoy
hearing me say that, right?

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Look,
all i'm saying is...

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,600
Ooh, or maybe i'll go down there

158
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,900
And tell them that
we're in a mental recession;

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That, uh, we're all turning
into a nation of whiners

160
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,200
And we all have to stand beside
the choices we make.

161
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,100
The choice not to rent.

162
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,700
Joel.

163
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,300
Howie, i'm joking.

164
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Joking.

165
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,700
Go down there,
give 'em my personal regrets,

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,100
Tell them i'm tied up
for a little bit.

167
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,600
Which is the truth,
okay?

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,700
Listen, howie,

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,900
There's gonna be camera's,
so, you know... be nice.

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm always nice.

171
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
So, moving on...

172
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
Oh, i see.

173
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,000
So, we're free to access
the customer relations section

174
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
Of your website.

175
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,700
Come on.

176
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,100
That could be a problem
'cause i don't have a computer.

177
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,600
Or a house to put one in.

178
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,500
Mister...?

179
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,400
Do you really care
what my name is?

180
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
I'm sure mr. Graves would
consider a written request

181
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,200
For a private meeting.

182
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,400
As i'm sure you
can appreciate,

183
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,900
These are busy
and challenging times

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
For us all.

185
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,000
We look forward to you
getting in touch.

186
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,800
Thanks so much.

187
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,700
We'll remove them.

188
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,500
No, let them stay.

189
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
They don't wanna
see that on tv.

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,100
That's not supposed
to happen.

191
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,300
It's the same old
brush off.

192
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
I thought joel graves
was a lush for the media,

193
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,600
Couldn't resist
the spotlight?

194
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,100
Yeah, well, it's fine.

195
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,000
It's fine.

196
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,800
Plan b.

197
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,800
We have a "plan b"?

198
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,500
Yeah. I'm going up.

199
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,100
Then what?

200
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Then you'll see.

201
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,100
Come on up,
i'll tell you on the way.

202
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,800
You stayin'?

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,200
Right here.

204
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,100
Stay tight, stay tight.

205
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,700
Okay, go-Go-Go, go!

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Code 113.
Elevator 1.

207
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,600
It's not gonna work.

208
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,500
Yes, it is.

209
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
He won't come down.

210
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Let's call it off.

211
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
No.

212
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,600
This is "plan b."

213
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
All those nights
we spent talking about this,

214
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,900
I'm not walking away.

215
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,900
You do this and we're
in deep. Sit down with us

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,300
And someone is gonna do
this right.

217
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,300
Good morning.

218
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,900
I'd like to speak
to joel graves.

219
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Make the call.

220
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,500
Do it now!

221
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:15,999
<b><i>Flashpoint
Season 02 - Episode 05
** Business as Usual **</b></i>

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
Probably the same as you.

223
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
There's no place
like this.

224
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,000
No work like this.

225
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,200
With your skills,

226
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,200
You could work any number
of different places.

227
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,500
You did well
in undercover.

228
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,500
Yeah.

229
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,500
I've done my time
behind enemy lines.

230
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,600
Enemy?

231
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,500
Sorry, i don't mean...

232
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,700
Now, you know,
the whole war zone imagery

233
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,500
Doesn't really fly
around here.

234
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,100
Okay, sorry.

235
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
You know what i mean.
Do i?

236
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
It's an expression,
come on.

237
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,600
Uh, oh yeah,

238
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,600
It's a pretty revealing
expression.

239
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,900
You're mirroring me.
What?

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,300
Your body language.

241
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,199
You're showing me
"me" now.

242
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
Do you know
you're doing that?

243
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,200
Or is that just
reflex by now

244
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
From all your time
among "the enemy"?

245
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,900
Constable sabine,

246
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,100
You got the bonding
moves down,

247
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Belonging,

248
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,000
Being what someone
wants to see,

249
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,300
And that's all very,
very useful.

250
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,600
But it concerns me
a little...

251
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,600
When your psych eval
shows inconsistencies

252
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,600
On self-Reporting.

253
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
It's like you can't keep
your story straight

254
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,400
About who you are.

255
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,800
This job,
connecting to people,

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,900
I need to know you've got
something to draw from.

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,300
Team one, suit up.

258
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,300
Hot call, hot call.

259
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Gunmen at large
in the commerce tower.

260
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,400
Someone to draw from.

261
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Pick this up later.

262
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,800
Awesome.
Awesome, yeah.

263
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,800
Kira,
how many gunmen?

264
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,700
We have multiple witnesses
reporting a single gunman

265
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,900
Or pair of gunmen,

266
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,600
At different areas
on the 11th floor.

267
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,000
Could be one suspect,
could be a team.

268
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,199
What are they carrying?

269
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,300
Handgun, rifle, shotgun?
Take your pick.

270
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,200
Joel graves.

271
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,400
Just need a minute
of your time.

272
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,200
Joel graves, do you know
where his office is?

273
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,400
<i>Commerce tower will be
under lockdown</i>

274
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,700
We're not here to hurt anyone,
we just...

275
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,200
We just wanna talk
to your boss.

276
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,400
Do you know where
his office is?

277
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,600
Just wanna talk
to your boss.

278
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,700
Where's his office?

279
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,600
Graves!

280
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,400
Second floor.
Let's go.

281
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,700
She rappels like a spider.

282
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,900
Thinks on her feet.

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Is it time for a vote yet
or what?

284
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
I'm thinking i need
to think some more.

285
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,600
She's a no-Brainer.

286
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,200
She's got the chops,
no question about it.

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,700
But...

288
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Boss, needs to think.

289
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,800
Copy that.
Boss needs to think.

290
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Let's go.

291
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,100
I'm gonna just, uh...

292
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,300
I'm gonna call security,
see what the deal is.

293
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Joel.

294
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
It's the men
that wanted to see you.

295
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
One of them's got a gun.

296
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,000
Hey!

297
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,400
Come here! Hey!

298
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Get out of my way!

299
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,600
I don't know
how this could happen?

300
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,500
How anything like this
could happen?

301
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,000
I think you'll find out
everything you need to know,

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,700
Find out
when he gets down here.

303
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,100
If i were you,
i'd stand back.

304
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,900
Go on! Get out of here!

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,300
Stand back!

306
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,700
Number of suspects?

307
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,500
2 guys split off
from the older one

308
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
In the media centre,

309
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,600
Demanding to see
the grayson kearns ceo.

310
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,700
The media centre,
what's that?

311
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,100
It's down the escalator,
off the trading floor.

312
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,900
It's where the reporters do
all their stand-And-Talks,

313
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,500
Lots of big screens,
tickers,

314
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,700
It's like they're
right there.

315
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,500
Subject in the media centre,
is he armed?

316
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,900
No. No, visible weapons.

317
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,100
My guys are
holding him there.

318
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,700
Cops just showed.
I've got cctv tapes.

319
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,100
Eddie, i'll take the guy
in the media centre.

320
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,300
Spike, you're my second.

321
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,600
Set up a command post
at that security desk.

322
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,900
Where were the gunmen
last seen?

323
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,200
Grayson kearns head office,
11th floor.

324
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,500
Lou, sam, wordy,
with me.

325
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
We need one of those
elevators unlocked.

326
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,500
Keep the rest of them
shut down tight.

327
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
He what?

328
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,300
The guy's spilling gasoline
everywhere!

329
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,500
Hey, buddy,
what's going on?

330
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
What're you doin'?

331
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,800
Don't touch the camera.
Camera stays on.

332
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm not gonna touch
anything.

333
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
What're you doing
that for?

334
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,600
Come on,
just put that down.

335
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,300
Stay back!
Stay back!

336
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,400
Okay, okay.

337
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,500
But why don't we
just go outside,

338
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
We can talk about this?

339
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,400
I warned you...
stay back.

340
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,700
Nobody comes any closer.

341
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,700
Okay, okay.

342
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,900
All right, let's all
just move back.

343
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Let's give this man
some space.

344
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,500
Give him some space.

345
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,700
11:09 a.M.

346
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,200
Sergeant gregory parker
initiates negotiation.

347
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,800
Subject is level red,
threatening self-Immolation.

348
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,700
Hi, my name's greg parker,

349
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,600
I'm with the police
strategic response unit.

350
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,700
And i'm here to listen

351
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,600
To whatever
you have to say, sir.

352
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,500
I'm here to help you.

353
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,299
I'm not going anywhere.

354
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,200
Nope, no one's gonna force you
to do anything.

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,200
Spike, let's get
the fire department on standby,

356
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,300
But no entry.

357
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,700
Repeat,
no entry until my command.

358
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
And let's get ambulances
in the area on standby as well.

359
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,300
Copy that.

360
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,300
Let's evacuate the area,

361
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,000
And then i need you
in the security room

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
With my guy,
all right?

363
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,200
Miss,
did you talk to him?

364
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,700
I want you to stay
right there, okay?

365
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,300
Spike, we've got
a gentleman here

366
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,800
Releasing gasoline
into an enclosed room

367
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,200
Without any ventilation.

368
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,500
The concentration of vapours
is high and growing

369
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,900
And he's holding
a lighter.

370
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,100
Well, it's not just the lighter
i'm worried about.

371
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,900
Anything sets off a spark,
you got a fireball.

372
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,600
Firearms for instance?

373
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,500
???Lethal, non-Lethal.

374
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,100
Muzzle flash
would be all it takes.

375
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,700
All right, copy that.

376
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,000
See if you can get some airflow
going in here too, okay?

377
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,500
Sir?

378
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,200
It's greg again.

379
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,200
What's your name?

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,500
If you don't want to tell me
that's fine,

381
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,000
You don't wanna talk to me
that's...

382
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Not a problem,
no pressure.

383
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,700
In fact, i tell you what?

384
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,400
I'll give you
one less thing

385
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,100
To worry about, okay?

386
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,400
I want everyone
with a firearm

387
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,300
To leave this room.

388
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,200
Everyone with a firearm.

389
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,100
Fast is good.
Right now.

390
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,800
Got it? Officers out.
Everybody out. You too.

391
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
That's it, guys.

392
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,300
Sergeant,
is that everybody?

393
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,100
Okay, all done.

394
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,300
You all right?

395
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,600
Got cctv of our subjects.

396
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,300
Portraits of the gunmen...
coming at you.

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll be right here.

398
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,400
Can we cut the video?

399
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,200
We can't reach our cameras
from here.

400
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,700
And i don't think he's gonna
want us to turn them off;

401
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,100
That's sort of why he's here.

402
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh yeah?
What'd he tell you?

403
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,900
Well, he and two others

404
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,300
Have been trying to get
joel graves's attention for a long time.

405
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,400
Joel graves? He's the guy
who collects a fat bonus

406
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,800
While rome burns, right?

407
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,200
Mm, this is the guy.

408
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay, i want you to tell me
about his company,

409
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,900
"Grayson kearns."

410
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,800
Okay.

411
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,500
Sru. Which way did they go?

412
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,900
Clear.

413
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,100
Everyone stay calm.

414
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,000
We're with the sru.

415
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,700
Stay calm, please, everyone.
Stay calm.

416
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,100
Hands where we can see 'em,
folks.

417
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
Stay calm.
Thank you.

418
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,700
Clear.
Hands where we can see 'em.

419
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
Folks, need to see
your hands please.

420
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,400
We're with the sru.

421
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,600
Let's see some hands.

422
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,900
Clear.

423
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Which way did the gunman go?

424
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,600
Sru, please stay calm.

425
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,900
Clear.

426
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,500
All right,
let me get this.

427
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,500
"Grayson kearns" gives away
mortgages like it's candy.

428
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,800
When the market slides,

429
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
They dump high risk clients
to the highest bidder, right?

430
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,900
??Who re-Offer it at rates
these guys can't afford.

431
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,400
You know they seem
like regular guys.

432
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,300
They probably just want
their houses back.

433
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
Yeah, i think our friend
wants more than that.

434
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,800
He tell you his name?

435
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Stan matthews.

436
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,700
Okay, thanks.

437
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,500
You can get out of here.
Thank you very much.

438
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
Fire department's
on standby, boss,

439
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,100
Waiting for permission
to deploy.

440
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,900
Negative.

441
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,400
Negative,
if he sees fire hoses,

442
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
He just needs a split second
to beat 'em the the punch

443
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,200
And spark an explosion.

444
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,800
Copy that.

445
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,700
They gotta stay out
of the line of sight.

446
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,400
Gotta keep thinking
outside the toolbox.

447
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,000
All right, sir,

448
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,900
I understand, uh...

449
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
You're looking for
some information

450
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,900
From joel graves.

451
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,400
He's been in the... spotlight
quite a bit these days, huh?

452
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,200
He's doing okay
for himself.

453
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,000
You talking about
the $22 million dollars?

454
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,900
His bonus?

455
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,100
Yeah-Yeah,
something like that.

456
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,200
Here's a guy who's got
four houses already.

457
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,700
Books a 5-Star caribbean resort
with his buddies

458
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,300
To brainstorm
how to make the most

459
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,300
Of these troubled times.

460
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,400
What can you do?

461
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,600
What do you want from him?

462
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,300
I want him down here.

463
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Okay.

464
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,400
All right,
let's work on that.

465
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,400
Spike, let's get a 20
on joel graves.

466
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,800
It's not too late.

467
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,000
What do you mean?

468
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,200
Maybe we walk away,
before the cops find us.

469
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,300
Lorne...

470
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm just saying.
All the times talked about it,

471
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,000
We never talked about it
happening like this.

472
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
Hands, please.
Let me see your hands please.

473
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,600
Sit down, take a seat.
Thank you.

474
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,800
Ma'am, let's see
your hands please.

475
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,600
Let's see your hands.
Take a seat.

476
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,500
We have id on one of our guys.
Stan matthews.

477
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,100
He's a grayson kearns
account holder.

478
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,600
They all are.

479
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,100
I've narrowed the national list
by city, male account holders,

480
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,300
There's still a lot.

481
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,200
Might wanna try
recent foreclosures.

482
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,000
Foreclosures...

483
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,100
Here he is, stan matthews.

484
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,600
There's another one
who lives on the same street,

485
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
A lorne wilkes.

486
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,700
Good.
See any other connections?

487
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Hold on...

488
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,300
There's a brian baumann,

489
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,600
Same employer as lorne wilkes.

490
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,700
Ex-Employer.

491
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
They were both recently
laid off from the auto plant.

492
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,300
Copy that.

493
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,500
You know what'd be
really great, kira?

494
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,600
Some cell numbers fror these guys.
Copy-Copy.

495
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,600
You need to send someone now.
Right now!

496
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,800
Think of stan.

497
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,200
You remember that night,
right?

498
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah.
You with me?

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

500
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,900
Hey. Hey!

501
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
I'm gonna need
your keys.

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,900
Elevator.

503
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,700
You'll need this one
for the elevator.

504
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,700
Yeah.

505
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Thanks.

506
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,200
I'm telling you,
they're at my door.

507
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,200
Okay.

508
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,900
Mr. Graves.

509
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,800
Uh...

510
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,200
What can i do
for you guys?

511
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,300
You're coming with us
downstairs.

512
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,400
You're gonna go
on camera.

513
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,300
Uh, and then what?

514
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
Oh, we'll talk about trust.

515
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,400
Some promises you didn't keep.

516
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,600
"Your future first."

517
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,200
You-You don't care
about our future.

518
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,400
His family's out
on the street,

519
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,700
I'm livin' out of the car
the past few weeks,

520
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
So, whose future's
coming first here?

521
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
No-No-No,
we're going downstairs.

522
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Okay, listen to me,

523
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,100
I'm sorry to hear
about your losses,

524
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,300
I am, but...

525
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,300
I've been juggling
thousands of losses, guys.

526
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,300
It's my job.

527
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I'm just doing my job.

528
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,800
You know what
your job is now?

529
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
It's to own up.

530
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
Take responsibility.
Hunh?

531
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,100
Let go!

532
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Get...

533
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,600
Let go!

534
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,900
Okay, okay.

535
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,500
We need to end this,
huh?

536
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,700
We need to end this.

537
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,700
Brian.

538
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,600
It's right there.
Thank you.

539
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,700
We're gonna need
your pass key.

540
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,100
Those guys took it.

541
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,800
How is that fair?

542
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,200
Can you explain
that to me?

543
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,200
I don't know.
You tell me, stan.

544
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,300
It was just me and carol.

545
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,300
39 years.

546
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,500
I hated math,
she hated power tools,

547
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,900
So we had a deal:

548
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
She managed the books,
i worked.

549
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,700
We scraped together
everything we had

550
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,200
And we found this little...
mutt of a fixer-Upper.

551
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Didn't look like much,
but we knew what it could be.

552
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,300
And i'll never...

553
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll never understand
why she would do

554
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,900
Something like that.

555
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,900
What do you mean?
What-What happened, stan?

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I loved that woman.

557
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I loved her.

558
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm so fed up.

559
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,800
Stan, stan, it's okay.
It's okay.

560
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,500
Really is okay.

561
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,200
Why don't we take
a break?

562
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,500
Huh?

563
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Tell you the truth,

564
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,400
I'm getting a headache
from all the fumes.

565
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,200
Why don't we just step outside
and just get some air?

566
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,100
No! No!

567
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,900
Okay, you don't have
to do that, stan.

568
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,800
No!

569
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,600
It's locked.

570
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,500
Okay?

571
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,800
Police, don't move!

572
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Police!

573
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,800
Clear.

574
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,700
Ed, we got a hallway.

575
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,400
Ed, elevators are locked down,
right?

576
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,700
Affirmative.

577
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,500
<i>Well, elevator 3
is on the move.</i>

578
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,000
Floor 12, going down.
Hang on.

579
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,500
Where are the other
elevators?

580
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,500
Ground floor.

581
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,300
Stairs are faster.

582
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,300
All right, head's up, guys,
subjects are on the move,

583
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,400
They probably have
security cards and keys.

584
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,400
Spike, get me uniforms
on all the elevator exits,

585
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,400
In case they step out
before they reach bottom.

586
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,000
Security has reported two men
entering the elevator,

587
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,300
Just two?
Where's graves?

588
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Kira's got cell numbers.
You wanna give it a try?

589
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,900
Negative,
you make the call, spike.

590
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
I need my full attention
on my subject here.

591
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,800
They're not responding
to the phone.

592
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,500
They've stopped the elevator
between floors.

593
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,900
Floor 7, floor 6.

594
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,700
Sam and lou,
cover the 6th floor exit.

595
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,600
We'll go above.

596
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
Copy that.
Bravo team proceeding on foot.

597
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
Bravo team in position.

598
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Still no response
on the phone.

599
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What can you tell me about
overriding manual controls?

600
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,000
Listen up, guys,
we got a window of opportunity.

601
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,500
There's a trap in the ceiling.

602
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,300
I don't feel like dropping in
without a distraction.

603
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
I hear you.

604
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,700
Cs gas standing by.

605
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,900
No 555's.

606
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,400
9 cubic feet of air
in there.

607
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,700
What about 517's?

608
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,100
Still overkill in that space.
Ditto flashbangs.

609
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,400
Serious risk of eye
and ear damage.

610
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,900
Hey, how about this,
uh, training flashbangs?

611
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,200
Used them on the recruits
this morning.

612
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,000
You got training flashbangs?
Sure.

613
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Just open the doors
a little first.

614
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,000
Reduce the concussive effect.

615
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
I like it,
let's do it.

616
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,900
Okay, the elevator has two
emergency override patterns:

617
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,900
A ground floor

618
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,200
And a nearest floor
cycle pattern.

619
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,500
Dropping down a floor,
we'll deploy from above.

620
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,800
Sam, lou, meet and greet
when the doors open.

621
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,900
Copy.
Got it.

622
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,300
Boss, you good with this?

623
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,700
Just go careful.

624
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,200
These guys don't have records,

625
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
It just sounds like
they've been pushed too hard.

626
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Wordy.

627
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,500
Copy that.
Distraction standing by.

628
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Standing by.

629
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,500
Spike,
countdown override procedure.

630
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,000
5...

631
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,900
4... 3...

632
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,600
2... 1...

633
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,100
Triggering override.

634
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,400
Distraction on my go.

635
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,700
Back off.
Back off!

636
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,000
Hold.
Hold, eddie.

637
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,400
He's got graves.

638
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
11:36 a.M.

639
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,500
Armed subject with hostage
in elevator.

640
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,900
We have one subject
in the elevator with joel graves.

641
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,300
He's armed
with a snubnose.38.

642
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,300
Fall back.
New deal.

643
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,600
Hostage situation.
Decrease pressure.

644
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,900
Copy that.

645
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,200
Wordy, i'm coming up.

646
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,400
Spike,
keep trying the phone,

647
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,500
Maybe they're ready
to talk now.

648
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,300
No-No-No-No.

649
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,900
See if we can get
the ventilation going in here,

650
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
And keep your guys
out of sight.

651
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,700
All right, change of plans,
spike.

652
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,100
Go for the ground floor
override sequence.

653
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,900
We'll have more tac options
in the open lobby

654
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,200
Than in one of these hallways.

655
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,700
Freeze! Freeze!

656
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,200
I'm giving up.

657
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,000
Put your hands on your head!
Hands on your head!

658
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Stay right there!

659
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,600
Stay right where you are!

660
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,200
Come here.

661
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
We got a subject
who has surrendered.

662
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,200
Copy that.
Sam, you're sierra.

663
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,900
And, lou, let's bring the guy
down here.

664
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,000
Copy.

665
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,300
Okay, got him.

666
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,500
What's he gonna do?

667
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,700
That depends
on your friend.

668
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
Please don't hurt him.

669
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,300
We don't want to.

670
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,700
Why don't you
help us out?

671
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,600
What's that smell?

672
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,800
<What's going on?!

673
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
I'm trying to help
your friend.

674
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,400
What happened?

675
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,900
You don't know?

676
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,200
He's soaked the room with gas,
including himself,

677
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,500
And now he's threatening
to light it up.

678
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Oh my god. No, no.

679
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,000
None of this was supposed
to go like this.

680
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,700
Let me talk to...
do that.N't let you

681
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,700
Lou, i got him,
it's okay.

682
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,900
You wanna help
your friend?

683
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,000
You need to keep
talking to me.

684
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,900
Spike.

685
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,000
The gas in the media room?

686
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,400
I think we got another option.

687
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,700
Talk to me, lou.

688
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,000
How close can we get
to the subject?

689
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,100
You gonna answer that?

690
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,500
You know, you don't seem
like the kind of guy.

691
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,800
What kind of guy?

692
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,200
The kind of guy
who makes his point with a gun.

693
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
And what would you know
about that?

694
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,300
In my line of work,
you meet a lot of people,

695
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,100
You get a sense.

696
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,800
You know,
i got two kids.

697
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,000
My buddy lorne has two kids.

698
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,700
They went out
for a drive today,

699
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,100
Cross-Country,

700
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,500
To go live in a house
that smells like other people.

701
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,200
They got to watch their dad
sell everything that they owned

702
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,200
For less than what you pay
for a business brunch.

703
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,300
Do you think about what
kind of guy lorne was

704
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,300
Before you sold out
his family's future?

705
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,400
No one's accountable.

706
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,700
We're all just pieces of paper
crossing his desk.

707
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,000
He sells a piece of paper
and we lose everything.

708
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,700
And that's what happened
to stan too?

709
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,500
Brian and me worked
at the plant 11 years

710
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,600
'Til it closed 5 months ago.

711
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,200
Stan lives on brian's street.

712
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,000
We've all been buddies
a long time.

713
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,900
Brian thought...

714
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,800
He was doing us a favour.

715
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,500
Here's these amazing
mortgage deals.

716
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,900
And he talked you
and stan into it?

717
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,700
Me and carol.

718
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Carol is stan's wife?

719
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,400
Late wife.

720
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,400
Now, stan...

721
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800
Stan fixed his place up
with his own hands.

722
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,400
Did it for carol.

723
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,000
Did it to give her the home
she always dreamed about.

724
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,300
Then one day they get
a letter in the mail,

725
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,700
Her payments have
been tripled

726
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
And there's no way
they can pay.

727
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,300
Their pension's already...
decimated.

728
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,900
What're they gonna give up?

729
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,700
Heating?
Groceries?

730
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,500
She sees it's coming,
right?

731
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,500
All he put into it,
all he did for her,

732
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
It's all gonna be gone.

733
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,100
But she can't bring herself
to tell him,

734
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,600
So she hides it, right?

735
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,100
And hides it...

736
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,200
And one day,
she's out of time.

737
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,600
Makes no sense.

738
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,800
I mean... you love someone,
you stick around,

739
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,400
You fight, but...

740
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,000
She couldn't.

741
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,200
He comes home
after work one day

742
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
And he finds her...

743
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,000
He finds his wife.

744
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,500
That wasn't a great day.

745
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,700
You really think graves
is gonna care?

746
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,600
Or you just want him
to see what he's done?

747
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,900
We want him to see the people
he's wrecked, up close.

748
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,700
We want his face
on camera saying,

749
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,300
"I made this choice,

750
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,700
I sold out a thousand families

751
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,800
For the price
of my $22,000,000 dollar bonus,

752
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I knew what i was doing
and i did it anyway

753
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,500
And i'm sorry."

754
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,900
Okay.

755
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,200
Constable.

756
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,000
Eddie, i need to stay here
with stan.

757
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,900
That's all it'll take!

758
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,500
I want you to meet the elevator
to start negotiating.

759
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,700
You catch that conversation
i had with my friend, lorne?

760
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah, i copy.

761
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,500
Okay.

762
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,100
Spike,
start the override procedure.

763
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
Okay, listen to me,
please.

764
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,100
No, you listen to me.

765
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,400
You are gonna do this,
do you understand me?

766
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,700
You are gonna do this

767
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,300
Or you're not walking
outta here,

768
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,000
You're not going home.
Okay.

769
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,900
Do you understand?

770
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,800
I can't hold the elevator doors
open when they hit the lobby.

771
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,500
It'll cycle open
automatically.

772
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
And we're at 5...

773
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,400
4... 3...

774
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,400
2... 1...

775
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Move away.

776
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,600
Move ayay.

777
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,900
My name's ed lane.

778
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,500
I'm with the police
strategic response unit.

779
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,700
How you doing?

780
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,600
Get out of the way.

781
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,600
It's brian, right?

782
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,500
Brian?

783
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,800
We're coming through.

784
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,700
What's going on?

785
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,300
Have you got him?
Is he coming?!

786
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,000
Just try and understand
where we're at, stan.

787
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Boss, me and lou
are working on option b.

788
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,300
Big reno on the main floor.

789
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,500
Big paint job.

790
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,800
We may be able
to neutralize the lighter.

791
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Could buy you a few seconds.

792
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,900
Yeah, i hear you.
That's good.

793
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,100
You better get him here.
I'm done waiting!

794
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,300
Just calm, just calm, stan.
Just stay with me.

795
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,000
Lou's got uniforms
moving on it.

796
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,800
Okay, but move fast,
move real fast.

797
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,500
And give ed whatever background
you can on brian baumann.

798
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,900
Okay.

799
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,500
Still workin' on it.
We're still workin' on it.

800
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,000
5 more minutes, stan.
5 more minutes.

801
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,800
I got the solution.

802
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,200
Copy that.

803
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
He's gonna talk.

804
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,600
You gonna talk, right?

805
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,200
I know what's going on here,
brian, okay?

806
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,100
And i gotta tell you
right out of the gate,

807
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,700
I'm sympathetic.

808
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,600
Laid off from the auto plant
five months ago.

809
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
Lost his house
to foreclosure.

810
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,500
No listed address.

811
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,700
No family.

812
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,700
We got a lot of people here
who are very sympathetic.

813
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They understand exactly
what it is you're going through.

814
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,900
No, they don't.
They don't.

815
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
Yeah, they do.

816
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,100
No, they don't.

817
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
That's why we're going in there
with the cameras,

818
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,100
And he's gonna say
what he's done.

819
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,800
That's what we're here for.

820
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,700
I get that, brian.

821
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,200
Okay, i get that.

822
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
When i was a kid,

823
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,100
I saw my folks go through
the very same thing.

824
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,900
You feel helpless.

825
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,200
You get it?

826
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Then you get why this guy
has to go in there

827
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,700
And own up
to what he's done.

828
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,700
Where is he?

829
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,000
What do you want, stan?

830
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,600
Why aren't you
letting him through?

831
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,000
Brian and lorne...

832
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They want to make things
right again.

833
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,900
Lorne wants a house
for his family,

834
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,900
I get that.

835
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,100
But what do you want
from joel graves?

836
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,300
I want him in here.

837
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,700
You know what i think
you really want?

838
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,200
What you really want,
you know he can't give it you.

839
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,600
You know he can't
bring it back.

840
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,900
Lou, you gotta hurry,

841
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,200
You gotta hurry,
lou.

842
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,000
Okay, copy.
On our way.

843
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,200
Don't try to stop me.

844
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,900
I owe this.

845
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,500
I owe this to carol.

846
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
To carol?

847
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,300
Stan's wife.
"Recession suicide."

848
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,700
He found her
in the garage.

849
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,200
She had her good coat on.

850
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,400
Her good coat,
like she was going somewhere.

851
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,600
She left a note
on the hood of the car

852
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,500
'Cause she couldn't tell him.

853
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,900
And she, she thought
she let him down.

854
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,200
I hear you.

855
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,000
That's not right.
That's not right.

856
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,200
Yeah,
it's not right.

857
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,800
It's not right.

858
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,400
You hear me?

859
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,400
You get it?
Then you let me through.

860
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,400
Now, listen to me, brian.

861
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,000
In this job,
i hear a lot of people

862
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,500
Asking for a lot
of crazy things,

863
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
And what you're asking for,
it's not crazy.

864
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,900
It's not.

865
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,900
It's just not something...

866
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,700
It's not something
that we can do, okay?

867
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,400
We can't do it like this.

868
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,300
You know, i get it.
I get it.

869
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,300
You just, you just wanna
do right by your friends.

870
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,000
You just wanna do right
by stan.

871
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,400
Brian, stan is down there
right now,

872
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,900
Doused gasoline,
with a lighter,

873
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,200
And he's gonna light himself
on fire.

874
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,200
No. No.

875
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,100
Now, i know you've
lost a lot,

876
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,600
But you don't want
to lose stan too.

877
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,700
So i'm asking you,

878
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,100
Show him that this
isn't the way.

879
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,200
Just show him that there's
another way to end this.

880
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,100
Okay?

881
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Please?

882
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,100
Please.

883
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,200
Thank you.

884
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Weapon's down.
Weapon's down.

885
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,900
Thank you.

886
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Thanks.

887
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,900
And i know how hard it is
to lose someone.

888
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,100
To lose someone you love,

889
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,900
To lose something that's
so important to you

890
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,300
And have it ripped
out of your life.

891
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,700
You got ten seconds.

892
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
This isn't the way, stan.
It's not the way.

893
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,700
Your friends know that.

894
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,200
Your friends know
when it's time to stop.

895
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,300
You get him in here...

896
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Or this ends right now.

897
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,500
Just don't do it, stan.
Just don't do it.

898
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,800
Thank you,
you did the right thing.

899
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
You did the right thing.

900
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,700
Mr. Graves.
Hi.

901
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,200
What do you have
to tell us about today?

902
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,500
Hi, uh...
i'm joel graves and...

903
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,700
In response to today's events,

904
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,900
I'd just like to say
a few words,

905
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,800
Um...

906
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,800
I'm moved by the losses
of these men.

907
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Eddie...

908
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,300
And i understand the need
to turn to someone

909
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,300
For an explanation.

910
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,100
What these men lost was more
than four walls and a roof,

911
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,600
But that's the part
that i took from them.

912
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,100
It made sense on paper,
but up close...

913
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,600
It's a different story.

914
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,500
Let's go.

915
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,200
Up close...
it's not the same,

916
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,500
I'm sorry.

917
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,000
Stan, i'm sorry.

918
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,100
If there's anything
i can do to help?

919
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,400
Mr. Graves! Mr. Graves!

920
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,700
Well, he got up there,

921
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,800
Came clean,
said he was sorry,

922
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,900
That's what you wanted,
right?

923
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,900
It's not enough.

924
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,500
I know.

925
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,000
I know, nothing's gonna
take that pain away.

926
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,600
Now he wants to help.

927
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,300
How's he gonna do that?

928
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,500
Being sorry gets him
off the hook?

929
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,800
"I wanna help"
makes things better?

930
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
What's he gonna do?

931
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Is he in the business
of giving back lives?

932
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,500
What about my wife?

933
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Just don't do it,
stan.

934
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,600
Just don't.

935
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,600
Ready, serge.

936
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Go.

937
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Carol...

938
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Carol... carol...

939
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,500
12:16 p.M.

940
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,100
Third subject,
stan matthews, contained.

941
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,400
You know what?
She blew by everbydody in there.

942
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Nobody can touch her.

943
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,100
Greg, nobody.

944
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,300
So what's the problem?

945
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,600
You don't think
she'll work?

946
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
You don't wanna
let jules go?

947
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,300
Mm...

948
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,400
Constable sabine?

949
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Sit down.

950
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,300
Good call today?

951
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,000
Well, no one died.

952
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,300
This guy wanted to die today,
but he didn't get to.

953
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
This other guy,
he's got a family

954
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,900
Who's gonna go without
a father for a while.

955
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,300
This guy's going to jail

956
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,900
'Cause all he wanted to do
was help out his two friends.

957
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
I get it.

958
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah?

959
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,500
It's not black and white.

960
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,900
Everyone's a constable here.

961
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,100
There's no rising up
in the ranks.

962
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,200
You don't make more money

963
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,300
Because you risk your life
everyday,

964
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,900
You make less.
I know.

965
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,800
Mm-Hmm.

966
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,200
Not gonna be out
in the field alone,

967
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,300
You're gonna be in it
with a team.

968
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,400
I'm not gonna lie to you,

969
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,600
If jules makes it back,
she's got a place here.

970
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,300
Fair.

971
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,600
But that doesn't mean
i won't put my faith in you.

972
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm not gonna let you down.

973
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,300
Okay.

974
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,100
Yeah? Okay?

975
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,900
Yeah, let's keep
the peace.

976
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,000
Okay,
let's do that.

977
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,300
Thank you.

978
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
You're welcome.

979
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,900
We're gonna get through this.
