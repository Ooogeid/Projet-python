1
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,940
- zero one, wait on my scorpio.
- Zero one, copy.

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,430
Get those hands up.

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,260
your hands up. Keep your hands up!

4
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,400
Hang on. Here he comes.

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,300
I got the solution.

6
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,540
- Get down!Get down!
- No!

7
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,270
Don't! don't do it! Stop!

8
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,710
- No! Please!
- Please don't kill us! No!

9
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,150
{\a6}<i>2 hours earlier</i>

10
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:54,940
Why not?

11
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:56,696
What have I got to lose?

12
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,055
You sound very upset.

13
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,627
You're damn straight I am.

14
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:01,290
Look, I hear what you're saying, okay?

15
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:04,350
Stay in control. This
is your negotiation.

16
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:07,732
What do we need to do so
that we can all go home?

17
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:08,932
You can give me what I want.

18
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,011
I'd like to try.

19
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:11,911
You know what I'd really like?

20
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:13,770
I'd like some coke.

21
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:15,050
How about that, huh?

22
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:17,473
You give me an ounce, this is over.

23
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:21,002
- Hello!
- I'm gonna do it. Hello!

24
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:22,071
- A little help here.
- Hello!

25
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,852
- Hello!
- Hello!

26
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,421
You hear me, but you're
not doing nothing about it.

27
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:27,181
He's a lying pig.

28
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:29,951
- I'm not a liar.
- Don't argue. Just get him back.

29
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,380
Okay, look, you're obviously very upset.

30
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,043
Yes. Yes. You know what that means?

31
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:37,083
You know I really wish a cop
would negotiate us to safety.

32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,061
Come on, sam, just talk to them.

33
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:41,320
Dude, you know what I want!

34
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:44,690
- I'm not giving you cocaine, jackass.
- Bang. Bang.

35
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,922
Jackass? Did he say jackass?

36
00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:50,142
Okay, sam, let's talk this through.

37
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:52,853
Just give me a minute, sarge.

38
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,981
Can't you just give me
some more time, okay?

39
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:02,912
What about A...? Just give me a week.

40
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:06,173
Okay, a couple of days
then. Just a couple...

41
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,313
no, fine.

42
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:16,321
Maybe I'll get it tonight.

43
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,523
long way from kandahar, huh?

44
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:48,433
I was doing everything right, wasn't I?

45
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:52,181
Mirroring, emotional labeling, eye messaging,
everything in the book, but I just...

46
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,731
need to listen.

47
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:59,363
Look, you can kick ass like nobody's
business, and you look great in the cool pants,

48
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:02,253
but as long as you're out there, and
you're trying to talk to somebody,

49
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:06,780
you've got to be able to listen,
you've got to be able to connect.

50
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,400
I know, okay. It's just...

51
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:13,233
how do I connect to bad guys when
I spent four years shooting 'em?

52
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,781
I just need to finish this review.

53
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,062
No, you need time.

54
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:23,243
Field training, a little patience, okay?

55
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:26,501
Remember, you got the cool pants down.

56
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:38,443
12 months ago, this bank was city central's
lowest-performing branch in the downtown quarter.

57
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:45,292
Since then, thanks to all
of you, we're at number two.

58
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:51,531
Now, before we start the new week, I'd like to
highlight the current figures... from our sales team.

59
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:53,532
Top seller, third week running...

60
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,661
- I'm sorry, miss geller...
- please, join your group.

61
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:02,543
Top sales figure for
rsps and mutual funds...

62
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:06,273
goes to wendy trailor.
Great work, wendy.

63
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:12,272
Let's have an excellent
week, everyone. Thank you.

64
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:18,012
paul? Paul, a word?

65
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:22,760
Miss geller, I'm really
sorry. My wife has just D...

66
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:24,931
paul, please.

67
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:29,062
You don't have to apologize for what's
happening in your personal life ever.

68
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,412
Thank you.

69
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:32,671
- It's been a hard week.
- But...

70
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:37,741
you can't expect your team
to pull your weight, either.

71
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:40,800
It's a question of priorities.

72
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:42,932
Figure out yours, please.

73
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:45,750
- Yes, absolutely.
- That's all.

74
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:49,883
Oh, and could someone ask
security to call the alarm company?

75
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:53,283
There was an error code
with the door this morning.

76
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,793
Do you know who I am?

77
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:06,360
I said, do you know who I am?

78
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:08,223
- Yes.
- Good.

79
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:13,893
Then you know what to
do. I want $500,000.

80
00:05:13,907 --> 00:05:18,600
You're going to bring it back up
here, let me check it, and then I go.

81
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:20,243
- Okay.
- What did I say?

82
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:23,780
$500,000, I bring it back;
you check it, and then you go.

83
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:25,222
No dye packs.

84
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:26,650
No dye packs.

85
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,153
You check it. You go. No one gets hurt.

86
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:32,240
No one gets hurt. That's right.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

87
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:34,920
Let's go.

88
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:40,032
Go on.

89
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:03,682
Miss geller, is it okay if I grab the
foreign exchange file from your desk?

90
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,682
Uh, no.

91
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:10,033
No. Okay, well, I can ask somebody
else if you don't want me in there.

92
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,982
Do not go upstairs. Danger.

93
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,582
Robbery. Manager's office.

94
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:22,173
Robbery!

95
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:30,253
nobody move! Nobody move!

96
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,793
Hold it! You idiot! what did you do?

97
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:39,661
you're the big boss. You're the
big manager. Tell them to calm down.

98
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:40,521
Just calm down.

99
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:42,581
Everybody, calm down. Calm down.

100
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,463
- Tell 'em again!
- Calm down.

101
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:47,653
Or somebody's gonna
get hurt, you got it?

105
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:21,533
Team one, gear up. Loud call.

106
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,763
Armed robbery in
progress, young and queen.

107
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:27,412
Possible hostages,
single suspect, armed.

108
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:50,683
you got anything else? Okay. Thank you.

109
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,381
You got a video of him yet?

110
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:56,700
No. Alarm company says someone comes
in early morning with an override code.

111
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:58,530
I'm gonna assume it's our guy.

112
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,120
Video and audio are all cut.

113
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,691
So nobody could id him when he got away.

114
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:03,972
Still, would have been kind of
hard, what with the ski mask.

115
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,563
- Great.
- Not great?

116
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:08,212
MO matches the monday morning
bandit. You heard of him?

117
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:10,340
Like, five jobs this
year already. That guy?

118
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:13,983
Six. We got ourselves
a big fish. Guy's a pro.

119
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:17,593
He knows managers are trained not to pull
the alarm, but just hand over the cash.

120
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,433
Somebody didn't get that memo.

121
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:23,620
Last one, a couple of tellers gave him some
lip, and he shot them both without blinking.

122
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,822
What about back ways, loading doors?

123
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:27,272
Any entrance besides the main door?

124
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:28,251
No, it's just the front doors.

125
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:30,502
The fire exit's around
the other side, but it'S...

126
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,063
it's all out in the open.

127
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:34,712
So, there's no way we can get
in there without him seeing us?

128
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:38,281
Okay. Okay, you figure out how to
get into the impossible building,

129
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:41,521
and I'll go talk to the
killer with nothing to lose.

130
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,342
If you put it that way.

131
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:45,723
Sam, you're with ed.
Jules, you're my second.

132
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,050
Let me be second, sarge.

133
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,910
Easy, cowboy. You know you can't blow
or shoot anything up in the truck, right?

134
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,912
I could use the field training.

135
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:55,261
So long as you're not scared
of blowing anything up.

136
00:08:55,277 --> 00:08:58,220
- No.
- All right, follow me.

137
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:17,083
- yeah?
- Hello.

138
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,283
This is sergeant gregory parker with
the police strategic response unit.

139
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:23,060
Am I talking with the person in charge?

140
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:27,650
This is the guy you're gonna get a half
million in unmarked 50s for, and by noon.

141
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:29,930
First contact with
subject made 9:27 A.M.

142
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:33,132
Well, I hear you, but you're
the one in the bank, sir.

143
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,520
Look, I don't know who you
think you're dealing with.

144
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,756
I'm not some junkie that's
looking for his day's fix, okay?

145
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:43,295
You and I both know that once that alarm
went off, that vault went into hard lock,

146
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:47,957
and the only way you get it open now
is manual override, you know that, so...

147
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,450
you are gonna get me my money.

148
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:53,680
You're gonna get me my money.
You're gonna get me a car.

149
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:59,421
An open car, which you will park at
the northeast corner of young and queen,

150
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:03,281
and then sit back as me and my hostage
drive right off. Is all that clear?

151
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:07,571
You're gonna do this by noon, and if
you don't, here's what's gonna happen.

152
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:09,543
Here, tell him.

153
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,822
this is ruth geller.

154
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:19,493
I'm the manager of the bank.

155
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:24,093
Please do exactly as this man
says, or he'll kill us all.

156
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:25,920
That's very good. Nice job.

157
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:33,790
have we got an action plan yet?

158
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:36,771
What about the getaway car he wants?
Couldn't we just fit it with a tracker?

159
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:40,990
Yeah, we could, but he wants it at one of the
busiest intersections in this city at lunch hour.

160
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:45,693
My bet, he takes a hostage as a shield, gets within
ten feet of that car, shoots the hostage, runs.

161
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:49,560
When there's a crowd in the subway,
he'll lose us in two minutes.

162
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:52,381
This guy is smart. We got
to get to him before that.

163
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,362
Subway.

164
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:57,942
- You ever hear of joe sampson?
- Underground crew joe sampson?

165
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:01,933
He always used to say, the best banks
to hit were the ones by the subways.

166
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:04,952
Underground access, breakable walls.

167
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,332
Nobody sees a thing.

168
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:11,283
How the hell do you know joe sampson?

169
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:13,921
It takes a village.

170
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,710
Yeah, we've got just over two hours.

171
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,241
What do we do when he demands his money?

172
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,810
Refer to a high authority, get
concessions, try to keep him on the line.

173
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:28,351
Good. So, how do we make
a connection with this guy?

174
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:32,450
Can talk anybody out of anything
if he thinks you don't understand.

175
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,873
So what do you understand?

176
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,493
I don't know. Guy's a thief.

177
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:40,232
You take pride in your job;
so does he. Connection. Right?

178
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:43,131
But remember what the point is,
sam. It's not you. It's not him.

179
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:48,463
It's those hostages. It's
ruth skellar. She's the point.

180
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:58,120
okay, you got my money?

181
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:01,980
Okay. Now, passed on your
requests to my superiors,

182
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:04,850
but one thing that'll help us is
a sign of good faith on your part.

183
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:07,813
Yeah, this is where I'm supposed to
start turning over my hostages, I guess.

184
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,691
That's not going to happen.

185
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:12,190
It's nice dealing with a professional.

186
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:15,313
Six banks, six getaways. That's
something. That's planning.

187
00:12:15,326 --> 00:12:18,071
Is that why you've always worked
alone? That's easier to plan.

188
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:19,611
Easier to plan, that's right, yeah.

189
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:22,430
And you're alone now, too,
right? Part of the plan.

190
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,642
It's like I tell my guys, you fail
the plan, you plan to fail, am I right?

191
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,933
Something like that.

192
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:33,930
And I respect that, but how
long can you keep doing this?

193
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:37,242
I'm just saying you know
how this usually ends, right?

194
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:39,550
Don't we all want to go home?

195
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:41,121
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

196
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:42,410
What does that even mean?

197
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,643
How am I supposed to do that?

198
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:45,483
Is it the last job you're worried about?

199
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,760
Shooting the tellers,
what was it 14, 15 times?

200
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,810
That says to me that
something went very wrong.

201
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:53,061
Something that you
didn't want to do, right?

202
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,500
Yeah, that's right.
That's nothing I wanted.

203
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:58,441
Yeah, doesn't sound like you.

204
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:01,183
But it is me. All right.

205
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:04,512
That's me and I don't get what I want.

206
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,813
And I advise you to remember that.

207
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,531
Just remember it.

208
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,581
- Catch the remorse about the shooting?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:17,711
Yep. Not the typical antisocial profile.

210
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:22,683
Check this with the holdup squad.

211
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:27,481
Hey, eddie, how are we doing
with our delivered action plan?

212
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:29,520
Heading underground now, boss.

213
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:44,771
Excuse me.

214
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:52,030
What do you want?

215
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:55,793
People need to go to the bathroom.

216
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:59,011
So?

217
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:00,581
So...

218
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:05,171
so I assume you don't want these
people dirtying themselves on the floor.

219
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:07,632
And why would I care?

220
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:11,303
Because it's just going to make
them more afraid, and on edge.

221
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,890
I'm just trying to make
this easier for everybody...

222
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:17,080
you want to make things easier,
sit down and shut up. Sit down.

223
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:22,873
We're in the tunnel under the subway.

224
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:25,692
Jules, distraction on my go.

225
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,350
Jules, where are we?

226
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,633
Good to go. Team?

227
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:35,303
Checking wall thickness.

228
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:42,481
okay, I told you noon.

229
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,850
We're still working on everything.

230
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:46,120
I just wanted to warn
you about something.

231
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:49,380
The manual alarm, when it was
tripped, it automatically reset,

232
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:51,401
so in about a minute
it's going to go off again

233
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:55,230
and I just need you to stay
calm when that happens.Okay?

234
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:57,522
That's all I wanted to say.

235
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,670
Get back.

236
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:11,732
- Ready, jules?
- Ready when you are.

237
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,780
Five, four, three, two...

238
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:22,083
calm down!

239
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,993
We're in. Basement's ours.

240
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,231
Thanks. Will do.

241
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,082
Nice catch.

242
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:37,983
Littler fish.

243
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:39,781
Team, listen up.

244
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,550
Subject is not who we thought.

245
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,032
Monday morning bandits' murders
were execution-style, two bullets.

246
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:48,511
But the story the press got was a
bloodbath-- multiple shots fired.

247
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:51,211
The subject does not
contradict the press version.

248
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:54,851
That's all he knew. So, we
have no idea who this guy is.

249
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:57,131
We're moving up.

250
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,823
- Excuse me...
- What?

251
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,263
This woman has asthma.
She needs her medication.

252
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:04,873
So what?

253
00:16:04,888 --> 00:16:08,681
I'm doing my part to keep these
people calm. Can't you do yours?

254
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:11,080
Want to tell me how to do my
job? Is that what you want to do?

255
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:12,440
No, I... yeah, go ahead.

256
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:14,422
- Oh, my god.
- Tell me.

257
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:18,090
You sit down! Sit down,
sit down now! Sit down you!

258
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:22,281
boss, subject's gone active.

259
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:25,160
We're moving in. We're east...

260
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,843
police! Police!

261
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:30,611
Everybody out! Move to the front!

262
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,640
Police! Get these people out of here.

263
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:35,041
Move! Move! Out of the way.

264
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,911
Right there. Right there.

265
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:39,270
Set the gun down. Set the gun down.

266
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,253
Put your gun down!

267
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,140
Set the gun down. We're
not going anywhere.

268
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:44,501
I'm telling you, get out of the bank!

269
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:46,871
Sir, put the gun down now!

270
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,880
Get out or I kill
her! I tell you I will.

271
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:52,283
- We're not leaving.
- Well, then she dies. Three...

272
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:54,961
- please.
- And in two...

273
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,452
and in one...

274
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:01,203
team one, we're coming out.

275
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:03,921
- Subject still has a hostage.
- Go!

276
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:14,122
Lock the door.

277
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:17,732
Hurry up! Come on, come on.

278
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:40,572
oh, god!

279
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:43,293
George!

280
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:48,971
****connect the video,
but there's no audio.

281
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,853
Here we go.

282
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:57,293
And freeze it there.

283
00:17:57,945 --> 00:18:00,223
Get the security guy.

284
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,922
Can we get the security
guard in here, please?

285
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:06,000
Look at them. They're just... she's just
looking at him like they know each other.

286
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,743
Yeah.

287
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:12,340
Hey, buddy. This guy ring any bells?

288
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,510
- That's george.
- Who's george?

289
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,203
George orston. Head of security
here at the bank. He was my boss.

290
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,291
Was until when?

291
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,703
Uh, till about two months
ago. When she fired him.

292
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:39,503
10:58, subject's employee record,
delivered by constable lewis young.

293
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:41,103
Been at the bank since '81.

294
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:43,811
Head of security for the past ten years.

295
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:46,142
He's no career criminal.
We need a new strategy.

296
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:47,451
Initiate stockholm?

297
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:51,163
Hey, doc, thanks for coming. We've got
a disgruntled employee. Any thoughts?

298
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:53,731
I had four of those
cases in the last month.

299
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:58,301
Okay, you need to look for inadequate
personalities, substance abuse.

300
00:18:58,315 --> 00:19:01,321
Appeal to shared experience,
validate his emotional reality.

301
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:03,870
I hear you. Losing your
job, I'd be pissed, too.

302
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:06,412
Let him know we've id'd him,
we lose tactical advantage.

303
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:08,452
Yeah, but I gain
intimacy. I gain a name.

304
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:12,063
Yeah, but it's going to be hard to calm him
down when he knows there's a camera on hiM.

305
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:13,831
Going to need a cover story.

306
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:15,941
Right, noted.

307
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:23,932
Hey, guys. What do we
have on his hostage?

308
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:27,612
Miss trailor, you want to tell sergeant
parker here what you just told us.

309
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,972
Look, what george is doing--
I'm not saying it's right--

310
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:34,180
but ruth skellar came
in around a year ago.

311
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:35,072
Corporate clean-up.

312
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:37,993
We were in trouble, and
she turned us around.

313
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:40,543
But a lot of people lost their jobs.

314
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:43,060
And those of us that stayed, half
of us are losing our families.

315
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:44,641
My wife had a baby a week ago.

316
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:48,920
I barely see either of them, but it's
not like skellar cares. Woman's a robot.

317
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:53,341
I'm just saying if I was her, I wouldn't want
to be alone with a former employee who was armed.

318
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,160
Please, george.

319
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:05,373
Shut up! I don't want to hear one
word out of you, you understand?

320
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,911
Not a peep.

321
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,272
Subject's still got a clear view
of the bank from that hallway.

322
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,461
I don't see us pulling
the entry trick again.

323
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:20,190
I still think you should
try initiating stockholm.

324
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:24,032
According to the manual, a subject with
a hostage is an object of anger or scorn.

325
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,383
His negotiator should attempt to...

326
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:29,092
humanize the hostage to the hostage
taker. I know the manual, okay?

327
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:32,960
Once this guy knows he lost his cover,
he'll be thinking his life is over.

328
00:20:32,976 --> 00:20:34,961
And he's holed up with the
woman that made it happen.

329
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:38,133
So my goal is getting him to
think about anything but her, okay?

330
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:38,931
- boss,
- I just...

331
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,780
boss, when you talk this guy out, you're
going to have the white covered already.

332
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:45,282
I want to put snipers
on red just in case.

333
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:49,190
We need a side solution. Why don't
braddock and I take zero one and two?

334
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:52,401
Okay, do it.

335
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,990
- yeah?
- Is this george orston?

336
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:05,460
I'll take that as a yes.

337
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:08,801
A colleague identified
your voice, george, so...

338
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:11,762
can we talk straight?

339
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:14,420
First of all, this is a big relief.

340
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,193
We thought you were a pretty bad guy.

341
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:18,610
But now that I've seen your file,

342
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:23,882
I think you're a guy who got kicked to
the curb and now wants a little payback.

343
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,402
I don't think you want to hurt anybody.

344
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:26,971
Don't tell me what I want.

345
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:30,862
You know exactly what I want.
It's exactly the mey fore.

346
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,012
And now, I know I can't trust you.

347
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:34,711
I want you to trust me, george.

348
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:38,762
Yeah, well, then, you shouldn't have sent
in the cavalry, then, should you have?

349
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,220
You know what?

350
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:44,382
I was going to give you just
less than an hour from here,

351
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:47,973
but now, after what you've done,
that's going to be a half an hour.

352
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:51,380
You don't give me what
I want in one-half hour,

353
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:53,642
I'm going to shoot her right here.

354
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:55,442
Get his focus off her, onto you.

355
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:57,201
George, listen to me,
I'll do everything I can,

356
00:21:57,238 --> 00:22:00,101
but a half hour is not a lot of
time to get you that kind of cash.

357
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:02,081
Cash? What am I going to do with cash?

358
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:04,750
Oh, this is... this is what you're
going to do. Okay, you're going to...

359
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,962
you're going to transfer
that money right in this bank.

360
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:09,871
I got an account number for you.

361
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:12,960
Mark it down. I won't
say it again. 0-6...

362
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,913
uh, what is it?

363
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:20,302
9-8-1-0-9.
Okay?

364
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:23,053
And then, I'll get the boss lady
here to take me over to a computer,

365
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:27,210
and she's going to verify for me whether that
money is received within the next half hour.

366
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:31,242
And if it isn't, I'm going
to put a bullet in her head.

367
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,733
Okay, and don't make the mistake of
thinking that won't be easy for me to do.

368
00:22:34,756 --> 00:22:37,082
It'll be very easy after
what she's done to me.

369
00:22:37,096 --> 00:22:39,832
- Hey, boss, arriving in position.
- Copy.

370
00:22:39,846 --> 00:22:45,231
Hey, spike, I need an id
on a bank account: 0698109.

371
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:46,362
Copy.

372
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:47,863
Okay, joe, just forget about her.

373
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:49,861
Let's talk about you
and why you're here.

374
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:52,903
Why I'm here is because
of what she's done to me!

375
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:55,310
That's why we're here.

376
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:57,780
- It wasn't personal.
- What'd you say?

377
00:22:57,796 --> 00:22:59,800
- Hey, george, just stay with me.
- Shut up.

378
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:01,352
Come on, george. She can't help you.

379
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:03,090
I'm the guy who can
give you what you want.

380
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:05,483
No, I want her... i want her to tell me.

381
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:07,220
Pretty please?

382
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:13,422
I want her to tell me how 20 years of a
man's life ended up worth practically nothing.

383
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:18,331
You tell me how a man works, doesn't
put a foot wrong his whole life,

384
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:21,013
and then at the end,
you hand him a check,

385
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:25,592
and it's worth like one week's
salary for every year worked.

386
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:28,820
What am I suppose to do with
all that money, buy myself a car?

387
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:30,992
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

388
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:33,173
Would you mind explaining to me
how you come with that figure?

389
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:35,420
How did you come up with that number?

390
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:39,063
It's a standard
termination package, george.

391
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,462
It wasn't personal.

392
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:43,260
Oh, you're missing all the comedy. It
wasn't personal. That's what she says.

393
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:44,520
It wasn't personal?

394
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,733
Come on, george, come on. You gotta
know this is hard for her, same as you.

395
00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:49,170
I doubt that very much.

396
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:53,572
Ruth has done everything right her whole
life, lived for her job, just like you.

397
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:55,550
You loved your job, too, am I right?

398
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:57,812
I gotta go.

399
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:05,072
You know what, this is
looking kind of bad for you...

400
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,142
boss lady.

401
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:08,542
Are you buddies ?

402
00:24:08,557 --> 00:24:09,981
Georges I don't know if I'd say buddies.

403
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:11,922
Pretty private guy,
george, but a good boss.

404
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:13,280
Always made sure I was doing okay.

405
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:14,483
He's a regular guy, good guy.

406
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,093
What about family? Ever met them?

407
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,402
Other than mary?

408
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,611
Who's mary?

409
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:21,322
His wife.

410
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:22,771
See, that's why I don't get this.

411
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:26,670
The day he got canned, all he said was,
"well, now I can spend more time with mary."

412
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:30,082
No kids, as far as I know. He
just pretty much lived for her.

413
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:31,710
Did you ever meet her?

414
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:34,143
Sure, yeah, she was always
by for lunches and stuff.

415
00:24:34,158 --> 00:24:36,100
Uh, well, not now, but...

416
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:37,480
what, since he was fired?

417
00:24:37,497 --> 00:24:42,450
No, I mean the last year or so, actually,
but before then, yeah, all the time.

418
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,970
- All right, thanks.
- Thank you.

419
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:49,780
How'd you get in just like that?

420
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:51,493
Technical genius.

421
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:53,631
Bank gave me the pass codes.

422
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:55,343
Okay, last step, the password.

423
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,271
"Hotstuff": One word, no space.

424
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:01,270
What?

425
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:03,290
What kind of account is this?

426
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:05,842
Looks like a straight payment account.

427
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:07,802
You put money in, the holder withdraws.

428
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:10,741
This one's for... there.

429
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:13,711
Saint ignatius homes, limited.

430
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:16,433
Whatever that is.

431
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:21,893
So you planned all this just
from watching security tapes?

432
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:24,213
George: Yeah, that's right.
All the banks showed them.

433
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:26,831
They wanted us all to see the guy's mo.

434
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:28,333
You know what I used to do? Make notes.

435
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:30,853
- That's pretty good notes.
- Thank you.

436
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:34,753
Hey, george, is there anybody you want
us to get a message to, anybody at all?

437
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:35,860
Look, I know what
you're doing, all right?

438
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,881
We're wasting enough time right here.

439
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:40,391
You got, like, less than 20
minutes left. Give me my money.

440
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:41,621
I know, we're still working on it.

441
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:43,533
We just need you to stay calm, okay?

442
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:45,153
That's easy for you to stay.

443
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:48,170
You've got a life to go back to at
the end of this-- what have I got?

444
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:52,102
Well, to tell you the truth, it's not
like you've told me a lot about yourself.

445
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:54,873
Well, what's there to tell?

446
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:56,561
And who cares anyway?

447
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:59,193
You think this one sitting
beside me thinks she cares?

448
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,873
The account's for a
retirement home downtown.

449
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:03,881
I can go right now and get
the answers faster in person.

450
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:04,982
Okay, drive fast.

451
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:07,502
You want someone like her
thinks of someone like me?

452
00:26:07,548 --> 00:26:09,792
Whoa, george, where'd you go?
Don't go back down that road.

453
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:11,990
Come on, buddy, you were going
to tell me about yourself.

454
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:15,330
I'm a line item on a
budget, and that's about it.

455
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:19,710
I'm george orston, $47,000
a year, plus benefits.

456
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:23,300
Hey, wait, the way I figure
it, you get some kid in here,

457
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:26,560
pay him half that, and no
benefits 'cause he's part-time.

458
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:27,922
Hey, where do I sign?

459
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:29,512
I can't get there fast enough.

460
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:32,883
You think I like firing people?

461
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:35,270
- You think I enjoy it?
- Yeah.

462
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:37,651
George, she's having a hard time.
She can't help you. You stay with me.

463
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,900
I'm the guy who can get
you out of this, okay?

464
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,783
Yeah, right, yeah, 'cause I'm A...

465
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:44,820
I'm the boss bitch.

466
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:47,611
I'm the ice queen.

467
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:54,072
Oh, you think I didn't know the
nicknames, hear the whispers?

468
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:58,291
I am the first one in every day
and the last one out, so I know.

469
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,150
Good for you.

470
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:03,490
But a year ago, they were going
to close this branch, george,

471
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:07,711
and 62 people were
going to lose their jobs.

472
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,553
Sixty-two.

473
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:15,183
I came in, and I worked
everyone hard, yes.

474
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:19,650
And I worked harder than i
ever have in my entire life.

475
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:23,451
And in the end...

476
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:28,231
it still wasn't enough. It just wasn'T.

477
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:32,811
Seven people had to go.

478
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:36,073
Those were the numbers.

479
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:39,850
Not 62. Seven.

480
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:45,553
And I am sorry that you
were one of the seven.

481
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:49,382
I really am, george.

482
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:52,530
George, george, can you hear me?

483
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,442
We can talk about all of this.

484
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:57,202
Talking's through--
no more talking.

485
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:01,750
No more talking.

486
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:07,212
Where are you going,
george? Where are you going?

487
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:12,050
What are you doing, george?

488
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:17,362
put your hands out.
Put your palms together.

489
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,860
Don't do that, george.

490
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:24,801
Team one, stand by for immediate action.

491
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:26,712
What's going on, boss?

492
00:28:26,728 --> 00:28:29,063
Just stay ready.

493
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,350
Lean forward.

494
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:31,640
He's gagging his hostage.

495
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:35,393
He's dehumanizing her, so when
the me comes, he can kill her.

496
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:39,163
You don't want to kill her, george.
You don't want to kill her. Stand by.

497
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:44,172
- Wind's at 1:00.
- More like 3:00 now.

498
00:28:44,497 --> 00:28:46,972
Flag down the street
in front of the park.

499
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:49,731
Nice.

500
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:52,032
Thank you, sir.

501
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,173
Is there a problem, braddock?

502
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:57,402
I was right, you know,
about the proper procedure.

503
00:28:57,415 --> 00:28:59,603
Well, that's the lead
negotiator's call to make.

504
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:02,083
But I was right. Manual's clear.

505
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:05,790
You know the boss wrote the manual?

506
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:08,501
It's tough not being the
best at something, huh?

507
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,170
I'm trying.

508
00:29:11,186 --> 00:29:13,421
It's not something you
can get out of a textbook.

509
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:15,110
You've got to learn how to make the...

510
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,570
I know, I know. I gotta connect.
Sarge says it every time.

511
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:22,323
Then, how come you don't hear it?

512
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:27,232
parker.

513
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,682
It's luria.

514
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:30,081
You at the retirement home?

515
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:31,923
George's wife has alzheimer'S.

516
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:33,143
Oh, that's great.

517
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:34,992
Diagnosis was six months ago.

518
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:38,643
Early onset usually means
rapid decompensation.

519
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:40,713
She's in pretty bad shape.

520
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:43,090
But now, there's another problem.

521
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:45,981
They're going to kick her out.
She doesn't have the money.

522
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:49,172
Thanks, doc.

523
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,353
so, what's going on? Where's my money?

524
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:14,073
What I got is two names.

525
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:16,661
First name is george orston.

526
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:21,271
Ha-working guy, has done everything right
his whole life, married 25 years to...

527
00:30:21,315 --> 00:30:24,460
here's the second name: Mary orston.

528
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:27,182
A hairdresser, or she used to be.

529
00:30:27,196 --> 00:30:29,290
Right now, she's not doing so well.

530
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:32,480
In a few years, she might not
be able to do anything at all.

531
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:37,132
And the kind of place that she
needs to be in doesn't come cheap.

532
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:38,501
That sound right, george?

533
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:40,642
You tell me, parker, does
that sound all right to you?

534
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,123
- No.
- No.

535
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:44,012
No, it doesn't sound right.

536
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:49,440
Doesn't sound right that you lose your job and your
insurance a month after you find a home for her.

537
00:30:49,838 --> 00:30:53,051
You work hard your whole life, and
something like alzheimer's comes along,

538
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:57,783
and suddenly, the most important person to you
can't even remember your name; that's not right.

539
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:58,891
No.

540
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:01,382
Neither is what you're doing,
george, and you know that.

541
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:03,013
I know.

542
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,663
Look, I tried, parker. I've tried. I've tried
to look for another job, look for anything.

543
00:31:06,676 --> 00:31:08,380
It ain't happening, okay?

544
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:10,742
I've looked to try and get a loan.

545
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:13,622
But what am I supposed to do at my age?

546
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:16,602
It's not exactly easy
out there to find a job.

547
00:31:16,646 --> 00:31:18,910
And then, let's be realistic about it.

548
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,522
How am I supposed to pay
anybody back? It's stupid.

549
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:23,983
Okay, so that's it. I'm
at my wit's end right here.

550
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:25,252
This is my last chance.

551
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,660
I know you're feeling really
alone right now, george, but...

552
00:31:27,675 --> 00:31:30,261
being alone, that's not
what's scaring me here.

553
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:33,812
I'll tell you what's scaring me is
my wife gets kicked out of that home,

554
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:36,753
and I'm not in a position where
I c-can take care of her anymore.

555
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:39,280
That's what's scaring me, okay?

556
00:31:39,326 --> 00:31:44,773
This woman here, my wife has
always taken good care of me always.

557
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:47,230
That's the least I can do.

558
00:31:47,246 --> 00:31:49,573
I got to take care of her.

559
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:53,401
I'M... I'm just trying
to do what's right.

560
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:55,910
There isn't anybody in the world
who wouldn't understand that.

561
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:58,712
I'll bet you ruth's family
would understand that.

562
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:03,960
okay.

563
00:32:04,198 --> 00:32:07,262
Parker, look, I'll tell you what.

564
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,172
Let me talk, let me talk
to my wife and I'll just...

565
00:32:11,185 --> 00:32:12,871
I'll end this, okay? It'll be over.

566
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:14,761
What do you mean "over," george?

567
00:32:14,776 --> 00:32:16,612
What I mean is if you
let me talk to my wife,

568
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:18,963
I'll come out and I'll bring
miss skellar with me, okay?

569
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:20,511
Just let me talk to my wife.

570
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:23,101
All right, george, i'll
get her. You hold on.

571
00:32:28,518 --> 00:32:30,100
luria.

572
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:33,922
So he's ready to come out
once he talks to his wife.

573
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:36,863
Now, if I let him do it,
he'll probably kill himself.

574
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:41,763
If I don't, he'll go off,
and I risk losing the hostage.

575
00:32:41,797 --> 00:32:43,183
Hard call.

576
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:45,640
- Put her on the phone.
- Okay.

577
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:50,223
Here, mary.

578
00:32:50,976 --> 00:32:52,901
go ahead.

579
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,943
Mary?

580
00:32:57,548 --> 00:32:59,771
Hello?

581
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:01,740
It's me. It's george.

582
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:05,363
H-how are you, how are
you feeling, pretty girl?

583
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:06,990
Where are you?

584
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:10,111
Oh, I'm just around the
corner. I'm really close by.

585
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,771
So tell me how you're doing.
Tell me how was your day.

586
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,202
All right, I think.

587
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:19,522
- George.
- Yeah?

588
00:33:20,857 --> 00:33:22,701
Did I do something wrong?

589
00:33:22,738 --> 00:33:25,732
You what? What are you talking about?

590
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:29,123
It's just... you're not here.

591
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:33,540
Did I do something to make you go away?

592
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:37,192
Is that why I'm alone?

593
00:33:38,778 --> 00:33:42,723
Mary orston, I just want
you to know one thing, okay?

594
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:48,722
That anything that ever went right
in my life is directly due to you.

595
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:51,230
Now, do you understand me?

596
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:53,940
Hey, mary.

597
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:56,982
Just want to tell you something.

598
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,481
I'm real, real sorry.

599
00:34:01,435 --> 00:34:04,280
What for?

600
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,242
I got to go now, mary.

601
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:09,171
- Okay.
- Okay.

602
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,761
I love you, george.

603
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,912
me, too, pretty girl.

604
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:29,922
okay, give me your hands.

605
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:39,091
Careful.

606
00:34:45,086 --> 00:34:48,571
okay, so go. You hear me? Get
going. Get out of here. GO.

607
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:49,640
What are you gonna do?

608
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:51,941
Just go. What do you care?

609
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:55,810
I'm not leaving here
without you, george.

610
00:34:57,155 --> 00:34:59,670
What are you talking about? Why?

611
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:02,231
- Because I didn't help you before.
- What?

612
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:03,750
And I can now.

613
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:07,243
I know if we sit down together, we
can figure something out for your wife.

614
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:09,313
Figure something out. What are you
talking about, figure something out?

615
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:11,813
There's nothing to figure out; I've tried
everything. There's nothing to figure out.

616
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:14,202
There's always something we can look at.

617
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:17,262
We'll look at early pension
payout options, insurance.

618
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:20,713
We'll see what the bank can do.

619
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,921
That's pretty nice of you.

620
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:27,123
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

621
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:32,330
Okay. Thanks.

622
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:38,013
Why are you doing that?

623
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:40,160
Why am I doing this?

624
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:44,733
I don't want mary to see me coming out.

625
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:50,573
- Keep your hands up when you're in front of the bank, okay?
- Okay.

626
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:52,072
Team one, sierra one.

627
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:53,922
I think he's coming out. Get ready.

628
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,322
That's great. Congratulations.

629
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:57,011
Negative. Not good.

630
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:58,961
He said good-bye to his wife
and put his mask back on.

631
00:35:58,976 --> 00:36:01,453
He's coming out armed,
ed. Do you understand?

632
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,220
Loss of a loved one-- that
depersonalizes him and us.

633
00:36:04,238 --> 00:36:06,820
He's looking for direct
confrontation. He wants us to kill him.

634
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:08,193
Suicide by cop. Hold fire!

635
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,041
Suicide by cop.

636
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,141
Sierra one, wait on my scorpio.

637
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:16,491
Sierra one, copy.

638
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:33,582
Shouldn't he give a scorpio now,
in case this guy comes out shooting?

639
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:36,251
It's his call. He's got one
more chance to talk the guy down.

640
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:37,570
And if he can't?

641
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:39,852
We do our job.

642
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,312
Get those hands up.

643
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:48,862
Hands up! Keep your hands up!

644
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:52,270
Hang on. Here he comes.

645
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:55,381
Okay, now see, you're gonna go
down and you're gonna stay down,

646
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:57,043
'cause they're gonna
shoot me, eh, so get down.

647
00:36:57,057 --> 00:36:57,881
- Get down.
- No.

648
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,001
- No.
- Get down!

649
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:02,031
Don't! Stop! George.

650
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:04,242
Hold fire. Hold fire.

651
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,963
- I got the solution.
- Wait.

652
00:37:07,466 --> 00:37:11,282
George, this isn't right.

653
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,832
You're trying to make us do
something we don't want to do.

654
00:37:17,478 --> 00:37:20,960
hold fire. He's no killer. Hold fire.

655
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:27,370
Not gonna do it, george.

656
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:30,203
Not gonna give you what you want.

657
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:32,870
Put the gun down.

658
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:39,092
please, george.

659
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:50,373
- Take him.
- No.

660
00:39:09,998 --> 00:39:12,872
mary, I-I didn'T...

661
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:17,960
I didn't know george maybe
as well as I could have.

662
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:23,531
But I do know how much he loved you.

663
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:30,893
And he made sure that you'll be
taken care of for as long as you need.

664
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,261
That was very important to him.

665
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:43,933
Why are you so sad?

666
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:49,222
It's a, it's a beautiful day.

667
00:39:51,157 --> 00:39:53,792
Yeah, it is.

668
00:39:59,657 --> 00:40:00,750
how you doing?

669
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,971
I don't know.

670
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:03,863
I've never been questioned
like that before.

671
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,593
Well, it's procedure.

672
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:07,320
Luria told you what it was about, right?

673
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:09,293
Yeah, guy's insurance
wouldn't cover suicide,

674
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:12,413
but it paid out if he was
killed by a third party.

675
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:14,861
Lucky me, right?

676
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:16,973
Guys seen parker?

677
00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:19,492
Don't know where he is.
Look, we're gonna get changed.

678
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:21,951
Let's grab a drink. You earned it.

679
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,912
Hey, sarge.

680
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:46,722
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

681
00:40:47,317 --> 00:40:49,872
- Sure.
- Yeah?

682
00:40:58,215 --> 00:41:01,183
- Review?
- Yeah.

683
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:04,421
Just trying to figure out
where I lost the connection.

684
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:06,520
Didn't think you did.

685
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:09,990
Well, guy's dead.

686
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:13,000
Kept ruth skellar alive, though.

687
00:41:14,836 --> 00:41:17,371
Do you want another
pair of eyes on this?

688
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:20,303
No, no, I'M... I'm fine. Thanks.

689
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:28,400
But, you know, if you want...

690
00:41:34,265 --> 00:41:37,711
first contact with
subject made 9:27 A.M.
