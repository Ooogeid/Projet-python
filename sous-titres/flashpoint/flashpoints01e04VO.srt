00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,930
35 foot cabin cruiser currently
docked in slip number 127.

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,510
Sam, we don't have eyes yet. You?

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,950
Almost there.

4
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,020
He's gotta be in the
cockpit or down below.

5
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,070
Guys, I got 'em.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,630
Where are they, middle, stern or bow?

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,530
Standing in the back,
they're under a tarp.

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,220
- Say it!
- Go to hell.

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,220
She's on him. Ed,
she's right in his face.

10
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,370
Rebecca kessfield, this is the
police strategic response unit.

11
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,616
Get back!

12
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:51,735
- Rebecca, please.
- Go!

13
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:54,157
- Relax!
- Go inside!

14
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,773
<i>4 hours earlier</i>

15
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:05,171
just let me in, okay?

16
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,052
come on, I know you're there.

17
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:22,661
Honey, please, just let me in.

18
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:48,882
sadie?

19
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:57,213
sadie? Honey? It's just me. Okay?

20
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,451
It's just me.

21
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,472
Sweetheart?

22
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:18,421
I told you not to come.

23
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:21,381
What are big sisters for?

24
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:25,363
come on, let's get you up.

25
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:29,430
There's nothing glamorous about
the bathroom floor. Come here.

26
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:34,303
Here. Hang on, hang on.

27
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,953
sadie.

28
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,011
you must release me...

29
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:58,450
for if you do not, I
cannot be held accountable.

30
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:01,003
My lord, you have shattered my heart.

31
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,343
You have... awoken my soul.

32
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:05,963
Yo, dude, you've awoken my soul!

33
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,913
Wordy, this is the sru; you can't
be watching "lady in waiting".

34
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:13,020
It's a good movie, it's historical.

35
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,822
I got four women in my house, all right?

36
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:21,883
Anything that helps me get closer
to shelly and my girls, I'm there.

37
00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:24,050
If this is what they're
watching, I wanna know about it.

38
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:25,191
Got no secrets.

39
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,391
I think you need to shoot something.

40
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:28,612
Well, after you, siskel.

41
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:30,052
You're the one that
recognized the quote.

42
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,651
- Oh, yeah.
- Ohhh, snap!

43
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,332
Hey, you know what, it's on friggin'
pay-per-view, every hour on the hour, all right?

44
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:39,421
Well, maybe you and I should sit down, watch
it together, compare our favourite scenes...

45
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:40,432
I can braid your hair.

46
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:41,493
That's tricky business.

47
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:42,561
Naw, not really.

48
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:43,710
I do it for allie all the time.

49
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:45,613
She's got less hair
than either of these two.

50
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:48,531
It's okay, bring it. Come on.

51
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,900
Sadie, you know what
I'm going to say, right?

52
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:55,063
Yeah, I don't want to hear
it. Just not right now.

53
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:56,220
Okay, I'm gonna go check on caitlin.

54
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:58,512
- She was in her crib the whole time?
- yeah.

55
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,322
- You want her in here?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:06,721
you really sit around and watch those
sappy movies with your kids, or what?

57
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:08,370
Yeah.

58
00:04:10,137 --> 00:04:11,723
Well, I got girls.

59
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,262
It's different, right, you got a boy.

60
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,592
No, I know, I know.

61
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:19,112
You know, he's a good kid. Great
kid. It's just it's awkward.

62
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,721
You know, I love rock
music; he plays the cello.

63
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,812
Loves basketball, hates hockey.

64
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:27,152
Last week, he came home...

65
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,452
big fat lip, won't tell
me what happened, right?

66
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:30,771
Turns out this...

67
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:34,973
this kid at school, they had a
hassle and he told the teacher.

68
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:37,993
Kid waited for him after school and...

69
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:39,360
what're you gonna do?

70
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,591
Well, what are you gonna do?

71
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:42,852
I dunno. You know, soph wants to...

72
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,611
"we'll go to the school
and we'll take to him."

73
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:46,741
So go to the school about
it, find out what's going on.

74
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,280
Nah. I mean, it'll just make it worse.

75
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:50,790
Clark needs to stand up on his own...

76
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:52,141
his own two feet.

77
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,111
He's
13-years-old.

78
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:55,262
Exactly.

79
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:58,053
Well no wonder he doesn't
wanna talk to you about it.

80
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:01,020
You know what, wordy, you
got three girls, okay? So...

81
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:01,912
oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:04,563
Three girls, a real walk in the
park, they never do anything wrong.

83
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:08,121
You know what? You know what?
Whatever, okay? Forget it.

84
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:12,430
oh, yeah, that'S... that's mature.

85
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:17,342
it's okay. you're okay now. Hang on.

86
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:24,851
enough fighting, sadie.

87
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,643
what the hell happened?

88
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:29,772
Uh, he didn't touch her.

89
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,141
So why does this have blood on it?

90
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,323
It was me; I felt sick,
so I picked her up.

91
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:35,102
Do you hear yourself? Do you?

92
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:37,892
- Do not judge me.
- This cannot continue!

93
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:41,383
Well, tell me how it ends then? Tell me.

94
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:44,953
We both know how it ends.

95
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,423
I call the cops, they show up,

96
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:51,803
he's got a fat lip
because I fought back,

97
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:55,241
he tells them I'm crazy,

98
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:57,900
and they turn out to be
buddies from 58 division.

99
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,250
So you leave!

100
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:03,192
Where is he, sadie?

101
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,030
Please. You can'T.

102
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:10,352
If he finds out that you know about this,
any of this, he's gonna kill me, or you, or...

103
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:14,283
oh, just... just leave!

104
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know.

105
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:25,352
I just don't know anymore.

106
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:33,063
this is going to end.

107
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:49,000
I get it.

108
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,180
You can't do it.

109
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:54,023
I just need to sleep.

110
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:05,440
Okay, everything's
fine, just go to sleep.

111
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,861
I'll give caitlin a bottle.

112
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,570
Rebecca?

113
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:16,663
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,591
So am I.

120
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:09,413

troubles there, all the time.

127
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,150
Fine. Patrol happy hour.

128
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:26,470
All those very threatening
young women in tube-tops.

129
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:29,631
But just uh... button up, huh?

130
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:33,303
Be good. Look good. Jules? You're
still representing the force.

131
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:35,473
Eddie? Mr. Wordsworth?

132
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:36,892
East end.

133
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:40,690
Roving gangs of families,
runaway strollers and whatnot.

134
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,200
It's all yours. Sam? Jules?

135
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:43,731
We'll take west.

136
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:46,131
I'm thinking chicken
roti at island foods.

137
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:47,760
Hey, we'll take west.

138
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:50,092
- You got
tube-tops. - Yeah.

139
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,292
Let's go keep the peace.

140
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:22,021
All right, it's petey time.

00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:28,153

00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,120
Ah, triple one!

144
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:37,246
that's on the board.
That's on the board.

145
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,755
Hold up a sec.

146
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:48,877
What? Where's he goin'?

147
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,122
What're you doing here?

148
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:55,033
Long day. Having a drink.

149
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:56,713
Thanks.

150
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,913
- Uh, rebecca, I don'T...
- relax.

151
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:01,061
Don't worry, I'm in a good mood.

152
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:03,371
Nice day, sun's shining.

153
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:05,042
Spent the day planting trees.

154
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,762
Well, un-planting trees, actually.

155
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:10,622
This uh, this blue-hair in forest hill's trying
to tell me she didn't mean to order purple lilac;

156
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:12,490
she wanted white lilac.

157
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:17,871
Now I've got $3000 bucks worth of purple trees
sitting in my truck, but hey, she's paying.

158
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,953
I guess.

159
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,131
So... you talk to sadie lately?

160
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:28,471
We're not really, no, I
mean, not in a few weeks.

161
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:29,643
Everything okay?

162
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,601
Yeah, sure, everything's
great, you know.

163
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:36,371
I'm kinda keeping my distance these
days. She'S... got a lot on her plate.

164
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:39,511
You could say that.

165
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:41,480
then I will.

166
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:44,011
Sit down, have a drink.

167
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:47,252
I mean, if you want.

168
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:39,413
hi, matt? It's sadie.

169
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:42,880
I need your help.

170
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:46,001
Wordy, at least let's take
parliament street, all right?

171
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:49,203
Somebody's gotta be beatin'
someone up over there.

172
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:54,052
well, can you go any slower?
Look, do you wanna just stop?

173
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,651
Let's just stop, I'm cool with
that. We'll just stop the car.

174
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:57,852
what is your problem?

175
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:59,543
I don't have a problem.

176
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:01,742
It's my opinion. All right?

177
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,631
Your kid gets into some trouble, you...

178
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,172
go into the school, you figure it out.

179
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:09,451
What? That's how I feel.

180
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,380
Shelley teach you that?

181
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:16,200
Just go, go braid some hair, express
your emotions, all right, wordy, whatever.

182
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,002
No, you know what shelley taught me?

183
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:19,693
No, wordy, what'd your wife teach ya?

184
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:24,551
Don't be a victim, don't be a perpetrator,
and above all, don't be a bystander.

185
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:25,811
- Vote for ed.
- You're an ass.

186
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,511
Eddie. Matt mcdondrick, here.

187
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,803
Matty! What's going on, buddy?

188
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:33,490
Well, my partner in narcotics, pete fitzhaven,
his wife just called, her name's sadie.

189
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:36,582
I'm stuck in court on a heroin case,
she needs a little help on the qt.

190
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:38,182
I don't know who else to ask.

191
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:39,061
What do you need?

192
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:41,122
I don't know yet.

193
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,233
There's um...

194
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:44,530
there's a little bit
of trouble over there.

195
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:47,160
Pete's gun's missing,
she can't track him down.

196
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:48,332
All right, where is she?

197
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:49,862
You sure you're okay to stop by?

198
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:52,873
You know, I figure if there's a firearm
involved, you guys might get called anyway.

199
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,201
Better if it's you, right?

200
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:56,110
Yeah, yeah. We're just on
patrol, it's no problem.

201
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:58,960
Gimme her twenty,
we'll be there in five.

202
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:02,712
See?

203
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,671
It's nice to turn your
phone off once in a while.

204
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:05,772
It's old school.

205
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,433
No one can find you, no
one knows where you are.

206
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:14,251
Hey, how'd it go with the review board?

207
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:16,743
You get bumped up?

208
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:17,971
I did.

209
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,760
No way. Congratulations, sergeant.

210
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:27,782
Hey, mickey, we need another round here.

211
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,643
You got it.

212
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,832
You, uh... you still
playing with that thing?

213
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:36,172
'Cause it kind of looks like
your boys wanna finish their game.

214
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,880
I don't know. It's up to you, I guess.

215
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:45,770
Pete, it's nice to see you.

216
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:48,532
It's good to catch up, you know?

217
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:54,322
All right, I'll be
back. Finish that drink.

218
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,242
just soda from now on, okay, mickey?

219
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:02,393
- You sure?
- Yeah.

220
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:05,641
I don't want to make him feel bad,
but it's a little early for me.

221
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:11,263
Check out the window.

222
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:18,020
Sadie fitzhaven?

223
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:19,983
Hey, I'm ed. This is kevin. We, uh...

224
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:22,541
we got a call from matt mcdondrick.

225
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,873
Oh god.

226
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:27,612
he said he'd send a friend,
he didn't need to call the sru.

227
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:28,740
No, it's all right, we're friends.

228
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,321
We're uh, we're just on
patrol, it's nothing official.

229
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,702
Do you mind if I just...

230
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:36,883
- not at all.
- Fine.

231
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:52,233
Do you want to tell us what's going on?

232
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:53,731
My sister came by.

233
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:57,213
She was upset, she was very emotional.

234
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:59,623
Your sister. And you didn't let her in?

235
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:02,082
Well, I was upstairs,
I was with the baby.

236
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:04,702
I was nursing, so I didn't get the door.

237
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,852
I guess she just figured I was here.

238
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,293
So what'd she want?

239
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,700
- To talk to pete.
- Talk to pete?

240
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:12,943
Did you tell her where he was?

241
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,133
Oh, I didn't have to.

242
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,100
Chances are if pete's not
here then he's at the lion.

243
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:22,012
Look, I was upstairs, you
know, in the baby's room,

244
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,351
and she was storming around
for a while and then she left.

245
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:25,993
With your husband's gun.

246
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,381
And you're sure he
didn't have it with him?

247
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:29,461
No, I saw him put it in the closet.

248
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:33,463
He's very particular
- one place; that's where it goes.

249
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:36,351
Look, I'm sure that everything's fine.

250
00:15:36,378 --> 00:15:39,872
You know, and I wish that
matt hadn't called you.

251
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:42,493
You know, I just wanted
to make sure that...

252
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:51,322
No way.

253
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,400
I agree.

254
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:55,483
Pete's voicemail.

255
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,871
She's leaving stuff out. She's
leaving all the good stuff out.

256
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,040
Maybe she doesn't know any good stuff.

257
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:02,261
- Matty, it's ed.
- You talk to her?

258
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:03,903
- We did.
- And?

259
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:06,070
I don't know. There's
something going on. There's A...

260
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:08,591
there's a broken door,
there's a missing gun.

261
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:09,782
Who broke the door?

262
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:11,933
Her sister, rebecca kessfield.

263
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:14,201
That ring any bells?

264
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:15,770
You sure it was rebecca?

265
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:17,882
What's the story, matt?

266
00:16:17,897 --> 00:16:19,301
Off the record, she's
been stalking the guy.

267
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,772
She's been obsessed
about him for months.

268
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:22,920
She's out of her sweet mind.

269
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:26,393
Pete's told me crazy stuff,
stuff he hasn't even told sadie.

270
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:31,080
I'm out.

271
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,132
What? Where are ya going?
You're bailing on our game.

272
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:35,821
Ah, guys, I'm calling it a day.

273
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:38,601
Got a baby at home.

274
00:16:58,295 --> 00:16:59,831
told ya I wasn't leaving.

275
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:02,492
Just didn't want anybody talking.

276
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:07,120
Pete, why don't I just drive
you home. It's been a long day.

277
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:11,411
I'm fine.

278
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:13,272
Come on, you've had a few.

279
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:17,852
Hey, if you wanna walk home,
that's cool, but I'm good to go.

280
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:20,892
Okay, I guess I'll walk.

281
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:25,272
You know, it was uh,
it was good to see you.

282
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,971
Where's your car?

283
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:30,983
I didn't drive.

284
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:33,331
You want a lift?

285
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:37,060
- Sure.
- I don't mind at all.

286
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,301
Are you okay?

287
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,470
I'm fine.

288
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,252
you're such a lightweight.

289
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:43,610
- oh yeah?
- Yeah.

290
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:46,331
I could, uh... I could do
another drink, you know.

291
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:48,662
I'm not scared.

292
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,042
what about the patio at o'malley's?

293
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:56,493
It's a beautiful sunset.

294
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,380
Well, we could, uh...

295
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:02,040
we could go to your boat.

296
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:25,453
guys, this may be nothing, but we have a
potential incident involving a police officer

297
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:27,680
and a missing firearm at the lion bar.

298
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,231
Copy that. I've got nothing
goin' on, I'll meet you there.

299
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:32,043
South street and beacon.

300
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:34,023
- Bravo, charlie?
- Copy.

301
00:18:34,037 --> 00:18:36,761
You guys stay put, we'll
call you if we need you.

302
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:49,303
This way.

303
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:54,103
it's just up here on the left.

304
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:56,901
Careful, don't fall in.

305
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:59,273
I did that once. In venice.

306
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,331
Came out of this restaurant,
a couple glasses of wine,

307
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,670
thought it was the reflection of the street
or something, I stepped right in and...

308
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,900
bam, I'm in the canal.
You know, there's no...

309
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,202
no fences or anything.

310
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:10,982
Aw, man, you are lucky. I wish
I had a chance to, you know...

311
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:11,972
to what?

312
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:15,053
Travel! See the world! Get drunk.

313
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:19,112
Help pretty ladies out
of the water. Well...

314
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:21,830
here we are.

315
00:19:31,676 --> 00:19:34,553
uh, yeah, they were talking at
the bar, but, uh, she said goodbye,

316
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:36,111
left without him,
everything seemed fine to me.

317
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:37,132
She really wasn't even drinking.

318
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:40,350
She had one drink and then
after that it was soda water.

319
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:43,281
Hey, eddie.

320
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:44,523
Rebecca kessfield's clean.

321
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:47,243
No priors, no tickets, no nothing.

322
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:48,793
- What about the wife?
- Haven't checked yet.

323
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:51,572
- Eddie, any news?
- Nothing.

324
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,080
Guys, this woman's out of her mind.

325
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:54,740
Yeah, but so's his wife.

326
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:57,471
The whole family, I mean, I
feel bad for the guy, I do.

327
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,572
Ed. Three weeks ago...

328
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:02,551
pete said rebecca
showed up at the office.

329
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:05,662
You know, sat outside in her car for
an hour waiting for him to come out.

330
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:08,802
Apparently, he didn't return her call.

331
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,611
Matty, they having a thing here or what?

332
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:12,972
I don't know. Not my place. Sorry.

333
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:14,360
Maybe.

334
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,703
The wife's sister? Boss.

335
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:17,733
Hold on a second.

336
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:20,821
I don't know for sure, okay,
but there was something there.

337
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:25,013
I guess I figured maybe they had had a
thing, he ended it - obvious reasons -

338
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,880
she was pissed off, confused, I
don't know. Don't ask, don't tell.

339
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:30,322
Got a little domestic
situation on our hands?

340
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:31,760
And he's hammered.

341
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:33,151
She's got a gun.

342
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,720
I hear you.

343
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:36,382
Hey, frank, where's he going?

344
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:38,500
Uh, I don't know, he
said he's going home.

345
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,882
Well, he's not at home. Anyone?

346
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:42,281
He's got a boat.

347
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:43,892
Let's start with the boat.

348
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:46,053
team one, let's gear up.

349
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:48,062
Thanks.

350
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,280
You could've.

351
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:55,021
Coulda what?

352
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,553
Gone to italy. You know, this, uh...

353
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:02,750
this boat alone would've bought you a couple
of trips, there and back, you and sadie.

354
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:05,151
Nah, I need this.

355
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:08,071
It's good to have a place
to go, you know? Get away.

356
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,282
There we are.

357
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,202
Sit down, relax.

358
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:16,602
Sunset, right?

359
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:18,510
Don't want to miss it.

360
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,503
Let me just uh...

361
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,590
- pull this back so we get a better view.
- No, uh...

362
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,033
it's kinda nice.

363
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:27,980
It's cozy, you know?

364
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:35,441
Security guard said that he pulled in
in a blue pickup with a blonde passenger.

365
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:37,090
It's gotta be them.

366
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:40,132
Let's check with matt, see if
he knows which slip he's in.

367
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:43,421
So, are you seeing anyone?

368
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,692
Not right now.

369
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:48,281
All the good ones are taken, right?

370
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,273
Anyway, I'm not really sure I'm
cut out for the marriage thing.

371
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:53,590
Ksloo pretty hard.

372
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:55,301
Oh, come on.

373
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:58,522
No sex, no fun, no sleep, no slack...

374
00:21:58,546 --> 00:21:59,740
what's not to like?

375
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,852
So why do you stay?

376
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,912
I don't know.

377
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:08,712
Looking for somethin' better to
come along, I guess. You know?

378
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,141
Matty, are you sure about this?

379
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:15,461
I was here two weeks ago,
he's moored in 127. That's it.

380
00:22:15,476 --> 00:22:18,511
Okay, well, parallel to the end
of the dock, that's not good.

381
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,642
- No, it's harder to contain.
- Contain?

382
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:21,873
Well, that's what we're starting with.

383
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,182
We want all our options,
and that's the only way out?

384
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:25,102
Yeah, on foot.

385
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:26,801
Sergeant, just walk your
guys down to the boat.

386
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:29,312
No. We don't wanna spook
the girl with the gun, right?

387
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:32,182
If they don't see us,
we control what happens.

388
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:37,153
Sam, we need to find a high point,
parallel and east of this guy right here.

389
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:38,771
So, let me know when
you got eyes on him.

390
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:40,313
Yes, sir.

391
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:43,370
All right, the rest of us, we're gonna go
stealth 'til I hear something different.

392
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,171
Jules, get matty into the command truck.

393
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,492
I want priors on the wife.
I want priors on the husband.

394
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:48,463
Priors on the husband?

395
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:50,391
Sergeant, this way.

396
00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:53,211
Wordy. We need to get
sadie fitzhaven down here.

397
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:54,241
What, the wife? Why?

398
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:56,660
Because she was lying.

399
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,482
- Okay, I...
- won't let her past the truck.

400
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:01,190
All right, good. 'Cause I don't
want her anywhere near this thing.

401
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:02,140
Copy that.

402
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:04,993
Lewis! Spike! Let's hit it.

403
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:08,471
We used to be good.

404
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:10,903
Things were good for
the first couple years.

405
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,450
It's, it's complicated.

406
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,131
Used to be us against the world.

407
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:22,422
then she had caitlin and...

408
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:26,271
the day she was born, sadie's
all grumpy, she's on the edge.

409
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:28,511
That baby doesn't stop crying.

410
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:30,493
You know, she's
five-months-old.

411
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:32,301
Sir!

412
00:23:32,318 --> 00:23:34,921
Let's go, let's go. Let's hustle it up.

413
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:45,982
7:57 pm, team one on the scene of a
possible domestic, marina quay west.

414
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:52,493
35 foot cabin cruiser, registered
under one peter fitzhaven,

415
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:56,252
currently docked in slip number 127.

416
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:03,913
My job takes it out of me, I haven't
had sex with my wife in six months.

417
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:09,531
I'm sitting next to a girl and uh...

418
00:24:11,738 --> 00:24:15,282
well, I chose the wrong one.

419
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:20,110
They're either in the cockpit
or they're in the cabin.

420
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,381
Lewis, see if you can
get eyes from down here.

421
00:24:22,398 --> 00:24:24,303
Sarge, what if nothing's happening?
What if he's in there all alone?

422
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:25,580
I hope so.

423
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:28,650
False alarm's my
favourite kind of alarm.

424
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:35,881
Spike, see if this guy'll
let you use his shortwave.

425
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:37,472
Maybe we can contact him through that.

426
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:38,701
Yeah, it'll work if pete's radio's on.

427
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,890
Okay, I'll check it out.

428
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:42,893
Lewis?

429
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,470
There's plastic all around the
front, I can't see anything.

430
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,171
If I got near the actual dock, maybe.

431
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:49,892
No, back off. I don't
want her spottin' you.

432
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:51,530
- Hello there.
- Hello.

433
00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:53,560
I need to use your radio.

434
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:56,801
So leave... yifou're unhappy.

435
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:58,282
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe you should.

436
00:24:58,295 --> 00:24:59,472
Hey, don't tell me what to do.

437
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:01,981
I'm not, I'm just...

438
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:05,611
pete, it's not a secret, you know?

439
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:08,480
You married my little sister
at this very marina, what?

440
00:25:08,496 --> 00:25:10,413
Three years ago?

441
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:13,572
- When's the first time you hit her?
- Excuse me?

442
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:16,702
I'm guessing about five months later, I'm
thinking maybe it was that first halloween?

443
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,830
She got dressed up for a party
- sexy nurse.

444
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:20,711
- I remember you didn't like it much.
- You know what? You...

445
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,180
took me a little while to
figure it out, but I did.

446
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:26,051
- She doesn't have the energy to lie to me anymore.
- No?

447
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,203
Because she's pretty good at it.

448
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:31,300
nothing. Thanks.

449
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:36,322
We had a few fights, we had a kid,
she got fat, we had a few more fights!

450
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,853
- She's my wife!
- She's your prisoner!

451
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:43,421
don't you laugh! Don't you dare laugh!

452
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:46,880
I think it's time that you left.

453
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:03,812
Sam, we don't have eyes yet. You?

454
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:05,833
Almost there.

455
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:11,173
You know what? How come
you haven't left yet?

456
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:17,071
Guys, I got 'em.

457
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:18,582
Where are they, middle, stern or bow?

458
00:26:18,616 --> 00:26:20,600
Standing in the back,
they're under a tarp.

459
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:23,472
It's not like she's asking
for the moon. You know?

460
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:28,583
It's not like she's asking for flowers,
or diamonds, or trips to italy...

461
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,701
she's just asking you to be nice.

462
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:31,823
Thing is, you can't do it!

463
00:26:31,845 --> 00:26:35,640
You can't do it, pete, 'cause
it's not in your nature.

464
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:38,192
You're gonna leave, tonight.

465
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:40,661
Okay, you're gonna go to a friend's
place, she's gonna get a lawyer,

466
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:43,641
- and you're never gonna see her again.
- Rebecca.

467
00:26:43,656 --> 00:26:46,142
Say thatyou'll do it.
Just say that you'll do it!

468
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:48,293
- Give me my gun back.
- Say it!

469
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:52,103
- Go to hell.
- Say it again.

470
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,251
She's got a gun. She's
got it pointed at his head.

471
00:26:57,626 --> 00:27:00,070
Either way this is gonna be over.

472
00:27:00,088 --> 00:27:02,790
Today, it's gonna be
over, it's gonna be done.

473
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:04,081
She's moving in, she's on him.

474
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,633
Ed, shright in his face.

475
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:09,721
Rebecca kessfield, this is the
police strategic response unit.

476
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:11,881
We have got everything
under control out here.

477
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,411
How's everything over there?

478
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:15,182
Get back!

479
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:18,063
Rebecca, my name is greg,
and I wanna help you.

480
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:19,933
Undo that rope.

481
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:21,642
Pete, undo the rope!

482
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:22,891
We're concerned about your safety, so,

483
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:27,361
if you could tell me what this
is all about, we can all go home.

484
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:28,751
- Do you got a cellphone?
- Do it!

485
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:31,872
Maybe you can turn it on and
we can start talkog abinut this.

486
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:34,092
That's pete.

487
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:37,680
He's cuttin' the boat loose.

488
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,711
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

489
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,283
Get back. Get back, pete.

490
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,523
Go inside.

491
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,163
- Go inside!
- Rebecca, please.

492
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:52,070
- Go!
- Relax!

493
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:53,803
Looks like they're going inside.

494
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:56,541
Okay, easy.

495
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:59,103
We can't help you this way.

496
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:04,863
You have to stay calm, you have stay
there and you have to talk to us.

497
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:06,181
They're inside the cabin.

498
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:08,973
Inside the cabin? Buddy,
they're floating away.

499
00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:21,232
Maybe it's good, you know.

500
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:22,982
Maybe they'll finally...

501
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:25,333
maybe they'll finally listen.

502
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:28,283
Except you probably... you
probably set me up, right?

503
00:28:28,296 --> 00:28:30,491
Your guys probably think I'm crazy, huh?

504
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,372
Sergeant, we do not need you out there.

505
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:34,993
Now I need you tell us everything
you can about pete fitzhaven.

506
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,093
If we can't figure out why we're
here, we can't start talking.

507
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,482
Good. Go lethal. Please, I
told you everything already.

508
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:42,372
- Jules, can you take over?
- Yeah. In the truck.

509
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,270
The wife's here.

510
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:47,501
Luria's stuck in a parole hearing,
she's gonna keep us posted.

511
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,650
Sadie, hi.

512
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:50,263
I'm kevin wordsworth,
we met at your place.

513
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,853
I'm sorry, I had to drop
caitlin off at the neighbour'S.

514
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:53,561
What's happened?

515
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:54,522
Well, nothing's happened.

516
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:57,531
We're just trying to make contact
with rebecca, with your husband.

517
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:59,101
We're working on it, okay?

518
00:28:59,118 --> 00:29:02,882
But, sadie, right now,
I really need your help.

519
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:05,363
We need to understand
what's going on here.

520
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:07,912
If you want us to get your husband
home to you, safe and sound tonight,

521
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:11,501
you need to tell me what rebecca wants.

522
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:12,632
You good to keep talking?

523
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:15,500
If I can get her on the phone. There's
only so much I can do with this thing.

524
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:16,850
All right, well they can still hear you.

525
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:18,373
Okay, until we get a better plan.

526
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:19,633
Gimme lewis as my second?

527
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:21,363
Fine, I'll take sam.
Lewis, you copy that?

528
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:24,212
- Copy.
- All right, spike, I need ears on that boat.

529
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:25,540
Get the parabolic mic.

530
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:30,420
Sam, I need a canister of non-pyrotechnic cs
ready to fire, and you might be going for a swim.

531
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:35,073
Boss, I need you to talk this thing down,
so we don't have to go on a boat ride.

532
00:29:35,095 --> 00:29:36,382
- You got both cell numbers?
- Yup.

533
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:38,542
All right, start dialing.

534
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:42,592
Rebecca, this is sergeant greg
parker we're not going anywhere.

535
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:45,193
We can't go anywhere until
we resolve this thing.

536
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:46,960
I'm sorry, okay? I'M...

537
00:29:46,978 --> 00:29:48,012
Rebecca, can you hear me?

538
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,380
I'm so sorry. Just...

539
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:50,791
- Hey, hey, what're you doing?
- Easy, easy!

540
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:52,751
- What're you doing?
- I will leave the house.

541
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:54,682
- Okay, I will get counselling.
- Liar!

542
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:56,042
I'm not lying!

543
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:59,880
I will never see her again if
that's what she wants, okay?

544
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,060
- Rebecca, can you hear me?
- Bec...

545
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,943
it's me, it's not her.

546
00:30:04,978 --> 00:30:07,621
You remind me of this girl.

547
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:11,491
A girl from my neighborhood, growing up.

548
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:16,872
She was smart, she was
funny, she was... beautiful.

549
00:30:18,156 --> 00:30:22,183
And then she got
married - real young -

550
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:25,742
to this guy who beat
the crap out of her.

551
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,123
Both phones are off.

552
00:30:28,137 --> 00:30:29,541
All right, keep dialing.

553
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,413
Hey, jules, jules...

554
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:34,432
get luria, find out what
this guy means to her.

555
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,403
Maybe she has a past psych
history, anything you got.

556
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:39,462
I'm on it.

557
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:42,972
The thing about shelley was, well,
she's such A... a tough cookie.

558
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,072
But it took us...

559
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:48,671
I don't know, two years...

560
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:52,070
to figure it out. Two years...

561
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:59,181
before I realized why she
wore turtlenecks in the summer;

562
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:04,621
before I figured out why
she's always looking so scared.

563
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:08,680
Two years before I could help
her get out of that marriage;

564
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:11,752
before anyone could help her get away.

565
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:16,522
And you know what?

566
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:23,133
If I'd been given half a
chance, I would've killed him.

567
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:26,810
Ike, what do ya hear?

568
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:28,882
Nothing. Water. Very loud water.

569
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:30,491
Ed, what do you wanna do?

570
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:33,512
I wanna go in there. I wanna get ears
on that boat, or I wanna gas them.

571
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:34,253
Sam?

572
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,042
Six rounds of cs, ready to roll.

573
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:37,662
Rebecca, we can't keep doing this.

574
00:31:37,698 --> 00:31:40,042
We need to make contact with you.

575
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:44,332
We're trying to call you right
now, please turn on your cell phone.

576
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:45,953
my, um...

577
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:48,123
my, my phone, it's in my bag, it'S...

578
00:31:48,148 --> 00:31:49,301
it's on the deck.

579
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:50,792
Let me go get it for you, okay?

580
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:53,450
No, no-no-no,
where's your phone?

581
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:54,443
Where's your phone?

582
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,693
It's right here, it's in my pocket.

583
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:58,572
Okay, turn it on. Turn it on.

584
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:01,611
It's right here.

585
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:05,593
it's on.

586
00:32:05,605 --> 00:32:09,901
Put it on the floor.
Put it on the floor.

587
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:14,353
Kick it forward. Kick it over!

588
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,681
Okay.

589
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:25,073
drop it, or I'll break your wrist.

590
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,973
I said...

591
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:34,433
jules, what do ya got?

592
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,191
Luria sent me rebecca's chart,
but there's nothing there.

593
00:32:37,217 --> 00:32:39,522
No meds, no shrink, no history.

594
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:41,163
What about her sister?

595
00:32:41,178 --> 00:32:43,290
Not yet, but wordy's with her right now.

596
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:47,473
Sadie, we're preparing a
lethal solution for your sister.

597
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:51,061
If you can think of anything
that might help us, anything...

598
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,270
I told her to leave me alone.

599
00:32:57,286 --> 00:33:00,370
I didn't want her in the middle of this.

600
00:33:02,835 --> 00:33:06,721
she hates me for not leaving him.

601
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:09,753
it is not your fault, it's his fault.

602
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,621
Take care of her. It's his fault!

603
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:15,092
Look, just... just
don't hurt her please!

604
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:20,293
self-defense.

605
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:22,893
It's a cop's best friend.

606
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:25,353
Dude, can't swim in your gear.

607
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:29,720
Sam, I know it's a little unorthodox;
no time for a wet suit. You good to go?

608
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:31,323
Ready, freddy.

609
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:34,650
That side of the boat,
hatch-side of the cabin.

610
00:33:34,665 --> 00:33:36,522
This isn't a rookie thing, is it?

611
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:39,070
No sir.

612
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:44,092
so much for patrol night.

613
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:47,803
Swimmer in the water.

614
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:50,333
In a few minutes we're gonna have ears.

615
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:55,672
He's not exactly a fish.

616
00:34:03,178 --> 00:34:04,173
Rebecca?

617
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:06,121
- please! Please!
- Pete?

618
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:07,382
Stop, I'm begging you.

619
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:09,573
Just tell me what I can do?

620
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:12,441
Hey, it's greg parker, I'm glad you...

621
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:18,001
rebecca? Pete?

622
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:22,932
- spike, get me a zodiac.
- All right.

623
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:25,532
Sarge? He's beating sadie up.

624
00:34:25,547 --> 00:34:27,942
Sister feels responsible;
she introduced them.

625
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:29,750
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Sergeant,do not leave.

626
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:34,342
Today, sadie got defensive, it all went south,
and I guess rebecca decided enough is enough.

627
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,622
Wordy, you sure?

628
00:34:35,635 --> 00:34:36,940
Wait till you see her neck.

629
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:39,481
That's from today's
good times, apparently.

630
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:40,951
What're we hearing?

631
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,012
Nothing yet.

632
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:43,963
I thought we were getting ears?

633
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:46,683
Guys, we are running out of light.

634
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:52,061
mic is in place.

635
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:58,163
got it.

636
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:02,413
Now this is gonna work out pretty
well, 'cause my ass is covered.

637
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:07,922
I've already told anyone that's listening
that you're a crazy, psycho bitch.

638
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:17,292
I'm going to kill you
right here, right now.

639
00:35:17,706 --> 00:35:20,780
guys, it's not her, it's him.

640
00:35:20,798 --> 00:35:23,082
And when you stop breathing...

641
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:25,412
you're gonna know that it's your fault.

642
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:36,882
pete, you're a police officer,
you know where this is going.

643
00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:40,821
The phone is ringing, you need to
pick it up before it goes to voicemail.

644
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:43,480
Guy, I'm comin' to ya.

645
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:45,891
It's okay, wordy, we're gettin' her out.

646
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:49,530
Rebecca, if you won't talk
to us, we're coming in.

647
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,023
yeah, I got it. I hear you.

648
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:00,260
Pete, what's going on in there?

649
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:02,972
It's okay, I got the gun back.

650
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,253
I got her contained.

651
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:06,210
What do you mean, you've
got her contained, pete?

652
00:36:06,237 --> 00:36:08,413
She's unconscious.

653
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:11,970
If he's telling the truth and she's
out cold, we can't use the gas.

654
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:14,230
All right, fine... , buy me 90 seconds.

655
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:16,351
Lewis, spike, let's go.

656
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:19,142
- Pete, how's she doing?
- You heard her right?

657
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:22,533
You saw her...

658
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:24,622
you saw her trying to kill me, right?

659
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:26,200
Yeah, that's right, we saw that.

660
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,083
Hey, pete, how's she
doing, is she breathing?

661
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:32,493
I dunno.

662
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:35,621
Well, just turn e thboat around and
come on back, buddy. It's all good.

663
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:38,681
I can'T. I can'T. I don't
know what happened, I just...

664
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:42,491
that's okay, buddy. That's
okay. okay, we're good.

665
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:45,032
Your wife's here, she's telling
us everything that happened.

666
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:46,881
Sadie? She is?

667
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:50,450
She's telling us. She's telling us that
rebecca broke into your house today.

668
00:36:50,465 --> 00:36:53,042
She's confirmed it.

669
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:58,110
you listen to me, okay? It's done.

670
00:36:58,327 --> 00:37:00,392
The woman's out of
control. We all get that.

671
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:01,770
Your partner's already said it.

672
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,991
She took your gun, she came after you.

673
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,291
now, you're a good cop.

674
00:37:10,306 --> 00:37:13,262
So let's not let this situation
get in the way of that.

675
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:17,392
Okay, whatever you had to do, you
did in self-defense, I get that.

676
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:19,021
Please, buddy, let's just...

677
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:23,580
let's just stop this from getting
out of control. Come on back.

678
00:37:23,596 --> 00:37:27,141
Okay, we bring her in, we slap a restraining
order on her until she goes to jail,

679
00:37:27,155 --> 00:37:30,872
no questions asked. You
hear me? Are you listening?

680
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:34,512
better for you all the way
around if she makes it, pal.

681
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:47,333
Pete? Pete, talk to me.

682
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:01,052
Put the gun down! Put
the gun down! Down!

683
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:03,071
Interlock your fingers behind your head!

684
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:05,383
Thank god you guys are here.
Thank god you guys are here.

685
00:38:05,395 --> 00:38:08,613
Down on the ground! Down
on the ground! Come on!

686
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:09,931
what the hell are you doing?

687
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:11,933
Cuff him!

688
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:14,042
She's the one, right?

689
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:17,262
You saw her, right? you got her?

690
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:25,000
I mean, we got her, right?
We got her. We get her good?

691
00:38:26,658 --> 00:38:29,002
All right, you're gonna be okay. You're
gonna be oka Y. You're gonna be okay.

692
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:31,010
I'm sorry I have to do this.

693
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:33,870
All right, you're okay.

694
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:36,603
You're gonna be all right, rebecca.

695
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,731
Okay, okay, the facades over,
you can take these off now.

696
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:41,123
- Where is she?
- Sadie?

697
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:42,693
Keep her away.

698
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,892
Don't worry about this, it's just...

699
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:45,643
it's a part of the procedure.

700
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,900
How's caitlin? Where's caitlin, honey?

701
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,852
Don'T.

702
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:53,182
Go. Go.

703
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,683
Okay, how far are we taking this?

704
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:58,720
I mean, come on
- that was good.

705
00:38:59,026 --> 00:39:01,610
- Now, how about you take these cuffs off?
- Pete.

706
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:04,410
- How 'bout we take the cuffs off now?
- Pete.

707
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,923
What?

708
00:39:05,935 --> 00:39:07,103
Have a listen.

709
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:09,252
We got her, all right? This is good.

710
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:14,572
you know, this is gonna work out
pretty well 'cause my ass is covered.

711
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:18,472
I am going to kill you
right here and right now.

712
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:22,050
and when you stop breathing, you're
gonna know that it's your fault.

713
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:26,011
Matty? Come on. Please, matty.

714
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:28,150
We clean up after each
other, that's what we do.

715
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:30,623
Guess I didn't really know what
I was cleaning up after, did I?

716
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:33,230
say it!

717
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:34,483
Say it, bitch.

718
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:37,373
You lying piece of garbage.

719
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:39,971
- I want my lawyer.
- You're gonna need one.

720
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,952
Rebecca.

721
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:53,200
rebecca.

722
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:56,301
I'm so sorry.

723
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:59,252
Please, please, don't be sorry.

724
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:02,141
It's me, it's my fault.

725
00:40:02,155 --> 00:40:05,041
I think it's broken.

726
00:40:05,058 --> 00:40:06,963
We're going straight
to the hospital, right?

727
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,341
She needs a doctor.

728
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,232
I'm sorry, I...

729
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:14,352
this wasn't what I...

730
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:17,412
I just wanted him to stop, you know?

731
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:21,913
I know. It's okay.

732
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:29,391
- get him outta here, wordy.
- Come on, let's go.

733
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:30,963
Watch your head.

734
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:37,881
9:33 pm, incident
contained. Two arrests.

735
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:39,713
One heading to hospital.

736
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:43,900
* When I'm awake *

737
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:48,031
* and when no one else can see...*

738
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,472
* how I feel *

739
00:40:52,257 --> 00:40:56,331
* when the night comes meddling *

740
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:59,390
* I was movin' along...*

741
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:01,311
- so, I heard you're a really good swimmer.
- yeah.

742
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:04,443
No, I did. Were you on the swim team?

743
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:07,170
yeah, I admit, I'm not the...

744
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:09,433
I'm not the biggest fan of water.

745
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:11,690
- No?
- No.

746
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,422
I was raised in the desert.

747
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:20,892
Hey, buddy. Listen, tell your
mom I'm on my way home, okay?

748
00:41:22,968 --> 00:41:25,852
Wanna play some driveway games?

749
00:41:30,236 --> 00:41:34,331
* I was movin' along *

750
00:41:34,346 --> 00:41:37,593
* I was movin' along *

751
00:41:38,517 --> 00:41:41,981
* you can rely on me *

752
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:50,572
* we were only...*

753
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:53,351
hey, shelley.

754
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:57,070
* Loving you alone *
