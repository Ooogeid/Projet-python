1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,830
You're gonna show me that you're
still the guy that i can trust.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,820
Man,i told you,when the
time's right i'll do 'em.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,200
Is right now!

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,820
There needs to be retribution.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,220
They're gonna die
anyway,might as well be by you.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,320
Bravo team,what's your eta on b ward?

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,460
Minutes,boss.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,460
You got seconds.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,580
We've gotta get to the
hostages before they do.

10
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,070
She is gonna keep you in
here as long as she lives.

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,790
You do this now,finish
it,no one knows it's you.

12
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,070
She doesn't show up to
your parole board hearings.

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,040
It's your shot to get out.

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,250
- No!
- Let me put it another way!

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,690
You kill her or i kill you; your choice.

16
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,760
***

17
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,460
So... anton burrows,you've been
incarcerated now for 15 years,

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,690
And this is your fourth appeal
for parole,is that right?

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,990
Yes,ma'am.

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,080
And you feel you've been rehabilitated?

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,450
I've tried.

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,820
Tried?What,mr. Burrows?

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,470
To understand... what i did.

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,420
So i can learn from
it; be a better person.

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,870
It says here that you have
become something of an artist.

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,060
Participation in therapeutic
activities,that's very positive.

27
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,010
Yes,it is.

28
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,440
Do you have something you could show us?

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,070
I... i-I'd rather not.

30
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,400
All right.

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,050
I-I brought something.

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,310
A statement.Go ahead.

33
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,120
"To the amiri family.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,870
There are no words hat
can express how sorry i am

35
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,400
For what i did to your
family and to mr. Amiri.

36
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,390
I know and you know that...

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,360
There's nothing i can say or do
that will bring mr.Amiri back.

38
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,250
I want you to know that i-I'd do anything if i
could go back and change what happened that day.

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,780
Ms.Amiri,this parole board has
all of your letters on record,

40
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,730
Describing the pain that your family
has suffered since mr. Burrows' crime.

41
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,860
Is there any further statement

42
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,920
That you would like to make at this time
regarding mr.Burrows' request for parole?

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,070
What i would like to say... i can't.

44
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,970
Not in front of my mother.

45
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,100
I congratulate mr.Burrows on
his success in the visual arts,

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,720
And on his performance for us today.

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,920
He says he's "changed"?

48
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,480
That's nice; we haven't.

49
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,550
In 15 years,it's been the same
life,the same feeling,day after day.

50
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,700
I had so little time with my father,i
can barely remember what he looks like.

51
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:07,390
But i know he was a kind man,a gentle
man,and he was slaughtered by this... animal.

52
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,680
I want him to
die,alone,like my father did.

53
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,740
You don't know what
happened,you don't know me!

54
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,800
I know he meant nothing to you,nothing!

55
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,190
And he was the only father i had!

56
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,950
Guards!

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,960
What do you need me to tell you?!

58
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,000
What do you... what
do you want from me?!

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,050
What do you need to hear me say?!

60
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,930
Anton,calm down!

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,380
And i'll be at your next parole
hearing and the next one...

62
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,990
Get him out to the yard,cool him off.

63
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,240
Until you're dead!Do you understand me?!

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,010
I'll escort these folks outta here.

65
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,750
They're transferring warshaw
to maximum lockdown tomorrow.

66
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,880
I know.We're going today.

67
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,620
Today?Are you sure?

68
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,720
We got everything we need.Crew's
up to speed.Word's already out.

69
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,190
Get it started.

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,920
All right,boys,put your cards down.

71
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,700
Let's get this started,right now.

72
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,980
Follow my lead.

73
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,670
You two doing okay?

74
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,900
We're fine,thank you.

75
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,830
I don't buy that crap either.

76
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,360
You know,they got a book out on how to write
these "boo-Hoo" statements to the victims?

77
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,410
What's that?

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,800
This is potter,what's the alarm?

79
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,060
- Follow me.
- What's going on?

80
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,450
Just follow me now!Come on,we gotta go.

81
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,750
Gimme your money! Gimme your money!

82
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,490
Get out of my store!

83
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,970
Get outta here,man.Open
the door!Open the door!

84
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,210
For god's sake,open the door!

85
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,570
Everybody knows what to do.

86
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,540
Break into the box,gear up.

87
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,250
Find me some phones.

88
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,050
Carter!Carter!Carter!

89
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,340
We got visitors,hallway 8.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,390
Grab 'em; they may come in handy.Go.

91
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,350
Anything you can!Find me a phone!

92
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,460
Okay,we've got multiple hostages
and 75 to 100 inmates involved.

93
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,990
We're looking for
knives,shivs,shanks,improvised maces.

94
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,080
Everything is a weapon,so we're strictly
less-Lethal: gas,rubber bullets,tasers.

95
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,510
A prison riot and we're less-Lethal?

96
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,610
- No firearms in the prison.
- Yes

97
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,050
You think it's bad now?Throw
a loaded gun into the mix.

98
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,820
And us up against 100 cons
with shanks and shivs isn't?

99
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,330
Come on,you ever get hit by a
rubber bullet?Take anybody down.

100
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,390
That's good.'Cause it's not like we're running into
a place with a dozen guys we've put away or anything.

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,580
All we know is it appears
to have started in the yard;

102
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,000
One inmate attacked another unprovoked,the
guards intervened,and things escalated from there.

103
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,610
We'll setup command post here.

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,590
Any casualties reported so far?

105
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,230
So far only the inmate and a
guard who was attacked in the yard,

106
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,520
But i've got 3 guards unaccounted for.

107
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,180
They've blacked out cctv cameras,so
we've got a lot of blind spots.

108
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,110
We've been trying to lock down the
wings,but they've disabled the main control.

109
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,770
So all the prisoners
are out of their cells?

110
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,450
Except for the ones in maximum lockdown.

111
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,890
Okay,folks,priority here is containment.

112
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,450
Let's look at the floor plans.

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,210
There's a guard station on each wing.

114
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,820
Now can we do a manual
lockdown from those stations?

115
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,600
Yeah,it's the only way.They've taken the
inner control room; it overrides us here.

116
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,350
Taking over 4 guard
stations?Letting everyone loose?

117
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,190
This is looking more planned
than spontaneous to me.

118
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,010
Warden,how many guards can you give us?

119
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,370
We got 20 already
inside,there's more coming in.

120
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,200
Okay,good.

121
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,370
Sam,head up alpha team
with jules and spike.

122
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
Leah,wordy,you're with me,bravo.

123
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,270
We clear and contain
wing by wing,a through d.

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,190
Warden,we're gonna use
your guards as backup.

125
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,470
Maximum caution.

126
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,140
These gentlemen have
already lost their freedom,

127
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,180
They won't win friends by being
co-Operative with us here today.

128
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,620
We're gonna need you on comm,warden.

129
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,020
This your pa?

130
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,180
This is sergeant gregory parker with
the police strategic response unit.

131
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,980
Attention all inmates,tactical teams

132
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,940
And reinforcements to the guards are
being deployed throughout the facility.

133
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,790
They have been instructed to take all
necessary steps to resolve this disturbance.

134
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,700
If you return immediately to your
cells,there will be no further repercussions.

135
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,430
Sergeant,problem.

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,050
Who are they,warden?

137
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,650
There was a parole hearing today.

138
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,070
That looks like the victim's family;
they didn't make it out in time.

139
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,820
Okay,team,we've got civilians inside.

140
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,740
"A" wing hallway.

141
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,930
Sam,new priority.

142
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,810
Alpha team to "a"
wing,civilians at risk.

143
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,170
We're to stay less lethal?

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,320
Until you hear otherwise.Let's go.

145
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,850
All right,warden,you run the show here.

146
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,840
Any idea what triggered this thing?

147
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,510
We've got good services
here,we're pretty progressive,

148
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,880
- We're not overcrowded...
- Yeah,but how about who might be behind it?

149
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,860
Well,i haven't had any prisoner
grievances in the last ten months.

150
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,660
They take all their grievances to you?

151
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,810
No,of course not.

152
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,090
Then how about telling me about some
of the power players you got in here.

153
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,370
Multiple stab wounds,we
have to move him.

154
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,420
Boss,we've got the injured inmate.

155
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,570
Multiple stab wounds to the chest.

156
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,240
Any identifying marks or tattoos?

157
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,480
Picture coming your way.

158
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,260
Boss,we gotta get him outta here
fast,i'm gonna send him to the e.M.T.S.

159
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,540
- Hey,you gotta come here.
- Stay where you are!

160
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,240
Do not move! Do not move!

161
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,280
Okay,okay,okay.

162
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,500
They got the guards.

163
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,330
Where?

164
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,900
They took 3 guards to "c" wing.

165
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,540
- Who took them?
- I didn't see their faces.

166
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,040
You sure about that?

167
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,830
Look,i don't need that kinda trouble.

168
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,230
Move it.Boss,we may have
location on the missing guards.

169
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,050
I'm taking an alternate
route to get the amiris out.

170
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,140
Back off,carter.

171
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,180
You really wanna do this,frank?

172
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,430
Where's carter?

173
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,010
He's still running down the civilians.

174
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,620
We don't have time.

175
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,700
- Come on,carter.
- Come on,sweetheart.Come on.

176
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,060
No,no!Please,no!

177
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,340
It's not the end of the world.

178
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,010
Who's a big boy?

179
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,230
No,no!

180
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,290
Back off.

181
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,400
No one touches them.

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,640
They're mine.

Male,30 to 35 looks like he was
rown down a flight of stairs.

188

Not yet,but we've got "a" wing
contained.Prisoners are in their cell.

192
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,080
Manual override's in the guard
roo 300 feet to the nth of you.

193
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,250
Lock it down and move out.

194
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,970
- Copy that
- What do we do with the body?

195
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,210
We'll have to deal with him later.

196
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,760
The priority one is
to locate thocivilians.

197
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,630
Warden,help me see if
there's a biggericture here.

" He's an untouchable.

201
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,380
Satan's blood's the top gang in
thislace.He's one of their captains.

202
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,680
They pretty much control
all the drs,everything.

203
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,630
Yeah,well,a riot's a go time to settles.

204

- No,this was a mista though.
- Why's that?

205
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,760
If youit the blood,they hit you twice

Sloan keller... that name's
familiar.Can i see h file?

228
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,670
He's a hired killer,in for life.

Thpanetta killings; that sloan keller?

230
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,290
The benares killings the mitchinson

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,290
You killed caer?!

232
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,820
I didn't think you had that in you.

233
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,610
Did you know heas one of my boys?

234
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,380
Your boy was about to  'em.

235
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,830
Okay,that's not smart.

236
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,600
I mean,two civilians?

237
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,870

Keeping them alive right

When we're done here,you want them?

252
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,030

" Yes,boss.

255

One,you're gonna take the hostages,you're
gonna put 'em wre i tell you to.

256
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,310
And two,i need someone to tk
to the cops about our demands.

257
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,570
It was gonna be carter,but maybe
it'll be a little bit better

258
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,830
If it was coming from
the warden's litt buddy.

259
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,220
- What're we asking for?
- It doesn't matter,ou just keep 'em busy.

260
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,030
We're breaking outta "d"
wg,goin' through a wall.

261
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,100
But no one's going anywhere
unless you buy us a little tie.

262
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,710
All right.

263
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,350
But they're still mine.

264
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,530
No one touches burrows' little pets.

265

There's a common room to yor left.

269
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,880
It might be where
they're holding the guas.

270
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,500
Three guards,immediate
left,they look hurt.

271
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,360
Two inmates... one on the
hostages,one to the ight.

Are you good?

286

Nice work,eddie.

287
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,990
Sergeant parker,i got something

288
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,390
This is anton burrows,we
have a list of demands.

289
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,720
Send us someone out here
who can make decisions.

290
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,960
I know him.

291
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,130
Boss,i know him.Back in the day,when i
was at 41 division,patrolling gangland

292
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,180
Who'd he run with?

293
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,530
He wasn't a gangbanger,he
was more a hang-Around.

294
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,120
There's something you should know.

295
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,450
Anton burrows was up
for parol this morning.

296
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,450
And?

297
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,540
He wasenied for the fourth time.

298
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,740
Four times?Why?

299
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,900
Because every time the
victim's family,the amiri's,

300
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,220
They attend and they make
sure he doe't get out.

301
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,910
So,you're telling me,th are
the civilian hostages in there?

302
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,260

303
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,540

304
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,620
'Kay,go.

305
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,360
Sam,i gotta do this alone.

306

Been a long time,anton.

307
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
Yeah,a long time.

308
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,470
Not the place i was hopi to find you.

309
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,120
You knew i was in here.

310
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,110
I mean,right now,tanding
there,running this whole mess.

311
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,090
Gotta do at i gotta do.

312
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,490
Osges safe?

313
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,330
They're safe.

314
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,760
Anton,i trusted your word once.

315
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,840
They're safe,i swear to you.

316
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,650
I hope so.

317
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,400
Anton,i kw who they are.

318
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,330
We demand the following:

319
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,220
Increase to two the number
of conjugal visits per moh.

320
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,070
Larger number of spac
available for work detail.

321
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,240
Three: creation of a prisoner's
advocacy board to addss inmate concerns.

322
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,440
All this for conjugal visits?

323
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,670
There's gotta be
something more going on.

324
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,020
That's it?

325
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,190
For now.

326
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,590
But this thing's not
over until we sait is.

327
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,270
Don't forget that.

328
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,420
Anton,if anythg happens
to those hostages...

329
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,750
The only way something happens to those
hostages is if you come in here looking for them.

330
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,440
Noget us what we want;
you don't have much time.

331
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,130
Remember the ridgestone
towers,back  the days?

332
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,280
That's exact what you're looking at
here,unless we get some satisfaction.

333
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,820
You unrstand?Do you understand me?!

334
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,240
I understand.I understand.

335
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,750
Il start working on the demands.

336
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,310
It's not adding upeddie.

337
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:44,750
Boss,we need  regroup,set
up for immediate action.

338
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,290
Ddie,we just agreed to negotiate?

339
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,230
Time.

340
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,180
Not if we're gonna sto a breakout.

341
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,180
Where are you taking us?

342
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,180
Where the boss wants us to go.

343
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,620
Move.

344
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,410
The guy right there.

345
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,470
He's trying hard to look
like anton's sidekick.

346
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,320
Okay,it's the other way around.Warden?

347
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,920
If sloan keller's behind the riot,then this
isn't just about a list of minor grievances.

348
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,640
Well,does a breakut make sense?

349
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,870
Well,sloan thinks big.

350
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,690
- Eie,what's making you feel so sure?
- He brought up the ridgestone towers.

351
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,280
- And?
- Gang bust.

352
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,620
A big boss,it was the west end
crew.We had 'em holed up in a standoff.

353
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,850
When we finally went in,they were gone.

354
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,090
They'd cut through the walls
in all the oter apartments.

355
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,820
So sloan wants to break out,but first he triggers a
riot so that the place is surrounded by cops?Smart.

356
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,630
The fact that they're here kinda
suggest they're not master criminals.

357
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,430
Well,maybe he didn't trigger the
riot.Maybe he's just capitalizing on it.

358
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,000
Nah,it feels like it was part of a plan.

359
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,400
You sure anton's not playing you?

360
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,340
I know how it sounds.

361
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,680
I got a feeling he's on the level.

362
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,890
Where do you figure
they're staging this?

363
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,470
Well,"a" and "c" is locked down.

364
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,030
So it's gonna be "b" or "d.

365
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,100
" "D" has the most exposed
ll leading to the outside.

366
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,620
I've got team four positioned
along the perimeter.

367
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,860
So,no one's going anywhere.

368
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,190
All right,what kind of
eyes do we got in there.

369
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,410
Couple of cameras is all;
they've knocked the others out.

370
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,780
All right,let's take a
look at "d" wing.Entrances?

371
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,580
There's a hallway that
runs to it from here.

372
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,940
Comes out right in the back of "d" wing.

373
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,460
So we got the element of surprise.

374
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,040
Wordy,spike,you're with me.

375
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,450
- Sam...
- We'll grill for intel.

376
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,140
Yeah,we're gonna start with the inmates.

377
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,360
Let's go.

378
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,120
Eddie.One second.

379
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,130
I took a look at anton's file.

380
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,270
It says that anton's lawyer contacted you
at his sentencing as a character witness.

381
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,580
Anything i need to know?

382
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,410
You checking up on me or...?

383
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,440
No.Jt doing a background.

384
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,400
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.

385
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,710
Malvern,right?

386
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,060
Yeah.

387
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,570
Tough crowd.

388
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,140
Look,my folks and his
folks were friends.

389
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,080
He was a little bit younger than me and when his
dad died,he got mixed up with the wrong crowd.

390
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,140
My old maasked me to look out for him.

391
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,190
He's a good kid going off the rails?

392
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,300
He was a good kid.

393
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,450
He was a great kid,he had a big heart.

394
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,640
A rookie uniform...
trying to save the wor,

395
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,970
So i went to his mother and i went to his
teachers and i said,i'll look out for him.

396
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,460
I'll look out for him!

397
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,010
And then one night... and one night i get
a call from a buddy of mine in homicide.

398
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,670
There's a shooting down at...
kingstonoad,convenience store.

399
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,470
That's not your fault.

400
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,580
It doesn't matter.It doesn't matter.

401
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,190
I thought he could beat the odds.

402
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,000
Eddie... edd?

403
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,570
Do you believe what
anton's telling you now?

404
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,180
I don't know if he's
lling the truth or not,

405
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,310
But i do kno that he coulda killed
those hostages by now if he wanted to.

406
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,520
When they meet those demands,i
mean,what're we gonna do then?

407
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,480
Well,we'll make more demands,and
more,until our work here is done.

408
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,600
I thought we were busting out?

409
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,890
Who asked you to think?

410
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,590
Get back to your pets.

411
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,010
There's no breakout?

412
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,630
Sure there is.

413
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,500
For anyone who wan to run straight
into the arms of a swat team.

414
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,440
Bomb's good to go.How're
we doing on the blood's?

415
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,730
They've taken care of all four capins.

416
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,840
Warshaw's the lastone.

417
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,950
Good.

418
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,260
Let's go!Right there!Right there!

419
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,920
Up against the wa!Hands on
the wall!Hands on the wall!

420
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,460
Up where i can see 'em!

421
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,310
Wordy and  do not move!

422
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,600
Don't move! Don't move!
All right,let's go.

423
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,330
Get 'em outta here.

424
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,390
Get 'em outta here.

425
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,160
Outta here,now!

426
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,710
This doesn't make any sense.

427
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,160
Why?

428
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,230
The bomb,it's good to go,it's set up
really smart,it's solid piece of work.

429
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,440
But it's lame.

430
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,130
What?What do you mean?

431
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,360
I mean it's just propane.

432
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,280
The kind of explosion you're gonna get
from this,y'll get a big flash,a big boom.

433
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,450
But a flash isn't gonna take out a wall.

434
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,940
You need somethin' with actual force,and
this just... it doesn't have any.

435
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,560
Spike,those guys looked
ike they were good to go.

436
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,590
Spike: well,everything about this
looks good to go,but to go nowhere.

437
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,170
- Unless...
- Unless the big boom was e whole point.

438
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,240
Distraction?

439
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,100
Eddie,we've got a
situation in the commissary.

440
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,680
Alpha's on their
way,you better move fast.

441
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,150
Bomb's diffused,boss.We're on our way.

442
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,500
What happens now?

443
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,550
You've made your demands,now what?

444
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,240
I don't know.

445
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,560
I'm sorry.

446
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,540
- ***
- Hush,my daughter.

447
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,260
What she said about you
today,you have to understand.

448
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,940
I know.

449
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,320
You know what?

450
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,930
You don't want to hurt us,do you?

451
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,440
Why'd you have to come here?

452
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,300
Because you killed my father.

453
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,750
Left him to die alon you belong here.

454
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,780
Ii belonged here,you'd already be dead.

455
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,670
Why did you kill my husband?

456
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,700
We know why
- For money,for...

457
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,430
Tell me.Tell me.

458
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,450
And not what you tell them to get out.

459
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,210
The truth.

460
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,680
Why?

461
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:05,590
Uh,the place i grew up,either you
get with a ng or the gang gets you.

462
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:14,930
My mom... this... this
cop,they tried to keep me out.

463
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,230
I tried too.

464
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,050
But i just got tired...

465
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:31,480
Of trying,of bng scared all the time.

466
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,400
So these guys say to me,"you wanna
get with something,something good?

467
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,330
Something strong?

468
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,140
Get with us.

469
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,730
See that corner store
over on kingston road?

470
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,310
You gotta rob it.

471
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,790
The guy there,he's used to it.

472
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,360
" Give me the money.Gimme the money!

473
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:07,200
It was just the way in,you know;
to show they could trust me.

474
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,340
I wanted that so bad...

475
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,070
Just to be with something.

476
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,670
So i went in.I had the gun they ga me.

477
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,730
I mean,that store had been hit
ten,twelve times already that year.

478
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,360
Gimme the money!

479
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,350
Get out of my store!

480
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:46,040
All i wanted was the money.

481
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:57,060
But i guess he was just sick of being
robbed,of being afraid all the time.

482
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,450
But... i did it.

483
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:14,440
Ihot and i killed him
because i was afraid.

484
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,140
Th's the only "why" i can think of.

485
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,020
I-I killed your father...

486
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,680
And there's nohing i
can do to take it back.

487
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,050
But he didn't die alone.

488
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,400
Please don't die.

489
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,350
Boss,we got three more victims.

490
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,110
All prisoners.

491
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,960
This was never about a breakout.

492
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,210
They all have the same tattoo.

493
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,970
Yeah,these victims are all
satan's blood: leaders,enforcers.

494
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,410
The ones you want to hit when
you're attempting a takeover.

495
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,610
So they triggered a riot
to keep the guards busy.

496
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,840
Takntage of chaos to get to his enemies.

497
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,030
Tries to distract us with
bogus bombs and bogus demands.

498
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,910
Makes sense
- King of the empire.

499
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,700
That's a whole lot more power than
sloan would have in the outside world.

500
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,970
And it's a day on the
inside no one'll forget.

501
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,970
Warden,how many other
satan's blood untouchables?

502
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,590
After those guys?Just
the top man,terry warshaw.

503
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,860
We got him in custody?

504
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,030
No,he's in "b" wing.

505
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,270
All right,we're on the move.

506
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,080
Oss,upload ua photo on the fly.

507
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,060
Copy.

508
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,290
That's your man.

509
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,810
Boss,we split up into alpha and bravo.

510
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,370
We need to get those hostages secured
before they get a hold of warshaw.

511
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,130
Bravo team,what's your eta on "b" ward?

512
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,210
Minutes,boss.

513
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,370
We gotta get to him bere they do.

514
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,950
He's the grand prize.

515
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,980
With warshaw gone,sloan's
ot what he wants.

516
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,360
When he's got what he wants,he's got
no reason to let the hostages live.

517
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,150
We got you,dead man.

518
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,350
You're dead meat,warshaw.

519
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,200
Make your mo,man.

520
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,660
What the hell did you
say to that cop,burrows?

521
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,300
You were there,you heard me.

522
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,180
What i heard now was the
sound of a mb not going off.

523
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,430
Cops must've got to it
before,means they found out.

524
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,510
Means w have a rat.

525
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,550
Yeah?Well,let's go find him.

526
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,030
Oh,i think we already have.

527
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,600
Oh,yeah?And it couldn't be the 20
other goons you got working for you.

528
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,450
But if that's the way
you feel,make your move.

529
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,540
But a minute!Ke oh,come on.

530
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,760
- Okay,sloan,i'm telling you,i didn't...
- In a few moments...

531
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,100
It's either gonna be all good or 's not.

532
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,510
Then i'll hear what you have to say.

533
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,910
So the bomb wasn't about a breakout.

534
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,130
It was saved as their biggest distraction
for their biggest target,warshaw.

535
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,930
Boss,it looks like nton played me.

536
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,110
Again.

537
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,300
Freeze,sru,drop your weapons!

538
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,300
Drop your weapon!

539
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,150
- Drop your weapon now!
- Hands in the air!

540
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,570
Right now!

541
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,900
Hands on your head!

542
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,070
Rubbebullets take down anyone,huh?

543
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,880
Yeah,so i thought.

544
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,580
Inmate: no,you stay
there,you keep me posted.

545
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,990
Oh,words out.

546
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,260
Cops got 'em before they
could finish warshaw.

547
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,840
He's in protective
custody now.That's it.

548
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,280
So... things didn't
go all our way today.

549
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,420
Close.

550
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,340
So,my question is,which
side are you gonna be on?

551
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,450
Same  always,man,my own.

552
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,750
No,you're gonna need protection,especially now
that satan's blood knows how close you ande are.

553
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,870
So,you are gonna show me that
yore still a guy that i can trust.

554
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,770
Yeah,man,i told you,when the
time's right i'll take 'em out.

555
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,880
Time's righnow!

556
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,190
They're gonna die
anyways,might as well be by you.

557
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,670
Wordy?

558
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,090
Yeah,two seated,not
moving,small; it's gotta be them.

559
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,540
Bosswe've located the hostages.

560
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,110
That door's pretty heavy,if
there are obstacles...

561
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,080
Yeah,the hostages will be dead
before we get the door open.

562
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,800
There's gotta be ather way.

563
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,280
Doesn't lookike it,eddie.

564
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,010
Warden,what is this room?

565
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,690
That's an old weight room.

566
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
But it's been closed
over a year for renos.

567
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,030
It's the only part of the
prison that's just brick.

568
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,960
Posed an escape risk even
though it's four-Storeysp.

569
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,970
Well,if they can break
out,we can break in.

570
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,370
Hey,spike,how do you feel
about explosive entry?

571
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,990
She is gonna keep you in
here as long as she lives.

572
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,770
You do this now.Finish
it,no one knows it's you.

573
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,860
She doesn't show up to
your parole board hearings.

574
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,840
This is your only shot to get out.

575
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,190
No.

576
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,830
Let me put it another way:
you kill her or i kill you.

577
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,600
Your choice.

578
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,750
- You call me an animal...
- Why are you thinking about this?

579
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,530
But i'm not.

580
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,810
Cops are  the move,they're coming in!

581
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,690
Sloan,let 'em live.

582
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,730
I'll say whatever you want; i'll
take the heat for this whole thing.

583
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,780
I told the cops... they
come in... the hostages die.

584
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,470
No!

585
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,600
Let me go!Let me go!

586
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,890
Kill him!

587
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,430
Anton: let me go!

588
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,710
No,get off me,stop!

589
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,050
Get off me!

590
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,880
Get off!

591
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,180
Now get out!

592
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,250
He's mine.

593
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,900
Oh,i've been waiting for this allay.

594
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,790
Warden.

595
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,070
It's 911.

596
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,750
They've got anton on the phoe.

597
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,930
It's parker.

598
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,290
It's anton.

599
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,820
Listen to me,you gotta get in
here,they're gonna killhe hostages.

600
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,270
Anton,it's... okay,we're
working on it,just sit tight.

601
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,940
No,you don't have any time.

602
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,100
You gotta get in here now.

603
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,550
Okay,we're already at the dr.

604
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,520
No,they're expecting that.

605
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,110
All right,just stay on the line.

606
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,880
Eddie,i got anton,i'm
gonna patch him through.

607
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,530
Go ahead.

608
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,870
You can't go through the
door,they're expecting it.

609
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,840
Anton,you told me there
was gonna be a breout.

610
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,090
Why should i trust you now?

611
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,870
I was told there was gonna be a
breakout; that's what i was told.

612
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,600
I'm just trying to keep
them alive,that's it.

613
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,600
If i could just... ****

614
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,700
Seeing is believing,anton.

615
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,010
Yeah... well,if you don' get in here

All right.

617
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,210
Get everybody away from that west wall.

618
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,750
Try to buy us as much time as
possible,can you do that for me,anton?

619
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,030
I'm gonna try.

It's up to you,anton.

625

It's all right,okay?

639
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,720
It's gonna be all right.

640
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,150
All right,come with me.Come on.

641
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,360
Come on,this way.It's
okay,you're safe now.

642
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,280
Against the wall!

643
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,230
They okay?

644
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,400
They're safe,you did good.

645
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,520
Keeping it true.

646
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,130
You're gonna be okay.

647
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,660
You did good,i'm proud of you.

648
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,150
You all right?

649
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,000
Can you do something for me?

650
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,270
Anything you need.Anything
you need,buddy.

651
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,590
It was a nice job.

652
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,820
Team job.

653
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,030
He survives 15 years in this place,he
still manages to hang on to his soul.

654
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,980
Yeah.Something to be said for that.

655
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,360
And when you  out whathat
is,i'm sure you'll say it.

656
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,300
Excuse me?

657
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,530
How're you doing?Is your mom okay?

658
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,530
She will be.

659
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,560
Can you get a message to anton ?

660
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,720
Yeah,yeah,i'm... i'm
sure we could do that.

661
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,550
Tell him... at his next
parole hearing,i'll be there.

662
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,620
I'll speak for him.

663
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,190
Do you think people can change?

664
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,610
I think some people
always had it in 'em.

665
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,040
Anton wanted me to give you something.
