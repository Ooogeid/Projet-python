00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,700
YES?

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,000
EVERY MOVE THAT YOU MAKE,
THEY CAN SEE YOU.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,100
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GONE
BY 2:00,

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,800
HE WILL KILL THE FIRST HOSTAGE.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,400
SPIKE, WE NEED TO
GET IN THERE FAST

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,300
WITHOUT TIPPING THEM OFF

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,300
OR WE LOSE THE CHILDREN.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,100
I'M WORKING ON IT, BOSS.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,300
I JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT
MORE TIME.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,800
NO, WE DON'T HAVE TIME!

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,700
BOSS, WE'RE GETTING
INTO POSITION.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,400
BRAVO TEAM, BLACK WALL.
WE'RE ON WHITE.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,200
I'M READY TO PULL MY MEN BACK
AT 2 P.M.,

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,900
IF FIRST WE CAN TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,300
YOU CAN DO FOR ME.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,100
DANIEL! JENNIFER!

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,800
HURRY, YOUR FATHER'S WAITING.
COME.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,100
DANIEL?

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,800
IRINA, CAN I WEAR
MY OTHER COAT?

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,100
NO, THIS COAT IS BEAUTIFUL
AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,200
BUT I DON'T REALLY
LIKE THIS ONE.

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,900
LISTEN TO ME.

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,200
WHEN I WAS LITTLE GIRL,
JUST LIKE YOU,

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,100
I HAD THIS DREAM,
AND IN THAT DREAM

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
I'M WEARING
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COAT

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,500
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,000
AND, JENNIFER,
THAT COAT LOOKED

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE.

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,500
REALLY?!

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,500
REALLY.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,200
IRINA, I'M READY.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,300
YOUR BAG,
FOR THE HOCKEY?

34
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,200
DAD ALREADY PUT IT IN THE CAR.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
OH, OKAY.

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
CAN'T YOU COME TODAY,
IRINA?

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
NOT TODAY,

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,900
BUT NEXT TIME,
I PROMISE.

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
OFF YOU GO.

40
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,400
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,500
HEY, DAD.
HEY.

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I'LL DROP THEM OFF
AROUND 1:30, 'KAY?

43
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,700
WHAT?! YEAH, COME ON, GUYS.

44
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,700
NO, WAIT, WAIT.

45
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,600
MAYBE YOU FORGOT.
IT'S MY AFTERNOON OFF.

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,300
NO, NO, I THOUGHT VALERIE
TALKED TO YOU.

47
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,400
HER PLANE DOESN'T
GET IN TILL 2:00

48
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,300
AND I'VE GOT A MEETING.

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
OKAY, LOOK,
IT WON'T BE VERY LONG.

50
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
CAN YOU JUST STAY TILL?

51
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,000
THIS AFTERNOON,
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE.

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
WELL, I'LL, UH...

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

54
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,700
IS THIS ALL RIGHT?

55
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,000
YEAH, YEAH.

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DON'T DO
ENOUGH FOR THIS FAMILY.

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:01,800
RIGHT?

58
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,000
LET'S GO, GUYS.

59
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,400
HAVE FUN.
BYE!

60
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
BYE-BYE.

61
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,100
I SAW THE FIGHT THE OTHER NIGHT
AT MY BROTHER'S.

62
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,900
IT WAS BRUTAL.

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,200
UFC? NO, NO, THE PACQUIAO FIGHT.

64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,000
DUDE,
BOXING IS SO TWENTIETH CENTURY.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,700
HEY, IT'S BETTER THAN WATCHING
"THE LION KING."

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,600
I TOOK MY NEPHEW, OKAY?

67
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,900
I'M A GOOD UNCLE.

68
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,200
LION KING?

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,300
HOT TIMES ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

70
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,300
ARE THEY STILL TOURING
THAT THING?

71
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,300
HEY, NEW GIRL!

72
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
SOMETHING I SAID?

73
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,200
NAH. IT'S JUST,
HE'S JUST SHY.

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,900
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

75
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,000
OKAY.

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,900
SORRY. LION KING?

77
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,200
YEAH. SCAR STILL LOSES, TOO.

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,100
ONLY SURPRISE
WAS SEEING THE BOSS.

79
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,100
YOU SAW THE SARGE?

80
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,300
WITH A NICE-LOOKING BLONDE LADY
AND A LITTLE BOY.

81
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,800
OH!

82
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,900
THE BOSS HOOKED UP
WITH A SINGLE MOM.

83
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,100
DON'T LOOK AT ME,
I DON'T KNOW.

84
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,000
COME ON.

85
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,900
ALL RIGHT,
HER NAME'S SYLVIA.

86
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,800
OH HO! SHUT UP.

87
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,100
SERIOUSLY.

88
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,400
HEY-O!

89
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
YES?

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,900
ARE THEY GONE?

91
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,500
YES, THEY ARE GONE,
BUT LISTEN...

92
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,200
MISHA?

93
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
SO HOW'D IT GO?

94
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,900
HOW'D WHAT?

95
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
COME ON.

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,200
OH, YEAH.

97
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,900
IT WAS FUN.

98
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
IT WAS FUN.
THAT'S IT?

99
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,400
IT WAS FUN.

100
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,200
IT WAS "THE LION KING."
WHAT DO WANT ME TO SAY?

101
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,900
YOU LIKE THIS GIRL
OR WHAT?

102
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,000
YOU KNOW WHAT? HERE.

103
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,800
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
HERE'S AN IDEA:

104
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,800
YOU AND ME,

105
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,500
AFTER WE'RE DONE
WITH THE HORMONE THERAPY,

106
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,700
WE GO INTO
THE LITTLE LADIES' ROOM

107
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,100
AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT,
ALL RIGHT?

108
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,400
THAT'S FUNNY STUFF,
FUNNY STUFF.

109
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
I'LL JUST GO GRAB MY PURSE.
I'LL BE BACK.

110
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,900
OKAY.

111
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,200
HEY, EDDIE.

112
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,500
SHE'S GREAT.

113
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,700
YEAH?

114
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
YEAH.

115
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,400
BUT UH...

116
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,900
I TOLD HER THAT WE SHOULD
PROBABLY TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

117
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,700
WHY?

118
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,400
BECAUSE THERE'S
A KID INVOLVED, ED.

119
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,700
YOU LOVE KIDS.

120
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,900
YEAH, I KNOW.

121
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,900
YOU DON'T MESS AROUND
WHEN THERE'S A KID INVOLVED,

122
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,800
NOT UNLESS YOU'RE SURE
HOW YOU FEEL.

123
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,600
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

124
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,300
HOW ELSE ARE YOU GONNA
FIGURE OUT HOW YOU FEEL

125
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,600
IF YOU DON'T SPEND
TIME TOGETHER?

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,500
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
ALL RIGHT,
WHATEVER.

128
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,300
YEAH.

129
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,000
YOU GET WHAT WE NEED.

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
ALL RIGHT.

131
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,300
I GOT THIS.
I GOT THIS.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

133
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,500
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

134
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,100
WHAT?!

135
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,700
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO THIS.

136
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,200
MISHA!

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,300
YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR MIND.

138
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,000
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING.

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,900
THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE.

140
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,100
THEY TRUST ME.

141
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,600
I DON'T WANT TO STEAL
FROM THEM!

142
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,000
MISHA!

143
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,400
JUST LISTEN TO ME!

144
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,300
THEY ARE COMING BACK!

145
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
WHAT TIME?

146
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,100
1:30.

147
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,400
THAT GIVES US
MORE THAN AN HOUR.

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,600
NO! I NEED YOU TO GO NOW!

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,900
STOP!

150
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,100
THIS IS NOT YOUR DECISION.

151
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
OH, MISHA.

152
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,800
THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

153
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,300
IS IT RIGHT THAT YOUR BOY
HAS NO MAMA?

154
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,900
THIS IS WHY YOU DO THIS,
YES?

155
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,700
FOR LEO.

156
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,100
YES, OF COURSE, BUT...

157
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,500
THEY HAVE A LOT.

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,100
WE TAKE TINY BIT.

159
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,400
WITH YOUR SHARE,
YOU CAN GO HOME,

160
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
GET YOUR BOY,
BRING HIM BACK.

161
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
IRINUSHKA,
LOOK AT ME.

162
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,900
I WANT TO MEET HIM
VERY MUCH.

163
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,100
I KNOW HE'S BEAUTIFUL
LIKE HIS MAMA.

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,100
A CHILD IS
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING

165
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,600
IN THE WORLD.

166
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,900
AM I RIGHT?

167
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
GOOD.

168
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,600
GOOD GIRL.

169
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,700
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE GONE
WHEN THEY COME BACK.

170
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,500
YES, YES, GO.

171
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,400
GO.

172
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,900
DON'T FORGET,

173
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,500
CLOSE GATE WHEN YOU GO.

174
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,500
SABISTON RESIDENCE.

175
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,900
IRINA, I'M REALLY GLAD
I CAUGHT YOU.

176
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,100
UH, MR. SABISTON,
I'M JUST LEAVING.

177
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,400
I KNOW YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T STAY,

178
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,200
BUT I'M IN A JAM.

179
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,700
NOT ENOUGH PLAYERS
SHOWED UP FOR THE GAME

180
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,600
SO DENNIS IS BRINGING
THE KIDS HOME.

181
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,200
WHAT?

182
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,700

192
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,800
WHAT A BUNCH OF LOSERS!

193
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,100

195
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,400

HI. TED ASKED ME TO DROP

208
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,300

244
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,500
THEY'VE GOT A YOUNG BOY
AND A NEIGHBOUR...

245
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,200
WE THINK THE GUY
THAT PUT THE CALL INTO 911.

I'M CHECKING THOSE
LICENSE NUMBERS HERE.

247

BEYOND THE FACT

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,400
THAT THEY GOT THROUGH
THE SECURITY SYSTEM.

255
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,500
AND WHEN THEY GOT INSIDE
THEY REACTIVATED IT.

256
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,100
WHICH MEANS THEY'RE SMART
OR ELSE THEY GOT...

257
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,500
THEY GOT FRIENDS.

258
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,400
ALL RIGHT.

259
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,800

LET'S GET A UNIFORM

270
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500

271
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,300

WHO CAN TELL US SOMETHING.

272
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,300

273
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,600
EDDIE, HOW WE DOING?

274
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
GETTING OVER THE FENCE IS EASY,

275
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,100
BUT THEN WE'RE ON
CANDID CAMERA.

276
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,000
CAN THEY ACCESS THE FEED
FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE?

277
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,400
WELL, LET'S ASSUME THEY CAN,

278
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,100
'CAUSE IF WE TRIP THOSE WIRES
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

279
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,400
IT'S YOUR CALL, BOSS.

280
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,900
IT'S TOO SOON TO RISK.

281
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,500
NOT UNTIL WE KNOW WHO,
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

282
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,600
AND HOW THEY'LL REACT.

283
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
WE'VE GOT MOVEMENT
SECOND FLOOR THERE.

284
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,600

285
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,200
IRINA, WHO ARE THESE GUYS?
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

286
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,700
I TOLD YOU,
I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE.

287
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,800
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING...

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
WE GOTTA GO.

289
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,300
DID YOU HEAR ME?!
WE HAVE TO GO!

290
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
SHUT UP!

291
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
THE SYSTEM'S RESET.

292
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,400
IF THEY TRY TO COME THROUGH,
WE'LL KNOW IT.

293
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,300
GOOD.

294
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,100
HOW DO WE GET VIDEO?

295
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,000
I NEED TO KNOW.

296
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,400
THE COMPUTER.

297
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,500
PUT IT ON.

298
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
OKAY, SIT. SIT.

299
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
LISTEN, UM...

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,300

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,400
I MEAN,
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

303
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,100

HOW MUCH YOU WANT AND UH...

305
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,600
YOU KNOW, WE CAN MAKE
SOMETHING WORK.

306
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
SIT DOWN.

307
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,600
HE SPEAKS ENGLISH,
RIGHT?

308
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,300
I DON'T KNOW HIM!

309
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,700
COME ON.

310
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,500
I PAY YOU, UNH?
BIG MONEY, OKAY?

311
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,500
TELL HIM HOW MUCH I HATE
PEOPLE LIKE HIM.

312
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,900
I'VE HATED THEM ALL MY LIFE.

313
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,300
TELL HIM,
PLEASE GIVE ME AN EXCUSE.

314
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,500
HE SAYS HE'D LIKE YOU
TO BE QUIET, PLEASE.

315
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,000
WINNIE, WE FIND OUT
WHO THE OWNERS ARE?

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,100

317
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,400
WE'RE TRYING TO LOCATE THEM.

320
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,300

YES, I'M OKAY.
EVERYONE IS OKAY, BUT...

347
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,200
THEY WILL KILL US

348
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,700
IF YOU DON'T DO EXACTLY
WHAT THEY SAY.

349
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,400
HOW MANY OF THEM ARE THERE?

361
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,700
HAVE THEY TOLD YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT THEMSELVES?

362
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
NO.

363
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO ONE OF THEM.

364
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,800
NO, I'M SORRY.

365
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,000
IRINA, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,900
THAT I SPEAK TO ONE OF THEM
DIRECTLY.

367
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
HE...

368
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,000
HE SAYS THAT THEY
DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

369
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,200
ONLY RUSSIAN.

370
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,500
HE SAYS YOU MUST LEAVE
AND LET THEM OUT;

371
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,900
THAT THEY WILL TAKE
ONE HOSTAGE WITH THEM.

372
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
TELL THEM I'LL WORK ON IT,

373
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,700
TELL THEM I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

374
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,400
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I NEED TO KNOW

375
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE
IN THE HOUSE.

376
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,500
IRINA?

377
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,700
YOHEAR THE NANNY
ON THE HEADSET?

378
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,800
YEAH.
YOU TRUST HER?

379
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,500
RUSSIAN HOSTAGE-TAKER,
RUSSIAN NANNY...

380
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,200
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT
THE SECURITY CODE.

381
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,100
YEAH.

382
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,200
IS SHE IN ON IT?

383
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
MY FIRST GUESS, BUT...

384
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,400
HER FEAR SOUNDS REAL.

385
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,500
EXACTLY.

386
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,700
HEY, WINNIE, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE CAN FIND OUT

387
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,200
ABOUT OUR NANNY
IRINA KAZKOV.

388
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,100
K- A-Z-K-O-V.

389
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,900
COPY THAT.

390
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
WE'VE GOT A POSSIBLE ENTRY.

391
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
SECOND GARAGE,
SIDE OF THE HOUSE.

392
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,800
THAT'S GOOD.

393
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,900
SPIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE SECURITY SYSTEM?

394
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,100
COULD YOU HOLD ON A MINUTE,
PLEASE?

395
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,800
YEAH, BOSS, I'M TALKING
TO THE COMPANY RIGHT NOW.

396
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,400
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GOT
ALL THE WHISTLES AND BELLS,

397
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
AND THEY'VE GOT INFERNO.

398
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
WHAT'S INFERNO?

399
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,700
UH, IT'S LIKE A SOUND BOMB.

400
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,000
IT PARALYZES, BUT HARMLESS.

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,500
ALSO CCTV,
BOTH INSIDE AND OUT.

402
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,000
SO WE CAN SEE INSIDE THE ROOMS?

403
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
NOT THE BEDROOMS,
BUT ALL THE COMMON AREAS.

404
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,800
AND I THINK I CAN OPEN
THE GARAGE DOOR REMOTELY.

405
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,600
IT COULD COME IN HANDY.

406
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
YEAH, BUT WOULD
THEY HEAR IT?

407
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,400
SILENT.
STATE-OF-THE-ART HYDRAULICS.

408
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,300
CAN WE SHUT THE SYSTEM DOWN
REMOTELY?

409
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,600
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

410
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,500
THAT'S GOOD.
LET'S DO IT ON MY SIGNAL.

411
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,000
OKAY, LOU,
LET'S GET THE LADDERS.

412
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
COPY THAT.

413
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,900
HELLO? YOU STILL THERE?

414
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
ANYTHING MOVING OUT THERE?

415
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,400
NO, NOTHIN'.

416
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,600
JUST LET THE CHILDREN GO.

417
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,600
WHY NOT?

418
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
YOU STILL HAVE HIM.

419
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A ROBBERY.

420
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,000
AND THEN HE INTERFERED.

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,900
MISHA.

422
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,900
WE CAN'T SHOW WEAKNESS.

423
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,400
THEY NEED TO BELIEVE WE'LL
STOP AT NOTHING.

424
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,500
AND WHERE WILL WE STOP?

425
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,600
WHAT THE HELL?

426
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,500
WHAT'D YOU DO?

427
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,400
NOTHING!

428
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,900
BOSS, WERE GETTING
INTO POSITION.

429
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,400
BRAVO TEAM, BLACK WALL.
WE'RE ON WHITE.

430
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
ALPHA, BRAVO,
HOLD POSITION. HOLD.

431
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,200
HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE
TO RESTORE THE VIDEO SYSTEM

432
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,900
RIGHT AWAY.

433
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,400
AND THAT YOU HAVE TO REMOVE
ALL OF YOUR MEN

434
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,300
OR THEY'RE GOING TO KILL
A HOSTAGE.

435
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
OKAY, YOU TELL THEM
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

436
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
ALPHA, BRAVO,
ARE YOU WITHIN CAMERA RANGE?

437
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
NEGATIVE.

438
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
GOOD. DON'T MOVE,
DON'T BREATHE,

439
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,500
OR BAD THINGS HAPPEN
TO THE HOSTAGES.

440
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
UNDERSTOOD.

441
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,100
SPIKE, PUT THE SYSTEM BACK UP.

442
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,000
DOING IT NOW.

443
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
SYSTEM'S BACK UP.

444
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
COPY THAT.

445
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,100
IRINA?

446
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,000
OKAY,
WE'VE RESTORED THE SYSTEM.

447
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,600
NEW RULE.

448
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

449
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,300
YOU THERE?

450
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,600
EVERY MOVE THAT YOU MAKE,
THEY CAN SEE YOU,

451
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
AND IF YOU'RE NOT GONE
BY 2:00,

452
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,900
THAT HE WILL KILL
THE FIRST HOSTAGE.

453
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,200
IRINA, NOW I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH THE MAN IN CHARGE.

454
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,300
YOU HEAR ME?

455
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
SERGEANT.

456
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,200
IRINA?

457
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,400
IRINA?

458
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
WHAT'S UP, INSPECTOR?
WE GOT A NEIGHTBOUR HERE

459
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
THAT KNOWS THE NANNY.

460
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,100
YOU WANNA COME TALK
TO HER?

461
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,800
OKAY, TEAM ONE,
ALL EARS IN ON THIS ONE.

462
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,000
WE NEED TO CONNECT
SOME DOTS HERE.

463
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,700
GOOD AFTERNOON.

464
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,800
I'M SERGEANT GREG PARKER.

465
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,300
I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW
THE NANNY, IRINA?

466
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,000
YES, SHE'S A SWEETIE.

467
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,800
I SEE HER AT THE PARK
WITH THE KIDS.

468
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,700
DOES SHE TALK ABOUT
HER PERSONAL LIFE?

469
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,500
WELL, SHE HAS A LITTLE BOY
IN RUSSIA.

470
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,900
HE LIVES WITH HIS GRANDMA.

471
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,700
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD.
SHE MISSES HIM.

472
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,200
NO FAMILY HERE?

473
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,600
NONE THAT I KNOW OF.

474
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,000
DOES SHE ASSOCIATE
WITH BAD GUYS?

475
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,400
ANY FRIENDS?

476
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
THERE IS A NEW GUY IN HER LIFE.

477
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
HIS NAME IS LIKE A GIRL'S NAME.

478
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,200
SASHA... MISH...
MISHA! MISHA.

479
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
MISHA. THAT'S GOOD.
SHE MENTION A LAST NAME?

480
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HIM?

481
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,500
NO, JUST THAT
HE'S REALLY NICE.

482
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,600
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANKS, INSPECTOR.

483
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,900
WELL, IS SHE IN THE HOUSE?

484
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,600
OKAY, TEAM, THOUGHTS?

485
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,300
SOUNDS SOCIALLY ISOLATED.

486
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,100
SHE'S LOOKING
FOR A KINDRED SPIRIT.

487
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,000
VULNERABLE TO PROMISES
ABOUT SEEING HER BOY.

488
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,600
YEAH, THIS ROMANCE SOUNDS
A LITTLE STRATEGIC TO ME.

489
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
IRINA?

490
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,000
THIS IS GREG AGAIN.

491
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,300
HE SAYS THAT YOU'RE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME.

492
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,100
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
ABOUT MISHA.

493
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,200
MISHA?
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

494
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,300
THE MAN YOU'RE DATING,

495
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,800
IS HE WITH YOU RIGHT NOW?

496
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,300
I NEED TO KNOW WHO HE IS.

497
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,000
CAN YOU SPEAK SAFELY?

498
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,100
HE HAS A GUN,
THAT'S WHO HE IS!

499
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
AND HE SAYS THAT
HE WILL KILL ONE HOSTAGE.

500
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
LET ME TALK TO HIM.
JUST PUT HIM ON THE PHONE!

501
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,200
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME?!

502
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
MISHA.

503
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,500
YOU THINK I AM NOT SERIOUS?!

504
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,800
IS THIS MISHA?

505
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE!

506
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT!

507
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
MISHA, MY NAME IS GREG PARKER.

508
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,400
I'M WITH THE POLICE STRATEGIC
RESPONSE UNIT...

509
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,500
HEY, HEY, HEY! NO!

510
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,100
NO, MAN, COME ON!
DON'T! DON'T!

511
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,500
DON'T TOUCH ME!

512
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
THEY'VE GOT SNIPERS OUT THERE!
IRINA!

513
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,600
MISHA!

514
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,100
YOU DON'T DO WHAT I SAY!

515
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,600
LET'S NOT DO ANYTHING
THAT WE CAN'T UNDO,

516
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,000
BECAUSE THEN IT WILL
BE DIFFICULT FOR ME

517
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
TO MEET YOUR REQUESTS,
MISHA.

518
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,800
I'M VERY SERIOUS ABOUT
WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

519
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,200
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE TALK.

520
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,400
YOU WANTED VIDEO BACK;
I GAVE YOU VIDEO BACK.

521
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,900
NOW, MISHA, I'M READY TO PULL
MY MEN BACK AT 2 P.M.

522
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,600
IF FIRST WE CAN TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING

523
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,900
YOU CAN DO FOR ME.

524
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,000
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
MISHA.

526
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,900
MISHA.

527
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,600
MISHA!

528
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,300
MISHA, THIS IS SERGEANT PARKER.

529
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,600
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

530
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,400
MISHA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

531
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
WOODY, WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

532
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.

533
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,700
THERE'S NO WAY TO GET
PAST THAT CAMERA.

534
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,800
I NEED SOMEONE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE NOW!

535
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,300
BOSS, WE'RE SET TO GO IN.

536
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,500
YOUR CALL.

537
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,900
JUST HOLD YOUR POSITIONS.

538
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,700
SPIKE, ANYTHING ON CCTV?

539
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,500
NOTHING, BOSS.
I GOT NOTHING ON THE CAMERAS.

540
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,600
I GOT THE OWNER OF THE VAN.

541
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,100
GUY NAMED MEARS.
SAYS THE VAN WAS STOLEN.

542
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,300
DID HE REPORT IT?

543
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,900
NO.

544
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,400
OKAY, LET'S GET A UNIFORM
TO PICK HIM UP

545
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
AND BRING HIM HERE.

546
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,000
OH MY GOD.

547
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,600
SPIKE, WE NEED
TO GET IN THERE FAST

548
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,500
WITHOUT TIPPING THEM OFF

549
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,400
OR WE LOSE THE CHILDREN.

550
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,300
I'M WORKING ON IT, BOSS.

551
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,400
I JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT
MORE TIME.

552
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,100
NO, WE DON'T HAVE TIME!

553
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,700
COPY THAT.

554
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,200
YES.

555
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
YOU UNDERSTAND I'M SERIOUS NOW?

556
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,700
I'M WATCHING.

557
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,800
IF YOU DON'T TAKE AWAY
YOUR MEN,

558
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,000
TEN MINUTES,

559
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,300
I KILL LITTLE GIRL.

560
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,700
I WARNED THEM.THIS IS THEIR FAULT.

561
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,500
A CHILD IS
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING

562
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,400
IN THE WORLD.

563
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
I WILL NOT LET YOU TOUCH
THESE CHILDREN!

564
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,900
YOU DO WHAT I SAY!

565
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,000
AND I DO WHAT I HAVE TO.

566
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
SO DO YOU!

567
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,900
YOU WATCH;
YOU, COMPUTER!

568
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
WHAT'S UP, LOU?

569
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,800
THE GUY'S STICKING
TO HIS STORY.

570
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,900
HE'S NOT TALKING.

571
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
REALLY.

572
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,900
YOU KNOW WHAT?

573
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,300
THAT JUST SEEMS RUDE TO ME.

574
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,800
RUDE?
WHY AM I RUDE?

575
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,600
BECAUSE, MR. MEARS,
WE JUST HAD A HOMICIDE HERE

576
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,900
AND I'D LIKE TO KEEP
OTHER PEOPLE

577
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,000
FROM GETTING KILLED.

578
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,300
I'D LIKE TO KEEP SOME KIDS
FROM GETTING KILLED.

579
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,600
SO HOW ABOUT YOU FIND
SOME MANNERS?

580
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,900
HOW ABOUT YOU START TALKING

581
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,000
BEFORE I START THINKING
ABOUT OTHER CHARGES TO ADD ON

582
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
ON ACCESSORY TO MURDER?

583
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,000
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

584
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
OKAY, OKAY,
OKAY, OKAY.

585
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
THE VAN WASN'T STOLEN.

586
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,200
NO?

587
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,300
NO.

588
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,800
I LOANED IT TO COLE.

589
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,900
COLE.
IS THAT A FIRST NAME?

590
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,200
IS THAT A LAST NAME?
WHAT IS THAT?

591
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,300
COLE HUYSBERG.
HE'S MY BROTHER-IN-LAW.

592
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,400
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS
WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

593
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,600
HOW COULD I KNOW
THIS WOULD HAPPEN?

594
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,700
DOES COLE KNOW A GUY
NAMED MISHA?

595
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,300
YEAH, YEAH, HE TALKS ABOUT
THIS MISHA GUY ALL THE TIME.

596
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,300
MISHA GOT A LAST NAME?

597
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,800
HE DOES, UH,
KONDRASHEV?

598
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
KONDRASHOFF.

599
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,700
HE'S LIKE A RUSSIAN DUDE.
HE'S EX-MILITARY OR SOMETHING.

600
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
HE HANGS WITH THIS GANG,
UM...

601
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,600
UH, CHOOMA...
CHOOMA, I THINK.

602
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,500
IT MEANS, UH, "PLAGUE"
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

603
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,600
HOLD ON TO HIM.

604
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,300
COME ON, MAN.
I'M HELPING OUT!

605
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,800
I'M GIVING YOU WHAT
YOU NEED HERE!

606
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,600
SO, KONDRASHOFF
IS EX-RUSSIAN ARMY

607
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,300
AND THIS IS WHAT HE DOES
FOR A LIVING NOW.

608
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,800
WINNIE, YOU GOT ANYTHING
ON THE OTHER TWO GUYS?

609
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,300
THE ONE NAMED COLE
HAS A RECORD.

610
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,500
SMALL TIME STUFF, MOSTLY.

611
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,800
THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE GUYS
HE BROUGHT IN FOR MUSCLE.

612
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,900
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S
A WEAK LINK?

613
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,300
MAYBE,

614
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
IF KONDRASHOFF IS THE GUY
I'M DEALING WITH.

615
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,000
HE'S ALREADY LOOKING AT LIFE
FOR KILLING A HOSTAGE.

616
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,300
I DON'T THINK
HE HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO LOSE.

617
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,800
THEN WE'VE GOTTA
GO IN THERE NOW.

618
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,600
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
TO GET TO THE SECOND FLOOR?

619
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,500
MAYBE 30 SECONDS.

620
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,400
BY WHICH TIME BOTH KIDS
ARE DEAD.

621
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,300
GUYS, THERE'S A WAY
WE CAN DO THIS.

622
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:56,700
TALK TO ME.

623
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,300
OKAY, THE SYSTEM'S DIVIDED
INTO SECTORS.

624
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,400
OKAY, WE CAN SHUT THEM DOWN
ONE SECTOR AT A TIME.

625
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
SO AS SOON AS THE NINJAS
GO THROUGH SECTOR ONE,

626
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,000
WE BRING IT BACK UP.

627
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
THEN WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT
AND THEN WE GO TO THE NEXT...

628
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
BEFORE THEY REALIZE
THE SECTOR'S DOWN?

629
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,600
THAT'S THE THEORY.

630
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
WELL, I'M NOT ASKING
FOR THEORY.

631
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,000
CAN WE DO IT?

632
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
YEAH!

633
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,900
THEORETICALLY.

634
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,400
EDDIE?

635
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,100
WE'RE AT THE GARAGE ENTRANCE,
WHITE WALL.

636
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,400
HOW MANY SECTORS BETWEEN US
AND THE BAD GUYS?

637
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,100
THREE.

638
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,500
WE'RE THE OWNERS OF THE HOME.

639
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
WHAT'S GOING ON?

640
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
LET'S GO NOW.

641
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,100
BRINGING DOWN SECTOR ONE.
REPEAT.

642
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,900
BRINGING DOWN SECTOR ONE.

643
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,400
OKAY, SPIKE...

644
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
OPEN THE DOOR.

645
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
COPY THAT.

646
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
WE'RE IN.

647
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,100
WHAT THE HELL?

648
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,500
WHAT?

649
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
I THOUGHT...

650
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,000
IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S OKAY.

651
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,500
WE'RE IN THE GYM.

652
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,300
OKAY. SECTOR TWO STARTS
JUST OUTSIDE THE GYM.

653
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,800
I WANT YOU TO GO INSIDE
AND TAKE THE STAIRS.

654
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,200
STOP AT THE BOTTOM
AND I'LL START SECTOR THREE.

655
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,400
COPY THAT.

656
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,700
I'M BRINGING DOWN SECTOR TWO.

657
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE STAIRS.

658
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,700
COPY THAT.
BRINGING DOWN SECTOR THREE

659
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,400
ON YOUR CALL.

660
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,400
SECTOR TWO,
CAMERA ACTIVE.

661
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
STAY OUT OF RANGE.

662
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,900
MISHA, LISTEN, THAT GUY?

663
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,900
THAT WAS BAD NEWS.

664
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,100
REALLY BAD!

665
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,900
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
TWO KIDS?

666
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,700
YOU WANT TO GO TO JAIL...

667
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,800
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY!

668
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,900
YOU WERE HERE!

669
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,500
LOOK, WHATEVER'S HAPPENING,
IRINA IS NOT A PART OF IT.

670
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,500
I KNOW IT!

671
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,100
SHE WOULD NEVER HURT
THE CHILDREN.

672
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,700
YOU'RE SURE?

673
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,300
OF COURSE I'M SURE.
THEY'RE MY CHILDREN!

674
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,200
I SEE THE WAY
SHE CARES FOR THEM,

675
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,800
THE WAY SHE TALKS
TO THEM.

676
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,200
FOR GOD'S SAKES,

677
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,900
YOU HAVE TO GET OUR KIDS
OUT OF THERE!

678
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,300
IRINA HAS A SON
BACK IN RUSSIA;

679
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,100
WHAT'S THE BOY'S NAME?

680
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,600
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?!

681
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,800
MRS. SABISTON,

682
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,300
WHAT'S THE BOY'S NAME?

683
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,700
YES, IT'S LEO.

684
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,500
DOES IRINA HAVE
A CELL PHONE?

685
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,300
YEAH.

686
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,300
WE GAVE HER ONE.
WHY?

687
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,300
IT'S BEEN TEN MINUTES.
THEY STILL DON'T LISTEN.

688
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,400
OKAY, UNIFORMS AND DETECTIVES,
LET'S PULL OUT!

689
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,700
PULL OUT!

690
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,800
INSPECTOR!

691
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,600
YOU NEED TO SELL THIS.

692
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,100
WE NEED TO GET EVERYBODY
OUT OF HERE.

693
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY CLEAR OUT! NOW!

694
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,400
THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET US
OUT OF HERE.

695
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,200
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

696
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,300
I KNOW THEY DON'T WANT
DEAD CHILDREN!

697
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,200
ANSWER IT.

698
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,500
THEY NEVER GIVE IN
TO HOSTAGE-TAKERS!

699
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU
TO THINK!

700
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
YES?

701
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,600
IRINA, THIS IS GREG.

702
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,400
I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME
VERY CAREFULLY.

703
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,900
I KNOW ABOUT YOUR SON.

704
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,700
WHAT?

705
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,300
AND I KNOW THIS WASN'T
YOUR FAULT,

706
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,300
BUT I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME.

707
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,200
WHAT DOES HE SAY?

708
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,200
HE SAYS THAT THEY NEED
MORE TIME.

709
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

710
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,100
THEY'RE JUST GONNA KEEP
STALLING!

711
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,600
MISHA, HE'S RIGHT!
WE'VE GOT LET THESE...

712
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,500
SHUT UP!
TELL HIM NO MORE TIME.

713
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,400
HE SAYS NO MORE TIME;

714
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,800
THAT HE WILL KILL
THE CHILDREN.

715
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,000
OKAY, HAVE HIM LOOK
OUT THE WINDOW.

716
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,100

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,800

00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,000
THEY SAY THAT THEY WILL
LISTEN TO YOU!

724
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,200
IT'S TRUE!
THEY'RE LEAVING!

725
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,600
WE'RE GETTIN' OUT!

726
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,300

THE STOMACH.

727
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,800
DOES HE SEE THIS?
WE'RE LEAVING.

728
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,600
WE'RE PULLING EVERYBODY OUT.

729
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,400
WE'RE CLEARING THE AREA.

730
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
IS HE SEEING THIS?

731
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,200
YES, THEY SEE,

732
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,300
NOW YOU NEED TO KNOW

733
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,400
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
IRINA.

734
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,000
WE'RE COMING THERE

735
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,700

00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,500
OKAY, JUST TRY AND STAY CALM.

760
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,700

762
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,200

765
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,500

766
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
AN AIRPLANE.

767
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,000
A HELICO... A HELICOPTER.

768
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,600
A HELICOPTER.
HE SAID THAT...

769
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,500
HE'S SENDING A HELICOPTER.
IT WILL BE HERE-

770
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,700

771
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,400
JUST TELL HIM WE'LL DO
EVERYTHING HE SAYS.

772
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,300
THEY GET IT FOR YOU.

773
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,500

774
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,300

775
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,800

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,700
COPY THAT.

777
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,800
IRINA, NOW THIS IS VERY
IMPORTANT.

778
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,300
I NEED YOU AND THE CHILDREN
TO GET BACK AGAINST A WALL...

779
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,200
NOW.

780
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

781
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,700
NOTHING.
THEY'RE GONE.

782
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,200
CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY
WHERE YOU ARE?

783
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,900
WE ARE AT THE SOUTH WALL,
I THINK.

784
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,100
THE SOUTH WALL?

785
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,800
YES. BACK BY THE WINDOWS.

786
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,200
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE
THE GUNMEN ARE?

787
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,300
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY KEEP MOVING AROUND.

788
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,200
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S FINE.

789
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
THE HOSTAGES ARE UP AGAINST
THE SOUTH WALL.

790
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,000
WE CAN ONLY GUESS
WHERE THE GUNMEN ARE.

791
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
SPIKE, SHUT DOWN SECTOR THREE.

792
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,900
COPY THAT.

793
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,900
LISTEN UP, GUYS,
WHEN INFERNO GOES OFF,

794
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,200
IT'S GONNA SOUND LIKE
THE END OF THE WORLD.

795
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,400
MAKE SURE YOU GOT
YOUR EARPLUGS IN.

796
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,500
EARPLUGS.

797
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,800
OKAY, OPEN THE OUTSIDE GATES

798
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,100
WHEN YOU TRIGGER INFERNO,
SPIKE.

799
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,300
COPY THAT.

800
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,600
IRINA?
IRINA, YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR

801
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,200
A VERY LOUD ALARM.

802
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,500
IT'S A SECURITY FEATURE
OF THE HOUSE.

803
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,100
NOW, IT'S GONNA BE SO LOUD
THAT'S IT'S GONNA...

804
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,700
IT'S GONNA MAKE THE GUNMEN
NOT BE ABLE TO THINK.

805
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,200
IT'S GONNA BE A SHOCK
TO THEIR BRAIN,

806
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,800
BUT IT'S HARMLESS.

807
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,400
IT'S HARMLESS,

808
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,800
BUT TO KEEP YOU SAFE,
I NEED YOU AND THE CHILDREN

809
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,300
TO STAY RIGHT UP
AGAINST THE SOUTH WALL.

810
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,000
AND DON'T MOVE.

811
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,700
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

812
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,900

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,200
YOU THINK I'M STUPID?!

854
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,300
BECAUSE I'M RUSSIAN,
YOU THINK I'M STUPID?

855
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,400
NO, I DON'T THINK THAT.

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,300
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GONNA
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

YOU OKAY? HUH?

892
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,500
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

893
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,100
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

894
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
EDDIE.

895
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
YOU DOING OKAY?

896
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,500
I'M OKAY.

897
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,800
ARE YOU OKAY?

898
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,100
MY MISTAKE WAS
WHEN I WANTED MISHA TO TALK,

899
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,200
TRY TO GET HIM TO TALK,

900
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,400
TRY TO GET HIM
TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK.

901
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,300
BUT THAT'S WHAT
SET HIM OFF.

902
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,400
IT MADE HIM KILL
DENNIS MILFORD.

903
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,400
HE THOUGHT I WASN'T
TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY.

904
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
YOU TOOK HIM SERIOUSLY,
GREG.

905
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,700
WE ALL TOOK HIM SERIOUSLY.

906
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,200
GREG, YOU'RE THE GUY

907
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,100
THAT TELLS EVERYBODY
ON THIS TEAM

908
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,700
"JUST DO YOUR BEST."

909
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,100
"JUST DO YOUR BEST;
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO."

910
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,000
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

911
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,600
YOUR BEST
IS BETTER THAN MOST.

912
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
THANKS.

913
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,300
SO, WHY DON'T YOU...

914
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,600
WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT
WITH SYLVIA AGAIN?

915
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
TAKE 'EM BOTH SKATING
OR SOMETHING.

916
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,400
EDDIE, COME ON.

917
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,300
LIKE, COME ON, GREG,
IT'S...

918
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,300
IT'S BEEN NINE YEARS.???

919
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,500
NINE YEARS.

920
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,600
YOU KNOW...

921
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,100
YOU KNOW WHAT?

922
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,000
WHEN I WENT TO DALLAS
TO SEE MY BOY,

923
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,600
TO RECONNECT WITH HIM?

924
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
YEAH.

925
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,100
AH, JEEZ...

926
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,500
I NEVER GOT THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR.

927
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,100
I NEVER GOT TO SEE HIM.

928
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,400
HE WOULDN'T COME OUT.

929
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,900
SO, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO CALL SYLVIA

930
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,800
AND GO SKATING WITH HER BOY

931
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,200
WHEN THAT'S HANGING OVER ME?

932
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,500
* I can see *

933
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,000
* See you there *

934
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,300
* Hanging weightless *

935
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,400
* In the air *

936
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,800
* Wind and sunlight *

937
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,300
* In your hair *

938
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,100
* I can see you *

939
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:50,400
* I can see you there *

940
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,000
* Who is to say? *

941
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,700
* Who is to blame? *

942
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,300
* There's nobody
that wants you... *

943
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,700
* Like I do *

944
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,600
* Who is to say? *

945
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,900
* Who is to know the truth? *

946
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
* Yeah... *

947
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
* When no one is left *

948
