1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,400
What are they doing?

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,200
Jessie, I think we're done!

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,300
Terry, look!

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
They're going to shoot!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,500
They're going to kill us!

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Cover's blown,
Lewis, you got no time.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,500
Take the shot, Lou.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,200
Hold on,

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Hold on, hold on!

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,000
What are they doing?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,100
We have a baby?

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,900
Hey jess?

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Jess, you there?

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,100
Jess, it's me.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Look, I know you're there,
just listen.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,100
I'm not saying you don't
got every right to be pissed.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,300
But what I been through in these
last few months it's made me realize,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,500
It's made me see..

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,600
I've changed and I'm ready.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,300
I just wanna be with you
and our baby boy.

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,700
Jess?

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,800
What's wrong?

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
He's gone Terry.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,600
I gave him up,
i gave our baby away.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,700
What?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is that the guy?

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,300
Good...

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,900
it's good
when they run, huh?

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,300
Yeah.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,900
Save some
for the rest of us.

31
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,700
Will do.

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,800
Four arrests, one warrant.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,200
I know what you're thinking,
that is some kind of record, ed.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,100
How do you do it?

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,700
Well, Greg, I find...

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,500
how's she doing?

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,300
She's fine.

38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,700
She shot a cop
in the line of the duty.

39
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,000
She did her job.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,500
And you're saying she's
got no reaction, no issues.

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,300
No...

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,100
I'm saying.

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,700
You cut me some slack
when I had issues.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,300
She deserves the same.

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,700
I told you
i was pregnant,

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,200
You went out for smokes

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
And what, how many months
later you come back?

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,400
That's messed up.

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,300
I was just
doing a lot of thinking.

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,800
Yeah well,
so was i.

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
They made this
introduction book.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
The agency showed it to me.

53
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,400
Look at the house
they got on the bridlepath.

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,500
I've never even been up there.

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
And then I told myself,

56
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,200
Doesn't he deserve that?

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,000
You know, when he was born
something in me just said,

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is wrong.

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,300
And then I was trying to tell
myself that feelings were wrong,

60
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,700
That it was the right
thing to do.

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
And I tried calling them
once to change my mind,

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,700
But they only have three weeks
and it was one past...

63
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,000
But it was the
right thing to do.

64
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,700
It was just
the right thing to do.

65
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,200
Terry, I'm so sorry.

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,500
No, no, no,
I'm the one who left.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,500
I'm the one spent
the last two years a mess.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,300
But you, you don't have
a thing to be sorry for.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Except for maybe hooking up
with in the first place.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,600
But I'm here now and if you'll
let me I want to make this work.

71
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,900
Does he have a name?

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,600
I don't know.

73
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,200
Well,
what were you gonna name him?

74
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,600
Owen.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Really?

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,700
Yeah.

77
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,100
Can we just
do one last thing?

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Come on, sweetie.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
Terry, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

80
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
You said
they were nice people.

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,100
Nice people aren't gonna say no.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey Jessie.

83
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
What's this about?

84
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,700
It's Andrew, right?

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,800
Look Andrew, I'm Terry.

86
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,100
I'm the father of...

87
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Look, I know this is a bit weird
but we just wanted to know if we

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,700
Your baby, I mean.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Absolutely not.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
That was never part
of the arrangement.

91
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Andrew?

92
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,100
Who is it?

93
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,200
Let's just go.

94
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,800
It's uh, Jessie.

95
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Hi Jessie?

96
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
It's all right, Andrew.

97
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,500
Is everything okay?

98
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,600
You look so happy.

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,700
That's great.

100
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Yeah.

101
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,300
Thanks to you and your decision.

102
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,500
So what
did you name him?

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,100
Liam.

104
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,700
What's that, jewish?

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,900
Irish.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Nice.

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Yeah.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,500
Listen, it's about time
to wrap it up, okay?

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Okay.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
Can I hold him?

111
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,900
I don't think we're comfortable.

112
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,200
Please,
I'm never going see him again.

113
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,300
I just want to...

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,200
Just once before we go.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Please.

116
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,800
Please.

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Okay.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Okay.

119
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
Just watch his head.

120
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,100
Okay.

121
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,700
Got him?

122
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah.

123
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,100
I think it's time
for owen to come home.

124
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,600
Owen?

125
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,600
Terry,
what're you talking about?

126
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,500
Okay Andrew.

127
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah, yeah,
it's okay.

128
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Okay, you have exactly one minute
to get the hell out of our house.

129
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,700
No, I'm sorry,
but Jessie's changed her mind.

130
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,700
Isn't that right, Jessie?

131
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
No, i...

132
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,300
Jessie. Jessie.

133
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,300
You had your three weeks,
okay, Jessie.

134
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,900
It's the law,
you can look it up.

135
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,200
You're so young,you can have another baby.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,300
We already have a baby.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,300
And we're not leaving
without him.

138
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,400
Yes, you are.

139
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,600
Yes, you are.

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,300
Hey,
once we get a lawyer.

141
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,100
Lawyer?

142
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,900
Wait a minute.

143
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, I am a lawyer, all right.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
What are you going to do?

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,900
What lawyer do you have?

146
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,700
You think you're
so much better than me?

147
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Terry.

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,200
Okay.

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,100
Calm down.

150
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,400
I think I've spent more
time with the baby

151
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
And that makes me more
of a father to him than you are.

152
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,500
You wanna see
the kind of father I am?

153
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,700
Terry, stop it!

154
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,100
We can't...

155
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
get the hell
out of our house, okay?

156
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,000
No,not without our boy.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No, Terry!

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,900
Go get owen!

159
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,000
9-1-1.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,900
Cindy!

161
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,200
Listen,
you're both upset.

162
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,900
I've been there, all right?

163
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,700
You don't know me.

164
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,600
I know what it's like.

165
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,100
I know what's it's like to want a child
more than anything else in the world.

166
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,900
Shut up!

167
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,600
It can make
you do crazy things.

168
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,400
It does, okay?

169
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
You don't know me!

170
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Shut up!

171
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,900
Terry, there's a
two-Way alarm in the nursery,

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,500
The police are going to
hear everything you say.

173
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Shut up!

174
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,200
Jessie?

176
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,300
Okay, we've got a home
invasion in progress.

177
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,500
Unis are on their on way and it sounds
like there's a child on the scene.

178
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,300
Winnie, let's hear the live feed
from the home security.

179
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,500
Patch that through.

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Cindy!

181
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,600
You get
out of my house!

182
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
Is he okay?

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I got their car keys.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh my god!

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,700
Let's get owen.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,700
No, no,we can't do that.

187
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,600
You see this?

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
Why shouldn't this be us?

189
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Andrew?

190
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,400
Andrew?

191
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Help me!

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,800
We just want to make
sure the baby's okay, cindy.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,900
You tell
me my husband's okay.

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,100
What did you do to him?

195
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,800
Cindy, open the door!

196
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,000
Less lethal all around.

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
No tasers, no gas.

198
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,000
Wait for weapons on my go.

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,200
And nothing, repeat, nothing,
till we have a 20 on that baby.

200
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Copy.

201
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Cindy, open the door!

202
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,200
Terry!

203
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,700
Sounds like
it's escalating.

204
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,900
We gotta move fast on scene.

205
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,600
Spike, Lewis, approach on black.

206
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,400
Copy that.

207
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,200
Got it.

208
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Jessie, get out!

209
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,700
You get out!

210
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,600
Cindy,
we're not gonna hurt you, okay?

211
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,300
Donna, wordy,

212
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,900
You've got white.

213
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,500
Shields on everyone.

214
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,400
Where is he?

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,200
Winnie, sounds to me like the
homeowners know who the invaders are.

216
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
Let's see what
the connection is.

217
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,300
Why the care for the child?

218
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Homeowners are
Andrew and cindy greenwood.

219
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,800
Checking for a Terry
and Jessie now.

220
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
The police
can hear everything.

221
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
They're on their way.

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,900
They're coming.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Get away from that!

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
We just lost audio, folks.

225
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,400
No please, please,
don't do this.

226
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,400
Okay, okay,
it's not safe for him.

227
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,700
What,
you think I'm gonna hurt him?

228
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,800
He's my boy.

229
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Give him to me, please.

230
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,200
Okay?

231
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,900
No. No.

232
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,000
No, no.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
Give us our boy now.

234
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,600
Cindy.

235
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
You want
to see Andrew again?

236
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,100
Give us our baby.

237
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,400
Cindy,
give him to me, okay?

238
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,100
See?

239
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
He needed his mommy.

240
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,300
Okay, baby.

241
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

242
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,800
We gotta go, now.

243
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,300
What do we need?

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,800
I...

245
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
I don't know.

246
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,100
What do we need?

247
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,700
What do we need?

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,300
Okay, okay, it's cold.

249
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,600
You have to put him in this.

250
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,900
Oh god.

251
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh god.

252
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,700
Okay.

253
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,100
You need a blanket.

254
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,300
You should take this one,
i just washed it.

255
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,400
And a bottle.

256
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,000
Greenwoods
just went through an adoption.

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
Took official custody
two months ago.

258
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Can't get the name of
the biological mother,

259
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,200
Give me two more minutes.

260
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,800
That's why
the concern, it's hers.

261
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,200
Jessie, Jessie,
look at me Jessie.

262
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,900
Please don't do this.

263
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,000
You can come and see him
whenever you want.

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,200
You can come everyday,
i swear to god.

265
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
We can work something out.

266
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,700
I'm sorry, cindy,

267
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,500
But he needs to be
with his mommy.

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,200
He needs to be with people
who really love him.

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,800
We do.

270
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
We do.

271
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,000
We love him.

272
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,900
Come on, baby.

273
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,700
We gotta go now.

274
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
We got to go right now.

275
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
No!

276
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,300
No, Jessie.

277
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,200
No, please!

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Go, go, go, go, go.

279
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,000
Got the car keys,
let's go.

280
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,100
Team, neighbours just called
in greenwood's minivan.

281
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,800
Silver, light-Gray bmw
just pulled away.

282
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,400
I got them.

283
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Right here in the intersection.

284
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
If they run, we ram them
before they leave the scene.

285
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,600
Copy that.

286
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,600
Terry.

287
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,400
Donna,
possible baby on board.

288
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,700
Stand down.

289
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,400
The baby!

290
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,700
Terry, no!

291
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,100
Team one,
we've got a vehicular pursuit.

292
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,600
Standard formation to start,
but if there's a baby on board,

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,400
It changes everything.

294
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,200
Sabine, you good to go?

295
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm on it.

296
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,200
I'm gpsing the area now.

297
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Okay, if they have the
baby we're limited here.

298
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,600
No road spikes, no collisions,
no shooting out the tires.

299
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,000
Unis at the house
confirm, baby's been taken.

300
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,100
Ed,
how about a rolling roadblock?

301
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,900
Negative.

302
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,700
We've got a school zone
coming up.

303
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
Can you make contact?

304
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,500
Copy.

305
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,900
Winnie, I want to know
who these folks are.

306
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
Okay.

307
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,800
Two names, Jessie wyeth
and Terry, no surname yet.

308
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,700
Wyeth's nineteen,
biological mother.

309
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,700
Gave her baby up two months ago.

310
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,400
Possible
post-Partum depression,

311
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,200
Separation anxiety,
or maybe psychosis.

312
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,100
How about the male?

313
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,500
Nothing yet,
I'm on it.

314
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,100
Okay, does she have parents
of her own we can contact?

315
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,900
Wyeth's mother's listed as
deceased, three years ago.

316
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,200
Overdose.

317
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,800
No father I can find.

318
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,200
This girl is alone,

319
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,900
Except for that guy
and this baby.

320
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm turning onto bayview.

321
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
What's going on?

322
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,700
What do you
think is going on?

323
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,500
They're still coming.

324
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,900
Fine.

325
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Let them come.

326
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Give us a nice police escort
right to the lawyer's office.

327
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
What lawyer, Terry?

328
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,300
Terry, what lawyer?

329
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,000
Krugman.

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,800
We'll go see him.

331
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,200
No!

332
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,100
You still owe him for
the last time, remember?

333
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,300
The robbery thing.

334
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,700
It wasn't robbery,
it was theft under a thousand.

335
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,700
Porter, we can see
if she can help.

336
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,500
No, she said
you couldn't call her anymore.

337
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,200
You know, if we're gonna be a family
you're going to have to have this stuff

338
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm thinking!

339
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't scream.

340
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,200
You're scaring him.

341
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,900
It's the police.

342
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,100
You tell them we're not getting out
of this van until we got a lawyer.

343
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,100
Hello?

344
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,800
Hi, my name is sergeant Gregory parker.

345
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
I'm with the police
strategic response unit.

346
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,700
Am I speaking with Jessie wyeth?

347
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,200
Yes.

348
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,100
I'm so sorry,
you'll have to speak up here.

349
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Oh, it sounds like you've got
your hands full over there.

350
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,500
That's a hungry cry.

351
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,700
How do you know?

352
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,300
Oh,
I'll never forget that sound.

353
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,800
Your baby wants a bottle.

354
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
What's your baby's name?

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
His name's owen.

356
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
So,
what do you say Jessie,

357
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,400
We all stop,
get owen some formula?

358
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Maybe you can tell us
your side of things?

359
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,800
No,we have the formula
in the diaper bag.

360
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,500
But Terry says we can't
stop until we have a lawyer.

361
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,800
Okay,
i can work on that,

362
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,800
But it'll be a lot easier for me to do
if we aren't speeding down the highway.

363
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,500
It'd be safer too for owen.

364
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,300
Terry,
i think we should stop.

365
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,600
What's
he saying to you?

366
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,300
Whatever he's saying,
you know he's lying.

367
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,200
No, he's just saying we should
stop and be safe for owen.

368
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,900
Yeah.

369
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,100
And then we stop
and they get him.

370
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,000
Where do you think he's going?

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,400
You wanna call tami
and ask her right now?

372
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,200
No.

373
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
He's not going to tamI's.

374
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,100
Yeah, 'cuz I'm not
going to let that happen!

375
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Now hang up the phone!

376
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,600
Hang up the phone!

377
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,500
Okay, I'm sorry.

378
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,300
Jessie,
don't hang up.

379
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,700
Please,
we need a lawyer.

380
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
Shh, it's okay.

381
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
All right,
let's go to plan b.

382
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Lewis, be ready
with that gps launcher?

383
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,500
Yes sir.

384
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Spike, get into position.

385
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,800
Aim for the rear bumper.

386
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Copy that.

387
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,400
We can make this work,
Lou, we can back off.

388
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,700
Donna, we're the distraction
on my go.

389
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,400
Go now.

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,900
What are they doing?

391
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
Jessie, I think we're done.

392
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,200
Terry, look!

393
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
They're going to shoot!

394
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,200
They're going to kill us!

395
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,400
Cover's blown.

396
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,500
Lewis, you got no time.

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
Take the shot, Lou.

398
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
Hold on to owen!

399
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,300
Hold on!

400
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,900
What are they doing?

401
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,000
We have a baby!

402
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,600
Got it.

403
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
It's holding, boss.

404
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,600
All good.

405
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,400
Good.

406
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Signal's up.

407
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,800
We got him tagged with a gps,
let's see where he's going.

408
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,500
Spike,
I'm going to fall back.

409
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,400
Copy that.

410
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm going
to pull back,

411
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,700
Let them slow down
and keep that baby safe.

412
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,800
Copy that.

413
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,100
Copy.

414
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,900
Falling back.

415
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,300
Jess, it's okay,
we lost them.

416
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,700
I think
we need to stop this.

417
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
All I want
is what everybody wants.

418
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,700
I know, I want it too,
but I mean...

419
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,400
all that time I was away all i
could think of was you, us and him,

420
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,700
:Jessie: where were you, Terry?

421
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
What did you do?

422
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Boss, the girl listed a Terry
dornan as next of kin on her

423
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,400
That's great, winnie.

424
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,200
Go ahead.

425
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,700
If this is him
he's got a record

426
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,300
And a long history of violence.

427
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,200
Listen to this, two months ago
he almost killed a guy.

428
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,900
Terry sebastian
dornan, 20 years old.

429
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,200
Last few months
he was in jail for assault.

430
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,300
On the 15th of june police were called
to 1678 ossington where mr. Dornan and

431
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,300
Kurt lawford,
shared an apartment.

432
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,800
Upon arrival police noted blood
on the walls, floor, and ceiling.

433
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,600
Jess,
i can do this for you and him,

434
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,200
But I just want to do
one more thing.

435
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,700
I really think
we should stop now, Terry.

436
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,200
Please, just one more thing then we'll
go downtown and we'll turn ourselves in.

437
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,400
Okay,
one more thing.

438
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,100
Boss, we lost them.

439
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,600
Yeah.

440
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,700
I see them,
taking the off-Ramp.

441
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,900
Okay team, let's take the
next exit and look back.

442
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,600
I just want to do
one thing as a family, jess.

443
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,900
It'll be great, you'll see.

444
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,200
Okay?

445
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,500
Team,
any eyes on the subject?

446
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,400
Negative.

447
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
Winnie,
you still trying that number?

448
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,000
No answer
the last four times.

449
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,300
Okay, keep trying.

450
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,700
Anything else on dornan?

451
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,400
Background, family, anything?

452
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,100
Both parents are dead.

453
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,100
Though they didn't die together, mother
died, looks like some sort of car accident.

454
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,400
He was four.

455
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,100
Father, I'm just getting a date,
almost a year later.

456
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,600
After that I'm getting
multiple addresses for dornan.

457
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Over ten, till he was 18.

458
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,800
Yeah, those aren't relatives,
those are foster homes.

459
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,500
Keep looking, guys.

460
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,700
Terry,
what are we doing?

461
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,100
Terry!

462
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,600
Terry, we can't go in there.

463
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Just trust me,
it's gonna be great.

464
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,700
He's going to love it.

465
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Look, we're okay.

466
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,700
Boss, I got her.

467
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,500
Here she is!

468
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,100
Jessie,
hey it's Greg parker again.

469
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,900
I'm really glad to hear
that you're okay.

470
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,500
So where are you?

471
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,600
We're in...

472
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
We're safe, okay?

473
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
And we're gonna turn ourselves in,
we just need to do this one thing.

474
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
Owen's
still hungry, huh?

475
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,800
How are you coming
with that formula?

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,200
I don't know
how to make it.

477
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,300
I should know this!

478
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,600
What am I doing?

479
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Jessie, you know who's
born knowing this stuff?

480
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Nobody.

481
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,200
Having a baby, that's one thing,

482
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,800
But taking care of him honey,
that's something else.

483
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,500
You can't do it on the run.

484
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,900
Oh yeah,
well, if I was a real mother,

485
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,900
You know, I would have learnt, i
wouldn't have just given him up.

486
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,800
Or you knew
what your baby would need

487
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,400
And made sure he got it
like a real mother would.

488
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,400
So Jessie, why don't
you tell me where you are.

489
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,000
We're at
the northern dreampark, okay?

490
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
We're almost done and then
we're coming in downtown.

491
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,700
Okay Jessie,
just stay on the line.

492
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,600
I gotta go.

493
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
Eddie,
northern dreampark.

494
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,100
Copy that.

495
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,400
Let's
step on it, folks.

496
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
Ready?

497
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,900
Terry,
can we go now?

498
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,600
Yeah.

499
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,700
What's this?

500
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,600
It's just
one last thing.

501
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,800
I know exactly where it is,
he's gonna love it.

502
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Terry, come on.

503
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,800
Please.

504
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,700
Let's just go.

505
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Please.

506
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Please.

507
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Terry...

508
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,300
come on.

509
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,600
I can't wait for you to
see this and owen too.

510
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,600
Winnie,
Jessie mentioned a tami,

511
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,500
Some connection to dornan
find out what it is.

512
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,500
I'm on it.

513
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,100
What do you think?

514
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,800
Well?

515
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,100
Yeah, it's pretty.

516
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Come on, come on.

517
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,200
All right,
I'm sierra one.

518
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,500
Spike and Lewis, alpha team,
west side of the park.

519
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,300
Wordy and donna, east side
of the park, bravo team.

520
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,200
Weapons?

521
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Dornan may not be armed,
but he's violent and unstable.

522
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
So tasers, if we can.

523
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
What about long-Range?

524
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Rubber bullets.

525
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,000
That baby is the priority.

526
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,700
If he gives us no choice,
we do what we got to do.

527
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,300
Clear?

528
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,800
Clear.

529
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,600
I don't think...

530
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
guys, get going.

531
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,900
Donna, you got a problem?

532
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,100
No, I'm good.

533
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,100
You sure?

534
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,900
Yeah.

535
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,100
Let's go!

536
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,100
You all right?

537
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,500
Yep.

538
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:49,800
You good?

539
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,200
Yeah.

540
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Here,
give him to me.

541
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Please.

542
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,200
You sure?

543
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,900
Okay.

544
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,200
Terry, watch his head,
watch his head.

545
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
I got it, I got it.

546
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,400
Okay team,
keep me posted.

547
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Nothing yet, boss.

548
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,000
No joy here either.

549
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,900
Right down here?

550
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,700
Yup.

551
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:40,600
You know, when your daddy was
almost 4 his mommy and his daddy

552
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,300
And your daddy, well, he thought
the whole world lived in this park.

553
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:55,000
And at the centre of this world was the
most beautiful thing he had ever seen.

554
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Horses and families,
everybody together.

555
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,500
Eddie,
I'm about to talk to this tami.

556
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,600
See what more we can get
on our subject here.

557
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,500
If you see him,
let me know right away.

558
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Copy that.

559
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,400
No, I spent more time in
court with him than all

560
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
What did he do now?

561
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,500
How long
did he live with you?

562
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,500
Two years.

563
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,100
Time he was sixteen
to the time he walked out.

564
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,300
Can't say I was sorry.

565
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Quite a handful, huh?

566
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,000
No,
a handful's what I'm used to.

567
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,200
You ever spend the night with a baby's
not getting his crack from mommy's milk?

568
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,800
That I'm used to.

569
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,000
When Terry came everybody said,
look, this is a really hard one.

570
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,700
I said, yeah, hard or not,

571
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,600
Every kid wants love
and that I got to give.

572
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,600
Okay.

573
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
So what made him different?

574
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,000
Look,
no kid likes a foster home.

575
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,400
Every kid wants to believe
that some day mommy and daddy

576
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,600
Are going to come back and
everything's going to be better.

577
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,600
Well, Terry never even had that,

578
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,500
His mother dead from that
accident, and then his father,

579
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,000
I don't know, maybe you just
never get over something like that.

580
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,700
What happened
to his father?

581
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh, and this one.

582
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,000
This one.

583
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,200
This was my favorite,
he'd never forget it.

584
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,900
And my daddy.

585
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,600
Hey, you know what his name was?

586
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,200
It was owen.

587
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,100
Just like you, buddy.

588
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,300
There's
nothing in quadrant e2.

589
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,600
No dice in w4.

590
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,200
I need a better
vantage point.

591
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,500
Thank you.

592
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,400
Sierra 1 in position.

593
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,900
No sign.

594
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,400
Hold on, hold on.

595
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
At the carousel.

596
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,000
Bravo team,
that's closest to you.

597
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,600
There it is.

598
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Okay.

599
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Wordy, donna,
stealth approach.

600
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,000
Alpha team, what's your 20?

601
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Alpha team's on
the move and we're far.

602
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,100
I didn't cry.

603
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,500
Well, you were 4,
Terry he's just a baby.

604
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,500
Give him to me.

605
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
I thought we were
gonna go downtown together.

606
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,300
Yeah, we will.

607
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,900
Then what
are they doing here?

608
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,900
Terry, I'm sorry.

609
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,800
When I go to jail you'll probably
never see me again, right?

610
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,900
You'll just give me up.

611
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,700
We were supposed to be together.

612
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,100
Supposed to?

613
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,200
Terry, we did all
of this together.

614
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,200
He's escalating,
he's got the baby.

615
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,500
You know, maybe it doesn't
matter how much we want it.

616
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,400
We have to think about
what he needs, okay?

617
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,100
Give him to me.

618
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,200
No!

619
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,600
No?

620
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,100
It's too late.

621
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,500
Terry!

622
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,600
Give him to me.

623
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,500
No!

624
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Terry!

625
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,600
He's seen us.

626
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,900
Cover's blown,
we're in pursuit.

627
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,300
Wordy, on the girl.

628
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,100
Donna, follow the male.

629
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,800
Spike and Lou,
get to the carousel.

630
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,800
I got him.

631
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,600
You got him?

632
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,700
Splitting up.

633
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,300
Terry!

634
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,900
Stay right there.

635
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,700
Stay right there!

636
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,300
I gotta go,
i gotta go.

637
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,800
I know, I know, I know.

638
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,100
I can't
let him go alone.

639
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,600
I need you
to calm down.

640
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,500
Listen, I know.

641
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,600
Wordy, hold on,
i got him.

642
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Donna, wait on my go.

643
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Boss, he's heading for the
stairs and he's got the baby.

644
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Eddie, stop him.

645
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,000
He's too far to tase.

646
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,900
Then go lethal.

647
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,000
Rubber bullets?

648
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
They might not do it,

649
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,700
Ed, if he makes it up there
that baby could die.

650
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,000
Copy that.

651
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,800
I don't have a clear shot.

652
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,500
Sabine, do you have
the solution?

653
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,900
Sabine, you have scorpio,
take the shot.

654
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,400
Negative.

655
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
No solution.

656
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,300
The baby's in jeopardy.

657
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,900
He's going up the coaster, but he
can't go any place once he's at the top.

658
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,600
Yes, he can.

659
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,500
He can go the way his
father went, he can jump.

660
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Donna, wordy, wait on my lead.

661
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,800
Copy.

662
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,600
Copy.

663
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,700
Hey Terry,
wait up, buddy.

664
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,800
It's me, Greg parker.

665
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,700
I want to help you.

666
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,600
I have
to get up there!

667
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,900
I have to get up there!

668
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,500
Listen, there's nothing
you can do up there but put

669
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,900
He has my baby!

670
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,700
Terry,
hey it's me, Greg.

671
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,300
Come on.

672
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Hold up a second.

673
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,600
Hey, I just want
to talk to you.

674
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,700
It's okay.

675
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,500
It's all right.

676
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,900
You get
her out of here.

677
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,200
I made her do this,
she shouldn't have to see this!

678
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,900
What this?

679
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,700
What do you mean?

680
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,300
Hey, can I talk to you for a second,
just man to man, what do you say?

681
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,300
Know what I see?

682
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,200
I see a guy who's trying
to do the right thing

683
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
But suddenly finds himself
in the wrong place.

684
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,800
Is that close?

685
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,400
I bet you don't even
want to be up here.

686
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,500
In fact, I bet you can't
imagine why you're even up here.

687
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,200
What,
do you think I'm stupid?

688
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,400
No.

689
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,200
I think you got feelings.

690
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,700
I think you got big,
gigantic feelings,

691
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,900
The kind that just come out of your
stomach and make you feel like what do you

692
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,900
And you've never had anybody in your
life to teach you about those feelings,

693
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,000
To help you with those feelings.

694
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,900
And that's not fair.

695
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,500
Oh, I had lots of
people, loads of families.

696
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,500
Different one every year.

697
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Sure.

698
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,500
They've never been
your real family, right?

699
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,500
What's going on?

700
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,000
It's under control.

701
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
My ma died
when I was just 4.

702
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,800
I know.

703
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah?

704
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,900
You know what happened
to my old man?

705
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,500
You know that too?

706
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,200
Yeah, yeah, I do.

707
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,900
That's why I want to help you.

708
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,700
Five years old.

709
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,500
My ma's dead not a year.

710
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
And we go up to the top
of our building.

711
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Hey,
just stay with me, buddy.

712
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,700
Just stay with me.

713
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,400
And I remember
he puts me down by the door

714
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,400
And he gives me
a piece of paper.

715
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,100
I can't read.

716
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,700
I don't know what's on it.

717
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And I'm just standing there, looking
up at my dad as he walks to the edge.

718
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,200
Terry,
you're not your father.

719
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
You're your own person.

720
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,200
So what's
wrong with me?

721
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,000
Nothing.

722
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,900
What is wrong with me?

723
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,900
Nothing.

724
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,800
Nothing's wrong.

725
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,600
Still have the solution, but no way to take
him out without the baby going over too.

726
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,800
Copy that.

727
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,200
All I want
is what everybody gets.

728
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
What do you want?
You tell me.

729
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,100
I want my family.

730
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,400
I want to come home and they're
there every day, no matter what.

731
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,700
I want my little boy
to look at me and say,

732
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,700
Daddy, don't leave.

733
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,300
And I say, I would never.

734
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,600
You've got it.

735
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,300
You've got it.

736
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,100
You've already got it.

737
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,500
You've got Jessie.

738
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,900
She loves you.

739
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,800
She wants you to
come back down safe.

740
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,700
You and owen.

741
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,700
Oh my god,
he's bleeding.

742
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,500
No, no, no, Terry,
it's okay.

743
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,300
It's just your hand.

744
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,600
It's okay. It's okay.

745
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,300
Look at what I'll do
every time, won't i?

746
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,600
No, no,
it doesn't have to go that way.

747
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,900
It doesn't have to go that way.

748
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,600
It's going to be okay.

749
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,500
No.

750
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,800
You were the one who told
Jessie he was hungry.

751
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,600
That's right.

752
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,900
Probably still is hungry.

753
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,600
Why don't we go feed him
together, come on.

754
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,300
Go feed him together, okay?

755
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,300
Come on.

756
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,100
Come on, that's it.

757
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,600
That's it.

758
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,100
Okay.

759
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
Thank you.

760
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,000
Team, be ready.

761
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,900
Take care
of him for me.

762
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,600
You bet.

763
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,500
Here we go, here we go.

764
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,400
That's it, I got him.

765
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

766
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,700
You're
not going anywhere.

767
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,100
You're not going anywhere.

768
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,900
Don't go.

769
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,400
Don't go, Terry, don't go.

770
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,100
Don't go, my man.

771
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,700
Terry!

772
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,300
Terry!

773
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,300
No, no!

774
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,600
Jessie!

775
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,700
No, no, Terry.

776
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,300
I'm sorry.

777
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,100
Terry!

778
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,100
We'll debrief later,all right?

779
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,900
All right.

780
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Okay.

781
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Jessie, there's a police officer over
there, he's ready to take a statement.

782
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,000
Did he say
anything before he...

783
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,200
yeah, he said to take
care of him for me.

784
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,600
His dad wrote that,
in a note.

785
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,500
I have to
take owen now, Jessie.

786
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,600
His name's liam.

787
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm sorry.

788
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,400
The subject's family
history made suicide likely

789
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,500
And the danger to the infant
was extreme.

790
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,000
I gave the order
to take the shot.

791
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,300
Constable sabine was unable to do so and the
subject made it to the structure and ascended.

792
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,400
Donna, you have anything to add?
At this point constables sabine

793
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,500
And wordsworth pursued
the subject.

794
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,100
Hey, tomorrow we're
going to do this debrief again.

795
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,800
And you're telling the boss
what really happened.

796
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,800
Because, donna, the only thing's
that more dangerous than a cop

797
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Who shoots too fast, is a cop
who can't shoot when they need to.

798
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,700
Now you had the shot,
and I saw it.

799
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,500
You saw it?

800
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,700
Where were you then?

801
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Because where I was there I pointing a gun
at a scared kid with a baby in his hands.

802
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,300
We got an order.

803
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,100
You
questioned the order.

804
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,900
Yeah, I did,

805
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,300
But the boss had information
we didn't have.

806
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,600
I asked a question
and then I did my job

807
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,300
Like any member of
this team is supposed to.

808
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,000
All right?

809
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,900
Are you a member of this team?

810
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
Yes.

811
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,500
That's good.

812
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,600
Does this job
get any easier?

813
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,700
No.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
