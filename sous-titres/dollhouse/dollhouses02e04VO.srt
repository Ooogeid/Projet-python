1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,610
I was just trying to help her.

2
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:12,828
I was just trying to help her.

3
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:18,380
- Thanks for covering, Priya.
- I sold a necklace for you.

4
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:21,182
A talkative young man
bought one for his fiancée.

5
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:22,357
No kidding.

6
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:25,405
I should have you sell my junk
for me all day.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,193
Your jewelry sells itself.

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,761
Well, the Aussie princess
can't hurt.

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,897
Do they have royalty in Australia?

10
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,496
We have a queen, yes, but it's the same
one they have in England. Fickle bitch.

11
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:42,470
Speaking of princes... he's back.

12
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:45,419
- Not my type
- Why not?

13
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,137
You're certainly his.

14
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:52,487
So, what are you doing
with all these pieces anyway?

15
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:56,055
- Not using them for firewood, I hope.
- I'm a collector, and

16
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:58,516
you're the real deal.
You shouldn't be

17
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:01,852
selling on Venice Beach
with all this novelty crap.

18
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,215
Well, I need cash, and...

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,090
I don't have a work visa.

20
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,735
So...

21
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,926
Would you ever be interested in...

22
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,184
making something for me?
Something very large?

23
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,659
Like an elephant?

24
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,831
Like a painting,
a big painting that would

25
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:23,999
cost a lot more money.

26
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:26,107
You're loaded, too.

27
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,506
I'm overpaid.

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,706
Well, did you have something
specific you would want?

29
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,136
Yes. You.

30
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,598
To...

31
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:42,476
do your thing. You know, maybe I
could even arrange a show.

32
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:44,603
All right, so...

33
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,033
here.

34
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:47,258
Let me know.

35
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:52,277
See, you hit the jackpot, girl.

36
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:56,286
And Nolan commissioned this?

37
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:58,922
Because I don't think
I have reason to live

38
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:01,454
if I can't have one of
your paintings for myself.

39
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:04,491
You must have a really boring life.

40
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:06,834
You're funny.

41
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:09,295
She's funny, too, Anton.

42
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:30,189
There she is...
the woman of the hour.

43
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:32,756
Man, Nolan wasn't kidding.

44
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:33,931
About what?

45
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,046
Well, he said the art

46
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:38,818
was nalmost
as beautiful as the artist.

47
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:41,632
Yeah, Nolan likes
to say things like that.

48
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:43,844
I'm not as good
as these people tell me.

49
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,040
How good you are is
history's business.

50
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,460
You're doing what you love and
these folks want to pay you for it.

51
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,741
These aren't really
my kind of folks.

52
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,516
I plan to be moving on.

53
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:56,370
Well, a few showings like this
and you can move on...

54
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,427
and on, anywhere you want.

55
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,150
You should stick with Nolan.

56
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,485
He finds an artist, they thrive.

57
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,260
This is an elaborate,
expensive seduction,

58
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,385
I mean...

59
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:10,232
it's the least Rossum can do
after all of your work with us, but...

60
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,567
couldn't you just buy her
a necklace or a boat or something?

61
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:16,817
I tried all that,
but she's an artist.

62
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,619
A free spirit, Harding.
She can't be bought.

63
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:20,991
But she can be lured.

64
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:23,492
We'll see.

65
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,667
Why don't you let us build the woman
you want... the perfect woman?

66
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,442
- We have all types available.
- I don't want a Doll, Harding.

67
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:34,124
I want her.

68
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:37,787
- He's crazy about your work.
- It's not all about the work.

69
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:40,636
No, sweetie, it's about the power.

70
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,367
There's a ton of money in this room

71
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:45,108
but that's not power.

72
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,142
Nolan's a medical genius,

73
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,910
short-listed for the Nobel.
That's power.

74
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:51,355
Art is power

75
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,440
because they can't make it.

76
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,225
So what if you make Nolan
all cute and nervous?

77
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,200
Why not ride that a little?

78
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,157
Let them think they have the power.

79
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,173
Our time will come.

80
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,870
Sorry, darling.
Luca is chomping at the bit.

81
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:10,416
This is Luca Pallidio, the finest
art dealer in all of Italy.

82
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,184
Not true.
Buona sera.

83
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:14,423
Hello.

84
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:18,073
I love the piece.
It's very organic... effortless.

85
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:20,629
You mind if I ask you
many boring questions?

86
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:21,804
Not at all.

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
Always a pleasure.

88
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,168
Most people who are as rich and
good-looking as Nolan

89
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,062
don't have good taste. But your work

90
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,190
reminds me of Bernard Patin.

91
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:35,919
Is he an influence?

92
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:39,629
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know who that is.

93
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:40,854
Is that bad?

94
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:42,915
Well, no, it's natural.

95
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,572
People kill for that...
to be unaffected.

96
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,921
Unlike everyone here.

97
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,557
So why the bird motif?

98
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:54,970
I don't know.

99
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:58,316
I just think they're beautiful.
That's it.

100
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:01,143
Perhaps it is a
reflection of you, no?

101
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,554
Free, always moving, searching
for something... better?

102
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:07,731
I don't need better.

103
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,852
You move because...
because there is wind.

104
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,254
Do you want to get out of here?

105
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:18,479
I'd love to.

106
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,737
We can talk some more about Nolan.

107
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,222
- Sneaking out?
- I was just looking for you

108
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:30,609
- to say good-bye.
- Why are you so eager to leave?

109
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,587
Everyone is here to adore you.

110
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:35,379
- Enjoy the painting.
- Come on, come on.

111
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:38,323
- Stay a little longer.
- The painting is yours.

112
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:40,631
My job here is done. I'm going now.

113
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,799
Why?

114
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,930
So you can give it up to some guy
you just met? He's not even real.

115
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:51,731
- What?
- Would you like a treatment?

116
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:54,444
- You were supposed to help me.
- You don't need my help.

117
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,420
You're like the bull... strong,
yet with the horns, fierce.

118
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:59,833
- Wait...
- After my treatment, I find you.

119
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,735
- Ciao, ciao.
- Good-bye.

120
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,739
I've pulled out all the stops.
I mean, this is our big night.

121
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,534
- We've planned for this.
- This isn't our night. There's no we.

122
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:12,015
I've offered you everything.

123
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,039
What else do you want?

124
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,250
I want to walk out the damn door.

125
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:28,576
What did you expect, huh?

126
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,553
Day after day, just dangling it
in front of my face, seducing me.

127
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:34,643
Seducing? You're crazy.
It's all in your head.

128
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,195
Get off me!

129
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:39,498
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna
take no for an answer.

130
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:41,859
- All right, I'll do anything.
- Stop it!

131
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,877
You disgust me.

132
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,200
Nothing in this world could
ever make me love you.

133
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:55,599
Present Day

134
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,904
When can I see you again?

135
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:05,732
I don't know.

136
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:08,346
Soon.

137
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:13,795
Wait, wait.

138
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,613
To remember you.

139
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,073
I love you.

Thank you.

152
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,987
I don't like this color, though.

153
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:30,839
Why do you use it?

154
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,601
It's always here.

155
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:49,865
It should work.

156
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,222
Well, it doesn't work.
It works in theory.

157
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:54,804
Alpha got it to work,
through a phone nonetheless.

158
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,592
Are you comparing
my intelligence to Alpha's?

159
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:00,205
You're talking
to yourself like he does.

160
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,395
That's a...

161
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,619
very good point.

162
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:07,301
- What's good?
- Mother ship!

163
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:09,399
You got to stop doing that

164
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:11,580
or I'll make you wear a bell.

165
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,511
You shouldn't have.

166
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,138
Sierra made it.

167
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,511
That's very thoughtful of you
but I don't think

168
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,977
there's room on my fridge.

169
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,069
You're like a ninja.

170
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,333
Sierra hates the bad man.

171
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:37,577
Who's the bad man?

172
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,197
It's not like the others.

173
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,713
He makes her sad over and over.

174
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,213
Well, it's a...

175
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:48,291
fairly primitive rendition.

176
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:53,258
I'm not sure if this is a man,
let alone which one.

177
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,397
You're not looking hard enough.

178
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:00,880
You never do.

179
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:06,925
What's the word
on this repeat client

180
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,778
Sierra has been seeing?

181
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,236
- Why?
- Something's bothering me about it.

182
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:14,571
I have a hunch something's wrong.

183
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,368
That's funny...
that I have a hunch?

184
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,127
That it's bothering you.

185
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,159
Nolan Kennard.

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,543
Big-time Rossum VIP, MD, PhD

187
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,506
in molecular pharmacology.
Wrote his dissertation on neuroleptics.

188
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,138
Works a lot with sick kids.
You want me to make this profil

189
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:38,186
- available to you on the system?
- What about the engagements?

190
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,911
You design them. Tame.

191
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,857
Your typical romance
or seduction scenarios.

192
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:46,319
Sierra's stress levels
never go higher than a 1.3.

193
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,730
Always comes back
with a clean bill of health.

194
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:51,900
I helped Sierra, you know.

195
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,072
She was a paranoid schizophrenic
when she came here...

196
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,340
psychotic...

197
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,521
I helped her.

198
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,603
I didn't ask.

199
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:07,833
Is that where your hunch came from?

200
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:11,114
It's Sierra's.

201
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:12,839
Echo brought it to me.

202
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,880
She was going on about a bad man.

203
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:19,553
He's the blotch here,
is what I'm getting.

204
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:22,881
- Echo brought it you.
- She's always been

205
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:24,706
Mother Hen about Sierra.

206
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,122
- Should look into that.
- I am!

207
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,112
And so far, Echo's given
me way more than you have.

208
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,834
I need a connection,

209
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,361
a pattern.

210
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,486
Saunders.

211
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,611
Saunders?

212
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,387
She's gone, Boyd.

213
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:42,543
- You got to stop mooning.
- Saunders didn't work engagements.

214
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,162
She looked after the Actives here.
She would have seen.

215
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,371
Seen what?

216
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:47,786
A pattern.

217
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,045
"Dark shape always present.

218
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,089
Must be something from her past?"
Question mark.

219
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:58,103
"I can only conclude that

220
00:11:58,228 --> 00:12:00,551
if the dark shapes
don't symbolize Sierra's

221
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,454
state of mind before intake,

222
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,563
they must represent an extreme
sense of anxiety and rage

223
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,718
associated with..."

224
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:13,690
I'm not the bad man.

225
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:20,104
Sierra doesn't like this color.

226
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:24,254
You should take them all.

227
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:30,707
Is this wrong?

228
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,876
It's good.

229
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,254
You're taking charge.

230
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,800
You're taking matters
into your own hands.

231
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,793
They're in my shirt.

232
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,856
What are you up to, girl?

233
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,750
Echo was right.
I wasn't looking hard enough.

234
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,852
- What?
- Neuroleptics. He's an expert.

235
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:55,029
You mean Kennard.

236
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:57,087
Neuroleptics are
antipsychotics, right?

237
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,944
Like haloperidol or
good-old chlorpromazine.

238
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,316
Most of them block D2 receptors
in the dopamine pathways of the brain.

239
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,841
- I'll take your word for it.
- Look.

240
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,139
This is a brain.

241
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,833
Normal, boring brain,
like your brain.

242
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,269
This... is a brain on drugs.

243
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:17,554
Or more specifically,
antipsychotic medication.

244
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,499
You see the inhibited
mesolimbic pathway?

245
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:23,392
The partially blocked
serotonin receptors?

246
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,115
And this is Priya's original scan.
It's similar, right?

247
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,318
But why the Five-HT
efflux in the striatum?

248
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:32,093
And looking closer...

249
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:34,835
increased conduction
of chloride ions.

250
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:37,793
- They're at odds.
- You lost me at brain.

251
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,523
Priya wasn't psychotic
despite her heavy medication.

252
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,422
She was psychotic because of it.

253
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:44,758
And...
that's not all.

254
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,163
When Saunders conducted that wish
fulfillment exercise a few months back,

255
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,774
you said that Sierra went to
the mental health clinic

256
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,815
to confront the doctor
who diagnosed her?

257
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,463
- Dr. Makido.
- Wrong.

258
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,740
Sierra went to confront Nolan.

259
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:00,941
Nolan Kennard owns that clinic.

260
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:03,537
He owns the whole complex...

261
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,695
and he has a penthouse office there.

262
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:07,781
Sierra went to see him.

263
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,309
How did this get by DeWitt?

264
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:11,994
We got to tell her.

265
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,119
She's gonna flip her biscuits.

266
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Unless...

267
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,791
You don't think she already knows?

268
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,043
She does now.

269
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,450
Thank you so much
for coming in, Dr. Kennard.

270
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:27,229
I'd been meaning to schedule
another appointment anyway.

271
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:30,637
It seems the moment you take
her away, I'm ready to have her back.

272
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:32,092
No doubt.

273
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,351
And no doubt that's why
you've asked me here to

274
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,979
caution me yet again about your policy
on repeat engagements, right?

275
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:40,509
In a way.

276
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,650
You know I'm not interested
in any of your other Actives?

277
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,532
That's a non-issue.
I would no sooner allow you

278
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:49,573
near one of our other Actives
than I would a mad dog near a child.

279
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:53,785
- I beg your pardon?
- Given that you're a raping

280
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,038
scumbag one tick shy of a murderer.
I can't recall. Do you take sugar?

281
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:00,706
All right.

282
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,839
What the hell's going on here?

283
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:08,812
There's nothing going on.

284
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,519
In fact, it's finished.

285
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,931
We will no longer be
providing you with our services.

286
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,327
You have made me an accomplice
in something vile, Dr. Kennard.

287
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,945
And it ends now.

288
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,105
Does it?

289
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,365
Yes, it does.

290
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,586
What are you gonna do, Adelle?
Go to the police?

291
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:28,092
Not really in a position
to do that, are you?

292
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:31,132
I am, however, in a position
to see to it that you never lay a hand

293
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:34,294
on that woman ever again and
that is exactly what I intend to do.

294
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:37,120
You know what?
I think you're right about this

295
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:40,999
repeat engagement thing.
It's not a good idea, so let's...

296
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:44,111
stop dancing around your policy,
all right?

297
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:48,141
You're going to imprint her,
and you're going to send her to me.

298
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,756
- Forever.
- Excuse me?

299
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,774
You do it by the end of business today,
I'll see to it you keep your job.

300
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:00,262
Thanks for the tea.

301
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,188
I can't believe what
you're asking me to do!

302
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:23,102
The girl was a basket case.
Hearing voices, drooling in her soup.

303
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:25,919
- You saw yourself.
- Because he made her that way.

304
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,410
We're being asked to place
this young woman into a life

305
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:31,302
of wealth and privilege,
married to a man she adores.

306
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,885
Do you really want to go
to Rossum with this?

307
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:36,304
And accuse one
of their most valued assets

308
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,236
of being a kidnapper and rapist?

309
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:39,811
That is what he is.

310
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,027
And if we do this,

311
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:44,102
what does it make us?

312
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,866
What are we already?

313
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:49,901
We are not slave merchants.

314
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,170
Mr. Harding, I won't do this.

315
00:17:53,091 --> 00:17:55,241
However she got here, she's here.

316
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:57,992
In my house,
and therefore, in my care.

317
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,286
Yes, you would never
let anyone take advantage

318
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,621
of any of your charges, would you,

319
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,403
Miss Lonely Hearts?

320
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,466
Whatever indiscretions
I may be guilty of...

321
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,591
Forget Victor.
We don't care.

322
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,250
Everyone likes to take
a little something

323
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,206
home from the office
once in a while.

324
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,363
But he's the least of
your indiscretions.

325
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,015
I think we both know that.

326
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:23,262
If feeling that you're
somehow decent and moral

327
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:26,104
helps you get through your day,
that's your business.

328
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,680
This house, however,
is our business.

329
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:31,520
And you will run it
the way we tell you to,

330
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,695
or we'll find someone who will.

331
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:35,381
And I promise...

332
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:38,256
you wouldn't like
the early retirement plan.

333
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:42,078
Imprint the girl, send her
to him, close the account.

334
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,393
What are you doing?

335
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,516
Now you don't have
to use this color anymore.

336
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:32,670
You look like an Indian chief.

337
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:36,674
I am an Indian chief.

338
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,586
Hurry, Sergeant, orders!

339
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,183
What do we do?!

340
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:49,229
I don't want to take charge.

341
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:55,272
- I don't want to take charge.
- Come here.

342
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,426
You can't let them do this.

343
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:02,801
They're not going to do it. We are.

344
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,745
And when I say we don't have
a choice, know that I mean it.

345
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:08,813
Aren't we supposed
to care for these people?

346
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,877
- Dr. Saunders would never have...
- Which Saunders would that be?

347
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:16,496
The avuncular physician
so brutally cut down

348
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:19,065
not five feet
from where you were standing?

349
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,011
Or the last woman to whom
you gave a permanent imprint?

350
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,751
The other wounded flower you
restored by offering her a new life?

351
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,719
Who apparently found you
so unbearable

352
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,769
she had to flee the city.
Is it that one?

353
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,303
How can you expect me to do this?

354
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,786
You'll do it because you must.

355
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:49,843
The cold reality

356
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,000
is that everyone here was chosen

357
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,587
because their morals have been
compromised in some way.

358
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,841
Everyone...

359
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,633
except you.

360
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:05,574
You, Topher, were chosen

361
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,391
because you have no morals.

362
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,770
You have always thought
of people as playthings.

363
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:15,963
This is not a judgment.

364
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:19,301
You always take very good care
of your toys.

365
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:22,780
But you're simply going
to have to let this one go.

366
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,958
It's time for your treatment.

367
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,302
All right.

368
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:48,755
- Would you like to come with me?
- I'd like to, yes.

369
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,792
Victor can't come with you.

370
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:58,158
Why not?

371
00:21:58,326 --> 00:22:00,276
He just can't, okay?

372
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,040
Okay, I'm sorry.

373
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,406
I'll wait for you right here.

374
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:29,122
So she can remember.

375
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:32,804
<i>This is Boyd.</i>

376
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,729
Topher is having problems
following commands.

377
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:39,649
Please make sure
he follows this one.

378
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,401
<i>So I don't have to resort
to drastic measures.</i>

379
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:43,759
What's the order?

380
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:46,684
<i>The order is to keep
the Dolls in that place.</i>

381
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:56,664
Topher, have you completed your
report on Sierra's last engagement?

382
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:58,989
You mean her last engagement ever?

383
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,462
How about a verbal report?
Hearn's an idiot.

384
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:06,814
Thanks for the treatment, Shaggy.

385
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:09,929
No problem,
"I can't remember your name today."

386
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:14,616
I would like to report
Hearn called me a nerd.

387
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:16,469
Is he a fourth grader?

388
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,326
We may have found our
replacement Sierra.

389
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:20,857
22-year-old female.

390
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,942
I think you might be
interested in this one.

391
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:25,161
Let me guess, a little bit hot?

392
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,438
Mental health case.

393
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:29,742
A paranoid schizophrenic.

394
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,037
Vivid auditory hallucinations,
paranoid delusions.

395
00:23:36,162 --> 00:23:38,825
She's all over the place,
usually incoherent.

396
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,163
We've been working
with a specialist in neuroleptics

397
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:42,758
and he's in there right now.

398
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,845
He's been giving her
daily treatments,

399
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,220
but none seem to take.
Poor thing.

400
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:51,219
I think, she'll be
sedate enough for evaluations.

401
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:52,764
Thanks again, Dr. Kennard.

402
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:53,932
Certainly.

403
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,476
This way.

404
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:11,305
This is Dr. Brink. He's going
to ask you a few questions.

405
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:16,120
Stream of bodies,
just more and more bodies.

406
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,747
More bodies, more and more bodies

407
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:20,672
gushing through the river.

408
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,676
Just more and more bodies.

409
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:26,193
My name is Topher Brink.

410
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,134
How could he get answers
when every word in here is a lie?

411
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,558
Every word is a lie!

412
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:33,527
Everyone's a liar, he's a liar!

413
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:35,515
- He's a liar!
- I'm not a liar.

414
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,783
He's a liar.

415
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,393
- He's a liar.
- I'm not a liar.

416
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,733
Don't call me that!

417
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,820
They're dissolving me. From the in,

418
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,988
the inside out.

419
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,014
Do you know where you are?

420
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:03,501
I'm in hell.

421
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,211
You're in Los Angeles.

422
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:07,556
I can understand the mix-up.

423
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:09,528
You are in a medical facility.

424
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,426
Would you like to leave this place?

425
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,224
Yes.

426
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Yes!

427
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:21,729
Help me.

428
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:23,212
Help me, please.

429
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:27,984
There are men with guns

430
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:31,090
and they took me here
to fill me with poison.

431
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:34,574
They're filling me with
poison to make me crazy.

432
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,410
It's not uncommon to believe that.

433
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,078
They're torturing me!

434
00:25:39,612 --> 00:25:42,665
They're torturing,
they're torturing me.

435
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:45,268
I'm a prisoner, I'm a prisoner.

436
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,195
Not for long.

437
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:11,165
<i>Sun</i>

438
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:14,855
<i>Rises slow</i>

439
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,563
<i>Water rides the air</i>

440
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,878
<i>Gathering in the clouds</i>

441
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,400
<i>Forming raindrops</i>

442
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,759
<i>Or heavy snow</i>

443
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,074
<i>We're drones</i>

444
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:39,074
<i>Happy as we are</i>

445
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:42,780
<i>Thinking our sustained</i>

446
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,311
<i>Lies are love</i>

447
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:50,566
<i>The flow, tearing us apart...</i>

448
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,964
You're here to stay?
I have you to myself?

449
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,289
I'm all yours.

450
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,541
Is it done then?

451
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:18,206
Yes.

452
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:21,148
Good.

453
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:23,136
If you say so.

454
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,199
If you have actually managed
to develop some pangs of conscience,

455
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,950
you may rest in the knowledge
that in this matter, you...

456
00:27:43,612 --> 00:27:45,012
you had no choice.

457
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
I didn't.

458
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,429
Will it still be romantic if
we build up an appetite first?

459
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,609
Am I being too aggressive?

460
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:20,048
Did you want me
wide-eyed and demure?

461
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:21,873
Or stupid?

462
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,785
Did you want me to be a mute?

463
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,489
Which is it, Nolan?

464
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,782
Which fantasy did you
want to keep forever?

465
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,639
You just couldn't
take no for an answer.

466
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,566
Are you looking for this?

467
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,559
This a bookmark?

468
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,208
It's a leaf.

469
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,121
It's pretty.

470
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:56,025
Is the book pretty?
There aren't any pictures.

471
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,937
I can make out some of the words.

472
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:02,062
It's fun.

473
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:04,905
Exercising our brains
makes us our best.

474
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,565
When did you learn how to lie?

475
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:15,211
Am I in trouble?

476
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:18,238
Not from me.
But there are people

477
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:21,175
who would be very upset
if they knew what you were doing.

478
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:22,622
Reading?

479
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:26,551
You brought the painting to Topher.

480
00:29:26,676 --> 00:29:29,538
You're pushing.
The Actives, the staff...

481
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:32,137
What you're doing
could have consequences

482
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:34,021
you can't predict or control.

483
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,482
Some people are not ready
to wake up.

484
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,210
I don't care.

485
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:41,778
Something bad is coming...

486
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:43,637
like a storm...

487
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,730
and I want everyone to survive it.

488
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,830
They need to wake up.

489
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,124
You stir things up,
you might bring the storm on yourself.

490
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:59,423
I'm not your lab rat anymore.

491
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,050
I'm free, clear-headed,
it feels good.

492
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:06,887
What, and you came to get revenge for
a year of loving every minute of it?

493
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:10,188
Did I love it?

494
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:14,776
Must not have been very memorable.

495
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:17,839
I remember you poisoning me,
locking me up,

496
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:21,824
but I have not a single memory of
the year where I apparently liked you.

497
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,779
We had some good times.

498
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:26,887
I got filled in on all the details.

499
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:28,162
Brainwashing.

500
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:30,119
Talk about desperate.

501
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:34,287
They even programmed me to think
it was endearing how quick you were.

502
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:36,505
You were mine.

503
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:38,065
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:39,914 --> 00:30:42,214
I don't think I was faithful to you.

505
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,926
I let them whore you out to anyone.

506
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,194
No, it's something else. It's...

507
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,722
It's someone...

508
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:51,361
someone I trust.

509
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,750
- He helps me.
- See?

510
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,494
- He thrills me!
- Yeah, I know, see, it worked.

511
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:59,249
You told me that you
loved me a hundred times.

512
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:00,574
I changed you.

513
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,010
It's not you.

514
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:05,613
I managed to fall for someone else.

515
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,656
- You think this is cute?
- It's absurd.

516
00:31:07,985 --> 00:31:10,035
I don't remember meeting him or

517
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:12,465
even spending a moment with him.

518
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,846
But I can feel it
stronger than anything.

519
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:18,434
I'm crazy about him!

520
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,590
I love him.

521
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:22,797
I love him

522
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,133
so much more than I hate you.

523
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,672
You're gonna fight fair this time?

524
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:01,347
So much for fair, huh?

525
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:09,538
You know...

526
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,910
this is a scenario
I never thought of.

527
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,301
You resisting.

528
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,390
The struggle is a turn on.

529
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:57,874
We got to run.
We got to run.

530
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:00,294
We got to... we got to
get out of here.

531
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,258
We got to move. Got to run before...

532
00:34:14,627 --> 00:34:15,756
How did you...

533
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:17,960
I'm head of security.
I hear every call.

534
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,504
I want you to wash your hands
and go to Nolan's room.

535
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:24,728
Pack a suitcase of his clothes.
Pack for warm weather.

536
00:34:26,494 --> 00:34:29,234
In the van outside, you'll find
containers of sulfuric acid,

537
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,609
a plastic sheet and a bag of tools.

538
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,488
What?

539
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,074
What are you talking about?

540
00:34:38,346 --> 00:34:39,496
Consequences.

541
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:03,391
Come on, Topher.

542
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,707
- I can't do it.
- You're a doctor.

543
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:09,314
- You know how to dissect a body.
- That was in school.

544
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:11,217
And why do you?

545
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,271
Slit the femoral arteries
and pump the chest.

546
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:17,246
Draining the fluids makes
it easier to cut up.

547
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:14,496
I was just

548
00:36:14,826 --> 00:36:16,276
trying to help her.

549
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:21,116
Now she's ruined.

550
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,838
You had a moral dilemma.

551
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:25,013
Your first.

552
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,304
And it didn't go well.

553
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:29,929
Priya does not belong
in the Dollhouse.

554
00:36:31,186 --> 00:36:32,189
She does now.

555
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,322
Now, I have to start the lies.

556
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:43,677
Man, it's me.

557
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:46,647
Yeah, it's been a while.

558
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,560
Look, I'm going to need
The Goose. Is he around?

559
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,335
Yeah, I need someone...

560
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:52,826
disappeared.

561
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,725
It seems his permanent
engagement plan

562
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,310
involved leaving the country
with Sierra.

563
00:36:59,435 --> 00:37:01,398
Did any heat come down from up top?

564
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:02,973
Not that I know of.

565
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,822
- Anything at your end?
- <i>Nothing here.</i>

566
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:08,297
<i>But he left without her.
In a hurry.</i>

567
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,899
We found his car just
south of the border,

568
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:13,323
with some fake ident
in the glove box.

569
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:15,651
So, Sierra's back in the House?

570
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:17,826
<i>Never even got to say good-bye.</i>

571
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:19,945
How convenient.

572
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:22,714
<i>Are you going to look
into it further?</i>

573
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,389
I don't think any good
would come of it.

574
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,209
I don't know what's real.

575
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,178
Yesterday, I had lost my mind,

576
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,606
trapped in a nightmare.

577
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:43,595
Then you bring me here,
wake me up, and...

578
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,970
I'm sane again.

579
00:37:47,353 --> 00:37:48,603
But you tell me

580
00:37:48,728 --> 00:37:50,078
it's been a year.

581
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,000
All the things I was made to do.

582
00:37:58,494 --> 00:37:59,844
And I kill a man.

583
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,905
I woke up from a nightmare
only to live in one.

584
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:12,388
You were supposed to help me.

585
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:16,001
I thought I was.

586
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:21,141
I was... fooled.

587
00:38:25,355 --> 00:38:26,505
I'm so sorry.

588
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:32,392
If there was anything I could do
to make it better...

589
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:34,451
Do you have any beer?

590
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:48,173
Am I allowed to have beer in here?

591
00:38:50,016 --> 00:38:51,536
Or is this my last one?

592
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:55,586
You're allowed.

593
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:56,711
On...

594
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:58,943
special occasions.

595
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:02,817
And are we happy here?

596
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:06,121
I...

597
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:08,543
You...

598
00:39:08,904 --> 00:39:10,104
Most of you...

599
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:14,697
I have no idea.

600
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:22,618
That's him.

601
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:26,012
What's his name?

602
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,320
I love him.

603
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:41,806
Is that real?

604
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:45,747
Yes.

605
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:49,009
Yes, it's real.

606
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:51,939
He loves you back.

607
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:05,425
I wished Nolan dead, I did.

608
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,067
I thought about it all the time
when I was locked up

609
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,442
in that horrible place going crazy.

610
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:16,705
I never should've let you go there.
I should've just set you free.

611
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,523
I would've gone anyway.

612
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:20,853
I wanted to confront him.

613
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:24,842
I don't know
what I thought would happen.

614
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,333
If you wake me up again,

615
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,413
put me back to where I was
a year ago.

616
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:33,632
Skip this day.

617
00:40:33,757 --> 00:40:36,007
Ignore it or delete it or whatever.

618
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,846
I don't ever want this back, okay?

619
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:43,223
Okay.

620
00:40:54,428 --> 00:40:56,028
This secret we have...

621
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,038
can you keep it?

622
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,229
I can keep it,

623
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:09,021
but I don't know
if I can live with it.

624
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:12,371
I know I can't.

625
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:16,086
But I don't have to.

626
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,380
<i>Hang on, traveling woman</i>

627
00:41:57,295 --> 00:42:00,055
<i>Don't sacrifice your plan...</i>

628
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,580
Did I fall asleep?

629
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:08,216
- For a little bit.
- <i>Cause it will come back to you</i>

630
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:15,198
<i>Got to listen</i>

631
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:21,180
<i>To the vision</i>

632
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:26,967
<i>Some may say a dream</i>

633
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:32,367
<i>Words from the unseen</i>

634
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,275
<i>They can make you tired</i>

635
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,888
<i>Tell you lies</i>

636
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,794
<i>Make you fall</i>

637
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:45,442
<i>Make you tired</i>

638
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,144
<i>Tell you lies</i>

639
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:49,316
<i>Make you fall</i>

640
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:54,498
<i>Make you tired</i>

641
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:56,345
<i>Tell you lies</i>

642
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:59,228
<i>Make you fall.</i>
