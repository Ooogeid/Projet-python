00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,793
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,836
Three years of my life are gone,

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,463
stolen by the Dollhouse.

4
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:06,728
She's not right.

5
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,550
<i>She's perfect.
It's like they made her just for me.</i>

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,926
I call it a Disruptor.

7
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:13,470
The gentle hum
lets you know it's working.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,139
- Who the hell are you?
- You forgot me already?

9
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,851
If I don't stop Rossum,
no one will.

10
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:24,523
- You're not a Doll.
- What the hell was that?

11
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:27,902
We're going back to D.C.,
so you can forget this ever happened.

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,988
Here we are.

13
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:47,922
What's interesting to me
is that you don't call out to God.

14
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:52,736
It isn't a question
of faith, it's just the vernacular.

15
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,052
Anyone in this much pain prays,

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,940
or at least curses, but...

17
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:00,768
we take God from you, too.

18
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,771
You really are a shell.

19
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:05,439
Why?

20
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:07,464
Now's not the time for why.

21
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:10,194
I like this void.

22
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:12,914
This feeble, simple world.

23
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:15,950
Ju pain... over and over.

24
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:19,343
No reason, no-no end,

25
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:20,668
no in between.

26
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,958
You can't even pass out.

27
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:27,211
I've shut down everything
that stands between you

28
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,171
and blinding, searing pain.

29
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,048
Of course, I bluff.

30
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,593
It won't always be like this.

31
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,188
When we get to the why...

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,972
that's when it gets really bad.

33
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,053
Episode 206: <i>The Left Hand</i>

34
00:02:25,443 --> 00:02:27,229
www.subbercafe.fr

35
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,361
Please don't let them do this.

36
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,830
Do what, Daniel?

37
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:37,635
It's already been done.

38
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,033
Don't you get that?

39
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:41,202
I don't want to forget who I am.

40
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:43,579
Oh, baby.

41
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:46,574
You don't want to remember
who you were.

42
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,877
Even though that part's
always been there.

43
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:53,302
- What are you talking about?
- You already know.

44
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,040
You were a nobody

45
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:58,014
before we found you.

46
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:00,132
Just a name.

47
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,145
Everything you care about,

48
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,697
everything you hold most dear,

49
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:07,571
we gave you.

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,146
That's not true.

51
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,484
You know it is.

52
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:16,287
We took a spoiled, pampered,

53
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:17,613
selfish child,

54
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:20,199
and we made a man out of him.

55
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:23,165
A man the people could trust.

56
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,729
Why?

57
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,288
We needed a senator,

58
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,502
and you had the pedigree.

59
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,674
You didn't create me.
I'm going to expose you. You know that.

60
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,418
That righteous indignation?

61
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:40,343
Yeah, we gave that to you, too.

62
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,217
We spent three years
building up your credibility.

63
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,670
When you finally exonerate Rossum

64
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,671
at the Senate hearings today,

65
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,855
no one will question you.

66
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,206
Why are you telling me this now?

67
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,495
Because it's funny?

68
00:03:56,672 --> 00:03:59,800
And because you're not gonna
remember in 20 minutes anyway.

69
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:04,373
Which is also
why I think I can say...

70
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,284
I can't stand you.

71
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:11,763
Having to be your wife,

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,975
letting you touch me,

73
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:19,103
pretending that
when it doesn't disgust me

74
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:21,027
it doesn't bore me?

75
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:24,967
That has been really hard.

76
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,936
Feels good to get that out.

77
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,340
This limo is nice, right?

78
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,311
Very fancy.

79
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:44,575
You're probably used to it.
See, I definitely am not used to it.

80
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:48,620
Your sole purpose here
is to hack into the D.C. mainframe

81
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:50,581
and acquire
Senator Perrin's imprint.

82
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,500
This will require stealth,
clarity of purpose,

83
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,960
and above all, calm.

84
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:09,308
- Good stuff. Drink?
- No.

85
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,518
- Can I have one?
- Absolutely not.

86
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,686
Roger!

87
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,580
I...

88
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:27,010
don't like going
outside of my comfort zone.

89
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:30,577
Our one and only chance
for discovering

90
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,206
Rossum's plan is to pull it
from the senator's brain scan.

91
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,644
There is no margin for error.

92
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,220
So I would suggest that you expand
your comfort zone immediately.

93
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,434
It's just water.

94
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:44,957
It'll help.

95
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:49,076
It takes a lot out of you.

96
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:51,976
We take a lot out of you.

97
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,485
Do you know your name?

98
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:56,105
Echo.

99
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:57,898
Your real name?

100
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,112
Caroline.

101
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:05,325
You know.

102
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,492
It's good.
It helps.

103
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:11,514
And you know we took your memories.

104
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,213
Is Caroline in there?

105
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,881
Yes and no.

106
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:21,293
This is one of my memories...

107
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:22,506
of you.

108
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:26,555
This is the last time I saw you.

109
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:29,388
This is what you did to me.

110
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,530
Not just to my arm.

111
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:33,081
To me.

112
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,594
I want you to feel this.

113
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,733
There is something worse than pain.

114
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,539
Sorry to have kept you
waiting for a few minutes.

115
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,707
25.

116
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:58,917
Always so precise.

117
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,796
- And who's this?
- My chief programmer, Topher Brink.

118
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,591
You're out of your jurisdiction.

119
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,028
- You've my Active. I'd like have back.
- Geez, lighten up, will you?

120
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:11,180
- So serious.
- It's a serious situation.

121
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,599
I trust we'll find her undamaged.

122
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:16,352
Here's the thing, Adelle.
I'm not in a position to help you.

123
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,270
Your girl got caught up
in a major operation,

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,231
and there are certain protocols
that I just have to follow.

125
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,759
I just can't give her back to you.

126
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,824
I have to get approval,
and that may take time.

127
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,533
You understand.

128
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:33,869
Of course I do.

129
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:36,659
Then why don't the two of you
just fly on back to Los Angeles,

130
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:40,254
and the moment I get the go-ahead,
we'll ship your Active back to you.

131
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,310
- Does that sound like a plan?
- Absolutely.

132
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,836
I'll need Mr. Brink to examine Echo.

133
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:49,835
Just to ensure my asset is intact.

134
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,263
Where's the trust?

135
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:54,936
Protocols.

136
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,815
I'll let my programmer know
you're coming.

137
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:05,665
Business must be slow
in L.A. if you're here.

138
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,236
Who's minding the store?

139
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,490
We've got our top guy
covering for me.

140
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,348
Only person in the world I trust.

141
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,428
What you're not getting, man friend,

142
00:08:15,554 --> 00:08:18,664
is that this whole operation
is dependant upon me.

143
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:21,208
Not brain-constructy me,

144
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,574
but Bond, James Bond me, which is...

145
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,255
not so me.

146
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,466
Topher,
all you have to do is stay calm.

147
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:32,219
This from the guy who had
to dismember my last little outing?

148
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,013
You get into their system,
you make the connect so that we...

149
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,558
you can get a look
at Perrin's brain map.

150
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:41,106
I'm not up to this.

151
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:44,393
I suffer from acute agoraphobia.

152
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,236
Or I plan to.

153
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:49,278
Bennett Halverson is the chief
programmer at the D.C. Dollhouse.

154
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,025
She's a genius.

155
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,915
I think she's a genius,
so, you know,

156
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,032
double it.

157
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:57,411
She's just gonna look at my 1.0,

158
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,496
and his palms are gonna sweat,
and she's just... She'll know.

159
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,106
I have to track down Ballard.

160
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,628
You just run the House
and wait for yourself to call.

161
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,960
It's starting.

162
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,259
The clammy.

163
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,595
I'm busy right...

164
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:20,118
I'm sorry?

165
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,078
Topher Brink?

166
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:26,235
Of course.

167
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,169
Mr. Brink.

168
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:50,464
I... I'm looking
for Bennett Halverson.

169
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,991
Can you tell me where...?
Or you can show me where she...

170
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:56,497
It's different.

171
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:00,341
Than L.A...

172
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:02,768
Well, I suppose it would be.

173
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:04,937
You probably have palm trees and...

174
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,334
tans.

175
00:10:06,854 --> 00:10:08,607
We're four stories underground.

176
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,298
Not a lot of photosynthesis.

177
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,825
No, no, you're very pale.

178
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:15,653
White.

179
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:17,006
Pinkish-white.

180
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,328
Your skin...
Your skin is like a pig.

181
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,262
- Bennett Halv...
- Because it's pink.

182
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:28,259
People assume that pigs are bad,
but I love them.

183
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:29,920
I like them.

184
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,630
I hear they make good pets.

185
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:32,978
I'm Bennett.

186
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:37,383
You were looking for me.

187
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:41,473
For realsies?

188
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:42,641
You're Bennett?

189
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,371
Not Bennett Junior?

190
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,565
You merged JAMS with ESAMS
to create next gen proteins?

191
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:51,628
You stud!

192
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,213
I'm sorry... That was...

193
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:57,566
Clammy hands.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,701
I'm glad that you enjoyed
the report.

195
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,495
What's up with your arm?

196
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:06,572
It's...

197
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:08,384
Dead.

198
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:10,841
From the shoulder?

199
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,713
Nerves are severed.

200
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,424
You're here for your Active.

201
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,596
You won't get her.

202
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,764
What?

203
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:23,920
She interfered
with a Rossum directive.

204
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:26,768
It's unlikely
that Mr. Lipman will let her go.

205
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,722
It's unlikely Mr. Lipman
will have a choice.

206
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:31,659
- Can I see her?
- Of course.

207
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:34,106
She's still unconscious.

208
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:36,041
Courtesy of your device.

209
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,655
Just a little project.

210
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
Hardly.

211
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,535
Is it weird that I asked
about your arm?

212
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:46,935
Honestly, it's refreshing.

213
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:55,317
Adelle DeWitt flies 3,000 miles
across country

214
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,055
to pick up one Doll?

215
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,178
Must be a special girl.

216
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:02,638
They're all special.

217
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,058
Oh, yeah, but this one,
she nearly took Perrin from us.

218
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,157
I think our programmer wouldn't mind

219
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:11,619
wading around in that brain.

220
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,066
And clearly, you can't control her.

221
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:17,221
I think maybe you're just gonna
have to walk away from this one.

222
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:20,197
Do you honestly think
it's up to you?

223
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:23,617
Do you think anyone at Rossum
will take your side? Harding?

224
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:26,370
You're not much
of a poker player, are you?

225
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,954
You got no cards, Adelle.

226
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:30,040
And you don't know how to bluff.

227
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:32,209
One for the road?

228
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:34,544
Now, Stewart...

229
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,548
you and I have similar goals.

230
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:41,468
I would like to think
we could achieve a...

231
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,781
a mutually...

232
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,475
beneficial...

233
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,435
compromise.

234
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,236
Compromise can be fun.

235
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,888
If you don't return my Active,

236
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:06,076
I will send someone
to cut these off.

237
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,156
You will be killed, horribly,

238
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:12,685
over a long period and never found.

239
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:16,128
Now, look me in my eyes, Stewart,

240
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,338
and tell me
if I've learned how to bluff.

241
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:26,913
Compromise.

242
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,314
This is not my device.

243
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:39,901
- She's been tranqued.
- It was probably one of the Handlers.

244
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,221
How do you work it?

245
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,441
The Disruptor.

246
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:51,982
How'd you know it was called that?

247
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,191
What else would you call it?

248
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:02,048
The signal goes out for 50 feet,
but everywhere.

249
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:03,759
That's what...

250
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,905
messed up your senator
and ruined your evil plan.

251
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:11,183
If you... if you route
the signal through here,

252
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:14,311
it becomes directional.

253
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,898
Not like a bomb, more like a taser.

254
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:34,480
- Did you just try to tase me?
- No, no.

255
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:38,585
That would result in...
You'd be unconscious.

256
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:40,662
Why would I want that?

257
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:42,891
And it only works on Actives.

258
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,966
I'm concerned
that you may have tried to tase me.

259
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,359
No, I just...

260
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:49,554
You're really Bennett Halverson.

261
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,524
This conversation is becoming vague.

262
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:59,013
So, we have had an Active, Whiskey,

263
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:01,066
and she was rendered unengageable.

264
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,960
So, we, I made her into a doctor.

265
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:05,421
And you...

266
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,489
So, I thought maybe...

267
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,491
Similar...
Bennett, the real Bennett...

268
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,785
would use an Active to...

269
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,153
You thought...

270
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:17,212
That's idiotic.

271
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,751
Actives are beautiful.

272
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:21,920
Yeah.

273
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:29,469
And it's not my evil plan.

274
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,007
It's-It's not evil.

275
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:32,297
Wait. Hey!

276
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:33,932
I'm just here for Echo.

277
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:37,468
My last ethical quandary was...

278
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:39,578
unhelpful.

279
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,690
Let mommy and daddy
do the squabbling.

280
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,529
Yes, sir.

281
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,747
Right away.

282
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,367
Looks like you got the girl.

283
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,677
Let me go check on...
is it "Echo"?...

284
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,372
and get everything signed.

285
00:15:57,696 --> 00:16:00,709
Can I use your phone?
Just wanna check in with my House.

286
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:02,542
Yes, of course.

287
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:15,245
Wasabi peas.

288
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:18,327
I'm excited and scared.

289
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Finally!

290
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,038
<i>Everything good there?</i>

291
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,556
Everything's great, me-man,

292
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:33,631
except I've got
a long white beard from waiting.

293
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,762
Put the signal through.

294
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:43,599
Solid.

295
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,671
I see what you see.

296
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:49,901
I still don't know how I'm gonna get
Perrin's brain map running,

297
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,995
but you can use this link
to route it.

298
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:53,648
Dude,

299
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:56,056
Halverson's fine.

300
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,309
- What? Wait! Who? What?
- Bennett.

301
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,686
She's, what?
Like, distinguished?

302
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,773
Like young and fine, I poo you not.

303
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,191
Are we into her?

304
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:08,109
We may be fierce on the subject.

305
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,208
Oh, God, I wish I was there!

306
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:11,738
What's she like?

307
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:13,438
Totally shy,

308
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:15,417
librarian energy through the roof.

309
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:17,118
- <i>Glasses?</i>
- Glasses on a chain!

310
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,543
For the win!

311
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:21,099
<i>Dude, she has a dead arm!</i>

312
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:23,833
Like, dead?
Like, in a sling, with the glove?

313
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,394
Imagine John Cassavetes
in <i>The Fury</i> as a hot chick.

314
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:29,005
Which you know I often have.

315
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,019
We lose the connection?

316
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:35,011
Dude, she's probably an Active!

317
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:40,061
You're so untrusting.

318
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:51,991
Bree?

319
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,199
Don't go. Don't go.

320
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,243
We have to go. Come on!

321
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,125
Don't leave me!

322
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,883
I'm not gonna leave you.
We're both going.

323
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:15,233
Now!

324
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:25,353
Good-bye, Caroline.

325
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:43,596
Are you okay?

326
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:45,331
What happened?

327
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:47,595
Here, come here, come here.

328
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,401
Look at me. Look at me.
Can you tell me what happened?

329
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:51,755
It was Echo.

330
00:18:52,995 --> 00:18:53,810
Oh, boy.

331
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:54,935
Oh, boy!

332
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:58,225
Bad!

333
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:02,285
Where is she?

334
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:04,726
She took Perrin.

335
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:14,125
Bree, wait.

336
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:16,325
I'm not Bree. I'm Echo.

337
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:18,400
Echo, what did they do to you?

338
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,525
She did this. But not to me.

339
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,560
She? Who? I don't understand.
Who is "she"?

340
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,582
- Don't leave me!
- Sorry, sister.

341
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,715
I stay, we both get nabbed.

342
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:35,775
She wanted me to know how it felt.

343
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,534
It feels bad.

344
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,447
You're not making any sense.
Were they imprinting you?

345
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:42,722
You don't seem finished.

346
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:44,724
How do you know
when you're finished?

347
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,103
Listen to me. I think someone
on the inside is trying to help us.

348
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,905
They showed me the way out,
put it in my head so we could escape.

349
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,480
We haven't escaped.

350
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:55,276
They're coming, they always come.

351
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:57,445
Because of this.

352
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,215
What's that?

353
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,212
- It's how they find us.
- GPS tag?

354
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,375
We have to cut.

355
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:44,645
I don't think I can.

356
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:47,615
You will.

357
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,248
I'll show you how.

358
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,540
That's where Senator Perrin
will sit.

359
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:56,462
He's gonna make an opening statement,
and then the hearing will begin.

360
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,798
Okay, this is the press area here,
so just...

361
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:02,385
be prepared for a couple dozen
camera lenses pointing at you.

362
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:03,990
A couple dozen?

363
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:07,565
Don't even think about that.
Just focus on your testimony.

364
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:10,018
Where is the senator now?

365
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,396
He's following up on some last minute
evidence we received.

366
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,315
He wants all the ammunition
against Rossum we can get.

367
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,495
Excuse me one moment.

368
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,325
- Hello?
- <i>Perrin escaped.</i>

369
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:25,115
I see.

370
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,744
Can you explain how that happened?

371
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,289
He was attacked by that LA Active, Echo.
They're together.

372
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,666
- Has he been wiped?
- <i>No.</i>

373
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:35,418
That is very unfortunate.

374
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,140
We tracked their GPS,
we dispatched a retrieval team.

375
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,798
I've sent you the coordinates.
You need to be there when it goes down.

376
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,216
On my way.

377
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:45,845
They won't stop looking.

378
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:48,895
We won't stop running.

379
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:51,370
Pull everybody in.

380
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,745
I want every team on this.

381
00:22:53,615 --> 00:22:55,115
Well, figure it out!

382
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:59,877
He has to be at that hearing in 4 hours,
or Rossum will have our heads.

383
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,010
To be clear, this little project
is your problem, not mine.

384
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:06,009
Well, I'll remind you of that
when we're bunk buddies in the Attic.

385
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,305
Listen to this.

386
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:11,466
She's got a great idea.

387
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,195
It's your idea.
It's based on your idea.

388
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:16,894
But you should tell them.
I can't take the credit.

389
00:23:17,225 --> 00:23:18,271
Spit it out!

390
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,741
We might be able
to reconfigure the disruptor

391
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,110
to incapacitate Echo and Perrin
without actually locating them.

392
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:25,835
Explain.

393
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:30,679
Topher's disruptor sends a signal
using a universal frequency,

394
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:34,030
which affects every Doll,
but only within a limited range.

395
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:36,998
If we use the neural electric biolinks,
we can redirect the loop

396
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,666
to target a specific brain.

397
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,884
In English.

398
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:44,145
I do the English part? That's new.

399
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:48,075
We can plug my disruptor
into the biolink system

400
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,553
and send the signal from here
and put them to sleep.

401
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:54,045
A painful, bleeding sleep,
but sleep, nonetheless.

402
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,865
Right? She's just...

403
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:57,915
Genius! She's so good!

404
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:02,065
- How long will this take to accomplish?
- Not long at all.

405
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:05,733
I can have Echo's brain map
uploaded into Bennett's system.

406
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:07,420
I just need Perrin's.

407
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,145
I gotta have a target.

408
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,381
Give him whatever he needs.

409
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:16,895
Topher Brink...

410
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:20,225
Meet Daniel Perrin.

411
00:24:27,235 --> 00:24:30,285
It may be the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

412
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:40,405
Selective strand replacement
takes a delicate hand.

413
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:42,720
This is more
than just an alteration.

414
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:46,180
This is an imprint married to a...

415
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:47,693
an existing consciousness.

416
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:51,280
It's amazing you didn't end up
with a schizophrenic.

417
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,201
I have a theory that the brain can hold
multiple imprints and still function.

418
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:57,905
- A composite?
- Not a composite.

419
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Something new.

420
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:01,935
The original Daniel Perrin
is all there.

421
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,585
I just...

422
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,275
made him better.

423
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:09,507
We'll need your Active's map.

424
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:17,075
Uploaded.

425
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:23,705
It's very nice.

426
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:26,845
She was kind of a hooker.

427
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:31,745
How about...

428
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,214
While I build the magic bullets,

429
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:36,665
you work on adapting your gun?

430
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,495
Right. Right.

431
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:43,175
You can use the whole workspace
over there.

432
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:55,354
Let's hope when we zap them,
they're not driving down the freeway

433
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,929
or flying a biplane
or something, huh?

434
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,274


435
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:11,170
You probably don't even need
to make delivery files.

436
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:14,040
I bet we can just plug this baby
straight into your biofeed...

437
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:15,515
I know. I just...

438
00:26:16,395 --> 00:26:18,618
thought I'd upload some sweet dreams
to pass along.

439
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,785


440
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:22,885
Compensate for the searing,
searing pain.

441
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:26,745
I like that.

442
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:37,950
- Incoming.
- Is that it?

443
00:26:38,075 --> 00:26:39,347
It's me. The him-me.

444
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,815
- I'm giving the word to myself.
- And what's the word?

445
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,668
It ain't "Grease".

446
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,830
The he-me did it.

447
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:49,524
I rock. We rock.

448
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,569
The I-other-me has accessed
Perrin's brain map.

449
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:58,824
That may be the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen.

450
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:07,208
We can't stay here to long.

451
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:09,254
It's real.

452
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,888
It's all real.
They didn't program this.

453
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:14,953
I grew up here.

454
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,560
I wish they had.

455
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:21,943
Why?

456
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,293
They didn't create me.
Only parts of me.

457
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:27,348
How can I ever untangle it?

458
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,604
Does it matter?

459
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:32,737
What do you mean?

460
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:34,443
Does it matter who you were?

461
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,655
All that matters is
who you decide to be. Who you can be.

462
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:39,740
You make it sound so easy.

463
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:42,660
It is.
It's all up to you.

464
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:44,287
What, the voters don't get a say?

465
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,622
The voters will say yes.

466
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:50,677
I don't know.

467
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,160
At this stage,

468
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,707
might seem a little cynical.

469
00:27:54,832 --> 00:27:56,966
Like I was trading in
on the family name.

470
00:27:57,229 --> 00:27:58,505
Oh, you would be.

471
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,177
But it wouldn't be cynical.

472
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,096
You use what you have.

473
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,973
Think of all the good you could do.

474
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:08,599
Even if I decided to run...

475
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:12,777
Do you have any idea
how much dirt the opposition

476
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:14,298
could throw at me?

477
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,973
I saw what you were doing
when I walked into this party.

478
00:28:19,213 --> 00:28:21,145
But everybody's got a past.

479
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,300
It's the future
the voters care about.

480
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:27,488
You show them that, all
will be forgiven.

481
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:31,876
Where did you come from?

482
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:33,574
Salinas, Kansas.

483
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:36,631
And don't say
I'm not in Kansas anymore.

484
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:38,327
I've heard that one.

485
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,426
I know exactly where I am.

486
00:28:41,004 --> 00:28:42,654
And who I'm talking to.

487
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:49,612
Did it really happen?

488
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:51,707
Was she ever here?

489
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:56,094
Or was it something programmed
into me in some basement somewhere?

490
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,069
Doesn't matter.

491
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,620
She was right.

492
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,230
They made me into something better.

493
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:04,753
You try to be your best.

494
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:06,786
Yes.

495
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:11,749
Even if I could, I don't know
if I want to be the man I was before.

496
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,178
I understand.

497
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:16,170
You do, don't you?

498
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,143
I'm afraid of Caroline.

499
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:20,518
If she comes back, where will I go?

500
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,052
I don't want to fall asleep.

501
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:25,221
Even for a little while.

502
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:27,792
You're awake now.

503
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:32,061
And so am I.
That's what they didn't expect.

504
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:35,147
They were going to use me as cover,
but they didn't get a chance

505
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,616
to reprogram me.

506
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:40,231
They've created someone
who can bring them down.

507
00:29:40,356 --> 00:29:42,049
And that's what I'm going to do.

508
00:29:42,495 --> 00:29:44,662
There's still time.
We can make it to the hearings.

509
00:29:44,787 --> 00:29:46,237
We can expose them.

510
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,245
And then we can be who we are.

511
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:53,337
We can be who we decide to be.

512
00:29:58,635 --> 00:30:00,715
Okay. Fire when ready.

513
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,349
I got nothing on Echo.

514
00:30:12,372 --> 00:30:13,622
That's unusual.

515
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:16,704
I think your senator's
filibustering.

516
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,110
Wait...

517
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:24,155
What did you do?

518
00:30:58,552 --> 00:30:59,690
Daniel, stop!

519
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:04,820
They're in your head.
You don't have to listen!

520
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:07,573
You don't have to be
what they tell you to be.

521
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,133
You can belong to you.

522
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,996
- What do we see?
- Who is it?

523
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:19,877
<i>I'm looking at a triggered sleeper.</i>

524
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,545
He's not set on stun.

525
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,715
- How's the other one?
- <i>Still alive.</i>

526
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,134
But spiking on every front.
I don't think she can match him.

527
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,262
Get our new girlfriend
to switch him off or bye-bye, Echo.

528
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:31,578
Roger that.

529
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,421
You hacked into my system.

530
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:40,481
- You stole Perrin's brain map.
- You're trying to kill Echo.

531
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,484
- So we're even?
- Not even.

532
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,278
Not even close.
Shut him down. Now.

533
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:49,615
- Do you know who Echo really is?
- She's a friend.

534
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,847
Friend?

535
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,450
That shell?

536
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:55,441
I was her friend!

537
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:57,581
I was her best friend.

538
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:00,196
This is what I got for it.

539
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,419
This is my gift from Caroline.

540
00:32:03,145 --> 00:32:05,339
This isn't about Caroline.
This is about Echo.

541
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,934
They're the same!

542
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,312
Caroline has a power over people,

543
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:13,222
and however well you wiped her,
she clearly still does!

544
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,091
She has no power over...

545
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:18,686
When was the last time
that you described a Doll as a friend?

546
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:22,725
I know about Alpha and Ballard.

547
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:26,360
You're saying
she doesn't have some power?

548
00:32:26,823 --> 00:32:28,779
I'm saying shut Perrin down.

549
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,434
It's for the best.

550
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:43,127
You were so close to perfect.

551
00:32:48,162 --> 00:32:49,258
You still with me?

552
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,427
Is Bennett on board?
'Cause I don't see...

553
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,220
- Bennett's out.
- I killed her?

554
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:55,723
I hit her. It hurt.

555
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,391
But we can't just flip him back.

556
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,810
We can if we isolate
the neural path.

557
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,313
- Do you know how many...
- Then shut up and work.

558
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,522
I'm working.

559
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,274
I wouldn't hold your breath.

560
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,692
No. I wouldn't.

561
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:25,312
Split up.

562
00:34:22,576 --> 00:34:23,477
Where is he?

563
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:25,081
Gone.

564
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,772
Something else is here.

565
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,602
Oh, God. Doll-speak.

566
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,362
Watch her.
I'm going to go get the senator.

567
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:37,877
Please answer me.

568
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,470
Those things I said before...

569
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:44,540
none of them were true.

570
00:34:45,264 --> 00:34:46,984
I wanted to hurt you.

571
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:50,163
They programmed you to love me,

572
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,482
but the truth is,
no one programmed me to love you.

573
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,492
And I do.

574
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:00,468
I love you, baby.

575
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:03,726
Come with me.

576
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:07,146
Things can be
just like they were before.

577
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:10,657
We can be happy again.

578
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,179
Like before.

579
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,240
And ever after.

580
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:22,619
That's right.

581
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:53,624
Daniel, stop!

582
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:57,821
She's got me locked out on this end.

583
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,240
Who's your back door man?

584
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:03,611
We'll just pretend
I didn't say that.

585
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,623
- Found the worm.
- Step on it.

586
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,714
Squished.

587
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,319
She's broken. We have to go.

588
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:33,597
I killed her.

589
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:36,151
- I did this.
- It wasn't you.

590
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,194
It was them.

591
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:41,743
Daniel, we have to go.

592
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:44,118
You can still stop them,
but they're coming.

593
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,328
If we don't go...

594
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,913
They'll just make us forget...
forget that I killed her.

595
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:49,295
They killed her.

596
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,602
If you let them make you forget,
then you killed her.

597
00:36:51,727 --> 00:36:53,877
Can you live with that,
or can you trust me?

598
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,697
Where is Mrs. Perrin?

599
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:30,497
I apologize to the committee for...

600
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:38,005
My wife is dead.

601
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,140
I don't want to be here right now,
but I'm honestly afraid

602
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,143
I may not have another chance
to tell the truth.

603
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:55,355
I was looking for a conspiracy,
and I found something more horrible...

604
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,446
The Rossum Corporation
is the most powerful medical company,

605
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,573
but they are something else,
as well.

606
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:06,734
For the past several years,

607
00:38:07,228 --> 00:38:09,369
the Rossum Corporation
has been a target.

608
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:12,956
A target of a consortium of companies
that would stop at nothing

609
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:16,835
to undermine Rossum and take its place
in the medical community.

610
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,714
They set me on Rossum's trail,
and when I discovered the real truth,

611
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,133
they put a bomb in my car.

612
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,389
The car Cindy took
to stop by the family compound.

613
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:40,609
My wife was a victim.

614
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,861
There have been hundreds of others.

615
00:38:44,244 --> 00:38:46,890
This woman, Madeline Costley,
is a victim...

616
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:50,077
of their manipulation
and her own delusions.

617
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,411
What?

618
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,569
There is no Dollhouse.

619
00:38:55,306 --> 00:38:59,253
There are no sex slaves,
no underground fortresses.

620
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:02,965
Madeline Costley spent the last 3 years
in a mental institution in Canada.

621
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:08,411
- You know I was there.
- I have the documentation to prove it.

622
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:12,523
In fact, I have documentation
on all the companies involved in this...

623
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,100
travesty.

624
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:16,770
There is abuse here.

625
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:19,022
Not the lurid, pulp fantasy

626
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:21,497
they drilled
into this unstable mind,

627
00:39:23,223 --> 00:39:26,373
but something more insidious,

628
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:31,118
something that has cost this country
more than millions,

629
00:39:31,565 --> 00:39:33,078
and has cost me...

630
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,293
... everything.

631
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:50,220
This hearing is adjourned
until further notice.

632
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:07,504
These men are from the FBI.
They need to speak with you.

633
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:16,934
No. Echo's just gone.

634
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:19,306
And we're certain she wasn't
apprehended with Perrin?

635
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:21,616
My sources say no.
They don't have her.

636
00:40:21,741 --> 00:40:24,001
- And Mr. Ballard?
- Still no word.

637
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:30,278
Are we sure
this is such a great idea?

638
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:32,909
I am sensing tension...

639
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:34,639
of the palpable sort.

640
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:35,849
Just lie back.

641
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,392
Finding him obstinate, are we?

642
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:41,573
- This is so weird.
- This is so weird.

643
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,150
Seriously, just a few more days.

644
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:47,235
I could help analyzing
Perrin's brain map.

645
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:50,489
It wouldn't be a second opinion.
It would be the same opinion twice.

646
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,691
There's more to analyze?
I thought we knew his function.

647
00:40:53,816 --> 00:40:55,635
To inoculate Rossum
against further scrutiny.

648
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,742
More than that.

649
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:59,820
He's talking about new regulation,
which, inevitably, he'll oversee.

650
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:01,625
Rossum will be creating
their own laws.

651
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,478
Ah, good throw, Boyd,

652
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,255
but still doesn't win you
the giant stuffed panda.

653
00:41:09,797 --> 00:41:11,343
It looks like Bennett somehow

654
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:13,553
rigged his SNS
into his higher functions.

655
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:15,514
- Meaning?
- Let's just say...

656
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:18,100
It's an awful lot of ambition
for a junior senator.

657
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,980
I was going to say that.

658
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,782
- Did I fall asleep?
- For a little while.

659
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:34,950
Shall I go now?

660
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,743
For the love of God, yes.

661
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,937
So, what are you saying?
They're manufacturing a president?

662
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,877
- Wouldn't be the first time.
- Delightful.

663
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,172
Well, before the fascist takeover,
we need to find Echo.

664
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,708
She's lost in the world in Doll-state,
utterly helpless.

665
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:55,262
I want every resource
engaged in her recovery.

666
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,388
And Madeline?

667
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:57,537
Poor girl.

668
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:00,475
I'm afraid there's nothing more
we can do.

669
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,060
You don't have to be afraid.

670
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:05,699
I know how you feel.

671
00:42:07,393 --> 00:42:10,297
I know what it's like
to be betrayed.

672
00:42:11,948 --> 00:42:13,248
To be abandoned.

673
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:18,866
She's out there.

674
00:42:20,978 --> 00:42:23,011
They're all out there,

675
00:42:23,681 --> 00:42:25,281
and we're left behind.

676
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:28,989
Alone.

677
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:42,119
No one should be alone.
