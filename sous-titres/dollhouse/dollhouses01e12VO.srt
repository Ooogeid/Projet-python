1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,925
<i>Previously on</i> Dollhouse...

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,381
You programmed one of your Dolls
to be Jack the Ripper?

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,869
All I know is that Alpha
accessed multiple imprints.

4
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:11,844
And one of them did this,

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,930
slaughtered everyone around your girl
before pulling a smoke-and-mirrors.

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,933
- They won't wake up.
- I have a message for you.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,811
- That's not funny.
- They use this body to spy on you.

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,649
I know how to find the Dollhouse,
and you know how to get in.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,316
- Where are we?
- We are under the skin

10
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:29,235
of the mighty beast.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,011
Did you really think you could just
walk into the Dollhouse?

12
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:37,515
When everyone knows
it doesn't exist?

13
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,289
Well, you kept my gift.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,997
Turns out different every time.

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,846
Victor's, for example.

16
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,199
- My prince.
- I told you I'd come rescue you.

17
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,426
Help! I need help in here!

18
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:57,850
Victor...
He... attacked Victor.

19
00:00:58,062 --> 00:00:58,937
Alpha.

20
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:00,862
We need EMT response. Now!

21
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,537
He had a scalpel.

22
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,689
He cut...

23
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,900
Exits have been secured.
But I think the horse has left the barn.

24
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,379
Motorpool's reporting a dumped van
about two blocks from here.

25
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,815
Full lockdown. I want a complete
head count... Actives and staff.

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,940
Go and help Victor.
Quickly!

27
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,480
He came for Echo.

28
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:23,355
He took her.

29
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:24,693
There was an imprint.

30
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,118
I don't know what.
He somehow buried the signature.

31
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:28,587
We can find them both

32
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,380
because she's tagged.

33
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,104
Not anymore.

34
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,392
Her GPS strip... dug it out of her,

35
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:39,136
and he went into the system
and severed the bio-links.

36
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:40,911
I can't see her vitals.

37
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,227
She's just... gone.

38
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:45,572
I want to know
what he's imprinted her with.

39
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,574
- I'm looking.
- Keep looking.

40
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:53,314
He asked me if I always
wanted to be a doctor.

41
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:01,871
Who can fathom the mind
of a crazy person?

42
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:04,926
The one who made him crazy?

43
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,266
Maybe.

44
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,259
How do you like your new togs, baby?

45
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,872
Oh! I love them.

46
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:18,143
Thank you.

47
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:24,977
- It still stings.
- I had to get it out.

48
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:26,854
You trust me, don't you?

49
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:29,398
You know I do.

50
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,617
Yeah, I do.

51
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,797
We've been through
a lot together, haven't we?

52
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:38,032
Ever since you took me out
of that first place when I was 13.

53
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,572
13. Already a woman.

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,204
That's what you said.

55
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,914
I remember.
But it never happened.

56
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,824
Did you tell her that?
Shut up.

57
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,151
Baby?

58
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:50,628
I didn't know you when you were 13.

59
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:52,880
None us did. One of us did.
One of us did.

60
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,791
I'm not Bobby.

61
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,116
What do you mean you're not Bobby?

62
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:01,756
I mean...

63
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:04,057
I'm not just Bobby.

64
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,227
Bobby...

65
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:08,829
my Tasty Couture printed T...
she left it out of the bags.

66
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:12,497
You got enough there for now,
don't you?

67
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,069
We can't go back.

68
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:19,856
You left out my Tasty Couture.

69
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:24,525
I looked really cute in that shirt, too,
you stupid bitch.

00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:04,282


73
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:06,980
<i>Ms. Alvarez, Mr. Blevins,
am I to understand you've lost both</i>

74
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,948
<i>your Actives and our client?</i>

75
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:11,876
- Yes, Ms. DeWitt.
- Alvarez's girl is a bad influence

76
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,378
on my guy, Ms. DeWitt.
I don't know why we insisted on Parent.

77
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,798
There is no "we"
in this equation, Mr. Blevins.

78
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,384
It is not your concern which Active
is selected for which engagement.

79
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:23,489
Your only task is discreetly
to observe the proceedings.

80
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:24,972
<i>And we were, but...</i>

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,965
- Alpha knew he was being followed.
- I made it very clear

82
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,852
these imprints were
prone to paranoia.

83
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:33,388
- I flagged it in the paperwork.
- Just as a point of interest,

84
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,649
how potentially lethal would you say
these imprints are?

85
00:04:49,577 --> 00:04:50,627
Okay, Lars.

86
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:53,768
Who are you working with?

87
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:55,829
Nobody.

88
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,131
I'm not working with anybody.

89
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,506
Who was in the vans?

90
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:06,048
Vans?

91
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:08,542
I didn't see any vans.

92
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,694
- Did you see vans?
- Lars...

93
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,760
It's sad... It's sad how you lie.
I can smell it.

94
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,438
You think that I have survived
this long on the run

95
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,414
without being able to tell
who's lying to me?

96
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,523
And who's not?

97
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,273
You're hiding something.

98
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,750
I can see it in your eyes.

99
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,218
I will cut it out.

100
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:47,869
It's complicated.
It's complicated.

101
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:49,956
Right.

102
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:55,391
Make it simple.

103
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,272
You're...

104
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:01,193
you're not real.

105
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,446
What?

106
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,796
You and your girlfriend...

107
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,631
- What did you say about my girlfriend?
- You're not real!

108
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:14,640
Either one of you...

109
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:20,663
you think you're on
a cross-country crime spree.

110
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:24,753
You're not.
You think you have a doomed love.

111
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:28,222
It's not doomed.
It's not even love.

112
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,083
I paid for this.

113
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:35,898
It was supposed to be my fantasy.

114
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,927
Look, I just wanted
to have a little fun.

115
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,567
A little fun?

116
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:46,028
You wanted to have a little fun?
Well, are you?

117
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:47,953
Are you having fun, Lars?

118
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:58,519
She's real.

119
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,880
And it's the last real thing
you're ever gonna see.

120
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:04,923
Crystal.

121
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:10,073
Yeah, baby?

122
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:19,271
I've got a lock.
San Pedro, industrial road 7-18.

123
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:21,148
We're close.

124
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,358
Whiskey, would you like a treatment?

125
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:10,648
Yes, please.

126
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:14,235
Treatment.

127
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,926
Yeah, let's do that instead.

128
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,851
Let's go to the van, okay?

129
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:21,429
Thanks for the ride.

130
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,551
Where's Kepler?

131
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:34,538
Don't tell me that hypochondriac
gave you the slip.

132
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:38,957
Leave us.

133
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:41,478
This man...

134
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:43,961
the man you brought here tonight...

135
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,568
was, until last year,
one of our Actives.

136
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:51,394
Designation Alpha.

137
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,901
You're telling me Kepler's a Doll?

138
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:59,245
Not at all. Stephen Kepler,
the real Stephen Kepler,

139
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:00,683
is a corpse.

140
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,333
His body was identified
this afternoon by Arizona authorities.

141
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,128
And these bodies,
you've programmed to massacre?

142
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:08,044
The Alpha situation

143
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:10,716
was an unfortunate
technological anomaly.

144
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:13,888
A technological anomaly?

145
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,579
My God.
What have you people done?

146
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:20,659
What have you done?

147
00:09:21,572 --> 00:09:23,854
You have brought this thing
back into my house

148
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,878
to defile it a second time.

149
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,439
And now...

150
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:29,776
he's taken Echo.

151
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,155
Caroline.

152
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,376
I thought that might wipe the smirk
off your face.

153
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:41,502
- I'm walking out of here now.
- Out of the question.

154
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,540
He broke out of here... Alpha...

155
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,764
and so will I.

156
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:46,501
Alpha's a genius.

157
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,944
None of the follow teams
has even left the garage yet.

158
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,255
Building's locked down.

159
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:53,087
Someone called in
a terrorist threat.

160
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,179
He's laughing at us.

161
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:04,811
I can make this go away.

162
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,317
Set up a perimeter.
Let me know when it's time.

163
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,991
Ballard?

164
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:24,115
Graham, thank God it's you.

165
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:26,416
And not someone who can stand you?

166
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,484
Keep your eyes on me. Nod.
They're watching us.

167
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:33,423
Do you trust him?

168
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,634
I trust that I know what he wants.

169
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,805
- Listen, there's no bomb.
- What?

170
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,623
The tip was bogus,

171
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:44,184
but the Dollhouse is real.

172
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,990
- The Dollhouse?
- It's right under your feet.

173
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:50,148
A self-contained facility
built entirely underground.

174
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,276
I've seen it.
I can take you there.

175
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,995
Everybody, back in the trucks!

176
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,175
False alarm.

177
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:04,985
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

178
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:08,000
A bogus bomb threat, Ballard?

179
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,868
What, suspension wasn't enough for you?
You wanna go to prison?

180
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,605
Don't make me change my mind.

181
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:25,245
Hi.

182
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,390
I have news.

183
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,530
Have you identified
the latent imprints?

184
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,462
Not yet. I was going to inventory
all of Echo's old imprints to see

185
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,237
if maybe the signatures

186
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,565
matched any residual noise.
And anyway...

187
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:40,907
they're not there.

188
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,480
- I beg your pardon.
- They're gone.

189
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:46,105
Every wedge. Primary and backup.

190
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:50,792
Every personality we've ever imprinted
on Echo... They're gone.

191
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,910
Why would he take the wedges?

192
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,395
What good would they be to him?

193
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:09,295
Welcome to your castle, my princess.

194
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:10,955
Behold.

195
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:12,785
Your throne.

196
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:19,155
Say, you got a bathroom?

197
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:29,295
- It hurts.
- I know it does.

198
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,615
It won't always.

199
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,425
I'm not my best anymore.

200
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,455
I want to be my best.

201
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,005
I know you do.

202
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:47,724
How can I be my best now?

203
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:52,745
Dr. Saunders.

204
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:57,745
- How can I be my best, please?
- You can't, Victor.

205
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,325
You can't be your best.

206
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,265
Your best is past.

207
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:08,395
Your past...
You can't even remember.

208
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,705
You're ugly now.

209
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,825
You're disgusting.

210
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,545
All you can hope for now is pity,

211
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:20,285
and for that,

212
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:23,385
you're gonna have to look
somewhere else.

213
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,471
Dr. Saunders.

214
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:28,495
Dr. Saunders.

215
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:30,145
Hello.

216
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:31,825
Whiskey.

217
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,909
- What do we have here?
- She came back from the engagement

218
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,314
with some shoulder pain.

219
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:38,817
Have one of these,

220
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,085
and sit right down here
and I'll see what I can do.

221
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,545
You're overworked, dear.

222
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,260
You're too popular
for your own good.

223
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:51,635
I keep recommending a week of rest.

224
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,073
Our #1 Active?

225
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,564
Boss lady will never
let her lie fallow.

226
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:58,575
- I try to be my best.
- I'm sure you do.

227
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,798
<i>We have an intake.
All available handlers to the floor.</i>

228
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,366
- You got this?
- Yeah.

229
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:06,595
Sounds like you're gonna have
another friend.

230
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:08,535
Friends are nice.

231
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:10,905
They sure are.

232
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:12,385
Impressive, no?

233
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:20,705
This is where you'll spend the majority
of your non-engagement time.

234
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:26,275
When does the hankering
for tasty brains kick in?

235
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:28,885
These people are zombies.

236
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,825
We call them Actives.

237
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,145
You'll be served
five-star cuisine here,

238
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,705
and you'll never want for anything.

239
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,225
This isn't the end of your life.

240
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:46,595
Then why do I feel
like I'm walking to the gallows?

241
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,525
It's five years,

242
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:50,957
and to you,

243
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:52,933
it could feel like an instant.

244
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,385
She is sad.

245
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,565
Dr. Saunders is nice.

246
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:22,605
So this is it.

247
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,631
This is where you steal their souls.

248
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:29,205
And then we put 'em in a glass jar
with our fireflies.

249
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:34,249
Why is there a morally, judgmental man
in my imprint room besides him?

250
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,064
Special Agent Ballard
is going to lend us

251
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:39,354
his inestimable
crime-solving abilities.

252
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:41,415
Cool.

253
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:45,720
Say, maybe he can start
with finding the guy who Tasered me.

254
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,071
Pretty sure he led Alpha
right in here.

255
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,170
He can help.

256
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:52,255
We need to work together if there's
any hope of finding and stopping Alpha.

257
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,164
You know that better than anyone.

258
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,837
You will assist Special Agent Ballard
with his profile.

259
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:01,305
All hands on deck.
Do I make myself clear?

260
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:03,565
Good day.

261
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:05,985
We're ready for our treatments.

262
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:09,365
- Who the hell is this?
- Couple more decades.

263
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:10,785
I'll take...

264
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:12,725
Sierra first.

265
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:19,805
Hello.

266
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,635
What is this thing anyway?

267
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:30,890
And what are we gonna do to her?

268
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,815
Everything, nothing.
Not to her. She won't...

269
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,335
be her.

270
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:39,335
We won't be needing this,
will we, honey?

271
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,960
Wendy is going away.

272
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,345
She won't be here in a minute.

273
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:48,815
Wait, what, it's like a magic trick?

274
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,030
- We're gonna make her disappear?
- We're gonna stick her in a wedge.

275
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,512
We're gonna wedge her.

276
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,235
I don't get it.

277
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,075
Of course you don't.

278
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:05,215
How could you?

279
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:07,335
The mind...

280
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,910
you have been given
is so tiny, so primitive,

281
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:14,449
that it is incredible you can perform
basic motor functions or form words.

282
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:16,815
Screw you, Bobby.

283
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,495
Don't listen to him.

284
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:22,207
You're perfect.

285
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:26,044
I needed you just like this,
just like this, not afraid of anything,

286
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,162
so we could get out
of that place, make it here.

287
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:30,715
And you were great.

288
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:32,355
Jacking that car,

289
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:34,795
getting that girl.

290
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:36,930
You were perfect.

291
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,015
I was.

292
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,305
You're always perfect.

293
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,122
Hello, Echo.

294
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:04,695
Hello, Alpha. Good...

295
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:06,925
day.

296
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:09,254
- I'm going to yoga.
- I like you.

297
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,089
You're special.

298
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,174
I try to be my best.

299
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,692
You are the best.

300
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:22,660
Topher'd like to see you
for a treatment.

301
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,985
I enjoy my treatments.
Thank you.

302
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:27,315
Go on ahead. I'll catch up.

303
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:35,115
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hell.

304
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:38,475
- I don't understand "hell".
- It's what you would have caught

305
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,494
if it had been Dewitt coming
around that corner instead of me.

306
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,680
You'd be on your way
to the Attic by now.

307
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:45,373
Just watch your step.

308
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:47,555
I'll do that.

309
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,782
Topher says it's like childbirth.

310
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,035
I think it's more
like watching someone die.

311
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:29,793
Well, someone's gonna die if my partner
doesn't get her ass out here.

312
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:31,711
Trail's going cold.

313
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:36,555
But you're not cold.
Are you, handsome?

314
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:38,465
What's your story?

315
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:40,929
Wait. Don't tell me.

316
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:44,285
You got multiple contracts
on this job?

317
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:46,925
That's okay.

318
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:49,545
I like a little stiff competition.

319
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:53,191
But when it turns out you're not the one
who collects the bounty,

320
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,785
promise you'll hold it against me.

321
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:02,800
If you're done molesting the furniture,
can we get these guys?

322
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,175
Well, you're still in your pajamas.

323
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:12,795
She's not screaming anymore.

324
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:16,756
She's screaming.

325
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:20,885
They're all screaming.
Must you always defend...

326
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,470
Why can't you ever take my side?

327
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,347
I didn't say nothing.

328
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,578
You always say nothing.

329
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:31,134
There she is.

330
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:33,911
Listen.

331
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:38,069
- Am I supposed to hear something?
- Not yet.

332
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,074
Bobby, you're scaring me.

333
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:46,586
Little lamb...

334
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,642
what have you got to be afraid of?

335
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,341
I'll tell you what.

336
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,377
There's only one person
that can hurt you now,

337
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,546
just one...

338
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,007
and that's what we're here
to take care of.

339
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:07,017
Who was he after
the day it happened...

340
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:11,269
the day of your unfortunate
technological anomaly?

341
00:21:11,614 --> 00:21:14,077
He wasn't after anybody.

342
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:16,858
It was a random killing spree.

343
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,745
- You're wrong.
- Look...

344
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:21,152
you can't profile Alpha.

345
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:22,593
He's not a person.

346
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:23,718
He's...

347
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,421
he's like Soylent Green.

348
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,619
He's people.

349
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:31,389
He experienced a composite event...

350
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:34,886
48 personalities,
not split personalities.

351
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:37,827
Full, total, complete personalities

352
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:40,737
got dumped
into his coconut all at once.

353
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:43,517
- He snapped.
- I believe he snapped.

354
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:44,977
Who did he target?

355
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:47,119
Who did he go after first?

356
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:50,766
His handler.

357
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:54,887
Half my staff.

358
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:57,148
Then Dr. Saunders walked in.

359
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:00,735
- The woman with the scars?
- This is a waste of time.

360
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,988
In a mass killing, the first victims
will often be whoever's in the way.

361
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:07,400
Who was the first individual
that Alpha went for

362
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,327
the moment he had a choice?

363
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,167
Himself.

364
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:21,187
The first individual?

365
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:24,851
He came over here to the self shelf.

366
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:28,350
It's where I keep my primaries stored.
It's the original personalities

367
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:31,891
that the volunteers
first walk in with.

368
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:36,587
He took his original self...

369
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,357
and he smashed the hell out of it.

370
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,885
And you said this time
he took all of Caroline's imprints...

371
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,456
the ones you created?

372
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,739
Where's her original self?

373
00:23:01,688 --> 00:23:03,423
You have a backup, right?

374
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:05,967
This was the backup.

375
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:08,970
Where's the original?

376
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,482
Hello, Caroline.

377
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,514
Has it been five years?

378
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:36,789
What is this?

379
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:39,624
What am I doing sitting here

380
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:41,711
and standing over there?

381
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:43,246
Baby...

382
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:45,631
meet yourself.

383
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,136
Oh, God, the wrongness
of this is so large.

384
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,470
Whose body is this?

385
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:52,135
It's just a body.

386
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,798
They're all pretty much the same.

387
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:56,851
I think this one wet itself.

388
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,270
What did you mean "meet myself"?

389
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,631
This whining, pathetic creature,

390
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:04,567
this self-hating human...

391
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:06,195
that was you.

392
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:09,989
- What?
- She's responsible

393
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,700
for all of the terrible things
you can't remember.

394
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:15,244
- My brain hurts.
- How do you think my brain...

395
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:16,746
That is my brain.

396
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:18,569
I want my brain back.

397
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:20,166
I want back in my brain.

398
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,751
You should have thought of that
before you vacated the premises.

399
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,129
- I don't even know this girl.
- Do you know why?

400
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:29,100
- 'Cause we never met?
- Because she abandoned you.

401
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:32,964
She walked out on you
when you needed her most.

402
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,694
Time's got a little tough.

403
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,137
The road got a little rocky,
seas got a little choppy,

404
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:39,435
and she thought...

405
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:43,434
"I'll go to sleep.

406
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,142
"Night-night.

407
00:24:45,914 --> 00:24:48,611
"See you in five years."

408
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,694
She left you

409
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:54,132
to the jackals, to the wolves.

410
00:24:55,246 --> 00:24:56,552
To the predators.

411
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:59,288
Isn't that right, Caroline?

412
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:03,709
She said
that I would be taken care off,

413
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:05,893
and that I would be safe.

414
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,043
Do you feel safe?

415
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,968
Do you?
You feel safe?

416
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,772
Safe, do you feel?

417
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:18,891
What do you feel?

418
00:25:19,462 --> 00:25:20,309
Confused.

419
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:21,917
I'm with her.

420
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:23,970
You <i>are</i> her.

421
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:26,804
But you don't have to be.

422
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:29,339
You can ascend.

423
00:25:29,882 --> 00:25:30,994
You can evolve.

424
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,655
It's in you. I've seen it.

425
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,502
And I can help you, baby,

426
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:37,743
just like I always have.

427
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:40,992
She was never there
when you needed her.

428
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,541
But I was.

429
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:04,606
I like trees.

430
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,984
Someone's getting a treatment.

431
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,486
Whiskey, would you like a treatment?

432
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,679
- Yes, please.
- All right.

433
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:18,180
Tidy your station, and then
you may go with Sophie, Whiskey.

434
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:21,943
That girl keeps getting sent out.

435
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:24,944
- She's never gonna finish the tree.
- And it's a small tree.

436
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:26,274
That's my girl.

437
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:27,693
What can I say?

438
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,730
Most requested Doll in the house.

439
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,959
- #1.
- Really?

440
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:33,816
Whiskey?

441
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:36,772
Let Echo be #1.

442
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:08,971
How?

443
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:11,900
- How did this happen?
- I don't know. I don't know.

444
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:15,564
Some residual memory, inactive neurons
from a previous engagement.

445
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:18,378
All I can do is run
a full-range diagnostic.

446
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,006
I'm bringing up every
last one of his prior builds,

447
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:22,390
see if anything matches.

448
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:24,479
You don't leave this room
until it's done,

449
00:27:24,604 --> 00:27:27,561
and when you've finished,
send him to the Attic.

450
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,564
I don't understand.
Was I not my best?

451
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,234
I was making art.

452
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,361
Alpha, you need to settle, okay?

453
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:37,439
You need a treatment.

454
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,699
A treatment.

455
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:43,577
Please, I...
I need a treatment.

456
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,663
That's good.
That's good. He's good.

457
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:46,935
He's down. Thanks.

458
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,375
- I need a treatment.
- Yes, you do.

459
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,751
You surely do.

460
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,665
- I enjoy my treatments.
- Then you're gonna love this one.

461
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,597
It's kind of a greatest hits.

462
00:28:03,236 --> 00:28:04,919
I need some help.
Come here. Come here!

463
00:28:06,627 --> 00:28:08,227
- What have you got?
- He's frying!

464
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,857
You're gonna be okay.

465
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:24,035
Shut it down!
Shut it down!

466
00:28:27,063 --> 00:28:29,665
I understand hell now.

467
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,112
My God, Topher,
what the hell's going on here?

468
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:44,405
48 personalities,
each with its own rich history,

469
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,515
and none of it tells me anything.

470
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:48,205
Who's Alpha?

471
00:28:48,813 --> 00:28:50,061
Alpha is all of these.

472
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:53,802
That's what I keep saying.

473
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:55,501
And... And of course

474
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:57,622
it doesn't tell you anything.

475
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:59,327
It doesn't tell me anything,

476
00:28:59,452 --> 00:29:01,363
and I'm smarter
than everyone in this room.

477
00:29:02,689 --> 00:29:03,689
But less scary.

478
00:29:03,997 --> 00:29:06,225
I know you're all very invested
in your vaunted technology,

479
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,162
and it is very impressive,

480
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:10,539
but I still don't believe
you can wipe away a person's soul.

481
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:12,552
Their what?

482
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:14,248
Their soul.

483
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:15,920
Who they are at their core.

484
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,061
I don't think that goes away.

485
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:19,467
You'd be wrong about that.

486
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,864
I wanna know who Alpha was!

487
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,135
Who was he before in private life?

488
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,561
That is not relevant.

489
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:27,056
With all respect,

490
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:29,958
one of Alpha's first acts
after compositing

491
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,126
was to destroy his original self.

492
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:33,562
We should know who that was.

493
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,164
All right.

494
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:40,180
I still have about 19 personality builds
to reassemble

495
00:29:40,305 --> 00:29:43,155
so I can try and figure out
which of Echo's imprints

496
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,245
Alpha used on her, so...

497
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,725
good luck with the whole God thing.

498
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,526
Do not let him
do this to you, please.

499
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:56,251
You don't even know
what it is I'm doing.

500
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,105
It's not good.
I know that.

501
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:03,217
I've been in that chair.
It hurts.

502
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:04,898
Just for a minute.

503
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,771
- You won't remember.
- I remember.

504
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,224
It still smells
like burnt hair in here.

505
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:13,495
He's going to make me
a superior creature.

506
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:15,248
An ascended being.

507
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,566
Do you even know what that means?
Do you?

508
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:23,821
- So, you're not better than me.
- Look where you are.

509
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,990
You're in a lair, an evil lair.

510
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,868
You're sitting in some messed-up
dentist's chair letting a guy

511
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:32,786
who talks to himself attach
wires to your head, which, incidentally,

512
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:33,914
is my head.

513
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:35,194
Open.

514
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:36,963
Bite down.

515
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:38,511
Good.

516
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:41,673
Go ahead.

517
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:43,404
Keep talking.

518
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:45,384
I want you to.
We all do.

519
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,304
This is how it shall be.

520
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:49,948
She will ascend.

521
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:51,788
She will know.

522
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:53,893
And then she will kill you.

523
00:30:54,134 --> 00:30:55,130
What?!

524
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,312
- Why?
- Because...

525
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,103
that's what we need.
A blood ritual.

526
00:31:01,497 --> 00:31:03,319
Yes, yes,
we've got to have one of those.

527
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,612
I mean, the Aztecs knew it.

528
00:31:05,737 --> 00:31:08,787
The pre-Hellenic Minoans knew it,
for God's sakes.

529
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,994
From the moment man first clawed

530
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,954
his way out of the primordial ooze
and kicked off his fins,

531
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,274
he's understood
that the gods require blood.

532
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:22,421
New life from death.

533
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:26,050
The ancients had it right.

534
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:29,168
But the old gods are back.

535
00:31:30,593 --> 00:31:31,594
Alpha?

536
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,058
Meet Omega.

537
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:48,489
<i>No way!</i>

538
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:56,731
<i>Get out!</i>

539
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:18,269
God.

540
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:19,979
Gods.

541
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:22,931
I get it.

542
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:28,534
Now...

543
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,211
I get it.

544
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:34,249
I knew you would.

545
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:46,359
Now I understand everything.

546
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:52,396
Carl William Craft.

547
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,107
Three names... always ominous.

548
00:32:55,232 --> 00:32:59,206
When the Rossum Corporation first began
its investigations into neural science,

549
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,988
some of our recruits were furnished
by the Department of Corrections.

550
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:05,113
You experimented on prisoners?

551
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:08,419
We offered the opportunity
to trade lengthy prison sentences

552
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:10,561
for five-year terms of service
with us.

553
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:13,532
- What was he in for?
- Kidnapping, attempted murder.

554
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,619
- He never actually killed anybody yet.
- Not until he came here.

555
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:20,331
Based on what I'm reading, this man was
well on his way to becoming Ted Bundy.

556
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,849
You have no proof of that.

557
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:25,587
The only reason he didn't kill anybody
is because the victim got away.

558
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,839
When they finally picked up Craft,
they found a murder kit in his car.

559
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,008
- He was evolving.
- So, there's a living witness.

560
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:32,760
- You wanna drive?
- I can.

561
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,280
We're confused.

562
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:37,806
You hit me with a pipe.

563
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:41,018
Yeah? Call me Omega again,
and you'll get some more.

564
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:44,104
Something must have gone wrong
with the composite.

565
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:46,343
Nothing went wrong.

566
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:50,611
Every imprint this Active has ever had
is alive and awake in her head now.

567
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,072
Then why did you hit me in the head
with a pipe?!

568
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:54,911
It was handy?

569
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:57,951
And you wanted me to kill myself?!

570
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:01,288
I wanted you to kill her!

571
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:03,504
Her is me.

572
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,459
You made that very clear.

573
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,839
Her is the old you.
Try and keep up!

574
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,557
I'm way ahead of you.

575
00:34:13,182 --> 00:34:14,301
You think we're gods?

576
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,361
We're not just humans anymore.

577
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:23,986
We're not multiple personalities.
We're many personalities.

578
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:27,738
And one of my personalities
happens to be a multiple personality,

579
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:30,008
but that doesn't make me
a multiple personality.

580
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:33,237
- I'm looking for a little nuance here.
- We're not gods.

581
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,405
Fine!

582
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:35,973
Übermensch.

583
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,310
Nietzsche predicted our rise.

584
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:42,304
Perfected, objective,

585
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:44,539
something new.

586
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:45,749
Right.

587
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:49,060
New, superior people

588
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:51,455
with a little German thrown in.

589
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,382
What could possibly go wrong?

590
00:34:54,787 --> 00:34:55,987
We're not new.

591
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:58,265
We're not anything.

592
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,040
We're not anybody
because we're everybody.

593
00:35:04,497 --> 00:35:05,847
I mean, I get it.

594
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:08,681
I understand it.

595
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:12,684
I'm experiencing
like 38 of them right now.

596
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,270
But I somehow understand

597
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:19,441
that not one of them is me.

598
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,286
I can slip into one.

599
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:26,003
Actually, it slips into me.

600
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:30,373
They had to make room for it.

601
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:33,002
They hollowed me out.

602
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,199
There is no me.
I'm just...

603
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:38,217
a container.

604
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,878
There's a you.

605
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:42,343
She's right here.

606
00:35:44,723 --> 00:35:46,823
He may be crazy, but he's right.

607
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,855
You walked away from me.

608
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,025
You left me alone in that place.

609
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,027
Why did you do that?

610
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,700
It's complicated.

611
00:35:56,944 --> 00:35:58,155
Sweetheart,

612
00:35:58,694 --> 00:36:01,575
however complicated you thought
our life was before,

613
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:03,553
you cannot tell me...

614
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:10,661
How's that for a complication?

615
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,901
So, let me ask you something.
It's pretty obvious you're police.

616
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:20,058
How did you end up
working for these people?

617
00:36:20,183 --> 00:36:21,954
Could ask you the same question.

618
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,198
I'm not working for them.
I'm just trying to save the girl.

619
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,351
There's always a girl.

620
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:28,693
427.

621
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,537
Anita Walsh.

622
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:32,487
<i>Hello?</i>

623
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,839
<i>Hello?</i>

624
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:36,799
Miss Walsh?

625
00:36:37,534 --> 00:36:38,602
<i>Who's asking?</i>

626
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:40,531
Special Agent Paul Ballard, FBI.

627
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:43,117
I'm sorry. I know it's early,
but there's an urgent situation

628
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,000
you may be able to help us with.

629
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,080
We gotta ask you a few questions.

630
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,805
It's about Carl Craft.

631
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:52,042
<i>I don't have strangers in my home.</i>

632
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:56,255
<i>I'm just leaving for work.
I'll come down.</i>

633
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,882
You do realize what we're doing
to this woman?

634
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:02,118
Resurrecting a nightmare.

635
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:04,193
And maybe for no good reason.

636
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:07,140
Whoever Carl Craft was
may have nothing to do with who...

637
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:10,806
... Alpha is.

638
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:12,521
Agent Ballard.

639
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,357
How may I help you?

640
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:21,196
You don't know what you're doing.
What you're giving up!

641
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,292
Right. Why would I want to live
in a luxurious spa-like environment

642
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,868
when I could live here with you?

643
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:30,455
I thought you were different!

644
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:34,835
I thought you were exceptional.
I was wrong. You're weak.

645
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:42,222
I may not know who I am,
but at least I know who I'm not.

646
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:43,898
I'm not you're girlfriend.

647
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:47,975
You okay?

648
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:49,980
I kick ass.

649
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,117
Who are you?

650
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:56,641
I'm Echo.

651
00:37:57,353 --> 00:37:58,755
And who is that?

652
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:00,853
She's nobody.

653
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:04,990
I'm just the porch light,
waiting for you.

654
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:08,746
You have to put me back.

655
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,080
You have to put me back
in that wedge.

656
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:14,078
'Cause we need to get...

657
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:18,742
Wendy back in her body.

658
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,130
Why do you have to go back
in the wedge?

659
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:23,967
Why don't you come home?

660
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:27,505
I did sign a contract.

661
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,677
I have 38 brains.

662
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,231
Not one of them thinks
you can sign a contract to be a slave,

663
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,940
especially now that we have
a black president.

664
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,151
We have a black president?

665
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:45,197
I am missing everything.

666
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,610
Let's do this.

667
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:03,173
Now, do what I say...

668
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,969
or I will blow your brain out.

669
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:12,823
What's this? Background singer?
Background singer, ninja girl?

670
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:15,628
I don't know why Alpha would imprint her
as a background singer

671
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,051
unless he was starting an evil band.

672
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:20,308
Next.

673
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:24,987
- This is Topher.
- Topher. Question.

674
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,497
When Alpha was an Active,

675
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,865
did he ever have any engagements
that ended up in Pedro?

676
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:31,913
He had a lot of engagements, Boyd.
Can you be more specific?

677
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,777
When Alpha was a civilian,
he abducted a woman.

678
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:38,166
Kept her captive for three days
in some sort of defunct power plant.

679
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:41,164
<i>She escaped.
Cops picked her up on the highway.</i>

680
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:42,615
Get me Whiskey 1.1.

681
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,506
<i>Too traumatized to find her way
back there,</i>

682
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,341
but it was somewhere in San Pedro.

683
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,513
Actually... yes.

684
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,470
<i>There was one engagement.</i>

685
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,389
<i>He slipped his handler.
It was a double.</i>

686
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,257
He was with Whiskey 1.1.

687
00:39:54,455 --> 00:39:57,174
It took us a while to get a lock
on his location.

688
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:59,781
Wasn't a place we'd been before.
It was a bit off perimeter.

689
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:02,441
<i>It explains why you bounty-hunters
haven't turned up anything.</i>

690
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,902
<i>San Pedro. Industrial road 7-18.</i>

691
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,320
Thanks, Topher.

692
00:40:27,711 --> 00:40:29,342
He's using an old Whiskey imprint.

693
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:33,769
Get in the chair.

694
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:37,973
What are you gonna do?
Wipe me?

695
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:41,917
No, I'm gonna put her in you.

696
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:44,900
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

697
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,778
- Of course, then I'm gonna kill you!
- That's a little elaborate.

698
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,947
Then why don't you just shoot me
and the damn wedge?

699
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,989
I'm not gonna shoot the wedge.

700
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:55,961
I'm going to keep the wedge.
I'm going to use the wedge.

701
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,131
And I'm going to grab
Wendys and Beckys and Stacys

702
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,338
from all over this great nation,

703
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,126
and every one of them
will be a Caroline.

704
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,586
And every one one of them
will get carved up

705
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:07,267
and their throat cut

706
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,930
until I get bored.

707
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:11,119
So, get in the chair!

708
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,370
You like knives.

709
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:18,985
And scissors.

710
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:21,693
You like to cut things, don't you?

711
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:24,035
Whiskey.

712
00:41:24,705 --> 00:41:26,566
You cut up that poor girl
because of me.

713
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:29,027
For you. It was for you.

714
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,333
Save it!

715
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,322
Don't hand me any more of your crap

716
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,093
about you being
some superior ascended being.

717
00:41:35,218 --> 00:41:38,328
To ascend to anything, at minimum,
you don't cut up women!

718
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,119
- Lay back in the chair.
- You lay back in the chair.

719
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:44,292
I'm done laying back in the chair!
I'm ready to rinse and spit.

720
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:48,130
I will shoot it.
I will blast the wedge!

721
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,007
So blast it. What's stopping you,
Edward Scissor Pud?

722
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,717
I'm not fooling.
He's not kidding!

723
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,525
We're not bluffing.

724
00:41:54,693 --> 00:41:55,850
I'm bluffing.

725
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:58,140
But the rest of us...
we mean business.

726
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,249
I said shoot it!
I don't care.

727
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:02,740
Yeah? Well, maybe she will.

728
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,187
She won't know.

729
00:42:04,411 --> 00:42:05,411
She's me.

730
00:42:06,453 --> 00:42:08,150
And we're both coming to get ya.

731
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:51,288
Wanna bet it's stolen?

732
00:43:14,764 --> 00:43:15,964
He's up there.

733
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:25,977
- Caroline's up there!
- I see.

734
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,611
You wanna save the girl?

735
00:43:37,507 --> 00:43:38,448
Go get her.

736
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:23,493
You saved her.

737
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:33,962
Dr. Saunders?

738
00:44:35,448 --> 00:44:37,324
I think you gave me
more computer skills

739
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:39,676
than would be required
by a medical doctor.

740
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,096
It was very easy for me
to hack your system.

741
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,690
I'm curious.

742
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,705
About?

743
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:57,377
I guess I understand

744
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,890
why they wouldn't
wanna waste an investment.

745
00:45:01,957 --> 00:45:04,313
And I suppose,
why hire a new physician

746
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:07,620
when you can just...
imprint the broken Doll.

747
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:13,251
But why did you decide
it was so important for me to hate you?

748
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:19,578
I think that's strange.

749
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:23,345
You didn't open it.

750
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:28,725
Aren't you curious to see
who you really are?

751
00:45:32,957 --> 00:45:34,257
I know who I am.

752
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,621
So he continues to elude us.

753
00:45:49,824 --> 00:45:50,746
He does.

754
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:54,084
And the poor child at the warehouse?

755
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:57,212
An anonymous source
is providing generously for her family.

756
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,830
It's cold comfort.

757
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:02,938
We'll find him.

758
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,553
I have confidence now.

759
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,749
Our new contractor...

760
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:10,902
has the skills to inspire it.

761
00:46:11,651 --> 00:46:14,354
I don't work for you yet.
Remember our deal.

762
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:16,689
The young lady's freedom
has been granted.

763
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,382
- With full payment on her contract.
- Of course.

764
00:46:25,322 --> 00:46:26,533
Send her in.

765
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,094
Come in, my dear.

766
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:33,540
I just have a few things
for you to sign.

767
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:38,169
And then our business
will be completed.

768
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,591
Thank you.

769
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:59,091
Did I fall asleep?

770
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:02,026
For a little while.

771
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:05,834
Okay, you can go now.

772
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:07,264
Thank you.

773
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:13,997
It was so easy.

774
00:47:14,696 --> 00:47:17,709
- I feel like I just got here.
- Of course.

775
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:23,909
Thanks again.

776
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:25,764
Good-bye.

777
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:34,140
Excuse me.

778
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,890
Shall I go now?

779
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:55,859
If you like.

780
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:06,279
I don't think I got your name.

781
00:48:07,015 --> 00:48:09,177
Madeline.
Madeline Costley.

782
00:48:11,865 --> 00:48:13,389
That's a lovely name.

783
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:38,355
And you are?

784
00:48:40,048 --> 00:48:41,251
I'm nobody.

785
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:25,239
Caroline.
