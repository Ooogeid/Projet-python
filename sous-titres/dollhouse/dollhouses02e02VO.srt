1
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,669
Would you like a treatment?

2
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:51,467
I was just...

3
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,302
sitting because I'm...

4
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:54,643
tired.

5
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:57,175
Life of a handler
is pretty exhausting.

6
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,257
Better you than me.

7
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:02,256
- You just off shift?
- For a few hours.

8
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,064
Can't really seem to sleep, though.

9
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:08,584
- It's hard to imagine Echo being...
- Did you touch this?

10
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:10,511
I didn't...

11
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:12,196
It's not a toy, Ballard.

12
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,865
Leave the tech to the grown-ups.

13
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,700
So, Echo...

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,163
- it's good, right?
- It's different.

15
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,203
Not the romance,

16
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:26,001
- the other protocol.
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

17
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:28,668
I kind of blew my own mind
this time.

18
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:32,372
One special client request,
one minor change

19
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,009
to Echo's bodily functions,

20
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:35,343
and I just opened up

21
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,278
a whole new world for us.

22
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,968
It's all still new to me.

23
00:01:41,054 --> 00:01:42,435
Yeah, but this...

24
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,502
I made code for the brain...

25
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,358
that changed the physical body.

26
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,152
And I'm not talking about...

27
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:53,811
muscle memory so somebody can...

28
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:55,521
play fancy piano.

29
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:58,915
I made changes on a glandular level.

30
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,997
Do you have any idea
what this could mean?

31
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:04,319
Explain it to me.

32
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,012
Arguably,

33
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:09,251
one could program the brain to...

34
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:11,964
fight cancer.

35
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,658
Or be telekinetic.

36
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:18,219
Or not have that gag reflex
when you eat sea urchin.

37
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,555
Or whatever.

38
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,679
The possibilities
are pretty much endless

39
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:24,309
is what I'm saying.

40
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:28,089
I don't want to use
the word "genius",

41
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,775
but I'd be okay if you wanted to.

42
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:34,432
So you could do all that to me
with this chair?

43
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:36,207
Not you.
To an Active.

44
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:39,309
I can't fiddle with a mind
until it's wiped clean.

45
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:41,058
The human mind is like Van Halen.

46
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:43,232
If you just pull out one piece
and keep replacing it,

47
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:44,734
it just degenerates.

48
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:47,708
I don't understand.

49
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,235
But it's so cute that you're trying.

50
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:55,966
Good talk!

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,350
Say hi to Echo for me.

52
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:04,642
Tell her we're all very proud.

53
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,036
I thought I heard you.

54
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,399
Don't wake Daddy.

55
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,260
There, you...

56
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:36,335
<i>Hush, little baby,
don't say a word</i>

57
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,904
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird</i>

58
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:43,871
<i>And if that mockingbird don't sing</i>

59
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:47,660
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring.</i>

60
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,256
Episode 202: <i>Instinct</i>
v. 1.00

61
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:17,733
www.subbercafe.fr

62
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:41,215
Okay, little man.

63
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,550
Mommy needs
to mainline some caffeine.

64
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,551
So you just chill there for one sec.

65
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,476
Babe, you want coffee?

66
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,317
Nate, you in there?

67
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,118
Good morning.
You're up early.

68
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,836
Everything all right?

69
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:14,456
Yeah, it's fine. I'm good.

70
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:16,750
Okay. I said good morning.

71
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,882
Jack and I were gonna go
to the park today and feed the duckies.

72
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,884
That sounds fun.
You guys should do that.

73
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:28,052
You could play hooky and join us.

74
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,472
Yeah... I don't think so.

75
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:33,434
Could you grab him
while I finish the coffee?

76
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,247
I don't...

77
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:41,775
Here, you're not gonna break him.

78
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,528
He's not gonna bite you
or spontaneously combust.

79
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:47,531
You've got a master's degree in finance.
This should be a piece of cake.

80
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,599
Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't...

81
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:53,234
You know...

82
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:56,331
I'm gonna be late for work.

83
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,550
Nate, wait.

84
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:04,779
- Will you be home for dinner?
- Nah, I've got that Prentiss thing.

85
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,340
You shouldn't wait up. Bye.

86
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:22,843
Then he was supposed to take Jack
for a play date with the neighbors,

87
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:25,968
and at the last minute,
he's got another meeting as usual.

88
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:28,717
Nate's a workaholic, Em.
He's always been that way.

89
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,219
It's more than that.

90
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:31,957
It's like I hand him the baby,

91
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:34,454
and he acts like I've handed
him a live grenade.

92
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,205
Well, men are all wusses.

93
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:39,097
He's the one who pushed
having kids right away.

94
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,259
I wanted to wait a couple of years.

95
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,600
Tell him he has help out.
You can't raise this baby alone.

96
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:45,745
He helps.

97
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,573
Changes the diapers,
shops, does the laundry.

98
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:50,146
He's even read all the books.

99
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,171
Okay, now I just wanna swap.

100
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:56,725
I can't believe
how much I love this little boy.

101
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,687
And I don't even know
if Nate likes him.

102
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:03,877
Or me, for that matter.

103
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,859
Nate's crazy about you.

104
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,031
I think he's having an affair.

105
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,495
When was the last time
you had a full night's sleep?

106
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,749
- I don't even remember.
- You're exhausted.

107
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,669
Your hormones
are all over the place.

108
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,211
This isn't hormones.

109
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,878
He's never home.

110
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,339
He works all day,

111
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,232
and almost every night
he's got dinner or drinks.

112
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:33,152
And then when he is home,
he's always taking phone calls outside

113
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:36,265
- so I don't hear what he's saying.
- That doesn't mean affair.

114
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,800
Then maybe he's doing
something illegal.

115
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:39,643
What?

116
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,925
- Why would you think that?
- I've noticed this black van

117
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,300
parked outside the house every day.

118
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:47,276
We're being watched.

119
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:49,569
No one is watching you, Emily.

120
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,865
You're sleep-deprived,
and it's making you a little nuts.

121
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:54,492
Look,

122
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,287
some guys take a little longer
to get used to the idea of being a dad.

123
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:01,206
- But it gets better.
- You sure?

124
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:02,694
I'm positive.

125
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:06,253
Besides, Nate isn't the type
to sleep around.

126
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:09,756
What you need is a night
of uninterrupted sleep.

127
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,676
Make Nate take the baby tonight.
Have a glass of wine,

128
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,795
put some earplugs in,
and give yourself a break.

129
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:18,849
Things will work out, I promise.

130
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,394
I'm so lucky to have you
in my life, Kelly.

131
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,645
I'd go completely crazy without you.

132
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,315
That's what I'm here for.

133
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:29,811
And you're right.

134
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,809
I'm not obsessing
about this anymore.

135
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,812
I'm just gonna give Nate his space,

136
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:36,137
and let him figure it out himself.

137
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,164
We're just gonna find out
what Daddy's up to, aren't we, baby boy?

138
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:43,874
Yes, we are!

139
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,103
And if he's got nothing to hide,

140
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:52,799
he won't mind if I go through
all his stuff, will he, baby boy?

141
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,967
No, he won't.

142
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,236
Hello?

143
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:14,315
Anybody home?

144
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,985
Emily? Are you here?

145
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:39,096
Geez.

146
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:41,181
- You...
- Who is she?

147
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,982
- Where's Jack?
- He's asleep in his room,

148
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,276
and you still haven't answered
my question.

149
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,783
Who the hell is she, Nate?

150
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:56,154
- How did you...? You're not supposed...
- I knew it.

151
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,824
- I knew you were having an affair.
- You went into my office.

152
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,410
- That's private, my private stuff.
- Private?

153
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,870
This is where we went on our honeymoon.
Tell me who she is!

154
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,705
I knew her before I knew you.

155
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,720
I was in love with her.

156
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:21,680
Son of a bitch.

157
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:23,685
But then she died.

158
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:29,313
And it was very painful...

159
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:31,445
for me.

160
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:34,663
And it took a long time for me
to get over it.

161
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:37,696
In some ways, I'll never be over it.

162
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:41,380
But I shouldn't have
kept that from you.

163
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:42,909
That was wrong. I'm sorry.

164
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:48,030
You should have told me.

165
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,155
I know.

166
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:50,709
You're right.

167
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:52,252
It was a mistake.

168
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:55,945
This is all a terrible mistake.

169
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,677
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,574
I shouldn't have gone
completely mental on you.

171
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,640
I should have talked to you
like a normal person.

172
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:08,985
I've just been so tired.

173
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,611
Why don't you go to bed?
Right now.

174
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:20,447
I'll take Jack tonight.
That's the least I can do.

175
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:23,395
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

176
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:28,325
Thank you.

177
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:36,862
Things will be better
in the morning.

178
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,135
This is a disaster.

179
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,198
Now you people promised me something
that you cannot deliver.

180
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,658
This is not working.

181
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:06,445
I am calling it off.

182
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:08,205
Get rid of her.

183
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,748
I'll get rid of the baby.

184
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:18,422
I think I might have made a mistake.

185
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,100
You think I jumped the gun?

186
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:22,300
- Which gun?
- The press conference.

187
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:26,270
I was hoping when we went public,
witnesses would come forward.

188
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:28,432
What about the man
with the tinfoil hat?

189
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:32,269
Didn't he say Rossum mailed
his liver to Saturn?

190
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,537
Right now, he's our star.

191
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:40,389
We have anecdotal evidence that Rossum
and the other big meds are performing

192
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:44,030
illegal medical procedures
and unlicensed experiments.

193
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,949
But that's all it is: anecdotal.

194
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,161
You have a source at the NSA?

195
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,997
Had. Like everyone else,
he's gone to ground.

196
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,124
Well, you have their financials.

197
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:59,495
That's a lot of unaccounted
cash transactions for medical research.

198
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:03,196
It wouldn't be hard to prove
money laundering.

199
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,107
This is nice.

200
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,349
Focus.

201
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,559
You're Foil-Hat Man's only hope.

202
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:19,441
Sit. I got it.

203
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,947
I'm not after money laundering.

204
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:28,245
Rossum crossed a line.

205
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:32,245
And they've gotta be leaning on people
to keep them quiet.

206
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:37,645
They've got the resources.

207
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:42,797
Cindy?

208
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:52,425
There was nobody there.

209
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,928
Good morning, Madeline.

210
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:07,555
May I come in?

211
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:12,805
Place looks lovely.

212
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:15,712
I stripped a lot of it
back to the original.

213
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:17,725
Work is good?

214
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,100
You know, I haven't worked a day
since I've been home.

215
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:24,760
- God bless you, my dear.
- I should feel guilty about that.

216
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:26,535
I really, really don't.

217
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,842
Absolutely not.

218
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:31,210
Do you know how many people
would kill to have this kind of freedom?

219
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:34,724
It's strange. I never thought
I'd be among the idle rich.

220
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,275
You should travel.

221
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,300
- You're allowed to leave the country.
- I don't think so.

222
00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:42,482
I've been away so long, part of me
just wants to stay close to home.

223
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,694
Is there a young man
keeping you close to home?

224
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,940
Maybe. I'm not sure.

225
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,614
I thought as much. Do tell.

226
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:57,107
Don't misunderstand,
it's nice to see you.

227
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,230
But I have this irrational fear
that if I say one wrong thing,

228
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:04,296
men in suits are going to throw me
in a black van and take me away.

229
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,172
Not at all.

230
00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:09,835
Your obligation to the Dollhouse
is complete.

231
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,760
Right.

232
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,971
So you're just here
for a friendly chat?

233
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:16,474
You haven't come in
for your diagnostic.

234
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,183
Just because you leave our care,

235
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,520
we don't cast you to the wolves,
Madeline.

236
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,315
I'm worried about you.

237
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,115
I appreciate that.

238
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,840
I suspect you're worried
that I'll flip out

239
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:29,446
and expose you and the Dollhouse.

240
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:35,452
- The worries aren't mutually exclusive.
- You know what I'm wondering?

241
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:39,289
Is if this is really about the fact that
you let me out of my contract early.

242
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:41,175
Years early.

243
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:43,793
Why is that?

244
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,555
Did something happen?

245
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,355
Circumstances changed.

246
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:51,801
I'm not at liberty to discuss them.

247
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,720
For your own well-being,

248
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:55,680
come and have your diagnostic.

249
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,974
I won't take no for an answer.

250
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:03,195
I don't imagine you will.

251
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:10,499
Where are two going?

252
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:12,595
Just for a walk.

253
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,987
A walk outside.
We'll be right back.

254
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:18,255
You're holding your car keys.

255
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:23,495
We're going to the park in the car,
and then for a walk.

256
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:28,546
You know, I thought that
we could all eat breakfast together.

257
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:32,717
I just discovered that I can actually
cook something called scrambled eggs,

258
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,402
and I don't wanna brag,
but they're pretty amazing.

259
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:40,895
You know, that sounds so great,
but I'm not hungry.

260
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:45,855
- Aren't you supposed to be at work?
- I took the day off.

261
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:47,745
That's...

262
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:49,067
great, baby.

263
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,527
Yeah, it's long overdue.

264
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,197
I forgot.
You can't drive anywhere today.

265
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:56,491
Why not?

266
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,506
I took your car into the shop
to get the brake pads replaced,

267
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,620
and I forgot
the baby seat inside. I'm sorry.

268
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:02,778
It'll probably be ready tomorrow.

269
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,750
- You didn't need to do that.
- I know.

270
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,626
I'm just trying to help out.

271
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,102
You know what?

272
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:15,052
Why don't you go back to bed,
and I'll take this little guy?

273
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,874
- Get some rest.
- Wait.

274
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:18,722
It's okay. Go on.

275
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,754
We're gonna have
a little man time down here.

276
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:23,827
It's time for him to eat.

277
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,579
I forgot, but I should feed him.

278
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:30,322
All right.

279
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:34,738
Why don't you take a nap
when you're done?

280
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:36,254
Promise.

281
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,944
It's okay.

282
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,680
It's okay.

283
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:56,710
<i>Hello?</i>

284
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,678
- You have to come get me and the baby.
- <i>What's wrong?</i>

285
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,681
Nate won't let us leave.
I think he's trying to kill me.

286
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,726
- That's crazy.
- <i>He took away the car!</i>

287
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,807
Please come and get us!
I'll explain everything.

288
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:08,687
All right.
All right, I'm on my way.

289
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,753
Thank you.

290
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,690
Thank God.

291
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:47,693
Oh, God.

292
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,001
Oh, God.

293
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,250
She's upstairs.

294
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:15,087
Husband says
she's been acting a little paranoid,

295
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,131
and she has the kid,
so let her see me first.

296
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,362
We don't want this
to get out of hand.

297
00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:39,927
Would you like a treatment?

298
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:41,453
<i>Please be quiet, Jack.</i>

299
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,977
<i>Come on, it's okay.</i>

300
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:46,176
- What the hell?
- <i>Don't cry, please.</i>

301
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,959
<i>Don't cry please.
Don't cry.</i>

302
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:02,385
You got to be kidding me.

303
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,804
It's okay, baby boy.

304
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:07,503
We going to be okay.

305
00:21:12,282 --> 00:21:14,921
- Please sit down, Mr. Jordan.
- I will not sit down.

306
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:18,573
Your zombie took my Jack,
and you are sitting there drinking tea.

307
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:19,799
Do something!

308
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:21,737
Echo will not harm your child.

309
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,490
- She loves him. She is his mother.
- I'm sorry?

310
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,578
Are you listening to yourself?
She is <i>not</i> his mother.

311
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:30,066
But she is.

312
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:32,462
This isn't someone
playing make-believe.

313
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:35,126
In Echo's mind,
she planned for this child.

314
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:38,504
Carried him for nine months.
Delivered him and nursed him.

315
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:41,213
For all intents and purposes,
Jack is her baby.

316
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:44,489
I gave you people money...
a lot of money...

317
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:47,764
and you send a crazy
kidnapping chick into my house.

318
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:50,475
What the hell did I pay you for?

319
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:51,578
A mother.

320
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:54,020
You could have hired
a nanny, a baby-sitter,

321
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:57,774
but you wanted someone
to bond profoundly with your child

322
00:21:58,357 --> 00:22:00,643
because you could not
bond with him yourself,

323
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,893
which is understandable.

324
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:10,827
I shouldn't have done this.
This was a terrible idea.

325
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,673
The formative months
of an infant's life are crucial.

326
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:25,362
A child who feels loved
is imprinted with the sense

327
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:26,928
that the world is a safe place.

328
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:30,824
A child that does not feel loved
grows up to be...

329
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,172
well...

330
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:34,232
most likely a sociopath.

331
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:40,591
What happens to a child
kidnapped by a stranger?

332
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,043
I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan,

333
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:46,322
but your next plan was to put up
the child for adoption, was it not?

334
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:52,826
Just find him.

335
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:56,833
We know exactly
where Echo and the baby are.

336
00:22:57,662 --> 00:22:59,682
And we are retrieving them
as we speak.

337
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,445
We're just hitting the bank.

338
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,651
Taking out as much of Daddy's money
as they will let us.

339
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:08,669
And then we are road-tripping it,
sweetheart.

340
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:10,194
Won't that be fun?

341
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:31,875
Officers!

342
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,828
Officers!
Please help me.

343
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:35,810
Someone is chasing me,
trying to take my baby.

344
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:36,919
Where?

345
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:43,379
Damn it. They were right there, I swear.
You have to believe me.

346
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:45,714
My husband's trying
to have me killed.

347
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,969
You're safe now.
Come with us.

348
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,061
I know it sounds crazy.

349
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:56,559
I listen to myself
and I sound crazy.

350
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,309
But I heard him.

351
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:04,067
My husband wants to take my baby
and get me killed.

352
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:07,236
It doesn't make any sense.
I don't know what I did.

353
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,362
The important thing is,
you came to us.

354
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,684
Too many women convince themselves
they're overreacting

355
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:14,368
or pretend things will get better.
Then it's too late.

356
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,620
You have to understand.
He's not an abuser.

357
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:19,884
He's never laid a hand on me.
He doesn't even raise his voice.

358
00:24:20,009 --> 00:24:21,709
I'm not a victim.

359
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,378
Yeah, not yet.
Let's try to keep it that way.

360
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:26,839
You had a baby.

361
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:29,300
Some guys can't handle the stress.
They snap.

362
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,587
He didn't snap.

363
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:32,250
He just...

364
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:34,311
went away, you know?

365
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,647
It's like the person I knew
isn't there anymore.

366
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:42,447
He's been replaced
by a stranger and...

367
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:44,816
I don't even know what I'm saying.

368
00:24:44,996 --> 00:24:45,996
Yes, you do.

369
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,348
And you're lucky
you got out when you did.

370
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:51,488
What's going to happen now?

371
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,617
We'll record your statement,
then we'll bring your husband in.

372
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:57,825
In the meantime, we'll get a judge
to grant you a restraining order.

373
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,915
That's him.
Oh, God. That's him.

374
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,573
And that's one of the men
that came into my house.

375
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:06,223
Talking to my captain.

376
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:08,328
Don't worry. You're safe.

377
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,622
Stay put.

378
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,133
I'll see what's going down.

379
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,863
You can't hurt me in here, Nate.

380
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,574
Whatever you've planned,
it's not gonna work.

381
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,325
You sure about this?

382
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,714
I am positive. That is my baby,
but that is not my wife.

383
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,137
No one's going to hurt you.

384
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:42,279
This man is from the FBI.
He wants to talk to you.

385
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:44,075
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me!

386
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,761
I promise, you will be safe.

387
00:25:45,886 --> 00:25:47,252
Don't come any closer! No!

388
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:52,487
Don't take my baby!
Don't take my baby! Don't! Don't!

389
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:53,633
No! Come on!

390
00:25:54,097 --> 00:25:55,720
It's okay.
I don't want to hurt you.

391
00:25:56,443 --> 00:25:58,723
Just don't fight. It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you!

392
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,385
Don't take him!
Let me go!

393
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,510
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go, please!

394
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:03,887
Don't take him, Jack!

395
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,351
Don't take him!

396
00:26:08,223 --> 00:26:11,632
72, 65, 58,

397
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,083
51...

398
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,284
Thank you.

399
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,048
Repeat these words.

400
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,534
Boat. Cucumber. Wire.

401
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:21,251
Boat. Cucumber. Wire.

402
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:22,660
Very good.

403
00:26:23,345 --> 00:26:25,095
Any headaches, dizziness?

404
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:26,167
None.

405
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,712
Nightmares, deja vu?
Gag reflex while eating sea urchin?

406
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,088
What?

407
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,631
Forget it.

408
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:36,314
I'm not broken?

409
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:38,226
You're not glitching.

410
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:39,555
And I haven't found

411
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,142
any phantom files
or random memory threads.

412
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,726
Physiologically, you're intact.

413
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,938
- So, I'm finished, then.
- What were those three words?

414
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,648
Boat. Cucumber. Wire.

415
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:50,915
Clean bill of health.

416
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,906
Factory new
and not a scratch on you.

417
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:53,976
As promised.

418
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:56,364
We should put you
in the recruiting DVD.

419
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:58,599
Thank you very much.

420
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,936
How do I get out of here?

421
00:27:01,103 --> 00:27:03,678
I'll let them know
that you're ready to be taken home.

422
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,928
While we're waiting, may I offer you

423
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:09,961
any additional enhancements?

424
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:11,753
On the house.

425
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:14,336
I've been working
on some pretty sick apps.

426
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:16,530
How do you feel about ventriloquism?

427
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,637
So tempting.
I'll have to pass.

428
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:21,722
It's a dying art.

429
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:25,434
Give me back my son!

430
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,769
Give me back my son!

431
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,891
- Little help?
- Get her in the chair.

432
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:32,108
- They stole my baby. Help me!
- Did you offer her a treatment?

433
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,401
That's a great idea.

434
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:35,653
Why won't anybody help me?

435
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,712
Let me go!

436
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,276
You knocked her out?

437
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,790
I can't wipe her
when she's knocked out.

438
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:01,721
Think.

439
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,348
Okay, just come on.

440
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,113
Put her in the chair.
I'll wipe her when she wakes up.

441
00:28:07,238 --> 00:28:08,588
Whenever that is.

442
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,234
What are you doing here?

443
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,359
Just came in for a diagnostic.

444
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:29,332
That was really intense.

445
00:28:29,886 --> 00:28:31,186
You're bleeding.

446
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:35,794
I remember you.

447
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,610
You do?

448
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:39,675
My last day,
when I was signing the paperwork...

449
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:42,112
Right.

450
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:45,185
Come on.
Let's get that taken care of.

451
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:49,435
Looks good.

452
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,385
Don't even need a stitch.

453
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,510
Thanks.

454
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:58,542
You okay?

455
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:00,698
I don't know.

456
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:03,741
To be clear,
nobody took anybody's baby.

457
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:07,036
She's an active, like you used to be.
It was all pretend.

458
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,872
- Is it always like that?
- Like what?

459
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:12,365
She really believed
someone took her child.

460
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,740
Heart and soul.

461
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:15,920
Like I said, it wasn't real.

462
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:18,364
But it was, for her.

463
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:20,424
All that emotion, all that pain.

464
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,386
Was I ever like that?

465
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,597
We're not good for each other.

466
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,557
- Don't be so cruel! This is killing me!
- You'll get over it.

467
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,859
You know, I'm kind of new here.

468
00:29:33,294 --> 00:29:34,647
I wouldn't really know.

469
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:37,481
She'll be okay.

470
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:40,456
- Who?
- The girl.

471
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:42,855
You seemed worried for her.

472
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,616
She'll forget about the baby.
She'll forget everything.

473
00:29:46,357 --> 00:29:47,410
No more pain.

474
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,003
No more grief.

475
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,872
That's how it works.

476
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:53,916
They did it for me.

477
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:57,795
I had a daughter.
She died.

478
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:00,678
I'm sorry.

479
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,365
She had a cold.

480
00:30:02,743 --> 00:30:05,558
And then it wasn't a cold.
It was cancer.

481
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:07,095
Terminal.

482
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,348
And my world fell apart.

483
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:11,340
Within six months, she was gone,

484
00:30:11,465 --> 00:30:15,258
and I was left all alone,
completely unable to function.

485
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,131
I had no idea.

486
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:18,851
How could you?

487
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:22,463
But what I'm telling you is,
it all worked out.

488
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,529
I met Adelle.

489
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:25,823
She came to you?

490
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:29,369
She told me
I didn't have to suffer anymore.

491
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,078
I go to sleep for five years,

492
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,897
I wake up without pain.

493
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,059
So, what, you...

494
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:36,417
you're happy now?

495
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:41,159
I'm not sad.

496
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,593
It was nice meeting you.

497
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,018
You seem like a nice man.

498
00:30:54,498 --> 00:30:56,089
Please help me.

499
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:59,636
They're going to do something
terrible to my little boy.

500
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,341
I am a nice man.

501
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,845
You're going to be just fine.
I promise.

502
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,947
I'm gonna make all this go away.

503
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,790
So, you'll help me?

504
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,576
Absolutely.

505
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:50,032
Hello, Echo.
How are you feeling?

506
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:52,092
Did I fall asleep?

507
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:53,827
For a little while.

508
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,311
Shall I go now?

509
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,007
God!

510
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,056
- What is it?
- Wiretap transcripts.

511
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,514
This is more than medical malfeasance
or ethics violations.

512
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,044
This is... prostitution.

513
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,312
Human trafficking.

514
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,223
Maybe murder.

515
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:26,519
They take people, and they...

516
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:28,456
change them...

517
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,381
into whatever they want them be.

518
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:31,949
That's not possible.

519
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,253
It's very possible.
I read everything about this.

520
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:37,288
When Mom was sick,
Rossum had the means to help her,

521
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:39,120
and instead, they...

522
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,795
You know, when we first started
looking into this,

523
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,923
I thought this was
a game-changer for us, a trophy,

524
00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:50,450
the next step up in your career.

525
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:52,886
I'm scared, Daniel.

526
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,847
The power that these people have...

527
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:59,559
- Do you want me to back off?
- No.

528
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:03,555
I want you to do what you promised.

529
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,030
This has to stop.

530
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,528
We're gonna verify all this.
We're gonna find proof.

531
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,670
We've got better than proof.

532
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:15,471
We've got a name.

533
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:31,639
Go, please?

534
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,694
What, precisely, was the
last thing she said to you?

535
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:52,624
I'm telling you,
I remember wiping her,

536
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:54,309
and then my face exploded.

537
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:55,434
That's it.

538
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,184
Where's she going?

539
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:58,986
GPS has her heading to...

540
00:33:59,111 --> 00:34:01,392
Nate Jordan's house...
she's going after the baby.

541
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,762
How can that be?
You were supposed to have wiped her.

542
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:05,457
I did!
I'm sure of it.

543
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:08,023
Are we looking at another
composite event, Mr. Brink?

544
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:09,296
I don't think so.

545
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,157
I think we're looking at a genius.

546
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,135
I'm not as comfy with you saying that
as I thought I'd be.

547
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:17,734
Think about it: you changed
her on a glandular level.

548
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,640
Maybe her body was stronger
than her brain.

549
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,359
The maternal instinct is the purest.

550
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,189
It's too strong for a normal wipe.

551
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,983
I outplayed myself.

552
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:33,136
- Like in chess.
- Not like chess...

553
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:35,864
like Echo was in trouble and pain
because you didn't think it through.

554
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:37,857
She probably can't even
remember his name,

555
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:39,910
but she has to have him back,
no matter what.

556
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,128
Perhaps triggering lactation
was a bridge too far.

557
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,542
- Live and learn.
- Go. Now.

558
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:58,236
Well, I guess that's gonna hold.
What do you think?

559
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:03,596
You had a crazy day, buddy?

560
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:06,241
But things are gonna be okay.

561
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:09,020
You and me...
we're gonna figure it out.

562
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:11,650
Come here, pal.

563
00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:16,967
All right.

564
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:22,327
All right. I'm going to see
about getting a bottle together for you.

565
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,367
Okay? Now, don't you go anywhere.

566
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:25,748
Don't you go anywhere.

567
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:28,581
All right.

568
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:30,836
Daddy'll be right back.

569
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,100
Smells like fish.

570
00:35:59,214 --> 00:36:00,114
Damn it!

571
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:03,702
Hold on, buddy!

572
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,413
I'll be right there.

573
00:36:07,863 --> 00:36:09,625
- Hello?
- Mr. Jordan, Adelle DeWitt.

574
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,127
It's imperative you and your son
leave your house at once.

575
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,899
- What? Why?
- There's little time for discussion.

576
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:18,542
Our Active is on her way to you.
I've dispatched a team to intercept.

577
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,803
Get out of the house immediately.

578
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,621
She's coming here? Why?

579
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:24,932
Hello?

580
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:28,082
Hello?

581
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:29,576
Hello?!

582
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:33,447
Jack?!

583
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,579
Where are you?

584
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:01,134
Mommy's home.

585
00:37:05,404 --> 00:37:09,017
- Please. Don't hurt him.
- You took away my baby.

586
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:12,980
- Why did you do that?
- I'm sorry.

587
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:16,742
Can... Can I please have him back?

588
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,917
I love him.

589
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:20,686
I don't want to give him to you.

590
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:21,905
I'm his daddy.

591
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,573
But this is my baby.

592
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,370
I know that you think that he is.

593
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:30,622
I want you to go away now.

594
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:33,906
I can't do that.

595
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:39,002
- Babies need their mothers.
- I know.

596
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:42,303
- But you aren't his mother.
- That's a lie!

597
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,303
I don't want to talk to you anymore!

598
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,097
I know
that you love Jack very much...

599
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,392
... but he doesn't belong to you.

600
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:52,895
And I am afraid
that you're going to hurt him.

601
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,236
That's not me.
That's not right.

602
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,324
Do you remember?

603
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,285
They turned you into somebody else.
You're not real.

604
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:11,705
None of this is real.

605
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:13,148
I'm not real.

606
00:38:13,848 --> 00:38:15,125
Do you know who is real?

607
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:18,245
I don't.

608
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:19,906
And I'm sorry.

609
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,107
This is my fault.

610
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:25,260
I put you through hell.

611
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:29,890
They made you love Jack
because I asked them to.

612
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,603
Why did you do that?

613
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:35,990
My wife,

614
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:37,793
Karen...

615
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:40,746
she died while having Jack.

616
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,570
And I couldn't handle it,
and I fell apart, and I blamed him.

617
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:48,741
I blamed a baby.
Do you believe that?

618
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,739
And after she died,
I needed to find someone

619
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:54,790
who would love Jack

620
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:57,376
because I couldn't do it myself.

621
00:39:02,304 --> 00:39:03,882
So, can I be his mommy?

622
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,043
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,681
You can't.

624
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,270
Karen is a part of Jack.

625
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:17,535
You aren't.

626
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,650
And he's all
that I have of her anymore.

627
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:23,394
So...

628
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,700
You can do
whatever you want to do to me.

629
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:34,579
Just...
Just please don't hurt the baby.

630
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:47,003
My little boy.

631
00:40:19,354 --> 00:40:20,354
It's okay.

632
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:36,405
Are you okay?

633
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:40,027
I had a baby.

634
00:40:43,714 --> 00:40:45,664
Now I don't have him anymore.

635
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:48,843
I feel sad.

636
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
I'm sorry.

637
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:53,739
All of these things

638
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:55,827
that happen to me...

639
00:40:57,116 --> 00:40:58,216
I feel them.

640
00:41:00,553 --> 00:41:01,703
I know, Echo.

641
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:06,212
- I know you remember everything.
- Not remember.

642
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,830
Feel.

643
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,569
I was married.

644
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:16,422
I felt love.

645
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,826
And pain, fear.

646
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:24,022
It's not pretend for me.

647
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:29,526
They made me love my little boy.

648
00:41:31,345 --> 00:41:33,245
And then they took him away.

649
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,537
They make it so real.

650
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:42,992
Every time, they make it so real.

651
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:47,559
Why do they do that?

652
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,729
I know you want to help me
bring down the Dollhouse,

653
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:55,011
but maybe it's too much.

654
00:41:55,422 --> 00:41:57,122
I can do this on my own.

655
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,643
I promise I'll get you out.
I'll get all of you out.

656
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:07,387
If you want,

657
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,534
I'll tell Topher
what's going on with you,

658
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:12,059
and he can fix it.

659
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:15,769
He'll come up with a way to wipe you,
and you won't remember a thing.

660
00:42:17,396 --> 00:42:19,327
You won't have to feel sad anymore.

661
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,247
Feeling nothing would be worse.

662
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:25,083
That would be like before.

663
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,494
Asleep.

664
00:42:30,932 --> 00:42:32,132
I'm awake now.

665
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:36,443
I don't want to back to sleep.
