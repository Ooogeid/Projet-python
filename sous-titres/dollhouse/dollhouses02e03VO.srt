<i>Previously on Dollhouse...</i>

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,851
I can't beat you.

3
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:06,328
The FBI kicked me out for trying.

4
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:09,353
I want you to consider
becoming Echo's handler.

5
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:11,728
Everything's going to be all right.

6
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:13,638
Now that you're here.

7
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,665
- She's not going to...?
- Glitch?

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,516
She's fine, Agent Ballard.

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,104
My head is on fire.

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,663
All you had to do was remember

11
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:25,938
<i>who you were.</i>

12
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:27,735
<i>I remember everything.</i>

13
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,612
<i>I've been many people.</i>

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,280
Do you know who's real?

15
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:32,843
Caroline.

16
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,700
Will you help me?

17
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,569
Goodness gracious, but it is
good to be out of doors.

18
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:12,356
It certainly is.

19
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:17,076
And aren't Little Sister and
Aunt Sheila having a time, though.

20
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,876
What a healthsome

21
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:22,089
and robust young lady you are, too.

22
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:25,668
You better watch out, Aunt Sheila.

23
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:28,396
Little Sister's playing to win!

24
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,151
No use in moaning about it.

25
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:36,893
What?

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,640
Me?

27
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:41,588
Well, I'd love to join.

28
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:43,775
All right.

29
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:46,849
Don't think I'll be much
match for Little Sister!

30
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,524
Now watch this drive.

31
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,579
Aunt Sheila!

32
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,305
That's not very sportsmanlike
to just walk off

33
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,031
because you don't like the way
the game is going, is it?

34
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,869
Right when it's my turn to play,
everyone wants to quit.

35
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,626
Well, not this time.

36
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:18,786
Damn it!

37
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,549
Aunt Sheila!

38
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:27,316
This... is not...

39
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,491
how we play the game!

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,175
Guess we have to find
a new Aunt Sheila.

I'm Echo.

52
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:31,145
I was looking for you.

53
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,597
I'm glad.

54
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,623
Would you like...

55
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,234
a towel?

56
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,593
Yes, thank you.

57
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,077
I'm wet.

58
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,392
Good day.

59
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:54,771
A treatment.

60
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,670
Would you like a treatment?

61
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:58,339
Yes, please.

62
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,090
I enjoy my treatments.

63
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:01,634
Shall I dress?

64
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,077
Yes, dress would be good.

65
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:08,777
<i>And Mr. Ballard has been
given his engagement?</i>

66
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:09,752
<i>He has.</i>

67
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,477
And any progress on locating
our troubled missing employee?

68
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:15,733
She's not really missing, is she?
She left.

69
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,082
Well, I call that missing.

70
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,608
I call that leaving.

71
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,529
- One doesn't just leave this place.
- Claire did.

72
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,798
- Claire now, is it?
- Dr. Saunders.

73
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,330
Where is Dr. Saunders, please?

74
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:30,105
She's not here, Victor.

75
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,707
There is a man... he's not his best.
Dr. Saunders can help him.

76
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,293
Thank you, Victor.
We'll help him.

77
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,963
And we can also keep looking
for Dr. Saunders, yes?

78
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:45,123
How's the patient?

79
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,430
Not complaining.

80
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:51,180
Considering he was hit by a car.

81
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:53,607
Have we determined yet
if the condition is reversible?

82
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:57,636
I have to finish mapping his neural
landscape but if I can figure out a way

83
00:05:57,761 --> 00:06:01,215
to sneak up behind his reticular
activating system, give it a goose,

84
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,611
that might do it.

85
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,229
It could also give him
a man reaction.

86
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:07,421
I choose not to hear that.

87
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:11,534
Do we really want
to wake this guy up?

88
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:14,016
Mr. Langton, have you no charity?

89
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:17,971
We are working to reunite
a desperate family with their

90
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:19,795
wayward loved one.

91
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,338
By wayward, do you mean that
they've been looking for him

92
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,434
ever since he skipped
his last bail hearing?

93
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:27,211
A bail hearing over a minor matter
which has since been resolved.

94
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:29,386
And by resolved, do you mean...

95
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,635
A judge was bought off.

96
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,976
There is no need
to continue to translate me.

97
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:38,397
In any event, Bradley Karrens
is not only a valued client,

98
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,109
he happens to be a major shareholder
in our parent organization.

99
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:45,756
If we can apply our resources
to resolving his nephew's

100
00:06:46,377 --> 00:06:48,302
slight medical condition,

101
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,034
we do it.

102
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,702
Report any progress.

103
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,792
See? We're doing good.

104
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,457
So your client is an Edmond Gossen.

105
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:06,675
He's a liberal arts professor
at Clairfield College.

106
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,470
Echo is being imprinted
as one of his students.

107
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,795
- What's the "R" stand for?
- That's the engagement designation.

108
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,320
"R" means romance.

109
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:16,778
As in R-rated?

110
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:18,867
Great.

111
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:22,909
So she's the sex fantasy
for some egghead academic

112
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,976
who can't get one of his real
students to sleep with him.

113
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:32,284
- Don't you just feel like dancing?
- Not overly.

114
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:35,524
You know what it is? Normally
at this time,

115
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,540
I'm at yoga disco. So my body's just
sort programmed to do this.

116
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,834
- She's not wrong.
- What is it, Thursday?

117
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,046
Tell me I didn't miss Gossen's lecture.
He's hard enough to understand

118
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,073
- even when you're there.
- You're fine.

119
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,698
Paul here is going to see to it
that you get there on time.

120
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,412
Thanks, Paul.

121
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:52,823
I'm KiKi.

122
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,850
First, Paul is going to
take you on a little spree.

123
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,560
Shopping or killing?

124
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:00,965
Joke.

125
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,304
Good news on the coma front?

126
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,279
Good news is that he's in a coma.

127
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,519
- I beg your pardon?
- Just show her what you showed me.

128
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,788
This is a brain...
a healthy brain.

129
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:20,385
Frankly, an overly smart brain.

130
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,159
It's my brain.

131
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:26,551
And this is Terry Karrens' brain.

132
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,430
See these dark areas?

133
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:31,237
How they extend all the way out
to here? You know why

134
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:34,367
that looks like that? That's because
Terry Karrens doesn't use

135
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:37,253
that part of his brain.
And that'd be where you find stored

136
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,810
such things as empathy, compassion,

137
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:42,729
an aversion
to disemboweling puppies.

138
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,380
Basically, this is what

139
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:47,955
some of your more famous
serial killers' brains look like.

140
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:49,862
You're quite certain of this?

141
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,793
Certain enough that I have serious
ethical problems trying to wake him up.

142
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:55,818
Topher has ethical problems.

143
00:08:57,515 --> 00:08:58,871
Way to land it.

144
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,706
Judith, get me Bradley Karrens.

145
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:06,211
Hello.

146
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:08,288
You're new.

147
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,104
And of course,

148
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,629
you're always new.

149
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:13,302
And who are we today?

150
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,404
She's KiKi.

151
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:16,879
Of course she is.

152
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,100
Excuse me. Work order Echo.

153
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,479
Who's doing that?
I am.

154
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,378
Right, okay.
So not exactly a rocket scientist.

155
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,359
Normally that would be irony,
but here, one never knows.

156
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:34,531
Why don't you take Ms. KiKi here
on back and stick her in the works.

157
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:37,015
Who's going to pay for this?

158
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,661
Isn't that cute.
On the casa.

159
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,328
- Free?
- <i>Oui, oui.</i>

160
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:43,540
- Did I win a prize?
- You are a prize.

161
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,504
How long is this going to take?

162
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:51,330
Changing their insides is nothing.

163
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,806
The outsides... that's art.

164
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:56,373
Art takes time.

165
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:58,267
Magazine?

166
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:10,447
I won't even do this for my wife.

167
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:14,487
I was trained at Quantico.

168
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,202
Adelle, tell me
there's been a breakthrough.

169
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:21,778
Of a kind.

170
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,542
Can your people bring him back?

171
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,460
Convince me why they should.

172
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:29,691
What?

173
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:34,186
Bradley, when you came to me
with your request,

174
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:36,652
you assured me that
conventional medical science

175
00:10:36,777 --> 00:10:38,927
would fail to revive your nephew.

176
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:42,099
That news of his condition
would be a crushing blow

177
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,601
- to your brother, Terry's father.
- All true.

178
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:47,271
Yet somewhat incomplete, yes?

179
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,307
I encourage candor.

180
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:53,777
I have a team standing by
to return him to Mercy.

181
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,697
A return to Mercy.
That has a poetry.

182
00:10:58,569 --> 00:10:59,992
All right, all right.

183
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:04,413
All right, when I told you
the doctors said

184
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,415
he couldn't be revived,
that was true.

185
00:11:07,728 --> 00:11:10,127
"Revived in time,"
is what I neglected to add.

186
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,237
In time for what?

187
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:14,907
Well, you are no doubt
aware of Terry's past,

188
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:17,920
- his troubles with the law?
- Minor offenses.

189
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:20,843
What you know about
is only what the family

190
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,946
hasn't been able to scrub.

191
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,726
There have been other...
indiscretions.

192
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:29,509
Women,
"survivors" I should call them.

193
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:33,442
And when you have a survivor, you have
a person that might be persuaded

194
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,944
monetarily or by other means,

195
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,312
to stay quiet.

196
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,866
But when all you have are bodies...

197
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,201
I see.

198
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:46,609
We can't be certain, o course,
but recent reports of abductions,

199
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:49,791
- missing persons, might suggest...
- Survivors?

200
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:53,462
Terry and I have always been close.

201
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,561
If there are women
out there, he'd tell me.

202
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:59,265
And I just know
that if I can talk to him...

203
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,346
If he is to be questioned,
we do it on my terms.

204
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,089
My terms.

205
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:06,147
That's all.

206
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:38,173
I'll take her.

207
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,490
What?

208
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,762
I'll cover your engagement.
You're staying here.

209
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,687
Why?

210
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,556
Turns out we have a sudden need
for an FBI profiler.

211
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,024
I suggested you.

212
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,059
For what?

213
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,395
To interrogate
a possible serial killer.

214
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:53,431
"Serial killer"?

215
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:57,818
Thank God.

216
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,670
Car!

217
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,289
Goodness gracious.

218
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:12,766
Hello, Terry.

219
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:14,995
<i>Hello?</i>

220
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:18,880
<i>I'd like to know if I'm being
charged with something.</i>

221
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,618
<i>Do you know you have to charge me</i>

222
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:22,720
<i>with something eventually?
I know my rights.</i>

223
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,842
How much does he know
about who he is? Where he is?

224
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:27,915
Straight brain dump.

225
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,971
He is Terry Karrens.

226
00:13:30,096 --> 00:13:32,115
Right up to the moment
he got hit by that car.

227
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,727
I don't understand why you won't
just let me speak with him.

228
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:37,482
Mr. Ballard received
his training from the FBI.

229
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,906
He's very experience
in these matters.

230
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,331
We defer to him.

231
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:46,545
These missing persons reports...

232
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,509
Why do you think he's connected?

233
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:50,784
Just a hunch.

234
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:52,998
That's not a hunch.

235
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,916
A 42-year-old woman from Covina,

236
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,836
a 16-year-old girl from El Monte,

237
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,656
a 20-year-old from Whittier

238
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:03,177
and a 38-year-old from Alhambra.

239
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,719
I don't see a pattern here,
for some reason you do.

240
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,742
Who are these women?
Who are they to him?

241
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,017
They were in a real sense nobody.

242
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,811
The authors of some of the most
important medieval literature

243
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,807
had no concept of self identity
as we might understand it.

244
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,610
We think of them as anonymous.

245
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:24,571
They didn't think
of themselves at all.

246
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:29,659
And I can see many of you would rather
not be thinking of them, either.

247
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:33,955
Okay, your essays on the economics

248
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,753
of love in Chaucer's <i>The Wife of Bath</i>
are being returned to you.

249
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,526
If you have questions or quibbles,

250
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:43,363
my office is open.

251
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,772
Professor, this can't be right.

252
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:01,037
- Ms. Turner.
- KiKi.

253
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:04,361
Okay, so I probably never should've
taken this course to begin with.

254
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,266
But I figured it was Mid-Evil lit,

255
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:08,445
not Advanced Evil.
How hard could it be?

256
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,720
So I skipped
Intro to Evil or whatever,

257
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,744
but how is it I get an "F" when this

258
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,831
guy that we're reading,
Chauncy, can't even spell?

259
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:18,238
It's Chaucer.

260
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,043
It's Middle English.

261
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:22,588
Right like Hobbits or something.

262
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,919
As I said, my office is open

263
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:27,059
if you'd care to discuss it.

264
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,846
I'd care to discuss it. I'm like the
Scarlet Lady with the "F" on her chest.

265
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:33,390
- "A."
- If only.

266
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,491
The detail is exquisite.

267
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,178
Chaucer's detail.

268
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:41,977
Alisoun is his most
fully realized character.

269
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:46,194
Well, then he sucks,
because I don't get her.

270
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:47,628
Really?

271
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,199
Because I think I can detect
a little Alisoun in you.

272
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:07,043
These cuffs are digging
into my wrists.

273
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,165
I have no circulation!
Hello?!

274
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:16,472
Well, about time.

275
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,659
"Terry Marion Karrens"?

276
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,704
- Any part of that a boy's name?
- What?

277
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:33,764
So...

278
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:38,121
I gotta ask and I think
you know I gotta ask.

279
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Have you been practicing
dentistry on large cats?

280
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,310
Leopards? Pumas?

281
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:47,489
What?

282
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,714
I'm just wondering
why it is you have traces

283
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,135
of a veterinary grade paralytic
in your system?

284
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,578
I demand my phone call!
I want my attorney present.

285
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:57,182
No attorneys, no phone calls.

286
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,809
- I know my rights.
- And no rights.

287
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,270
You are in big trouble.

288
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,005
When my family finds
out what you're doing,

289
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,762
<i>you and this entire department...</i>

290
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:09,137
<i>- This isn't a department.
- What?</i>

291
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:11,119
<i>And I'm not a cop.</i>

292
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:12,537
<i>What do you mean?</i>

293
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,391
<i>Who are you then?
What is this place?</i>

294
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,076
<i>This is the place you're not in.</i>

295
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,589
And I'm the guy
you're not talking to.

296
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,976
And these?

297
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,668
<i>These are the women
you're going to tell me how to find.</i>

298
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:29,593
<i>I've never seen any
of these women before.</i>

299
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:31,811
<i>Take another look, Terry.</i>

300
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,307
Squint if you have to.

301
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:43,596
I told you I've never seen
these women before.

302
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:45,724
I don't know them.

303
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,045
Let me help you out.

304
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,695
Mother.

305
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:52,904
Big Sis.

306
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,030
Little Sis.

307
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,124
And Aunt Sheila.

308
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:58,743
At least that's how you know them.

309
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,219
This is exactly the wrong
approach to take with Terry.

310
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:07,127
- He needs to know you're on his side.
- But we're not on his side.

311
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,004
Adelle, I know my nephew.

312
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:11,225
And you should visit your nephew.

313
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,912
Escort Mr. Karrens downstairs
where he can see for himself

314
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:17,720
he care being provided.
I'm sure you'll be impressed.

315
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:21,259
He's got his own private room
and we've kept him very...

316
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:22,688
clean.

317
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,022
You know, Terry, when I was
first told that this is what you did,

318
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,816
abducted women who looked like
the women you grew up with.

319
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,080
Who told you that?

320
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:34,580
I figured, "Hell, the sick, little twist
must've killed his family."

321
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,805
It's a whole Norman Bates thing.

322
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:40,076
But no. Your real mother
and sisters and your aunt

323
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,997
are all still living in the family home.
You know what that makes you.

324
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:45,425
Very weird.

325
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:47,959
- I'm not weird.
- No.

326
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,370
No, you're weird, Terry.

327
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:52,795
But what you're not is special.

328
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,176
It doesn't take a criminal
profiler to figure you out.

329
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,744
Maybe just a pimp.

330
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:59,381
It's ordinary.

331
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:01,493
You're ordinary.

332
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,808
Maybe you got bottle-fed,
maybe you got dumped.

333
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,520
<i>It doesn't matter. At some point, you
decided real people weren't worth it.</i>

334
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,022
<i>You pushed them away.</i>

335
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,569
<i>Alienated everyone in your life
so you could surround yourself</i>

336
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,611
<i>with the fakes, the copies.</i>

337
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:17,914
<i>It made you feel like
you had some control.</i>

338
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,325
You're not in control.

339
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,531
Does this look like
a guy who's in control?

340
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,380
Goodness gracious.

341
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:40,011
No, it's impossible. It can't be me.

342
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:42,318
<i>It's you, Terry.</i>

343
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:48,321
<i>- What is this?
- You remember that car, don't you?</i>

344
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:52,524
You think you walked away
from that without a scratch.

345
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,983
Is that what you think?

346
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:56,865
<i>This is a trick.</i>

347
00:19:57,351 --> 00:19:58,154
<i>Is it?</i>

348
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:04,702
<i>You need too tell me
where to find those women.</i>

349
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,871
They're the reason
you're in that bed.

350
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,563
They're the reason
your Uncle Brad looks so worried

351
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,838
and they're your only hope
of ever getting up again.

352
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:15,537
They did this to me.

353
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:17,512
You did this to yourself.

354
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:22,182
It's her.

355
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,122
That one.

356
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,234
It's all her fault.

357
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:29,221
What about her?

358
00:20:31,342 --> 00:20:33,342
She made me. I didn't mean to.

359
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,178
I didn't want to.

360
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:38,403
She meant for this to happen.
You bitch! You bitch!

361
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:41,041
What did she make you do, Terry?

362
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,978
You just want to have a nice time.

363
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,108
You want to have a nice day,
but they won't let you.

364
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:55,213
Because they're not nice.
They are never nice.

365
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:58,571
They care more about their dates
and their boyfriends

366
00:20:58,696 --> 00:21:00,751
and they don't pay attention
to Terry.

367
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:02,676
They never let Terry play.

368
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:04,924
No time for Terry.

369
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:07,892
They are...

370
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:10,633
whores.

371
00:21:11,252 --> 00:21:13,146
No, she's not a whore.

372
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,606
You're saying she uses sex
to get what she wants.

373
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:17,610
I'm saying she's a lusty,

374
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,243
bawdy, self-aware woman.

375
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:23,031
She doesn't allow men to define her.

376
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:26,259
She knows she's the one
with the real power.

377
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:27,660
What power?

378
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:30,666
The same power that all women have.

379
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:35,050
You make a nice day.
You make shade.

380
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:37,136
You put plastic
umbrellas in the drinks.

381
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:39,611
It doesn't matter.
It never matters.

382
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,837
But I thought women back then
had to do whatever a man said?

383
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:44,462
Alisoun knows better.

384
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:47,757
Alisoun knows it's all up to her.

385
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:52,101
She can have what she wants.
She knows how to get it.

386
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:55,213
"Meself have been the whippe."

387
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:58,308
She is the whip.

388
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:00,795
She's the one in control.

389
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:03,147
They never do what Terry wants.

390
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:05,272
They always do what they want.

391
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:07,567
She made me.

392
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,620
It's not my fault.
She made me.

393
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:14,466
So if she were here,
and you were Chauncy...

394
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,601
Chaucer, and he's the author.

395
00:22:17,802 --> 00:22:19,052
Doesn't matter.

396
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,383
She'd know how to get the "F"
on her chest turned into an "A."

397
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:25,491
You're learning.

398
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,676
Not literature.

399
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:30,707
But still...

400
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:34,099
But I can fix this.

401
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,938
I can make this right.

402
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:39,607
They'll let me play again.

403
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:44,692
<i>We just need a new Aunt Sheila.</i>

404
00:22:46,747 --> 00:22:48,366
We know he's killed at least one.

405
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,210
The unfortunate,
ubiquitous Aunt Sheila.

406
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:52,780
I wasn't expecting that.

407
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,959
I didn't think he'd cross that line,
but it makes sense.

408
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,602
She probably fought back.
That's why he was wandering around

409
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:00,688
with traces of that paralytic
in his system.

410
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:04,051
He'd lost a piece and was out looking to
replace it when the accident happened.

411
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:07,526
You gleaned quite a bit in there,
all things considered.

412
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:08,909
But not enough.

413
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,858
By the way, smart move sending
the uncle down there.

414
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:15,935
I knew what you had planned.
It might add a touch of pathos.

415
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:18,735
He was really getting
on your nerves, huh?

416
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,773
Couldn't stand another moment.

417
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:29,176
- What happened?
- I don't know. His uncle was visiting

418
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:31,480
and then he went into
cardiac arrest or something.

419
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,507
- Where is Bradley?
- He was right here.

420
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,204
False alarm, it was nothing.

421
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:37,955
How was that cacophony nothing?

422
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,211
Somebody tampered
with the main lead.

423
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,725
This is entirely unacceptable.

424
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,081
We tried it your way.
It didn't work.

425
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:00,409
Terry's going to have a little
chat with his unc.

426
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:02,234
Everything will be fine.

427
00:24:06,056 --> 00:24:07,206
Now, Terry...

428
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:36,599
He's refusing to pick up.

429
00:24:38,472 --> 00:24:41,020
I would say this is
a very positive turn of events.

430
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:42,752
You think?

431
00:24:42,877 --> 00:24:45,160
I do,
assuming your profile is correct.

432
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:47,822
You still believe Terry Karrens
will return to his victims?

433
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:51,031
I think he's in the market
for a new Aunt Sheila. But yeah.

434
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,906
All our Actives are tagged
with a GPS strip.

435
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:56,781
We can find them
anywhere at any time. So...

436
00:24:57,617 --> 00:24:59,267
if there are survivors,

437
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:01,791
Victor will lead us to them.

438
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,005
What do you mean
he wasn't tagged? Why not?

439
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,610
They took his GPS strip out
before they started all that

440
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:09,340
complicated facial reconstruction.
The scar removal.

441
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,796
- The surgery's complete.
- Right, but Dr. Saunders

442
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:14,183
is the one who signed off
on having it taken out.

443
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:17,041
And she kind of left before
telling anybody to put it back.

444
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,728
Lovely, so you're saying
that we've imprinted an Active

445
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,645
as a serial killer and then blindly
let him loose upon the streets?

446
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:24,897
I wasn't saying that.

447
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,578
Victor might not have
a working GPS in his body

448
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:29,735
but maybe Bradley Karrens
has one in his car.

449
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,241
Funny how my mind would
never think to go there.

450
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:43,859
- What's happening?
- The stuff, it's wearing off.

451
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:47,737
Where is he?

452
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:50,359
- I don't know.
- He killed her.

453
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,984
- He killed her.
- I know.

454
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,097
- He's going to kill us, too.
- No, he isn't.

455
00:25:58,491 --> 00:25:59,841
We won't let him.

456
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:01,902
What's your name?

457
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:05,298
Megan. I'm Robin.

458
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,970
We have names.

459
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,391
Remember that.

460
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,730
We're human.

461
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:11,005
Not his toys.

462
00:26:12,477 --> 00:26:15,177
We're getting out of here.
Find a weakness.

463
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,994
He's on foot.

464
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:21,103
Damn.

465
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:25,791
- Or maybe not on foot.
- <i>What do you see?</i>

466
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,359
Metrolink station.

467
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,654
If he got on it, he could be anywhere
from the Valley, downtown, Hollywood...

468
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:34,550
The accident.

469
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,803
- <i>The hit and run, where did it happen?</i>
- Just outside Beverly Hills.

470
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,319
That has to be close
to where he's keeping the women.

471
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:42,023
You think he's headed back there?

472
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:44,810
<i>Probably with a stop along the way
to pick up a new Aunt Sheila.</i>

473
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,401
The Hollywood line would put him
<i>straight towards Beverly Hills.</i>

474
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,150
I'm going to see
if I can pick up his trail.

475
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:54,331
Your one man manhunt's using
public transportation now?

476
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:57,127
Which is why you're going
to provide assurance.

477
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,366
Beg pardon?

478
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,939
We cannot allow Victor to be
used as Terry Karrens'

479
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:02,662
vehicle for abduction and murder.

480
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:05,665
I'm personally against it.

481
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,416
You need to free Victor of him.

482
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,960
Love to. He's not here.

483
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:10,654
I do know this.

484
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,421
A remote wipe?

485
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,133
It can't be done.

486
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,100
- Alpha did it with Echo.
- But he used a tonal interface.

487
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:22,236
Serial killer Victor would need
to have a phone. I need to have a tone.

488
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:24,556
I'd have to get him
answer the phone.

489
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:26,727
- Do you have his number?
- Obviously not.

490
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,886
Well...?

491
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,350
Think another way.
Think of it fast.

492
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:50,595
"Upon an ambler easily she sat.

493
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,618
"Well wimpled, aye, and over all

494
00:27:55,246 --> 00:27:56,096
"a hat.

495
00:27:56,831 --> 00:28:00,094
"As broad as is
a buckler or a targe."

496
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,046
A "targe" is a shield.

497
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:04,849
Still not following.

498
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:08,473
"A rug was tucked around
her buttocks large."

499
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:11,868
I guess a fat ass was
a good thing in the 1300's.

500
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:16,808
"And on her feet,
a pair of spurs quite sharp."

501
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:18,534
Nasty.

502
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:21,926
"The remedies of love
she knew perchance

503
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:26,195
"For of that art she'd learned
the old, old dance."

504
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:29,903
Liking that.

505
00:28:31,248 --> 00:28:32,848
Where's your tune-age?

506
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:48,942
Don't you just feel like dancing?

507
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:04,021
Are you feeling my Bathy girl power?

508
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:08,204
'Cause I'm pretty sure
I'm feeling your boy power.

509
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:11,599
Now, let's talk about this "F."

510
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:15,419
Must be love. Or something.

511
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,257
This is Boyd.

512
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:24,178
Boyd, it's Topher.
We're trying something in here

513
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,722
and so we're calling
all the handlers in the field

514
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,715
to let them know that I'm going
to be taking the biolink grid

515
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,130
off-line for a few seconds. So...

516
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:35,648
When, your screen goes dead,
there's nothing to worry about.

517
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:38,192
<i>What are you trying?</i>

518
00:29:39,874 --> 00:29:41,072
A remote wipe.

519
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,531
Why?

520
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:48,577
Victor's loose, doesn't have GPS
and apparently, he's a serial killer.

521
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:52,456
<i>So, what I'm going to attempt to do</i>

522
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,433
is go into his biolink feed,
which doesn't tell me

523
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:58,262
where he is, but it does give me
a way into his head.

524
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:01,090
I'm going to reverse the signal,
send a purgation tone

525
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:03,391
and blow his mind.

526
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:05,719
Literally.

527
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,264
<i>Then what? Just leave him
out there in his Doll-state?</i>

528
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,557
Totally wiped?

529
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:13,501
He'll be an empty-headed robot
wandering around Hollywood.

530
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:15,271
He'll be fine. We'll find him.

531
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,644
How will we know
if we're successful?

532
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:57,933
See this?

533
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,399
Right now, his vitals
are doing the mamba.

534
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:02,866
He's excited about something.

535
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:05,016
If the wipe takes,

536
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,105
they should flatten out.

537
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:08,329
Go.

538
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,327
You do have power over me.

539
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:49,949
You are an incredible woman.

540
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:07,939
What did you call me?

541
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:14,505
I am an incredible woman.

542
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:23,983
Hello, Mr. Langton,
how's your evening out?

543
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,499
A lot like my evenings in.

544
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:28,401
I'm afraid there's been a little bit
of a situation here.

545
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:29,860
I spoke to Topher.

546
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:32,759
- Did the remote wipe take?
- It remains to be seen.

547
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,414
The attempt seems to have thrown
the entire system off-line.

548
00:32:35,632 --> 00:32:37,538
<i>We'll know all
once Topher has rebuilt it.</i>

549
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,936
Until then, we're blind. We need
to bring in all our field Actives.

550
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:43,412
Get them in pocket till
the situation is resolved.

551
00:32:43,537 --> 00:32:45,337
- I agree.
- You'll take point on this?

552
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,783
Will do. I'll start sending
out the word.

553
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:50,521
- <i>Then grab Echo and come home.</i>
- Very good.

554
00:32:51,862 --> 00:32:53,971
I thought I would make a nice day,

555
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:57,208
but they just won't let me.

556
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:01,270
You know what?
Now they don't even get

557
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:03,095
a new Aunt Sheila.

558
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:08,508
Full recall.
Everybody's coming home.

559
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,633
Hang on. That's my other line.

560
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:13,652
This is Boyd.

561
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:17,314
Cooper, did you end the engagement?

562
00:33:17,936 --> 00:33:18,736
What?

563
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:22,875
Get back to the house.

564
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:33,260
It's fine.
Everything's going to be fine.

565
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:38,641
This is Boyd.
I need an ambulance.

566
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,226
So how did it happen?

567
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,559
- Do we even know what happened?
- My best guess?

568
00:33:43,684 --> 00:33:46,122
I had to access the biolink
grid for the remote wipe.

569
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:49,276
I thought I isolated Victor, but
everything must have gotten scrambled.

570
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:53,382
So we assume Terry Karrens imprint
somehow got transferred to Echo?

571
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:55,949
Either that, or my attempt
to make her hot for teacher

572
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,649
really didn't come off.

573
00:33:57,876 --> 00:34:00,376
If Terry is in Echo,
where did KiKi go?

574
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,055
I'm KiKi.

575
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,408
I don't know how I got here.
I sort of don't care.

576
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,076
Am I drunk?

577
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:04,875
Hang on just a minute.

578
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:15,404
I noticed you watching me.
I think we both know why.

579
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,378
"As help me God,

580
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:23,928
"I laugh when I think,

581
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:26,025
how piteously a-nyght
I made them swynke!"

582
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,669
You know what that means?

583
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,335
I have no idea,
but it's wicked filthy.

584
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,162
How about...

585
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:34,631
buying a girl a drink
before you swynke?

586
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:38,043
You think he might be what?

587
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,440
You suck!
Trying to hit a girl?!

588
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,111
Why did you ever leave me?

589
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,283
You got a problem?

590
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:06,710
I got it, I got it!

591
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,254
Let's go.

592
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:26,212
Thank God.
We thought that you were him.

593
00:36:29,037 --> 00:36:30,096
I am him.

594
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:33,816
Hello, ladies.
Ready to finish our game?

595
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,268
She's really hurt.

596
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:39,572
She's really hurt?
How do you think I feel?

597
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:41,824
You tried to kill me with a car.

598
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,534
- What?!
- What?!

599
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,766
Don't play stupid. You think
I don't know what's going on here?

600
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:49,451
What you've been up to?

601
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:51,597
We need to get her to a hospital.

602
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:55,022
Please, Mother, always
protecting your little princess.

603
00:36:55,316 --> 00:36:57,005
I am not your mother.

604
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:59,706
Then I guess I'm not your son.

605
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,989
You always said, "Be a man."

606
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:04,137
You do make it a little difficult.

607
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,980
You think...

608
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:10,656
You think...

609
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:13,692
you can make me dirty like you.

610
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:16,858
I am not...

611
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,937
<i>They are... whores.</i>

612
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:22,146
You did this to me.

613
00:37:22,271 --> 00:37:24,324
Please, we just want to leave.

614
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,863
I'll just bet you do.

615
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:28,206
Everybody always wants
to leave Terry.

616
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,457
How about you, Aunt Sheila?
Huh? You still feel like leaving?

617
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,168
Aunt Sheila?

618
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:37,136
Aunt Sheila doesn't want to leave.

619
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:41,091
I say we all take a tip from her.
You're staying.

620
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:58,294
Did I fall asleep?

621
00:38:04,086 --> 00:38:06,218
Don't engage until we know
the worm is dead.

622
00:38:06,343 --> 00:38:08,396
You have to kill it in the g-line.

623
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:11,083
- The wave is hiding.
- Why is it moving?

624
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:14,160
Because it's designed to go
where it's not supposed to.

625
00:38:14,285 --> 00:38:15,626
It's the whole point.

626
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,130
The system's still down?

627
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,409
Evidently.

628
00:38:22,543 --> 00:38:24,393
I see you've made a friend.

629
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,887
I'm KiKi.

630
00:38:33,473 --> 00:38:35,223
Okay, I think we're good.

631
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,349
All right, where is she?

632
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:40,326
Beverly Hills.

633
00:38:41,315 --> 00:38:43,028
I think she's gone shopping.

634
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:45,544
Maybe they're both KiKi.

635
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,255
He was here.

636
00:38:58,009 --> 00:38:59,309
He's still here.

637
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:07,745
He wants to kill you.

638
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:14,162
You have to kill him first.

639
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:18,842
He's coming back.

640
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,041
He's coming back!

641
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:32,119
Get away from the door.

642
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:35,175
- He won't let me.
- What are you talking about?

643
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,895
Get away from the door!

644
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,570
You have to kill him.

645
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,461
- What do you mean?
- We have to kill her.

646
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,675
Yes.

647
00:39:44,578 --> 00:39:45,632
No problem.

648
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:54,805
He'll find you.
He won't stop.

649
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:57,588
He'll never stop, he can't.

650
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:00,913
What you're saying
doesn't make sense.

651
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:03,567
It doesn't have to make sense...
it just is.

652
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,870
He took you from a shopping mall.

653
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:09,906
He followed you from your house.

654
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,701
He'd been watching you for days.

655
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:15,969
Your little house, the yellow house.

656
00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:18,540
He watched you from the street.

657
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:21,251
He sat in his car
and he watched you.

658
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:24,536
He could see your kitchen
from the street.

659
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:26,965
He saw the boy,

660
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,682
the redheaded boy.

661
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:32,471
He liked the way the boy looked at you.
That's why he took you.

662
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:37,064
He'll do it again.

663
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:43,323
You need to stop him
for that little boy.

664
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:45,108
You won't get another chance.

665
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,949
Are you okay?

666
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:55,575
I don't think so.

667
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,121
Would you like a treatment?

668
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,900
I rather like him this way.

669
00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:35,033
Even though you asked me
to get into his head,

670
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:36,931
I never really could.

671
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:40,639
His uncle's having him transported
back to the hospital this afternoon.

672
00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:43,154
Think he'll ever wake up?

673
00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:47,494
Wouldn't it be nice if he didn't.

674
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:07,844
- Good day.
- Good day.

675
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,860
I think he dreams.

676
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:29,131
Not anymore.

677
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,600
Goodness gracious.
