1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:01,292
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:03,353
I've been many people.

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,502
I can hear them.
Sometimes suddenly.

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,247
My name is November.
The only reason Mellie exists

5
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:12,261
- is because of you.
- Remember our deal.

6
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:14,597
The young lady's freedom
has been granted.

7
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:16,385
Just because you leave our care,

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,768
we don't cast you
to the wolves, Madeline.

9
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:21,562
I'm worried about you.

10
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,425
There is nothing less
than a conspiracy,

11
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:26,942
spearheaded
by the Rossum Corporation.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,821
I'm sure he was looking for a cause.
Someone gave him us.

13
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,365
Prostitution?

14
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:34,215
Human trafficking?

15
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,702
- Maybe murder.
- We're going to verify all this.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,670
We're going to find proof.

17
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:41,707
We've got better than proof.

18
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,291
We've got a name.

19
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:48,070
There is nothing to worry about.

20
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:49,756
Did security vet everyone?

21
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:52,548
Metal detectors, hand wands,
the occasional frisk...

22
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:53,719
Occasional?

23
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,888
Relax.
The Rossum Corporation's evil,

24
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:59,308
not stupid. They're not gonna try
anything while the cameras are rolling.

25
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:02,821
- You really aren't nervous.
- I'm terrified.

26
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:06,509
I'm about to put an innocent woman up
against the largest corporations,

27
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,068
and I have no idea
how they're going to react.

28
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:11,578
Remind me why I love you so much.

29
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:14,175
I'm your white knight.

30
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,908
And I'm your beautiful damsel.

31
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,126
Ever after.

32
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:19,871
Ever after the press conference.

33
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,455
Ten minutes late. Huh?

34
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:28,328
Good afternoon. In the past weeks,
I have made some serious charge

35
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:30,089
Charges of corporate malfeasance

36
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,675
on the part of several medical
research companies.

37
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:34,982
Charges which will receive

38
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:38,014
a full airing on Capitol Hill
this week when hearings begin.

39
00:01:38,642 --> 00:01:41,818
At those hearings, you will hear
a most innocent word,

40
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,936
a word which will take on
a new and grim meaning.

41
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,269
A word that will become synonymous
with human trafficking,

42
00:01:48,394 --> 00:01:49,442
prostitution

43
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,278
and unconscionable abuses
of neural technology,

44
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:55,821
directly traceable back
to the Rossum Corporation.

45
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:59,016
That word is "Dollhouse".

46
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,125
An urban myth
that has become all too real.

47
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,087
Where people have their memories
erased and are brainwashed

48
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:13,656
to do things that would appall
the most cynical among us.

49
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:15,638
Today,

50
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,429
I want to put a face on this issue.

51
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:21,390
I have a witness
who lost three years

52
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,745
of her life to the Dollhouse.

53
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,622
She would like
to make a brief statement.

54
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:37,907
My name is Madeline Costley.

55
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,681
Three years of my life are gone,

56
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,746
stolen by the Dollhouse.

57
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:48,032
They preyed on me
when I was at my weakest

58
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:49,607
and forced me to...

59
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,699
And forced me to do things.

60
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,341
Things I never
would have believed...

61
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:58,644
until Senator Perrin
showed me evidence.

62
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,141
I almost wish I hadn't seen it.

63
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,101
But then I wouldn't be here.

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,896
And there are still people being
held captive by the Dollhouse.

65
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:12,524
They don't even know they need help.

66
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,339
So, that means we have to help.

67
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,924
We applaud Miss Costley's bravery,
and we ask that you respect her privacy

68
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,342
<i>throughout the inquiry process.</i>

69
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:30,948
Remind me why you released her
from her contract two years early.

70
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:32,417
It was an internal matter.

71
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,337
Right.
Something to do with keeping you

72
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,748
from exposing this house
to the public.

73
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,967
That worked out.

74
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,721
Something, obviously,
has gone very wrong.

75
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,780
But the protocol at this
house cannot be blamed.

76
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:47,834
There has been nothing
in her reintegration

77
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,485
that would suggest...

78
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,383
That she was about to go before a senate
subcommittee and start naming names?

79
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:56,145
I'm not questioning
your protocol, Adelle.

80
00:03:56,551 --> 00:04:00,030
It's your judgment
that's become the issue here.

81
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:03,826
There's some concern you may have
developed a soft spot for this one.

82
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,045
Like you did with Nolan's girl.

83
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:08,078
What was she called? Sierra?

84
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,749
How would you like us to proceed?

85
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:13,156
By doing nothing.

86
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,963
Rossum already has a plan
in place to deal with Madeline.

87
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:18,518
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

88
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:23,512
- Your house will be covered.
- May I ask how?

89
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:26,248
It's handled.
That's all you need to know.

90
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,574
I'm already late
for a satellite tour

91
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,977
where I get to run PR flack
against this mess.

92
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:33,497
Talk up Rossum's good works,

93
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:36,191
our groundbreaking
Alzheimer's treatment...

94
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:39,592
I'll be sure to watch.

95
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,286
Oh, we'll all be watching.

96
00:04:44,457 --> 00:04:46,657
So just how much danger is she in?

97
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,376
A former Active once made
a passing reference to us

98
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,624
in his blog.

99
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,449
That was his last entry.

100
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,126
So going
before the United States Senate...

101
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,076
- That would be worse.
- Considerably.

102
00:04:58,201 --> 00:04:59,918
We can't just sit by
and let this happen.

103
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,799
I have no intention
of just sitting by.

104
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,719
He told you to do nothing.

105
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,338
Indeed, he did not.

106
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,695
I inquired how he would
wanted us to proceed,

107
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,809
and given the context,
I would call his response a suggestion.

108
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,395
You framed it
before he could tell you what to do.

109
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,817
Madeline will not be testifying
in front of any senate subcommittee.

110
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,942
She was quite happy
when she left us.

111
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,267
Now she's not.

112
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,919
She's being used.

113
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:24,573
You have developed a soft spot.

114
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,142
You miss my point.

115
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:28,326
She's being used against me.

116
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,572
Someone with inside
knowledge has served her up

117
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,847
to this crusading junior senator.

118
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,560
So, what's your next move?

119
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,837
To discover what game
is being played.

120
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,562
Daniel Perrin.
Political family.

121
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:46,929
Third in his line to become
a United States senator.

122
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,938
Started policing medical research
just under three years ago.

123
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:53,727
<i>No one is saying the work
these corporations do isn't vital,</i>

124
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,395
<i>but there must be accountability.</i>

125
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,531
<i>The health of our citizens
cannot be held hostage</i>

126
00:05:58,656 --> 00:05:59,775
<i>to a profit motive.</i>

127
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,988
He's a demagogue. Look at him.
So concerned about the public.

128
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:07,691
And when he shuts down all research,
we can go back to leeches.

129
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:10,786
- So why isn't Rossum worried?
- Maybe they've got dirt on him.

130
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,903
- They would have used it by now.
- November is sad.

131
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:17,418
<i>- I almost wish I hadn't seen it...
- She's been there for years.</i>

132
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,253
<i>... but then I wouldn't be here.</i>

133
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:22,006
- Yes, she is.
- We should help her.

134
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,227
That's just what we're going to do.

135
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,721
- She's not right.
- We got that the first time, Echo.

136
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,789
She doesn't mean Madeline.

137
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,167
<i>Only that it took that long.</i>

138
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,938
<i>I was sure the moment
I laid eyes him.</i>

139
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,120
<i>I couldn't let her get away.</i>

140
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:41,400
<i>She's perfect.</i>

141
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:43,777
<i>It's like they made her
just for me. </i>

142
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,199
Episode 205: <i>The Public Eye</i>

143
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:16,852
www.subbercafe.fr

144
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,995
<i>I couldn't let her get away.</i>

145
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:21,420
<i>She's perfect.</i>

146
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,845
<i>It's like they made her just for me.</i>

147
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:26,690
He's not lying.

148
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:28,570
At first glance, she's perfect.

149
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,045
At second glance,

150
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:31,620
she's still perfect.

151
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:33,202
Skip to the part where she's not.

152
00:07:33,445 --> 00:07:35,800
You look hard enough,
you start to see discrepancies.

153
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:38,610
Her parents' social security numbers
don't match with their names.

154
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:40,383
Her college transcript
weighted her GPA

155
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:42,470
even though Berkley
doesn't calculate like that.

156
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,595
Forgeries.

157
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,506
Some of the best I've seen.

158
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:47,545
Cindy Perrin is a Doll.

159
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:52,475
Harding was being modest
when he said Rossum had a plan in place.

160
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,348
They've been married
for three years.

161
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:56,115
Long-term placement.

162
00:07:56,385 --> 00:08:00,229
She clearly wasn't imprinted
to dissuade him from going after Rossum.

163
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,147
She's a sleeper.

164
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:03,774
An assassin, you mean?

165
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:07,860
- Like Madeline when she was Mellie?
- Oh, please. She didn't kill you.

166
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:11,156
Mrs. Perrin's going to be activated
when things get too hot.

167
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,965
I'd say things are warmish.

168
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,139
Even Harding's too smart
to murder a sitting US senator.

169
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,623
But he wouldn't think twice about having
a sleeper assassin take out Madeline.

170
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,320
It won't come to that.

171
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:23,794
You're going to stop her
before she gets to Madeline.

172
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,815
Senator Perrin moved them both
to a safe house

173
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,205
by a security firm
called Contratech.

174
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,842
Where's Perrin?

175
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:32,209
His senate team is still working out
of the downtown hotel

176
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,565
where they held their press conference,
the Commerce Plaza.

177
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,860
He's still there.

178
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:38,135
So tell me about this safe house.

179
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:40,650
Ten minutes from downtown.

180
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,530
Quiet, residential neighborhood.

181
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,534
The house is covered
with surveillance.

182
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,067
I'm working on getting access
to Contratech's servers.

183
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,560
Just give me the address.
I'll go get Madeline.

184
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:52,345
It will be a touch more difficult
than playing cat burglar,

185
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,032
especially if Cindy Perrin is there.

186
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,162
You'll need to understand
what it is you'll be up against.

187
00:09:04,095 --> 00:09:05,595
That's my apartment.

188
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,882
Mellie.

189
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,637
Once a sleeper Active's protocol
has been triggered,

190
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,015
the thing you're facing will be
neither reasoned with nor stopped.

191
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,437
<i>There are three flowers in a vase.</i>

192
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:26,045
<i>The third flower is green.</i>

193
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:31,895
I get the idea.

194
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:41,060
Madeline easily dispensed
with a man twice her size.

195
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:43,585
Cindy Perrin will be
no less capable.

196
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,945
Any sympathy for Mr. Hearn
would be misplaced.

197
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,075
He was a serial rapist.

198
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:55,265
I wasn't thinking about him.

199
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:15,355
Last time I was at the Dollhouse,

200
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:19,465
he seemed so kind and...

201
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:21,845
gentle.

202
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,293
You can never tell what monsters
people are hiding inside.

203
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,924
Like me?

204
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:36,009
Why would you say that?

205
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:41,335
I killed someone.

206
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:46,295
For the rest of my life...

207
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:51,024
I'm going to know
that I killed someone.

208
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,642
You didn't do this.

209
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,485
The Dollhouse did.

210
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,654
And that's why
you're gonna testify against them.

211
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:10,575
Hello.

212
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,881
How are the two most important ladies
in my life?

213
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:17,485
You're sweet, Daniel.

214
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,928
But I can't talk.
Madeline's having a rough time.

215
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:22,015
Go, take care of her.

216
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:26,010
I'm gonna stay at the hotel and go over
the financials, if you need me.

217
00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:29,563
- <i>Remind me why I love you so much.</i>
- I'm your white knight.

218
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:31,648
And I'm your beautiful damsel.

219
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,255
Ever after.

220
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:42,865
What is it?

221
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,813
It's the thing that if it doesn't work
exactly like it should,

222
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:48,165
won't get me in trouble.

223
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,001
I call it a disrupter.

224
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:53,503
That's not too Star Trek, is it?

225
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:54,885
T.O.S.?

226
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:01,136
It's based off what I could deconstruct
from Alpha's remote wipe tech.

227
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,847
This is the same tech
that turned Echo into a serial killer.

228
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:06,183
We said we wouldn't dwell on that.
He's dwelling.

229
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:07,955
Continue.

230
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,750
You push this button,

231
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,294
and it sends a neuro-electric
feedback loop

232
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,683
through the biolinks implant,
disrupting the cranial architecture.

233
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:18,243
If the frequency
is calibrated to match...

234
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:21,073
Less tell, more show.

235
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:24,576
Hello, Kilo.

236
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,040
Is it time for my treatment?

237
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,015
Isn't she so cute and tiny?

238
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:32,365
I love it when a Doll's name
is so on the nose.

239
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:34,965
Because she weighs one kilo.

240
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,563
It's a unit of measurement.

241
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:39,895
I'm so alone.

242
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,760
I enjoy my treatments.

243
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,878
Yes, we know,
but you probably won't enjoy this.

244
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:49,975
The gentle hum lets you know
it's working.

245
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:53,355
Side effects include
headache, bloody nose

246
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,023
and the uncontrollable urge to...

247
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,943
It'll knock out any Doll
in a ten-foot radius,

248
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:03,118
including a pesky sleeper
like Cindy,

249
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:06,343
without actually harming
real people like us.

250
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:11,535
Make that a 50-foot radius.

251
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,889
Good.

252
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:16,615
So I'll drop Mrs. Perrin
and I'll pick up Madeline.

253
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:20,295
What?

254
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:22,250
You're more right than you know.

255
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,720
If Madeline is in range,
it will bring her down as well.

256
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,606
I thought it only worked on Dolls.

257
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,266
It would affect anyone
with Active architecture.

258
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:31,590
But you released her.

259
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:33,854
Why would she still have
your architecture in her head?

260
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:39,095
No one ever really
leaves here, do they?

261
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:55,808
It's time for a treatment.

262
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:03,715
Do I get to help November?

263
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:07,550
If he makes me someone else,
I won't be able to help her.

264
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:08,775
That's okay.

265
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:11,745
The person Topher's gonna make you
is going to help us.

266
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:22,146
Her handler's not gonna be happy

267
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:24,489
when he learns
you sent her out without him.

268
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:28,158
Mr. Ballard is unhappy about
a great many things at the moment.

269
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:31,026
His complete focus needs to be
on Madeline's retrieval.

270
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,163
You sure you don't want me
to cover her engagement?

271
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,531
I need you on point in operations.

272
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,175
Echo will be fine.

273
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,836
Any qualified interim handler
will do.

274
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:42,214
- I'll send Edwards.
- Fine.

275
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,360
Just tell him not to nod off.

276
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:47,185
Echo's gonna be doing
most of the "handling" on this one.

277
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,875
Try the Transit Limited account,

278
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,980
the one that paid out to Madeline.

279
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:02,045
See if we can run
a trace on it again.

280
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:06,355
Maybe it'll link back
to a Rossum subsidiary.

281
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,067
You know what, Burt,

282
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:12,750
it's getting late.

283
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,667
Let's finish this in the morning.

284
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:39,980
Wake up, Mr. Senator.

285
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,149
I wanna make sure
I get your good side.

286
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,015
Hi.

287
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:51,073
Trust me, you've got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

288
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:52,784
What the hell? Who the hell are you?

289
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,270
Oh, you forgot me already?
I'm hurt.

290
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:56,745
I'm Bree.

291
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:59,916
I don't know you!
I've never seen you in my life!

292
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:03,700
Hate to disagree with you, Senator,
but you've seen all of me.

293
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:06,207
I can show you the instant replay
if you'd like.

294
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,575
I blacked out.

295
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,655
You had to have drugged me.

296
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:17,713
Should we order some champagne?
I think we should order some champagne.

297
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:20,394
We'll just bill it
to the taxpayers, right?

298
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,564
Stop it!

299
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:22,932
Shut up.

300
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:26,812
I have to think.

301
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,904
Fine, Testy.
I'll leave, then.

302
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,077
I sent the really good stuff
to my employers before you woke up.

303
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,825
I just stuck around because I've got
a message for you first.

304
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,799
Rossum sent you.

305
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,436
I just go where I'm told.
I don't get names.

306
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:47,999
The message is,

307
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:50,871
back off.

308
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,750
So, thanks for the fun times.

309
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,675
I'll get out of your hair.

310
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:02,628
Nice. I like it a little rough.

311
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:04,439
Just don't touch the face.

312
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:05,629
My God.

313
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,208
Or I could tie you up.

314
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,037
It's amazing.

315
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:12,286
So real.

316
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:16,758
You're a Doll.

317
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,414
Thanks. You're cute, too.

318
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:24,551
Rossum would never risk
hiring a call girl.

319
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,838
Not when they can
programs someone instead.

320
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:32,017
Whose memory they can erase
when they're done.

321
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,429
They didn't tell me you were crazy.
I typically charge more for that.

322
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:38,195
You're a Doll.

323
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,870
You're not real.

324
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:43,045
Dude, maybe you should
take a nap, sleep this off.

325
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:44,875
We're leaving.

326
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,435
Where are we going?

327
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,810
To see my wife.

328
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,443
You're twisted.
I like that a lot.

329
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,266
Threesomes are extra,

330
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:55,896
but I might just give
you a freebie, Senator.

331
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,006
Langton.

332
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,690
I have eyes I need you to take out.

333
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:15,552
<i>It's gonna take a second.</i>

334
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,639
Uploading malware now.

335
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,729
Got it.
You're clear to move.

336
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:45,886
Try to understand what I'm saying.

337
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,499
You are not you.

338
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:51,997
This place, this Dollhouse,
has altered you,

339
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,563
brainwashed you.

340
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:57,197
They've turned you
into someone else.

341
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:02,891
I know it's a lot to absorb.
I don't mean to upset you.

342
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,929
So is this some sort
of fantasy scenario?

343
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:08,580
Because I don't get it.
When do we get naked again?

344
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:09,689
Listen to me.

345
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,593
You've been manipulated.

346
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,861
You were probably desperate
and alone,

347
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:17,139
and they used that against you.

348
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,572
Forced you to be a slave
so the wealthy can have a play toy.

349
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:24,198
It's despicable.

350
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,549
I'll prove it to you.

351
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,585
- What is your mother's name?
- Denise.

352
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:34,224
- Where were you born? Your birthday?
- Duluth. August 6th.

353
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,091
I have 2 brothers.

354
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:39,526
I tried to be a dancer in New York,
but I made more money as an escort.

355
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:41,400
Do you really want
to know my life story?

356
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,575
The programming is so detailed.

357
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,101
Of course it is.

358
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,278
Look, you're very sweet,

359
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:51,636
but you should know,
I like what I do.

360
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,028
You're not the first John
who thinks he can save me.

361
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,777
But I can save you.
I can save all of you.

362
00:19:58,953 --> 00:20:01,253
If I don't stop Rossum, no one will.

363
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:04,536
You're a real hero.

364
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:08,623
I just want to do what's right.

365
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:12,063
Senator, no offense,
but if you want to do the right thing,

366
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:14,086
bringing your hooker mistress
to your wife

367
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:16,131
probably isn't a great idea.
Just saying.

368
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,783
Cindy knows the top neurologists
in the country.

369
00:20:18,908 --> 00:20:20,258
She can help you.

370
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:23,694
And... I need you.

371
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:26,837
You're evidence.

372
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:29,948
Sounds like overtime to me.

373
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:41,100
Listen to me.

374
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:44,218
Listen to me. These people
are not who you think they are.

375
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,035
Okay, they are tricking you.

376
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,840
Do you trust me?

377
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:51,875
Good. We have to get out of here.

378
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:55,837
Let go of me!

379
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:59,507
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- I know exactly what you did to me!

380
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,130
Get away from her!

381
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,711
Right now.

382
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,040
Don't come any closer.

383
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,058
You need my help
just as much as she does.

384
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,812
You're not a Doll.

385
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,347
This is new.

386
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:41,138
What the hell was that?

387
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,018
It's Echo. I don't get it.
Is she anywhere near Ballard?

388
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,354
Why?

389
00:21:54,722 --> 00:21:56,581
Because her neural
architecture is cascading,

390
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:58,700
which means she just got
zapped with the disrupter.

391
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,902
According to her GPS signal,
she's at that safe house.

392
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:03,973
Inform her temporary handler
he needn't return.

393
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,657
Bring up the security feed.

394
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,329
Okay, so either they just
got into a fistfight,

395
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,581
in which case, "Go, Echo," or...

396
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,312
Senator Perrin is the Doll.

397
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,002
We've been chasing the wrong person.

398
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,756
- That would make Cindy...
- Perrin's handler.

399
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,259
Get Ballard on the phone.
Warn him.

400
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:27,929
Harding made a senator.

401
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:31,015
And sicced him on the Dollhouse.
That makes sense how?

402
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:32,412
I don't know.

403
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:35,094
Unless he's trying to sabotage
this house specifically.

404
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:36,187
No answer.

405
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:37,707
Guys?

406
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:42,485
Echo just kidnapped the conspiracy.

407
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:57,908
- Where are you taking me?
- I don't know. Anywhere else.

408
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:00,128
As long as there's
a big fat aspirin.

409
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,211
We have to go back.
My wife is back there.

410
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:04,007
No way. Nothing's turning me around.

411
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:27,752
Everything you said is true.

412
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,044
Slow down.

413
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:31,083
There are...

414
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:32,428
gaps.

415
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:34,553
Things that aren't filled in.

416
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,481
I can see other people,

417
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,317
- other lives, through them.
- You're going to get us killed.

418
00:23:41,356 --> 00:23:44,669
It's like I can see the seams.
How it's all constructed.

419
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,342
I'm not real.

420
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,344
I'm not who I think am.

421
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:54,335
I am a Doll.

422
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,703
Make sure you get her
on an earlier flight.

423
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:04,146
I'll meet you at the airport
as soon as I talk to the police.

424
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:09,647
LA Dollhouse's latest idiot hire.

425
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:13,451
DeWitt had explicit instructions
to leave this alone.

426
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:15,895
I think it was more of a suggestion.

427
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:18,452
Who are you?

428
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:20,673
I'm Mrs. Cynthia Perrin.

429
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:24,015
You're not a Doll.

430
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:28,716
Because this didn't work on me?
What the hell is this?

431
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,245
But you are a Dollhouse...

432
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,376
Doesn't matter.

433
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,508
We have our own experts.
We'll figure it out.

434
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:36,599
Pack this with my luggage.
The black case.

435
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,186
It's got to get through security.

436
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,770
Better they don't see it.

437
00:24:40,137 --> 00:24:43,356
So why does Rossum want one of their
ex-Actives to testify against them?

438
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,152
Wait until I leave,
then make sure he ends up face-down

439
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:49,487
- in the river.
- Good.

440
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:51,445
I go find Perrin.
Meet you at the airport.

441
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,220
Do not miss the flight.

442
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:02,077
I know you're scared,
but we cannot keep running like this.

443
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:04,419
You said you can help me.
How are you going to help me?

444
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:11,303
Oh, God.

445
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:13,593
Stop the car!

446
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:20,601
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

447
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:22,645
Everywhere.

448
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,772
I need to get away from it.
How can I?

449
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,275
I don't think you can.

450
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:34,382
I think you're a Doll.

451
00:25:34,507 --> 00:25:35,408
Like me.

452
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:41,581
I know who I am.
I know who I am!

453
00:25:45,693 --> 00:25:47,605
Please tell me I know who I am.

454
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:50,233
I think I know who he is.

455
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:53,342
He's Senator Daniel Perrin.

456
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,941
So he's not a Doll?

457
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:58,045
He's Senator Daniel Perrin,
and he's a Doll.

458
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:01,003
He's a Doll version of himself.

459
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:05,130
His family's political dynasty
goes back generations.

460
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:06,794
Congressmen, senators,

461
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,613
even a great uncle
who was governor of Vermont.

462
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:12,677
But Perrin himself
was a party-boy screw-up,

463
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,402
well into his mid-30s.

464
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:16,677
Before he washed out at Yale,

465
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:20,582
he was voted most likely
to wake up in a pool of his own sick.

466
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,414
- He was selected for his pedigree.
- But his ambition?

467
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,375
Somebody else gave that to him.

468
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,468
Would you be open to a bribe?

469
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:37,929
Get up.

470
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:57,560
You're gonna miss your flight.

471
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:00,409
They stopped moving.

472
00:27:00,806 --> 00:27:02,718
- They've been captured?
- I don't know.

473
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:05,003
But I think the team I sent
to intercept them has.

474
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:05,919
What?

475
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:09,252
I had a retrieval team en route,
but they stopped here,

476
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,928
and they're not responding.

477
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,549
That's the cover number.

478
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:16,041
That'd be Bree calling in
to her escort agency.

479
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:21,013
Hello?

480
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,473
What did you do to him?

481
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,485
I guess that's who I am now.

482
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,479
Mostly.

483
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:30,523
Bree, is the senator with you?

484
00:27:31,936 --> 00:27:33,567
If he is a senator.

485
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:36,114
<i>Right now,
he just looks like a basket case.</i>

486
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:39,031
<i>You did this to him.</i>

487
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:41,591
<i>But I can help him.</i>

488
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:44,078
I think I believe you.

489
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,955
Of course you do.
That's why you called.

490
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,891
A treatment?

491
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:50,668
Yes, a treatment.

492
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:52,420
It will make him feel better.

493
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:55,462
No "treatment."
I know what that means.

494
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:58,008
I know everything about you people.

495
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,178
I am Senator Perrin.

496
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:04,163
I am not a Doll.

497
00:28:04,887 --> 00:28:05,850
You're not.

498
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,143
Strictly speaking.

499
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,236
<i>You were born Daniel Perrin,</i>

500
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,439
<i>but the man you are today
is part-manufactured.</i>

501
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,347
Your mind has been altered.

502
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,817
Tampered with.

503
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:17,297
What are you talking about?

504
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:18,696
<i>Someone is controlling you.</i>

505
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,657
I can help you find out who
and to what purpose.

506
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,951
Why should I believe
anything you say?

507
00:28:24,407 --> 00:28:26,370
Because I am the person
who programmed Bree

508
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,997
<i>to blackmail you.</i>

509
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:30,396
<i>If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.</i>

510
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,196
You don't want me dead.

511
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,046
I feel like we're really bonding.

512
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,089
<i>Let's discuss bonding, shall we?</i>

513
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:39,175
Let's discuss your wife.

514
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
Senator?

515
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:47,391
It's her, isn't it?

516
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,046
She's not right.
We should go. Now.

517
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:52,313
Where have you been?

518
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:55,711
- Who is that woman?
- What?

519
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,262
I don't even care what this means.

520
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:01,864
We were never here.
I never saw her. Let's just go.

521
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,824
Yeah, let's do that.
Let's just go.

522
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,034
Get away from me.

523
00:29:07,277 --> 00:29:09,170
I don't know what's happening to me.

524
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,208
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
We'll figure it out.

525
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:15,185
Remind me why I love you so much.

526
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:21,027
I'm your white knight.

527
00:29:22,568 --> 00:29:24,889
And I'm your beautiful damsel.

528
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,711
Ever after.

529
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,546
Ever after.

530
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:31,099
That it?

531
00:29:34,993 --> 00:29:36,273
Oh, God...

532
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:39,318
It's all a lie.

533
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,637
I'm not going with you.

534
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,134
- Take me to the Dollhouse.
- Not a chance.

535
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:48,871
You won't shoot me.

536
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:50,824
You're my handler.

537
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,174
That's true.

538
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:54,820
But I'm not hers.

539
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,285
You won't shoot her.

540
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,174
That's not who you are.
Put the gun down.

541
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:03,469
Don't come any closer.

542
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:04,719
Please, come closer.

543
00:30:06,236 --> 00:30:07,721
What the hell are you doing?

544
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,351
She's not going to remember
and neither are you.

545
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:13,978
We're going back to DC,

546
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,272
so you can forget
any of this ever happened.

547
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,736
You wouldn't.

548
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,548
You couldn't.

549
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:26,115
Not your beautiful damsel.

550
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:27,867
You love me.

551
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,122
Good. That's it.

552
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:35,147
Put it down.

553
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:37,501
Now, we have to go.

554
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,833
You just woke up a lot of people.

555
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,595
And they all think you're a bitch.

556
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,888
She hit me, Daniel.

557
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,056
You're not my wife.

558
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:52,933
Don't!

559
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:10,534
I'm on your team!

560
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,577
I love her.

561
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,995
I know.

562
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,165
But I don't have that problem.

563
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:30,235
Sorry about that. Come on.
I know where you can get some help.

564
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,803
You want to take me to them?
They're all bad guys, Bree.

565
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:35,351
I think her bad guys
are badder than my bad guys.

566
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,831
She's not your wife.

567
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,191
Come on.

568
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:01,604
Right on time.

569
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:05,685
Call airport security now.

570
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,808
If I can't face him, how can I stand up
to a multi-billion dollar corporation?

571
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,084
- We've got to get you out of here.
- Who was I?

572
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:27,613
Who was I that made you
so obsessed with me?

573
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:28,930
Now's not the time.

574
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:30,948
It's the only chance you get.

575
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,956
Her name was Mellie.
She was my neighbor.

576
00:32:40,014 --> 00:32:42,814
I was FBI, and she was helping me
with my investigation.

577
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,254
That was the fantasy?

578
00:32:46,171 --> 00:32:47,318
I was your girl Friday

579
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:49,216
who you slept with
the other six days?

580
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,885
It wasn't a fantasy.

581
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:53,679
I was FBI.
And I didn't know Mellie was a Doll.

582
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,492
The Dollhouse tricked me, too.

583
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:57,713
So that made you
want to work for them?

584
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:02,104
It was part of a deal I made
with them to get you out.

585
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,948
I agree to work for them,
they free you.

586
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,817
So I should be thanking you?

587
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,857
I want them to fall
just as hard as you do.

588
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:11,488
Then let me testify.

589
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,533
They want you to testify against them.
It's a trick.

590
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:18,078
Mellie, if you do this,
it would be a mistake.

591
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:20,803
I'm not Mellie.

592
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,075
I know that.

593
00:33:30,002 --> 00:33:31,602
You said you freed me.

594
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:35,095
When someone's free,
they get to make mistakes.

595
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:38,722
Am I free?

596
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,722
Echo's vitals and GPS gone.

597
00:34:17,953 --> 00:34:19,176
How is that possible?

598
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:21,239
It's not. It shouldn't be.

599
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,296
Someone just did something
they definitely shouldn't be able to do.

600
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:29,410
Echo's gone.

601
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,099
Senator Perrin, too.

602
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:33,905
<i>Call Mr. Ballard
before you return to the House.</i>

603
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,300
<i>Perhaps he had more luck
with Madeline.</i>

604
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,343
Still no word from Ballard.

605
00:34:56,995 --> 00:35:00,362
Madeline is no doubt halfway across
the continent on her way to testify

606
00:35:00,487 --> 00:35:04,268
in front the Senate Subcommittee
on Ethical Neuroscience.

607
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,228
Why would Harding
hang us out to dry like that?

608
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:09,778
If we fall, half of Rossum
comes down with us.

609
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:11,741
With Perrin under his power,

610
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:13,736
Harding controls
how far the damage goes.

611
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,114
The Senate Committee will clear Rossum
of any contact with us.

612
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:21,172
And Perrin will be hailed
as the conquering hero

613
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,517
who's rescued all these poor souls.

614
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,707
He'll have the political capital
to pass whatever laws and regulations

615
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,349
Rossum programmed him to.

616
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:29,835
They'll be unstoppable.

617
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:31,378
Yes, they will.

618
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:32,901
So what do we do?

619
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:35,935
Stop them.

620
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:46,798
Thank you, Grace.

621
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,841
How soon till the senator gets here?

622
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,472
They said any minute.

623
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:53,197
Athena's diagnostic can wait.
I want a clear runway.

624
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,630
Daniel Perrin's our bright star.

625
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:59,427
Apparently, they're bringing in
the L.A. Active that kidnapped him, too.

626
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:02,992
We'll have a look at her
once the senator's squared away.

627
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:06,058
It's confirmed
she's from L.A., right?

628
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:09,381
Why would they move against us?

629
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:11,376
Keep your mind on your work, please.

630
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,124
The moment you start wondering
about the people upstairs,

631
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:17,449
they'll start wondering about you.

632
00:36:17,998 --> 00:36:20,498
- That isn't a thing you want.
- Sorry.

633
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,180
Curiosity.
It's perfectly natural.

634
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,183
We have urges,

635
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,269
and we are in the business of urges,
so why not indulge?

636
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:33,472
How many sugars?

637
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:35,025
Two-and-a-half.

638
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:38,275
But we can't.

639
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,808
We never can... indulge.

640
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:42,591
We have a sacred trust.

641
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:45,201
We have the privilege
of living inside the human heart,

642
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,317
for which we give up everything.

643
00:36:49,419 --> 00:36:51,019
We give up everything.

644
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,980
This is Bennett.

645
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:02,678
Yes, sir.
It won't be a problem.

646
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:05,622
As soon as I get
Senator Perrin's body.

647
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:08,822
I assumed we'd fill him
with travel memories...

648
00:37:08,947 --> 00:37:11,141
a layover in Milwaukee,
some turbulence...

649
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:14,297
and something to explain
any dehydration or disorientation.

650
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:16,925
Bad shrimp or...
or a film with a dog.

651
00:37:18,523 --> 00:37:21,473
If you could please just make sure
that no one touches him.

652
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:25,815
Do we have any information
about the other Active, the woman?

653
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:29,959
Might be useful to scan her,
see if we can lock down her parameters.

654
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:31,622
It might give an indication...

655
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:34,700
I'll report as soon as I can.

656
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:37,931
They're coming down.

657
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:43,311
Hades comes in at 6:00 after a long-term
with the closeted councilman.

658
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:45,186
Just keep him in holding.

659
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:48,092
And cancel Aphrodite.

660
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:55,507
Why is Hades still on the table?

661
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,115
- It should have been...
- It should.

662
00:37:58,298 --> 00:37:59,298
Should.

663
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:01,145
Not was. Is.

664
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,687
Condition contrary to fact: should.
Contrary to fact. Like a lie.

665
00:38:06,824 --> 00:38:07,824
Should.

666
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:09,197
Should.

667
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:16,437
Here we are.

668
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,865
Is he unconscious?

669
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,881
I can't work him
if he's unconscious.

670
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,002
Prep the mask,
recompile the Perrin imprint

671
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:25,552
and spool up the memory buffers.

672
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,982
And the second Active?

673
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:28,246
Put her in first.

674
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:30,663
I'll look at her for a bit
while the senator comes to.

675
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:33,685
Spool his buffers and table them,
keep him in holding.

676
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,694
You know what, you can go.

677
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:38,148
I need to focus.

678
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,691
I can help you.

679
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,818
I have to focus, please!
Thank you.

680
00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:44,705
I need this...

681
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:48,359
to focus on this.

682
00:38:49,258 --> 00:38:50,201
Thank you.

683
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:58,338
Bennett, another migraine?

684
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,120
All in my head.

685
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,158
Your problems are all external.

686
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:10,451
More things to explain
in Perrin's imprint.

687
00:39:11,456 --> 00:39:13,187
What should we go with?

688
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:14,454
Mugging?

689
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:16,642
Tumble down the stairs?

690
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,605
How about he beats his wife?

691
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,527
The senator doesn't beat his wife.
The senator loves his wife.

692
00:39:23,866 --> 00:39:24,916
Lucky wife.

693
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,889
I brought you a souvenir.

694
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:29,714
The tech that fried him.

695
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:33,156
Binaural transmitter.

696
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:36,343
Solid state capacitors.
Nanoscale solders.

697
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,059
I know this hand.

698
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,359
This is Topher Brink.

699
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,041
I've always wanted to meet his tech.

700
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,011
Don't.

701
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,052
Unless you want to drop
every Doll in the House.

702
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,725
My, my, my.

703
00:39:58,219 --> 00:39:59,519
How do you work?

704
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,375
The hearing starts in ten hours.

705
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:05,986
If Perrin's not there, the plan is
blown, and we're demoted to being dead.

706
00:40:14,075 --> 00:40:15,481
The other Active's slabbed.

707
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:17,442
This one's semiconscious.

708
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,808
Not a threat,
but you should be able to work soon.

709
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:22,383
His call and response
stopped working.

710
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:24,921
I'm going to have to rebuild
the CR10 relays to the amygdala.

711
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:26,784
A fun time for me.

712
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:31,133
We'll see how much cognitive damage
the imprint sustained.

713
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,874
Get away from me.

714
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:45,068
Get away!

715
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,817
It's going to be a full overwrite.

716
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,202
Please, don't erase me!

717
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,722
Please don't!

718
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:52,157
I don't want to forget.

719
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,115
Please...

720
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,270
It's my mind.

721
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,080
Not for some time now.

722
00:40:58,733 --> 00:40:59,936
Oh, God.

723
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:01,871
Who are you?

724
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,144
She's God, honey.

725
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,129
And you've heartily offended her.

726
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:10,425
Don't you need to make sure
L.A. hasn't tracked them here?

727
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:11,843
We left clean.

728
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,303
Will you please make sure?
Will you please make sure?

729
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:16,275
Will you please make sure?

730
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,268
It's going to be all right.

731
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,396
Better than all right.

732
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,712
This is sick.

733
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:26,149
You are sick.

734
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:29,820
Who's to say?
We'll start working in just a moment.

735
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:49,420
Where am I?

736
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,042
Caroline...

737
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:56,075
You always promised
you'd come back to me.

738
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,212
Let's play.
