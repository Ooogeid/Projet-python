00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,318
Previously on Dollhouse:

2
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:06,675
Caroline, are you

3
00:00:06,676 --> 00:00:07,902
volunteering to...
I don't have

4
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:09,702
a choice, do I?
I'm talking

5
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:11,293
about a clean slate.

6
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:14,690
Everything go all right
with the wipe?

7
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:16,589
Why don't you just ask Echo?

8
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:17,873
Oh, that's right.

9
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,252
Because she can't remember.

10
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:20,397
Dollhouse.

11
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:22,498
Say it.
Okay, Dollhouse.

12
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:23,325
Doll-freaking-house.

13
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:24,466
Paul, let me ask you.

14
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:26,848
Do you think the Dollhouse
really exists?

15
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:27,955
I know it does.

16
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:31,262
The situation
is a kidnap-and-ransom.

17
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:32,974
I don't want Rambo.

18
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,492
I want a negotiator.

19
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:36,186
I'm here to help.
Anything goes wrong

20
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:38,946
or feels wrong,
you extract Echo immediately.

21
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:44,590
Now tell me how we're going
to contain this.

22
00:00:46,944 --> 00:00:48,102
Laugh, yearbook monkey.

23
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,903
I'm know, I'm such a cliché.

24
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:51,428
What can I say?

25
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:54,820
I want to do everything.
???

26

27
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,443
What's that sound?
It's nothing.

28
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:01,482
Please get into your beds.

29
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,064
But we haven't had our shower.

30
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:04,189
We always shower before...

31
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,139
Everything's
all right.

32
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,261
Please get
into your beds.

33
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:20,803
Secure the exits.

34
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:23,346
Anyone tries to breach,
shoot them in the head twice.

35
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:24,897
Topher.

36
00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:25,751
Topher!

37
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,306
Guns- can I have one?

38
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:30,700
What happened?
Yeah, that's...

39
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:31,950
uh, that's the thing,
happened.

40
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:33,262
He just...
Who?

41
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:35,401
Doc Saunders looks
like a jigsaw puzzle,

42
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:36,513
and what he did
to Samuelson...

43
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,037
Who?

44
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:39,685
Alpha. It appears
we've had a composite event.

45
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:41,667
He gets wiped after every
engagement, like all the rest.

46
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,937
How could he composite?

47
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:43,686
Can't.

48
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:45,160
Shouldn't.

49
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:47,130
Did.

50
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,188
Target acquired.

51
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:49,892
Where?

52
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,831
Level 3, corridor 37.

53
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,333
Target...

54
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,677
Move out.

55
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,241
Seriously.

56
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,036
A gun?

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,058
They won't wake up.

58
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,570
Negative contact.

59
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:15,885
Continuing sweep.

62
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,062
In their resting state,
our Actives

63
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:57,380
are as innocent
and vulnerable as children.

64
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,396
We call it the tabula rasa,
the blank slate.

65
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:05,857
Now imagine the imprint process
filling it,

66
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:08,878
creating a new personality.

67
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:11,346
A friend, a lover, a...

68
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,518
confidant in a sea of enemies.

69
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,989
Your heart's desire made flesh.

70
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,411
And when the engagement
has been completed,

71
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,844
all memory of you
and your time together

72
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,079
will be wiped clean.

73
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:32,933
Hello, Echo.

74
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,708
How are you feeling?

75
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:38,267
Did I fall asleep?

76
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:39,733
For a little while.

77
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,247
Shall I go now?

78
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:43,826
If you like.

79
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:48,974
Neat trick.

80
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:51,028
Tricks are illusions,
Mr. Connell,

81
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:52,531
constructed to deceive.

82
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,148
What we offer is truth.

83
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:57,095
Rare commodity.

84
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:59,181
Hence the exuberant price tag.

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,183
I've been with a lot of women,
Miss DeWitt.

86
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,130
That's not bragging.

87
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,006
That's just what you
would call truth.

88
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:07,421
And not one of
them turned out

89
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:08,778
to be who they
said they were.

90
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,513
Your services may be expensive,
but at least this time,

91
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,262
I'll be the one telling the girl
what to lie about.

92
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:17,940
She won't lie to you,
Mr. Connell.

93
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,573
Everything you want,
everything you need...

94
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,464
she will be.

95
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:27,216
Honestly
and completely.

96
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:29,612
That will be something new.

97
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:31,882
There is, however,
one small problem.

98
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:32,735
I thought
everything

99
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,145
was good with
the background check.

100
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:35,530
That's not
our concern.

101
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,332
Your engagement
has been flagged as...

102
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,165
a moderate risk to our Active.

103
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,636
Nothing serious.

104
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,499
Our company
policy requires

105
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,477
a small additional fee

106
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:54,183
against any unforeseen
complications.

107
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:01,369
Small, huh?

108
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,843
To my employers, very.

109
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:07,328
Well...

110
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:10,017
if this girl's everything you
promise, it will be worth it.

111
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:12,501
Just make sure you return her
safe and sound.

112
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,798
Otherwise, there will be
additional costs.

113
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:19,062
I'll keep it low-key.

114
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,604
Not bad... not bad.

115
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:44,703
You should see
me on a five.

116
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:45,717
Thought that was a five.

117
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:46,468
No way.

118
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,094
Three, three and
a half, maybe.

119
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,576
If it were a five,

120
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:52,188
I'd be fishing you
out of the drink.

121
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,787
You think so, huh?

122
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,296
Huh.

123
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,383
And so.

124
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,152
Now get your ass moving
before I leave you

125
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:05,082
for the wolves...
or whatever they got

126
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,290
around here that eats guys
who can't keep up.

127
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:10,992
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:19,262
You know what they say
about looking down.

129
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:21,041
Don't?

130
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,210
Really don't.

131
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:30,365
Are you okay?

132
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:31,906
Yeah.

133
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:37,716
Jenny!

134
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:39,131
Oh, God.

135
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:43,464
Oh, God, the look on your face.

136
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:45,278
That's not funny.

137
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:46,856
You know how much trouble
I'd be in

138
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:47,932
if you went splat?
Yeah.

139
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,795
My brothers would kill you.

140
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,112
Quit screwing around.

141
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,276
All right, wuss.

142
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:53,879
Come on. Let's race to the top.

143
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,638
What about her adrenaline?

144
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:07,412
Uh, it's within
engagement parameters.

145
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:08,082
Are you sure?

146
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,675
She's elevating toward redline.

147
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,681
Relax, Mountain Man.

148
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:16,512
I've been reading the squigglies
long enough to discern the diff

149
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:20,494
between excitement and
"Sweet mother, I'm gonna die. "

150
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:22,312
She's fine.

151
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:23,746
Hey...

152
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:26,557
go soak up some nature.

153
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:29,898
Okay, like, uh, smell the honey.

154
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:31,717
Hassle a grizzly.

155
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,643
Leave the science
to the science guy.

156
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:37,001
Well, how about clearing up
my signal, Professor?

157
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:37,849
My displays are crap.

158
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:40,007
You're in the middle of "Why
Would Anyone Want to be There?"

159
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:41,378
What did you expect, HBO?

160
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,750
Can't you retask one
of the auxiliary satellites,

161
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:45,432
uh, give me some more coverage?

162
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,126
What's the magic word?

163
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,455
Please.

164
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,278
I was actually looking for
"abracadabra," but that will do.

165
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,063
Okay, re-tasking...

166
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,394
satellite...

167
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:01,963
7115.

168
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:04,222
Gonna take a few
to move it into alignment.

169
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:04,924
Thanks.

170
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:05,897
Anything for you.

171
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,229
'Cause I love you.

172
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,483
Deep, deep man love.

173
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,919
The woods.

174
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:15,837
Yep.

175
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:20,211
I hate the woods.

176
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:21,778
Yep.

177
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,413
Doesn't add up, does it?

178
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:58,857
Ballard?

179
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,253
Hell are you doing here?

180
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:01,605
This is
a straight kidnap.

181
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:03,192
What doesn't add up?
Yeah.

182
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:05,851
Why don't you give us
the inside view

183
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:06,853
on how this all...

184
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:08,139
leads to
the Dollhouse?

185
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,414
Or alternate plan:

186
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:11,309
why don't you just let us
do our jobs?

187
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,368
Doesn't add up, does it?

188
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:15,983
Not all of it.

189
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:20,437
We got three pros
come up from Mexico...

190
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,727
...and a disgruntled
science teacher.

191
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,839
They take the Crestejo girl
for ransom,

192
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,830
then they
fall out...

193
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,604
...and make everybody's life
easier.

194
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:32,639
But the money is gone.

195
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:36,021
So, there's a fifth guy,
and he's right now loving life.

196
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:37,721
He the one packing the cannon?

197
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:38,791
He'd have to be.

198
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,992
That weapon's not here.

199
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,106
Fifth guy took it.

200
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,407
After he blows
the door in?

201
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:47,682
Which is funny.

202
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:50,408
He's in the room
with his buddies,

203
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:51,787
then he has to blow the door in?

204
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:53,761
So, no fifth guy.

205
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,851
You think Crestejo
sent someone after them?

206
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:58,147
Well, he swears he didn't.

207
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:00,372
Hey, tell me
you didn't go near my vic.

208
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:01,667
I just hear the talk.

209
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:03,820
Crestejo's an
interesting guy, though.

210
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,543
Fits a certain profile.

211
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,863
Yeah, I know.

212
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,232
He's rich; he's respectable,

213
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,900
but maybe he's got a kinky side
he doesn't want anyone to see,

214
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,210
so he goes
to the world-famous Dollhouse

215
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:19,720
and hires himself a pretty lady
to groove his move

216
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:20,771
and then forget all about it.

217
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:22,539
They can do that,
you know, with science.

218
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,230
That's what
Davina called her.

219
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:25,380
What?

220
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,913
Crestejo's daughter.

221
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,909
She said the pretty lady came
and saved her.

222
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:31,714
You did talk...

223
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,314
Shaw, we get
any pretty lady prints?

224
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,572
We got the dead guys
and the kid, no one else.

225
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:38,197
Will you stop humoring...
And a couple areas definitely

226
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:39,639
wiped down.
So, what?

227
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,296
The Dollhouse sends one
of its brainwashed beauties

228
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:44,519
to-to take out
a kidnapping ring?

229
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:46,492
That's a full-service
organization.

230
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:53,141
It's the little
girl's, right?

231
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:55,317
I'd check it out.

232
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:59,516
Hey, Agent Ballard thinks
we should investigate.

233
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,229
Thanks for the tip.

234
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:03,748
Why don't you just leave us
to go find your pretty lady?

235
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,822
I will.
Be careful.

236
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:09,043
Looks here
like she's pretty bad-ass.

237
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:10,550
Carbon shaft,

238
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:12,235
three-blade
broadhead.

239
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:14,345
Damn!
Shh!

240
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,081
You'll scare
away lunch.

241
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:19,378
Uh, you couldn't have packed
a couple of sandwiches?

242
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,284
Oh, sandwiches
don't give you a run

243
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:23,588
when you try to eat them.

244
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:26,001
They just lay there,
waiting for mustard.

245
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,645
I like mustard.

246
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,256
Here.

247
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,401
Okay.

248
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:35,816
All right?

249
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:40,784
You're gripping
too tight here. Here.

250
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:42,775
Relax your hand.

251
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,541
You want the riser
to just rest there,

252
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,654
pressing against
your palmer crease.

253
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:49,943
Sounds dirty.

254
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,434
It's your lifeline,

255
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,197
in your palm.

256
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:58,719
You grip the riser too hard,
your shot'll torque.

257
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,821
You're pretty good
at this, aren't you?

258
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,015
My dad taught me.

259
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,531
He was a big
believer in, uh...

260
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,925
What? Was that a salute?

261
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:11,878
Do I have to learn a salute?

262
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,082
It's, uh, shoulder
to the wheel.

263
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,259
Do the work, earn your way.

264
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:21,587
If you can bring down
something bigger than you,

265
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:24,579
with just this, you proved
you deserve to eat it.

266
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,583
If it gets away, it proved
it deserves to live,

267
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:31,368
and you go hungry.

268
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,683
Dad thought we all take
too much for granted.

269
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:36,042
And you?

270
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,172
Oh, I appreciate
every moment.

271
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,959
Particularly
this one.

272
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,656
I'm not the first one

273
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,101
you've brought
into the woods, am I?

274
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:49,924
Uh... no.

275
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:51,774
But so far...

276
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:58,392
you're the only one that
hasn't been a disappointment.

277
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,685
Richard.

278
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:10,091
What do I do?

279
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,110
Extend your bow arm.

280
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,768
Now, draw back.

281
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:19,080
Keep your elbow high.
That's right.

282
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:20,950
Never take a shot
unless you're sure

283
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,420
it'll put your target down.

284
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,073
Aim for the flank,
right below the shoulders.

285
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,405
Is there anything
you're not good at?

286
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:38,851
I think that little thing

287
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,146
I did with my tongue
could use some work.

288
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,634
You really are
the perfect woman.

289
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,586
Not too shabby yourself.

290
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,586
Mmm.

291
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:56,929
You don't slow down, do you?

292
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,604
Oh. I like to live.

293
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,009
Mmm. A lot.

294
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:03,260
Oh.

295
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:07,506
Let's see who finishes
first this round.

296
00:14:07,507 --> 00:14:09,395
I might even let you win.

297
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,013
I'd like that.

298
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,121
You have no idea how much,

299
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,521
but, uh, you need
to get going.

300
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:20,025
Going... where?

301
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:21,036
There's just enough daylight
left

302
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:22,548
to make it back
to the main road.

303
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,952
Might even flag a ride out
of here before I catch up.

304
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:26,407
Yeah, okay.

305
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,782
Am... Am I missing

306
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,744
something?

307
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:32,269
Richard?

308
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,775
You need to stop
talking now

309
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,346
and start running.

310
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:37,684
I'll give you
a five-minute head start.

311
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,822
And then I'm coming after you.

312
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,820
Welcome to the Dollhouse,
Mr. Langton.

313
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:09,000
You come highly recommended.

314
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:10,773
So the stories are true.

315
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,497
Programmable people,
made to order.

316
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:16,481
It's a little more
complicated than that.

317
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,390
I figured it might be.

318
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:22,122
Science is very seldom
exact, Mr. Langton.

319
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,168
Being on the
cutting edge

320
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:26,621
invites a certain
element of risk.

321
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:27,793
Which is why
you're here.

322
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,619
In the light
of recent events,

323
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,411
we've decided to
engage individuals

324
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:33,773
with a more, shall we say,
intensive background.

325
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:35,883
If you're amenable
to the terms

326
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,569
of your contract, you will
be assigned to Echo,

327
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,427
one of our most
requested Actives.

328
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,138
What happened
to her last handler?

329
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,478
You're standing in him.

330
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:48,726
This is our resident physician,
Dr. Saunders.

331
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,768
Mr. Langton, who will
be replacing Samuelson.

332
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,776
Good.

333
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:56,382
Does that mean I can get
his body out of my office?

334
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:57,660
I'll take care of it.

335
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,033
Right.

336
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,515
Right.
Everything's under control.

337
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,152
It's nice to have you
on the team.

338
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:08,731
where you step.

339
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:14,181
Her... face.

340
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,262
Dr. Saunders is still...
recovering.

341
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,689
Same guy who killed Samuelson?

342
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:22,596
She was more fortunate.

343
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,343
I want to see Samuelson's body.

344
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:27,819
You really don't.

345
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,223
Show me.

346
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:33,284
Samuelson.

347
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:35,396
He was a good man.

348
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,897
Not good enough.

349
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,265
What do you make?

350
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,410
Single blade, non-serrated,

351
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,057
ten to 12 centimeters.

352
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:51,146
Tendons in the extremities were
severed first to disable him.

353
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,397
And then the real work started.

354
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,297
Hmm.

355
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:58,618
Knew exactly where to cut

356
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:01,495
to cause the maximum amount
of damage and pain.

357
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,619
Whoever did this
took their time.

358
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,076
Eight seconds.

359
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:08,020
That's the timeline we've been
able to piece together.

360
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:12,044
The cuts are meticulous,
almost surgical.

361
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:13,926
Wouldn't have thought
it was possible

362
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:15,487
to carve up a man
like this so fast.

363
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:16,168
It isn't.

364
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,532
Unless you've been imprinted
with the necessary skills.

365
00:17:19,702 --> 00:17:21,789
You're telling me
you programmed one of your dolls

366
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,053
to be Jack the Ripper?

367
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:24,165
Not my department.

368
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,465
All I know is that Alpha

369
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,183
accessed multiple imprints,

370
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:29,080
personalities that
should have been erased.

371
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,544
And one of them did this,

372
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,210
then slaughtered everyone
around your girl

373
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:34,846
before pulling
a smoke-and-mirrors.

374
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:37,973
So, why didn't he kill Echo?

375
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:15,681
Whoa! Oh!

376
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:19,557
Mmm.

377
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:30,496
Privyet.

378
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:32,866
You don't write. You don't call.

379
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,268
You're starting
to hurt my feelings.

380
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,702
How did you
get this number?

381
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,842
I'll always know your number,
Lubov, and where to find you.

382
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,232
Wait. What do you want?

383
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,580
Why are you
bothering me, huh?

384
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:45,413
I am honest citizen.

385
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:47,149
And I'm the Easter Bunny.

386
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,867
Dollhouse. Start hopping.

387
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:52,036
No, no. I told you, I-I...
I don't know any Dollhouse.

388
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:54,195
Then find another honest citizen
who does.

389
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,756
Don't make me come find you.

390
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,738
Hey, uh, Ballard?

391
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:05,610
We got a call.

392
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,756
A couple kids found
a house in the woods

393
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:10,449
all made of candy
and gingerbread.

394
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,586
Thought that might be
up your alley.

395
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:14,695
Oh, my God, that's hilarious.

396
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:24,269
Where'd this come from?

397
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:26,269
Oh, uh, Granny left it.

398
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,419
Man, her teeth looked big.

399
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:04,431
Satellite retask coming online.

400
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,282
When?

401
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:07,933
Uh...

402
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,036
anytime... nowish?

403
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,069
We got company.

404
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,332
All right.

405
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,766
Looks like we're there.

406
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,666
No, I'm telling you,
we're not there.

407
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,067
We're somewhere
over here.

408
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,466
There is
where we want to be.

409
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:30,800
Here is not there.

410
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,199
Excuse me.

411
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:33,599
This area's restricted.

412
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,653
No vehicles off the main road.

413
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,274
Sorry, uh, we-we're
completely turned around.

414
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,223
Do you mind pointing us
in the right direction?

415
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,234
What you fellas
doing way out here?

416
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:46,489
Local news.

417
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:48,418
We're shooting B-roll
for a piece

418
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,742
about the push to open up
the area to more logging.

419
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,603
You got some ID
to go along with that story?

420
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,041
Sure.

421
00:22:04,142 --> 00:22:05,647
Can't be too careful,

422
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:07,033
Mr. Crehan.

423
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,656
Being so far off the beaten
tends to attract

424
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:10,787
an unsavory element.

425
00:22:10,994 --> 00:22:12,177
No worries, Officer.

426
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,232
We couldn't be
more savory.

427
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:21,337
Good to know.

428
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:31,082
The new Samuelson.

429
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:33,003
You're bigger than the last one.

430
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:34,103
Topher.

431
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,382
The man behind
the gray matter curtain.

432
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,605
So, Alpha's one of
your achievements.

433
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:44,382
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:49,464
That, uh, was an anomaly.

435
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:53,809
There's unpredictable
remainders.

436
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,406
We're still working
out the kinkies.

437
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:56,230
Like the blood,

438
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:57,859
the screaming, the dying?

439
00:22:59,764 --> 00:23:01,056
Look at them.

440
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:02,878
Bunch of helpless children.

441
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,542
Did the ones Alpha
slaughtered even

442
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:06,496
put up a fight?

443
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:09,409
They...

444
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,717
wouldn't know how.

445
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:15,090
Not without an imprint.

446
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:19,402
So, why not default them
with ninja skills or whatever?

447
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:20,737
We tried that once.

448
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:21,551
And?

449
00:23:22,723 --> 00:23:25,283
Blood, screaming, dying.

450
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:27,437
Alpha.

451
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:34,223
I think I'd like to swim now.

452
00:23:35,568 --> 00:23:37,413
What do you think
of your new girl?

453
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,172
She's not a girl.

454
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,160
She's not even a person-
just an empty hat.

455
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,097
Until you stuff a rabbit in it.

456
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:51,429
Abracadabra.

457
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:17,142
Uh, you getting this,
man-friend?

458
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,163
Yeah, I'm getting it.

459
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,386
Okay, uh...

460
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:23,989
see these squigglies?

461
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,576
These are the not-so-goods.

462
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,064
What the hell's
going on over there?

463
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,368
Everything's fine.

464
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:32,102
You sure?

465
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:32,780
Yeah.

466
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:35,847
Except for the gun
pointed at my head.

467
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:37,745
Boyd?

468
00:24:38,626 --> 00:24:39,206
Buddy?!

469
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,096
Boyd?!

470
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,421
He's a threat.

471
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,925
Agent Ballard has been
groping blindly

472
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:32,310
for quite some time now.

473
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,332
He knows nothing.

474
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,827
I know his type.
A guy like this,

475
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:35,982
something gets
under his skin,

476
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,653
he's not going to let it go
until it's scratched out.

477
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,795
And how would you suggest
we handle this?

478
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:45,540
Neutralize the risk
before it becomes untenable.

479
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,477
Authorize a kill order?

480
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:49,580
On a federal agent?

481
00:25:50,193 --> 00:25:53,148
I think you overestimate
his abilities.

482
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,947
Even a blind dog can find a bone
if he digs enough holes.

483
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:59,011
All the appropriate measures
are being taken.

484
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:00,955
Thank you for your concern,
Mr. Dominic.

485
00:26:00,956 --> 00:26:02,943
With respect, ma'am,
I don't think you fully...

486
00:26:02,944 --> 00:26:04,934
Hey, uh, sorry.

487
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:06,507
I think we have a situation.

488
00:26:07,636 --> 00:26:09,210
The kind you need to shoot at.

489
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,448
Hello?

490
00:27:58,228 --> 00:27:59,282
Hello?

491
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:01,834
Is there anybody out there?

492
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:04,301
I need help, please, somebody!

493
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:10,246
Hey, baby?

494
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:14,353
Guess you found Ranger Bob, huh?

495
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:19,194
Why are you doing this?

496
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:20,843
Because I want to know.

497
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,095
Know what,
you sick son of a bitch?!

498
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:26,093
If you deserve to live.

499
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,592
If you've earned the right.

500
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:31,803
You know what gives someone
the right to live?

501
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:33,332
Not hunting them!

502
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,130
That's it!

503
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:36,584
Shoulder to the wheel.

504
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:38,442
Prove you're not just an echo.

505
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,109
You want proof, you psycho?

506
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,260
How about this?

507
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,226
I'm going to kill you.

508
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,413
Will that prove it?!

509
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:47,878
I'm going to stab you...

510
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,324
You don't sound too good.

511
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:57,087
Hey, you didn't drink

512
00:28:57,088 --> 00:28:58,269
from a canteen in there,

513
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,023
did you? 'Cause...

514
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:03,204
that would be bad.

515
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,961
Is it time
for my treatment?

516
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:12,510
Yes, but this

517
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,490
is a very special
one, Echo.

518
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:18,732
This one won't pinch
like the others...

519
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,192
You don't remember.

520
00:29:23,198 --> 00:29:24,043
Hello.

521
00:29:25,404 --> 00:29:26,616
You're tall.

522
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:30,919
Do I have to be here for this?

523
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,052
The Handler-Active imprint
requires a direct line of sight.

524
00:29:35,053 --> 00:29:36,653
So, she needs to be

525
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:37,652
looking into those

526
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,153
dreamy brown eyes
when I wave my magic wand.

527
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:41,257
Then what?

528
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:43,628
Me and "Special Needs"
become buddy-buddy?

529
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:46,514
Hey. This isn't
about friendship, man.

530
00:29:46,864 --> 00:29:48,440
It's about trust.

531
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:49,871
From this point on,

532
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:51,610
Echo will always trust you,

533
00:29:51,614 --> 00:29:53,736
without question
or hesitation,

534
00:29:53,737 --> 00:29:55,878
no matter
what the circumstance.

535
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:59,899
You're about to become the most
important person in her life.

536
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:04,912
Let's get this over with.

537
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:06,988
Hey, hey,
this is art.

538
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,688
It's not an oil change.

539
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,400
Rush the brushstrokes,

540
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:14,653
you'll get a clown
on black velvet.

541
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:17,177
What's this?

542
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:19,003
Your script.

543
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,330
Call and response.

544
00:30:21,562 --> 00:30:22,831
Neural lock and key.

545
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:27,704
All right, Brando.

546
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,520
Let's see what you got.

547
00:30:32,878 --> 00:30:35,288
Everything's going to be...
Oh, wait, wait, wait a second.

548
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:36,785
Uh, take her hand.

549
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:39,267
What?

550
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:40,647
Hold her hand.

551
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:45,680
Tactile proximity
enhances bonding protocol.

552
00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:46,718
It's...

553
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,702
Okay.

554
00:30:52,693 --> 00:30:54,948
And take two.

555
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:01,915
Everything's going
to be all right.

556
00:31:03,117 --> 00:31:04,511
Now that you're here.

557
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,193
Do you trust me?

558
00:31:11,732 --> 00:31:13,275
With my life.

559
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:35,449
How you feeling, sweetness?

560
00:31:35,824 --> 00:31:37,180
A little funky
right about now?

561
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:42,674
Don't worry.
Stuff's not going to kill you.

562
00:31:42,937 --> 00:31:44,012
The man I got it from said

563
00:31:44,013 --> 00:31:46,276
it would just put a spin
on things.

564
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:48,832
So what do you say?

565
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,520
You spinning yet?

566
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,160
Hey.

567
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:07,428
Hey, wait.

568
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,901
Wait.

569
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:11,167
Hey!

570
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:13,708
No, no, no, get that
thing out of my face.

571
00:32:14,107 --> 00:32:16,086
What?

572
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:40,541
How many?

573
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,538
What?

574
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:47,786
How many men

575
00:32:47,787 --> 00:32:49,082
between me and the girl?

576
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,636
I don't know!
I don't know. I swear to God!

577
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,176
I don't think he's listening.

578
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:58,971
A guy hired me
over the phone!

579
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:00,968
I never met him!

580
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:03,539
I was just supposed to get you
to stall the response team.

581
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:05,420
And then put a bullet
in my head.

582
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:09,139
Hey, it's business.

583
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,529
Don't take it personal, dude.

584
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:16,887
I don't.

585
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:30,302
Wake up.

586
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:39,952
Wake up.

587
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:46,850
Ah, you're doing great, baby.

588
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,360
Don't quit on me now.

589
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:56,107
Do you need a minute?

590
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,118
'Cause I don't want to rush you.

591
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,689
All right.
We'll rush.

592
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:08,208
Hey, neighbor.

593
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,624
Off early?

594
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:14,214
Just swinging by for a bite, then getting
back to it. Keeping our streets safe.

595
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,010
I should thank you.

596
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:16,910
You know,

597
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,759
by thanking you.

598
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,853
You want to have some lasagna?

599
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:21,818
I have leftovers.

600
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:24,266
You know, it's
only leftovers

601
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,144
if you've already eaten some,
Mellie.

602
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,734
Oh, no, I, uh,
made another one that I...

603
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:30,867
It's really good.

604
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:32,068
Rain check?

605
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,403
Totally. Yeah.

606
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,262
Anytime, just knock.
I'm always...

607
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:37,097
Ooh, um, pretty.

608
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:38,552
Who's she?

609
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:42,939
Nobody,

610
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,941
according to the FBI database.

611
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,001
No record of her.

612
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,767
Is she in trouble?

613
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:50,102
Maybe.

614
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:52,801
Or just got caught up
with the wrong people.

615
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:53,558
Either way, I'll keep

616
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,859
looking until
I find her.

617
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,610
Lucky girl.

618
00:35:41,246 --> 00:35:41,845
Wait.

619
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:43,294
I'm not going to hurt you.

620
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,142
Do I know you?

621
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,811
Everything's going to be
all right.

622
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:53,441
Now that... you're here.

623
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:56,817
Stay close.

624
00:35:57,276 --> 00:35:58,284
I'm going to get you...

625
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:03,901
Okay.

626
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,659
I know he's not
what people expect.

627
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,151
Or what I expected.

628
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:19,623
But I always go for
the wrong guy, you know?

629
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:21,677
Yeah.
Looks.

630
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:23,815
It's always about looks.

631
00:36:23,816 --> 00:36:24,847
I mean, we're bombarded

632
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:28,006
with perfect teeth
and hair and abs,

633
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:29,416
and who cares
what's underneath?

634
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:31,140
But, Jason...

635
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:34,518
I wouldn't have looked
twice at him.

636
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:36,879
And then you get
to know him,

637
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,470
and... okay.

638
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:39,714
So he's heavy.

639
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:41,588
He's not the guy
from the magazines

640
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:43,658
or the movies,
but he's real.

641
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:46,853
And I can't stop
thinking about him.

642
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,114
Can you wait for me?

643
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,887
I want to see him
after my treatment.

644
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:58,904
I mean, I have to tell
him what I'm feeling

645
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:00,302
before I get too scared

646
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,434
or whatever it is
people get when they...

647
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,020
I need him to know
what I'm thinking.

648
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,388
I'll be here.

649
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:09,488
You're the best.

650
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:13,766
Hi.

651
00:37:14,476 --> 00:37:15,796
I'll be right back.

652
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,357
We have to stop.

653
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,006
No. You got shot with a freakin' arrow.

654
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:27,690
If we keep moving,
you're going to die.

655
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:28,972
If Robin Hood
catches up with us,

656
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:30,269
we're both going to die.

657
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:34,657
How do I know you?

658
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,373
We met a while back.

659
00:37:39,744 --> 00:37:42,409
I feel like I can trust you.

660
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:45,888
But I don't remember.
You're okay?

661
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:48,709
There was something
in the water.

662
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:50,414
Richard...

663
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:53,267
put something in my
water. He poisoned you?

664
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,918
He said it wouldn't kill me,
but I've been seeing things.

665
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,347
What kind of things?

666
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,730
A girl that looks like me,
but isn't.

667
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:04,470
Dead bodies in a shower and...

668
00:38:05,814 --> 00:38:07,590
And a man standing over me,
holding a knife,

669
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:08,795
but I can't see his face.

670
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:10,401
I don't think he has one.

671
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:16,893
Are you here?
Is this... is this real?

672
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,271
I'm here.

673
00:38:19,085 --> 00:38:20,928
And, yeah, this is real.

674
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:24,655
He's going to kill us.

675
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:27,088
He's going to find us
and he's...

676
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:29,087
Hey. Hey!

677
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:32,770
Everything's going
to be all right.

678
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:38,885
No, it isn't.

679
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:42,575
Did you hear what I said?
Everything's

680
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:44,386
going to be... Everything's
not going to be all right.

681
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:47,563
You don't get to live
just because you deserve to.

682
00:38:47,564 --> 00:38:50,601
You have to prove it. You have
to put your shoulder to the wheel.

683
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,188
You want to speak English?

684
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,236
I'm kind of bleeding
to death here.

685
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,740
He's not going to stop.

686
00:38:58,288 --> 00:38:59,449
Unless he's dead.

687
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:01,040
You can't go
after this guy.

688
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,552
You don't have
the right imprint...

689
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,242
You don't have
the right training.

690
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:08,521
I'm a fast learner.
Jenny...

691
00:39:08,522 --> 00:39:10,700
Do you trust me?

692
00:39:11,419 --> 00:39:12,170
What?

693
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:15,464
Do you trust me?

694
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,357
With my life.

695
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:26,518
You know how
to use this?

696
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:28,886
Four brothers.

697
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:31,215
None of them Democrats.

698
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:34,719
You should
keep this.

699
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,480
If Richard finds you,
he'll...

700
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,881
You didn't think I'd give you
my only gun, did you?

701
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:07,291
Didn't think it'd
be that easy, did you?

702
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,073
I'd be disappointed if it was.

703
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:17,669
How's your buddy holding up?

704
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,099
Losing an awful lot of blood.

705
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,896
Not as much as you're about to.

706
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,610
What are you going to do?

707
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:26,334
You going to throw rocks at me?
No.

708
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:29,910
I'm going to shoot you with
the gun my "buddy" gave me.

709
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:32,589
You're playing my game now.

710
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,200
Toss the bow
and get on your knees.

711
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:36,651
Or I blow your freakin'
head off.

712
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,280
My dad would have
really liked you.

713
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:41,257
I'm still going to kill you...

714
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,453
I just wanted to make
a difference.

715
00:41:25,236 --> 00:41:27,108
Little piece of advice?

716
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,073
You don't want the big bad wolf
to find you,

717
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:31,923
you should really turn off
your walkie.

718
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:38,409
Is this the best date ever
or what?

719
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,118
Put it down.

720
00:41:49,067 --> 00:41:50,294
Or I put you down.

721
00:41:51,564 --> 00:41:52,456
Look at you.

722
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:54,052
You can barely
stand up.

723
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,910
Probably wouldn't be able
to hit me

724
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:57,487
even if you did pull
the trigger.

725
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:00,765
You really want to find out?

726
00:42:01,075 --> 00:42:02,786
I admit I'm curious.

727
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:04,836
Concerned.

728
00:42:04,837 --> 00:42:06,063
But curious.

729
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:08,084
Then again...

730
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:11,367
...you shoot me

731
00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:12,466
and you get an arrow

732
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:13,881
in that pretty little chest.

733
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,760
How's that arm holding up?

734
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,784
Maybe I'm not the one
that's going to miss.

735
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:22,966
I'll tell you what.

736
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:26,112
Why don't we ease up.

737
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:27,743
We'll call it a draw?

738
00:42:29,097 --> 00:42:30,611
You'll let me go?

739
00:42:30,612 --> 00:42:31,182
Sure.

740
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:32,785
No harm, no foul.

741
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:36,401
You poisoned me and tried
to shoot me with arrows.

742
00:42:37,397 --> 00:42:39,443
Okay, so maybe a little bit
of harm.

743
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,609
Look, how about this?

744
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:46,317
On the count of three,
we both back off.

745
00:42:47,038 --> 00:42:47,908
Deal?

746
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:50,671
One...

747
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:53,334
Two...

748
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:57,726
...Three.

749
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:48,731
I try to be my best.

750
00:44:06,031 --> 00:44:07,584
That really hurt.

751
00:44:08,603 --> 00:44:09,466
Good.

752
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:14,325
You said
you were going to kill me.

753
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,284
It's good for a follow-through.

754
00:44:22,556 --> 00:44:24,147
He was right about you.

755
00:44:26,618 --> 00:44:28,099
You really are special.

756
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:30,910
What are you talking about?

757
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:33,199
Keep your shoulder
to the wheel, baby.

758
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:38,342
Shoulder to the wheel...

759
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:37,900
You okay?
Where is he?

760
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,022
Do you trust me?

761
00:45:43,205 --> 00:45:45,227
Hey!
Prove you're not just an echo.

762
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:50,466
Shoulder to the wheel.

763
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:05,207
Did I fall asleep?

764
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,634
For a little while.

765
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,833
The background checks

766
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,167
are supposed to prevent
this sort of thing.

767
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,167
How is it that
you missed the fact

768
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,133
that Connell is
a psychopath?

769
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,533
Because Richard Connell
doesn't exist.

770
00:46:34,566 --> 00:46:36,999
Nothing in his jacket was real.

771
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,393
His entire background
from birth

772
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:41,632
to college to his
referral here-

773
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,177
all of it was fabricated.

774
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,468
I've never seen anything
this intricate.

775
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,808
What about the man that
Langton subdued in the van?

776
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,233
Have you interrogated him yet?

777
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,700
He was dead
when we got there.

778
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:56,067
But not from his run-in
with Langton.

779
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:01,702
That's not the way
I left him.

780
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:04,856
The GSWs were nonfatal.

781
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:09,200
Painful, but you avoided
the major arteries.

782
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:11,233
That was the plan.

783
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:13,204
What about these other wounds?

784
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:17,733
Caused by a single
non-serrated blade,

785
00:47:17,766 --> 00:47:20,866
approximately ten centimeters
in length.

786
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:26,599
The lacerations are precise,
almost surgical.

787
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,766
I've seen this before.

788
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,733
Alpha.

789
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,933
That's impossible.

790
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:35,400
Isn't that what we do here?

791
00:47:36,328 --> 00:47:36,700
The impossible?

792
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:38,533
Alpha is dead. After he...

793
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,133
After what he did...

794
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:47,300
they tracked him down
and put a bullet in his brain.

795
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,599
And they'd never lie to us
about something like that.

796
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:51,294
Would they?

797
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,233
Alpha could have
killed Echo

798
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:54,533
when he escaped,
but he didn't.

799
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:57,300
A wake of bodies,

800
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,533
but he left
her alive.

801
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:05,400
Now someone hires some nut job
to hunt her down in the woods.

802
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:06,533
Maybe it was Alpha.

803
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:08,281
Maybe not.

804
00:48:09,566 --> 00:48:10,766
Only thing
I really know

805
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,833
is it all leads back to Echo.

806
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,486
Sorry.
Are you?

807
00:48:26,188 --> 00:48:26,992
Am I?

808
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:28,833
Sorry.

809
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:30,334
Are you really sorry?

810
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,431
Awful lot of people seem
to end up dead around you.

811
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,334
How's it make you feel?

812
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:38,599
Oh, right.

813
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:40,533
You don't,
unless we tell you

814
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:43,133
how and what and when.

815
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:47,466
I'm going to swim in the pool.

816
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:51,367
If it were up to me,
I'd put you in the Attic.

817
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,866
Or the ground.

818
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,400
Yeah, like talking to you is
going to make a difference.

819
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:01,547
Yeah.

820
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:02,670
There's nobody in there.

821
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:14,001
