1
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,264
Glad I got that second chair.

2
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,307
Don't get a lot
of visitors out here.

3
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:22,230
Makes what friends I have left
feel bad to see me this way, I guess.

4
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,100
I don't have a lot to tell them.
Still broke.

5
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,399
Still love a woman.

6
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:28,155
Still can't have her.

7
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:35,743
I wonder what she'd say
if she saw me this way.

8
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,761
I bet she'd love me anyway.

9
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:39,454
Don't take that bet.

10
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:41,234
I know she'd love me anyway.

11
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,860
She's programmed to.

12
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,041
Now, some might say that takes
the magic out of love,

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,845
to know you are loved.

14
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,898
But what's still a surprise

15
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:55,638
is how much you love her.

16
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,837
I loved her to abstraction.

17
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:03,396
To destitution.

18
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,115
I blew my fortune on engagements.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,276
Now, only my love sustains me.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,390
Love for a wan who doesn't exist.

21
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,866
That's my sad story.

22
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,879
You want to know the saddest part?

23
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:25,668
It's the ending.

24
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,419
Seems like maybe love wasn't enough.

25
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:37,680
Episode 208: <i>A Love Supreme</i>

26
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,332
www.subbercafe.fr

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,973
Are you having one of
your headaches, my dear?

28
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:24,964
I'm not my best.

29
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:28,075
We'll have to do something
about that.

30
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,050
Tell me, how long have
you been having these headaches?

31
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:32,325
I don't know.

32
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:34,652
Let's be mathematical.

33
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:39,137
Did they begin before your three-month
absence from the Dollhouse?

34
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,143
I don't know.

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,317
Do you remember
being away from here?

36
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:48,011
It wasn't nice.

37
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:56,645
Does a treatment sound nice?

38
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,768
I can see that it does.

39
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:09,875
Do you have something
you want to tell me

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,899
before we schedule you
for that treatment?

41
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:18,614
You choose pain.

42
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:28,361
I wish she'd say
something about her absence.

43
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:31,047
Then all this could be over.

44
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:36,360
Are you certain she said nothing
to you when you found her?

45
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,212
I told you.
She barely spoke at all.

46
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:41,470
She was in really bad shape.
She still is.

47
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:44,971
One wonders how she managed.

48
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Out there.

49
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:48,152
Alone.

50
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,980
The odds of an Active
in an infantile state

51
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:55,135
surviving outside
the Dollhouse, unprotected...

52
00:03:56,966 --> 00:04:00,281
I suppose we must take into account
the fact that Echo is special.

53
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,742
You're punishing her for surviving.
It's complete lunacy.

54
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,610
You're wrong, Mr. Ballard.

55
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,233
I'm very sorry for Echo's suffering,

56
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,221
but we must have answers.

57
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,544
So if she floats, she's a witch?

58
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:16,726
That will be all for today.
Thank you, Dr. Gholsen.

59
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,456
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

60
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:21,552
Until I'm satisfied
that Echo wasn't exposed

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,721
to dangerous elements
during her sojourn,

62
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:25,935
these sessions will continue.

63
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:28,225
Will you excuse me, gentlemen?

64
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,294
I'll consult with my expert.

65
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:33,725
Expert on what?

66
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:36,331
What does she think
she's going to get out of Echo?

67
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:38,539
She doesn't expect to get
anything out of Echo.

68
00:04:38,664 --> 00:04:41,426
She's using her to make you squirm,
and it's working.

69
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:42,851
I can't help it.

70
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:46,490
- I don't like seeing her in pain.
- I don't like seeing her in pain.

71
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:49,120
I looked into her eyes and swore
to protect her, same as you.

72
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:51,730
Before you.
Today, protecting her means not reacting

73
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,422
while DeWitt tortures her.

74
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:54,918
So man up.

75
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,544
You must have some suspicions.

76
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,420
I find her in a perfect,
childlike state:

77
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,550
simple, accepting and contradictory.

78
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,856
- She's hiding something.
- If she did something naughty,

79
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,555
she's completely unaware of it.

80
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,601
She, however, is naughty

81
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,810
and completely aware of it.

82
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,565
- Let's stay on task, shall we, Doctor?
- You don't like my remark, Ms. DeWitt?

83
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,318
You prefer men to keep
their natural urges to themselves?

84
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,287
On the contrary,
urges are my stock in trade.

85
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,491
I find identifying with those
of my clients to be very useful.

86
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,161
But that's your sales pitch, I think.
You're very tightly controlled.

87
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:31,956
See, men wear
everything on the outside,

88
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,791
including their genitalia.

89
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:37,335
Whereas, you are chastised
for any suggestion of sexuality.

90
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,879
Punished, perhaps.

91
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,053
So goes the entirety of relations
throughout history, Dr. Gholsen.

92
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:44,885
- I really don't see...
- No wonder you despise that girl.

93
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:48,047
She gets to be the virgin
and the whore,

94
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:50,348
and for both, she's celebrated.

95
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:53,062
Yes, very insightful.

96
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:56,926
- Would you like a treatment?
- Yeah. Very much so.

97
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,823
- That was a tiresome exercise.
- I told you, brain science

98
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,741
is all about hardware and software.

99
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,910
There's no mystical in-between.

100
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,245
So tell me.
What's wrong with her?

101
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,457
Why is she getting these headaches?

102
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,997
Weirdly,
I agree with Dr. Freudenstein.

103
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:19,627
There's no tumors, nothing physical.

104
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,256
- It's all in her mind.
- So she's perfectly normal?

105
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,564
Normal as anyone else around here.

106
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,304
And I suppose there are some nonsensical
scans to back up your report?

107
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:31,765
Would you like to see them?

108
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,479
These are the craziest scans
I've ever seen.

109
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,855
I can't even look at them
without going nuts!

110
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,903
I know a conspiracy when I desperately
try to avoid seeing one.

111
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,572
Did you tell DeWitt?

112
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,850
So why don't you two crack open
your little chamber pot of secrets

113
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,286
and tell me what's going on?

114
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,330
Echo's not a blank slate.
She's a person.

115
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:57,195
What do you mean?

116
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,833
She's self-aware?

117
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:00,549
That's not all she is.

118
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:03,197
Everything you've imprinted her
with for the last six months,

119
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,450
it's still there.

120
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:07,760
So she's got five people worth
of brains banging around up there?

121
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,138
More. She's got everyone Alpha
dumped into her, as well.

122
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:13,136
That's everyone.

123
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:15,851
He took every imprint
she'd ever had.

124
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,313
- I went in with a Q-tip after!
- Didn't work.

125
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,326
- She hasn't been wiped for months.
- The wipes just push everything down,

126
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:24,192
but it all surfaces again.
And now,

127
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,360
she can control what and when.

128
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:27,613
She can control...?

129
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,715
What does that make her?

130
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,929
What is she?

131
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:44,942
Please sit down.

132
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:49,891
I know that the exhaustive
health screenings

133
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:51,455
I've been running on Echo

134
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,180
seem misguided to you.

135
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:57,518
I know that you're looking for something
that I don't think you'll find.

136
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:01,306
You see, in the Dollhouse,

137
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,639
things aren't always what they seem.

138
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,115
Echo, for instance.

139
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:07,945
Perfectly healthy.

140
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,156
- That's good news.
- Isn't it?

141
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,950
I'm putting her back in the field.

142
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,827
She is our most requested Active.

143
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,539
In fact, Mr. Pierce has already
booked her for a romantic engagement.

144
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,847
So soon?

145
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,989
What about the headaches?

146
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:23,486
I take your point.

147
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,947
Romantic engagements
can be a bit strenuous.

148
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,494
But he's a repeat client of hers.

149
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,780
And "not tonight honey,
I have a headache"

150
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:35,973
really isn't one of the excuses
we allow our Actives.

151
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:41,103
I thought you might need this.

152
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,568
Well, to Echo's health.

153
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,153
To Echo's health.

154
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,509
It's time for your treatment.

155
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,781
We never meet like this anymore.

156
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:11,796
I missed you, too.

157
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,387
Is she still Eleanor Penn?

158
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:18,265
Is she still Terry Karrens?

159
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,391
Topher, yes.

160
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,893
So she's a serial killer.

161
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:22,519
Only a little.

162
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,856
Right, only a little bit serial killer.
And we let her outside?

163
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,400
- She's in control, Topher.
- She's in control?

164
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,945
Not you? Not Paul?

165
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,888
And who is "she" again?

166
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,832
Does she still trust you
with her life?

167
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:35,490
Is that because she's programmed to,

168
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:36,950
or just because you're

169
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,543
a swell guy with a trustworthy brow?

170
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:41,788
I like to think both.

171
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,874
She's here.

172
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:45,459
You're all here.

173
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,878
Nice to meet you.

174
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:49,974
We've met, Topher.

175
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:51,340
Don't you remember?

176
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:52,947
She's funny.

177
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:55,761
Is that a good sign?

178
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:57,971
So we're going to send you

179
00:09:58,209 --> 00:09:59,723
to a Mr. Frank Pierce.

180
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,934
I mean, if that's okay with you?

181
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,259
I do work here.

182
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:08,505
Well, Frank wants Susan,

183
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,285
who I guess is his wife?

184
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:13,403
No, she's his sister-in-law.

185
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,369
Susan, you are a heartbreaker.

186
00:10:15,494 --> 00:10:17,443
Or you're gonna be.

187
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:22,317
If you could just
hop in the chair for me.

188
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:27,543
Am I going to see Frank today?
Oh, my gosh!

189
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,582
Oh, my gosh! I can't wait.

190
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,260
Got her.
Repeat engagement.

191
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,762
Had her filed away.

192
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,790
Shall we go?

193
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,220
I am obsolete.

194
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:57,556
This must be what
old people feel like.

195
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,363
And Blockbuster.

196
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,582
Watching you in that cell in pain,

197
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,751
I thought about this part.

198
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,754
I knew that we'd come
to the end of the torture at some point

199
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,215
and we'd be back out
in the field doing our thing.

200
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:16,508
And I thought,

201
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,955
"That's when we'll run."

202
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,678
And you thought, "That's stupid."

203
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,793
We'd end up in the same place,

204
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,474
except worse,
because it would be the Attic.

205
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,686
I don't like this.

206
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:29,313
I don't like being your pimp.

207
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,017
I don't like it either.

208
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,319
Frank Pierce isn't so bad.

209
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:38,238
He's actually kind of sweet
in a hapless way.

210
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,485
Okay, fine.
He's not really my type.

211
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,412
But he's Susan's.

212
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:49,291
And that's who I'll be
when I'm with him.

213
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:53,025
Susan loves Frank Pierce dearly,

214
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,751
and cannot wait
to be back in his arms.

215
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,100
And tell him
what a horrible mistake...

216
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,810
... I made marrying his brother.

217
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,772
He'll never make me happy.

218
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,524
I'm finally going to leave him.

219
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:16,652
You're doing the right thing.

220
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:19,676
Frank?

221
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,255
You old softie.

222
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,038
How many roses lost

223
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,704
their lives for this?

224
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,176
Oh, my gosh.

225
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:33,958
Did you cook?

226
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,008
I've died and gone to...

227
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:47,428
- I can't snap her out of it.
- Show me.

228
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,651
Echo, would you like a treatment?

229
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:01,444
He said he had something
special planned.

230
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:04,324
I think he was going to propose.

231
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:06,217
I'm sure of it.

232
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,470
She was hysterical when I found her.

233
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:13,963
Strong emotions have messed
with imprints before.

234
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:15,782
Yeah, grief.

235
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,964
Echo said this imprint
loved the guy.

236
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,882
It looks like
over a week's decomposition.

237
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,507
And this engagement
was arranged yesterday.

238
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:26,004
So who the hell
made the appointment?

239
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,056
His throat's been cut clean
through the carotid.

240
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:30,600
- But where's all the blood?
- He wasn't killed here.

241
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:31,977
He was posed.

242
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:36,026
This whole thing's been staged.
And we were meant to find it.

243
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,566
No, I was.

244
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,447
This message is for me.

245
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:44,860
For Echo.

246
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,242
What message?

247
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:50,412
"For my Number One."

248
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:52,459
Whiskey was Number One.

249
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:53,749
Now, I am.

250
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,625
This is from Alpha.

251
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:59,135
Alpha?
What proof do we have?

252
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,755
Aside from the note, nothing.

253
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,069
But it makes sense,
he's the only one out there

254
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:05,412
with a knowledge of this place
and an obsession with Echo.

255
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:07,971
- I thought that was you, Mr. Ballard.
- You're hilarious.

256
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,555
I want her back
in solitary, immediately.

257
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,510
Why?

258
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,912
Because if this was, in fact,
the work of Alpha,

259
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,903
then Echo was his accomplice.

260
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:17,731
Do you know how crazy you sound?

261
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,852
Echo was missing for three months.

262
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:22,038
It stands to reason
someone was helping her.

263
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:23,361
If it wasn't Alpha,

264
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,559
who was it?

265
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,534
Do you have an alternate
explanation?

266
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:28,967
Thought as much.

267
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,325
Find Alpha and keep her locked up.

268
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:34,516
Clay Corman, ex-CEO of Comulus,

269
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,336
ex-client of Echo's,

270
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:39,838
was found dead 3 days ago outside of
his crappy trailer in Riverside County.

271
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,005
<i>Throat cut with a 5-inch
gut hook knife.</i>

272
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,690
Sheriff chalked it up
to a meth deal gone bad.

273
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:47,385
That guy was a billionaire.
Where'd all his money go?

274
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,679
Into that fine, ergonomic chair,
among other things.

275
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:51,451
Blew everything on the Dollhouse.

276
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:53,237
My ass does feel very pampered.

277
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:55,852
This is Brian Chu.
Took Echo on a month-long

278
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,271
European tour;
tried to marry her in Vienna.

279
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:00,165
And this is Megan Krentz.

280
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,284
She did marry Echo in San Francisco.

281
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:03,902
It was a lovely ceremony.

282
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:06,091
Brian was murdered four weeks ago,

283
00:15:06,216 --> 00:15:07,276
hit and run.

284
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,324
And Megan,
about ten days ago... shot.

285
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:13,078
These were romance engagements.
Maybe that's the pattern.

286
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,190
These engagements were special.
They were about love.

287
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,333
- They loved her?
- Echo loved them.

288
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:20,252
That's why Alpha wanted them dead.

289
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:22,395
So who's next?

290
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,551
Hey, buddy. Got a smoke?

291
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:29,125
Let me guess.

292
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,870
You've been done wrong by a man?

293
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:34,220
I've been done wrong ten ways
to Sunday and it's Tuesday.

294
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:36,245
Well, how about a treatment?

295
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,620
Sure, I'll take the treatment.
Why not?

296
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,855
He already gave me the business,
the bum.

297
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,776
Every Johnny Two Step's got a story,
and his was no different.

298
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:49,140
Some skirt done him rotten,
so takes it out on me.

299
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,449
Yeah, well, just lay back.

300
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,081
"The dolls hold all the cards",
he said.

301
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,925
Well, this is one doll
who's gonna fold.

302
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,585
I never want to hear his name again.

303
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:03,505
Excuse me?

304
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:07,799
We're sure it was him?

305
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,567
Myers was the handler.

306
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,400
He didn't get a good look
at the client.

307
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:14,125
Mr. E. Hap. Lasher doesn't exist.

308
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,620
And when you unscramble
the letters...

309
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:17,995
"Alpha's Here".

310
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:21,705
Have we any engagements this month
that he hasn't arranged?

311
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:23,360
I don't book the clients.

312
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:25,940
All right.
We don't know who he's got to.

313
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:28,320
So, we suspend all engagements,

314
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,360
put everyone through the chair,
wipe them all again.

315
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:34,117
I don't care if they haven't left
the House since Y2K.

316
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:36,350
- Clean slates.
- That's not all.

317
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,600
She said she had a message
from Alpha.

318
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:42,417
- I thought that was the message.
- She said "The next lover ages well".

319
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:46,004
- He wants us to be there this time.
- Let's not disappoint him.

320
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:54,390
It's like he's giving away
free government cheese in there.

321
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,565
They do enjoy their treatments.

322
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,860
"The next lover ages well".
So he's young.

323
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,835
Or he's old and looks good.

324
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,979
Any plastic surgery addicts?

325
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:06,190
It's got to be simpler than that.
He wants us to find him.

326
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:07,470
Part of the game.

327
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:08,745
"Aging well".

328
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,779
Who's got a birthday coming up?

329
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:13,199
- That's it.
- It is?

330
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,324
"Ages well".

331
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,993
Somebody who knows how to celebrate
his birthday in style.

332
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:20,465
Matt Cargill.
Books Echo once a year on his birthday.

333
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,755
Echo's crazy about him.

334
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,640
- Party area's empty.
- <i>So's the room they stayed in.</i>

335
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,226
Hold on, I think I see something.

336
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:43,585
- You better get up here.
- <i>On my way.</i>

337
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,965
Am I the only one
who bothered to dress for this?

338
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,576
I mean, the black works,

339
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:01,650
because honestly, when doesn't it?

340
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:03,825
It's functional, it's slimming.

341
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:05,105
But you...

342
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,885
You don't work
for the Federal government anymore.

343
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,424
Why don't you go
with just a splash of color?

344
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,525
- Trigger device.
- Yep.

345
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:16,715
Put it down Alpha.

346
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,395
If I do then...

347
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,275
he will become a splash of color.

348
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:23,965
I'm thinking red.

349
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,104
Help me.

350
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:28,925
Do not do this.

351
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:31,425
There's a part of you
that knows this is wrong.

352
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,890
There are many parts of me
that know that this is wrong.

353
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:36,415
None that care. And six...

354
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,675
that just find it funny.

355
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,120
You know what's not funny?

356
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,195
Is that she actually cares...

357
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:46,875
about these guys.

358
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,925
You know what I mean.

359
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,253
She loves.

360
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:54,507
But they're just using her.

361
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:58,585
Not even every part of her.
Just the piece that serves them.

362
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,097
They're wasting her.

363
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,314
So I'm going to waste them.

364
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,853
- She doesn't remember.
- Do not lie to me!

365
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:08,688
We remember everything.

366
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,406
What were you saying,

367
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:12,552
about you and Echo,
about your time together?

368
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:14,391
Tell them what you told me.

369
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:16,566
Please, please, just let me go.

370
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,381
You said that she was amazing...

371
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:22,869
and that it was what?

372
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,075
Tell them.

373
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:27,545
I said it was a blast.

374
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,626
- Who doesn't love a pun?
- Fall back!

375
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:56,319
He's gone.

376
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,855
They both are.

377
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:03,250
Dunsford's on an international flight
for the next 12 hours.

378
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,079
Angie Dameron is in a safe house
outside of Berkeley.

379
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:09,457
Yoshi Maru died of leukemia
a year ago.

380
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,345
So who's left?

381
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:12,765
Just one,

382
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:14,375
Joel Mynor.

383
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,200
- The Internet guy.
- Problem is, I can't track him down.

384
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:22,428
Two weeks out of the year,
he goes on some retreat and disappears.

385
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:26,430
Family members and business colleagues
insist they have no idea where.

386
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,768
So maybe that means
Alpha won't be able to find him.

387
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:30,520
I imagine Rebecca knows.

388
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:33,410
- Rebecca, the dead wife?
- Rebecca, the imprint.

389
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:35,635
If she knows, Alpha knows.

390
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:37,569
We have to find him
before Alpha does.

391
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,504
I haven't done anything wrong, okay?
You can't arrest me.

392
00:20:56,865 --> 00:20:58,715
I'm not here to arrest you.

393
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:01,843
You know what, you kicked the crap
out of me last time, and I let it slide,

394
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,724
but I don't forgive
when I'm on vacation.

395
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,490
So just get lost, FBI guy.

396
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:07,565
I'm not with the FBI anymore.

397
00:21:07,954 --> 00:21:10,310
I'm with the Dollhouse,
and we believe you're in danger.

398
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:12,625
You're with them now?

399
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:17,660
You're a little bit of a freak.
I don't even know what to say to that.

400
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:19,920
Someone may be trying
to kill you, Mr. Mynor.

401
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,149
We believe you'll be safest
inside the Dollhouse until we find him.

402
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,724
Not a chance.

403
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,530
That part of my life is over, okay?

404
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:29,720
And I got rid of your girl's number.

405
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:31,748
And...
I mean, I'm getting married, okay?

406
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,216
I have moved on.

407
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,045
Hi, Joel.

408
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:48,306
I've missed you so much.

409
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,840
You sure he'll be safe here?

410
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,380
As safe as he can be.

411
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:04,005
Baby, I'll be fine.
I mean, this spa looks super fortified.

412
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:07,120
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

413
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:09,495
Mr. Mynor, I'm so glad you're well.

414
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,413
We will make sure you're comfortable
until the threat has passed.

415
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,625
- Thanks, Adelle.
- I hear congratulations are in order.

416
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,710
Your pending nuptials
have made all the papers.

417
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,720
Thank you.

418
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:20,550
Our programmer, Mr. Brink.

419
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:22,640
He's been very eager
to show you his toys.

420
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:25,352
And he can keep you occupied
for days, if necessary.

421
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:28,260
- Huge fan. Huge.
- Thank you.

422
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:29,920
Joel, can I stay with you?

423
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:31,560
Oh, I don't see why not.

424
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,519
I'm afraid my Active
is in very great need of a treatment.

425
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,165
Okay, but...

426
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:40,775
I can see her later, though, right?

427
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,986
Of course.
We'll take very great care of her.

428
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,455
Let me show you around.

429
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:53,335
Sit.

430
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:54,455
There.

431
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,195
Tell me,

432
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:04,347
which part of "put Echo in solitary"

433
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:06,450
was unclear to either of you?

434
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:08,075
It was an emergency.

435
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,887
We're handing out day passes now?

436
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:14,070
You both blatantly disregarded
a direct order and then lied about it.

437
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:15,500
We had to act quickly.

438
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,479
Echo was the only one
who could find Mynor and bring him in.

439
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:19,981
You mean Rebecca.

440
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,310
Rebecca knew how to get to Mynor.

441
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,435
Of course.

442
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm aware of your little cabal.

443
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,530
And I will not be managed.

444
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,491
We're sorry.
It won't happen again.

445
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:33,141
I need to find a more suitable location
for Mr. Mynor.

446
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:36,116
We can't have clients
roaming about the house.

447
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,230
Get her out of my sight.

448
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:41,205
And consider yourselves
on a very short leash.

449
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,163
And the information
is stored non-linearly,

450
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,799
like the brain.

451
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,360
Want to see the hardware?

452
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:50,734
I wouldn't mind
a few pity compliments.

453
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:54,265
Look, don't be scared.

454
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,165
I'm not.

455
00:23:57,445 --> 00:24:00,508
It's just that this morning,
I was engaged to a great girl,

456
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:03,233
and now I'm hiding out
with my dead wife.

457
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:06,085
It never occurred to me that

458
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:08,988
Rebecca would still exist
after I stopped coming here.

459
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:11,315
Makes sense, you know? I...

460
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:14,390
You can't ever really delete
a program.

461
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:16,287
Once it exists, it's alive.

462
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:20,249
That's kind of the problem
we're having right now with Alpha.

463
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,169
Yeah, the guy who wants me dead.

464
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:24,433
Who is he?

465
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:28,790
In a nutshell,
he's this super genius serial killer

466
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:31,286
who imprinted himself
with a bunch of personalities

467
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:32,761
and then escaped.

468
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:33,955
Wait, what?

469
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:35,805
Nutshell, nutshell.

470
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:38,363
It's not as bad as it sounds.

471
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:40,561
He knows where this place is.

472
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,563
- Technically, yeah.
- Technically?

473
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,890
Hey, it's all good.

474
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,734
We've totally revamped the security
system and the countermeasures.

475
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:49,362
There is no way
he'll break in here again.

476
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:51,665
Break... You said he broke out.

477
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:05,790
Judith, we need to find
a five-star hotel nearby.

478
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:09,919
Something where an armed security detail
can be discretely accommodated.

479
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,346
Try the Franklin.

480
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,855
It has a terrific pasta bar.

481
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:20,560
Also, you're almost out of paper.

482
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:25,815
All right, tell me the truth.

483
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:28,195
What do you think of the suit?

484
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,335
You're quite the dandy.

485
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:35,222
It's a little Brummell.
I've gone a little Brummell.

486
00:25:35,815 --> 00:25:38,070
It's better to look good
than to feel good.

487
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:39,295
It's ironic.

488
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:42,863
It took 40-odd characters
on the inside...

489
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,888
for me to realize

490
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:48,440
that it's what's on the outside
that counts.

491
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:50,465
Let me freshen that for you.

492
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:55,935
Are you scared?

493
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:58,855
Out of my mind.

494
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:00,595
Smart girl.

495
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,103
Of course, I could never be
out of my mind.

496
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:07,982
I have so many, and the second
I'm out of one, I'm right into the next.

497
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:09,935
I have you to thank.

498
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:12,612
If it's Echo you want,
I could send for her.

499
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:15,345
That's not very chivalrous of you.

500
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:19,445
I've moved beyond chivalry
on to self-preservation.

501
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:21,275
Well,

502
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:23,915
I'm not here for Echo.

503
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,065
She's not ready for me yet.

504
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:28,085
The man we're protecting...

505
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:31,180
I'm having him transferred. I'll be
happy to furnish you with an address.

506
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,805
All this bargaining.

507
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:36,969
You don't have anything I want
that I can't just take, and I will.

508
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:38,975
When I'm ready.

509
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:41,494
But for right now,

510
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:44,169
I have something
I wanna share with you.

511
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,810
I can't believe
I made her come back for this.

512
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:50,942
She's safe.

513
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:54,153
Joel Mynor's safe.
Nobody she loves died today.

514
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:57,073
- Small comfort.
- There's no comfort.

515
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:58,695
Not for Echo.

516
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:05,230
I know that looking at someone else's
holiday snaps is usually such a bore,

517
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:08,105
but I thought that these
might interest you.

518
00:27:08,452 --> 00:27:09,252
Indeed.

519
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:12,546
What do you think of
how I spent my summer?

520
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:14,825
Most intriguing.

521
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:18,000
That's what I love
about the British.

522
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,175
Your talent for understatement.

523
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:21,347
Also Python.

524
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:23,525
Well,

525
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:25,935
tally-ho then!

526
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,050
In fact,

527
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:30,425
what say we tally your ho's?

528
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,401
How many you got down there
these days?

529
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,865
A couple hundred? More? Less?

530
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:39,942
You can't hope to get to Mr. Mynor
without security intervening.

531
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:42,368
We can always hope.

532
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:45,055
Why don't I have him simply sent up?

533
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,248
What, with a puckish pinot?

534
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:48,708
No, thanks.

535
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,880
I don't wanna waste
the element of surprise.

536
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:52,205
We'll go down.

537
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,588
We'll take the executive elevator.

538
00:27:57,995 --> 00:27:59,245
Get your purse.

539
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:12,150
Get to Joel Mynor.
I'll go for DeWitt.

540
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,525
Security alert.

541
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:19,155
God, it's good to be back.

542
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:23,160
I imagine you put them through the chair
after you discovered the breach.

543
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,285
Why?

544
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,953
No reason.

545
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:29,035
Southeast stairs.

546
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:32,005
Go to your man.

547
00:28:35,535 --> 00:28:37,385
Time to send in the clowns.

548
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,071
This way!

549
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,375
What the hell was that?

550
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:57,785
Test of the emergency
broadcast system?

551
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:08,615
Hiya, Joel.

552
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:39,460
Did they eat my brains?

553
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:40,760
Topher, you're fine.

554
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:42,923
- Joel Mynor, where is he?
- He's in there.

555
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,525
With Alpha.

556
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,845
Get out of here.

557
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,974
Bait, meet switch.

558
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:26,685
Hello, lover boy.

559
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:32,425
Easy.

560
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:35,643
You'll pull something.

561
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,980
You're in for the ride.
You're not gonna get loose.

562
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:43,883
One of my imprints was an Eagle Scout.
Another one was a sailor.

563
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:47,613
There's a dirty joke
in there somewhere.

564
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:49,765
What are you doing?

565
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,578
What every great philosopher
since time immemorial

566
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,120
has attempted to do.

567
00:31:56,674 --> 00:31:59,583
To answer the question,
"what is this thing

568
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,961
"called love... this funny
thing called love...

569
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,921
"and who can solve it?" Etcetera.

570
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:04,963
What?

571
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:07,578
It's different.

572
00:32:07,703 --> 00:32:11,053
And I want to crack open
that egg and see what's inside.

573
00:32:11,406 --> 00:32:13,256
What are you talking about?

574
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:14,946
This...

575
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,771
I'm talking about this...

576
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:21,953
you and my immortal
beloved playing house.

577
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:25,901
It's probably my fault. I'm the idiot
that introduced the two of you.

578
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:28,251
Look at her.

579
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:31,615
Do you see that in her face there?

580
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,001
What would you say that is?

581
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:35,452
Lens flare?

582
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,837
She has feelings for you.

583
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:39,037
Feelings.

584
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,725
Nothing more than feelings.

585
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,462
She shouldn't have those.
Not any that weren't put there.

586
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,392
- How did you do it?
- I'm her handler.

587
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,801
Those feelings were put there.

588
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:54,854
That's not Active handler face.

589
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:56,579
That's something else.

590
00:32:56,982 --> 00:32:58,932
- Could be love.
- It's not.

591
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:02,995
Is an acorn a tree?

592
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,276
And you, look at you!

593
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,282
- Planted, watered, fertilized!
- You're wrong.

594
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:15,837
No, I'm not wrong.
I was there.

595
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,923
I saw everything.

596
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:19,611
There was nothing to see.

597
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:22,087
That's how I know
that I am not wrong.

598
00:33:23,861 --> 00:33:26,161
For months you shared the same room.

599
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:29,363
You never slept with her.
You could have, but you didn't.

600
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:31,985
If that's not love...

601
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:36,175
Are you gay?

602
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:40,989
Then it's love.

603
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,860
DeWitt thought so, too.

604
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,916
- How many are with you?
- And who are you, exactly?

605
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,378
Do you want to talk,
or do you want me to save your life?

606
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:12,800
Come on, Adelle, move your ass.

607
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,575
We can hug it out later.

608
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,101
Thanks.

609
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,270
Bedchamber.

610
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,405
- What do we know?
- Sierra didn't just have a message,

611
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,189
she was carrying a computer virus.

612
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:33,348
When I wiped her,
it must have infected the system.

613
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:36,573
He knew we'd put all our Actives through
the chair after that. It's protocol.

614
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:40,128
Then he used that tone he used
to remote wipe me to activate them.

615
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:42,703
- Yet you're immune.
- I'm like him...

616
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:44,873
- but not.
- Isn't that lucky?

617
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:46,444
He's got us chalked off.

618
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:49,294
- How did you get away?
- He wasn't after me. It was Ballard.

619
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:50,921
What?

620
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,228
Yeah, he has him in there,
in that room.

621
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:55,968
Go.

622
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,758
We can defend ourselves.

623
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,751
Just try not to hurt them.
They're people.

624
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,600
There is something going on here.

625
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,691
But nothing more
than the average bear,

626
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:27,957
so why do you get to be her honey?

627
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:31,712
Well?

628
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:33,839
Hello?

629
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,552
When did you die?

630
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:44,615
Maybe me trying
to get into your head

631
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,894
was the wrong approach.

632
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:49,605
We need to get to my elevator.
It's our only way out.

633
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:50,898
There's too many.

634
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:54,459
We have a cache of tranq guns.
They're in the upper utility.

635
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:56,710
Wait, wait.
My remote wipe device.

636
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:59,392
The one I designed for Harding.
We were about to go into production.

637
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:00,908
It's in the manufacturing room.

638
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,619
- That's kinda not far, right?
- We can reach that no problem.

639
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:04,912
Go, now!

640
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:25,181
So, do you think
this thing will turn them off?

641
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:28,393
Should. Otherwise, we might
have to shoot them in the brains.

642
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,217
- We should try this first.
- We don't have much time.

643
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:33,593
Won't take me a second
to put this together.

644
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:36,066
- You have to put it together?
- It's the manufacturing room,

645
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:37,653
not the "it's finished" room!

646
00:36:48,846 --> 00:36:50,429
Your boyfriend's dead.

647
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:56,373
You wanna snuggle?

648
00:36:57,723 --> 00:36:58,723
Too soon?

649
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:03,161
You killed him.

650
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,289
He's dead.

651
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:08,752
Well, brain-dead.

652
00:37:10,914 --> 00:37:12,064
You're upset.

653
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:17,234
I can see you're upset.

654
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:27,856
I should be mad.

655
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:29,872
I created you,
and who do you fall for?

656
00:37:30,418 --> 00:37:32,666
The schmuck guy used to get in here.

657
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,465
He's ten times the man you are,
and you're, like, 40 guys.

658
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:50,050
Is that why he didn't lay a hand on you
during your <i>Three Months of the Condor</i>,

659
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:51,643
because he was such a gentleman?

660
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:55,032
This isn't like footprints on the moon.
Many, many men

661
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:56,807
have come there before.

662
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:07,428
Face it, you are nothing
but a science project to him.

663
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:08,953
I'm sorry,

664
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:11,192
no, were...

665
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:13,933
a science project to him.

666
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:18,741
Get over it, babies.

667
00:38:19,555 --> 00:38:21,355
Love the ones you're with.

668
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:32,062
To love me is to love yourself.

669
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:33,895
We're the same.

670
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:38,774
Playing in the mud
won't make you an animal.

671
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:40,525
You were meant for a love supreme.

672
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,600
I could never love you.

673
00:38:51,187 --> 00:38:52,487
Do you trust me?

674
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,248
Paul?

675
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:57,032
I'm sorry.

676
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:59,336
I thought we had more time.

677
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,230
He imprinted himself with you.

678
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:04,678
Do you trust me?

679
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,200
With my life.

680
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,148
Then end mine...

681
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,058
Please.

682
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:14,851
Do it.

683
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:16,567
Please!

684
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:48,595
Did I fall asleep?

685
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,290
Did I fall asleep?

686
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:36,337
I'm gonna leave now.

687
00:40:38,463 --> 00:40:40,013
He's still out there.

688
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:45,166
Somehow I don't feel
like I'm much safer in here.

689
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:49,028
I mean, I have the resources
to protect myself from...

690
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,082
almost anything.

691
00:40:58,718 --> 00:40:59,664
Rebecca?

692
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:02,466
Joel.

693
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:04,718
My Joel.

694
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:07,839
You never told me about her.

695
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:09,707
What's she like?

696
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,520
What's her name?

697
00:41:16,347 --> 00:41:17,397
Anne-Marie.

698
00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:19,308
And, she's...

699
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:23,438
I know you're not Rebecca

700
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,400
and-and neither is she.
And she could...

701
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,460
She could never replace...

702
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,670
you.

703
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,978
She's not supposed to replace me.

704
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,700
Rebecca wouldn't want that.

705
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:41,581
But she wouldn't want you
to be alone.

706
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:45,512
I thought I was past it.

707
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:48,453
You don't get past it.

708
00:41:49,604 --> 00:41:50,604
It just...

709
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,042
becomes a part of who you are.

710
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:57,006
You...

711
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,050
live on for me.

712
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:02,866
And I'm... so glad of that.

713
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:31,712
And you live on for me.
