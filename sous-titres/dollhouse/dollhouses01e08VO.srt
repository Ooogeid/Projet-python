1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,790
Previously on Dollhouse:

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,090
She's a risk. An increasing risk.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,830
She had control over the situation.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,830
But we can't control her.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,680
No. Stay away from me! No.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,270
No!

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,680
please...

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,760
There are three flowers in a vase.
The third flower is green.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,210
And our sleeper active
performed perfectly.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,640
I replayed the tap.

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,000
More than once.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,030
It did not lack for poetry.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,640
You.

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,740
I only have a few minutes.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,140
They can't know this
body left an engagement.

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,640
Are we not fighting this time?

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,780
I have a message for you
from inside the Dollhouse.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,700
What? Sit back and wait some
more while they dismantle my life?

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,750
I could handcuff you right now
and bring the dollhouse to my door.

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,100
So, you tell me, who sent you?

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,010
You have something we need.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,190
I have something you need.

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,170
And what is that?

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,860
I'm not a client. I don't need that.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,360
You know you do.

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,630
Caroline?

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,830
Save me, Paul.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,920
- Oh, god.
- Oh, my god.

29
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,810
Mellie.

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,290
I guess I took too long getting back.

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,530
You're already with A... her.

32
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,250
I know this is confusing for all of us.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,800
Don't stop, Paul. I need you.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,610
Paul!

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,070
I'm sorry. I have a thing she needs.

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,250
She's not even real!

37
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,610
You feel me. Trust that.

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,370
I need you to finish what you started.

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,550
Caroline doesn't need anything
anymore, Paul. She's dead!

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,930
No. Caroline? Come back.

41
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,210
I won't let anything
happen to you. Not again.

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,320
You let them hurt me, didn't you?

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,810
No. I tried to stop it.

44
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,060
How did they know?

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,350
I'm trying to stop everything.

46
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,620
How do they know what we shared?

47
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,550
How do they know?

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,860
We're all aware there
have been recent problems.

49
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,100
Ours is a complicated world.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,390
But the world of our actives
must be one of constant certainty.

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,600
Did you guys start early?

52
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,650
I-I was, uh, backing up my
primary drives to protect them...

53
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,440
from that.

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,800
As Topher points out, we are currently
upgrading our electrical and security systems.

55
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,130
We will be instituting
other changes as well.

56
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,630
We have had an active go off mission.

57
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,520
Another has developed urges. Others still are
showing signs of cognizance or recognition.

58
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,770
Nearly all the actives exposed to the n-7316
drug experienced a glitch, a random memory thread.

59
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,330
This house is out of balance.

60
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,910
For the handlers, the main concern
will be identifying behavioral problems

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,350
that cannot be quelled
and reporting them.

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,590
It's easy to become attached
to your assigned active.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,760
In fact, it's necessary, but
don't think of them as children.

64
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,280
Think of them as pets.

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,050
Is that supposed to be funny?

66
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,810
If your child starts talking for
the first time, you feel proud.

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,830
If your dog does, you
freak the hell out.

68
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,700
Any developmental progress an active
makes is dangerous to the house,

69
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,570
and a possible first
step toward another alpha.

70
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,570
What about the alpha
that's already an alpha?

71
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,650
Whereabouts unknown.

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,750
Let's stay on topic. Topher?

73
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,760
I've scrubbed them as
much as I safely can.

74
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,470
If we pursued the short-range
calcium modulin k2 amplifier,

75
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,620
I could advance the protein's
corrosion of long-term potentiation.

76
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,430
Done, whatever that
means. Anything else?

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,260
The sleep cycle.

78
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,580
The sedatives and anti-psychotics we pump into the
pods with the o2, the subliminal tone patterns...

79
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,620
I think I could...

80
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,130
play with that cocktail a bit.

81
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,540
Sleeping is their most vulnerable time.

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,440
We could test it out on one chamber
if you're stressed about it...

83
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:12,070
If you start playing with their meds,
it could backfire or damage them.

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,790
Or solve the problem.

85
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,350
I know what I'm doing, doc.

86
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,840
So do I.

87
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,580
But I also care what
you're doing. To our pets.

88
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,040
I will take this into consideration.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,790
I need reports at the end of every shift
detailing your interactions with the actives:

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,350
feelings they express, questions they
ask, instincts you observe. Everything.

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,420
We can't jump at shadows.

92
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,180
I don't want to report that my active asked
for toast and have her sent to the attic.

93
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,140
We were hired to protect them.

94
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,790
In the field, yes, mr. Langton.

95
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,430
In here, we protect the house.

96
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,030
A tide is rising.

97
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,580
Until we learn how to turn it back,
we pile up the sandbags together.

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,350
Unless anyone here thinks
they've got a better idea.

99
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,160
Caroline, I'm Paul Ballard.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm with the FBI.

101
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,120
Your name is Caroline.

102
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,410
You don't know this, but
you're being fooled, you're being used.

103
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,420
I will never hurt you.

104
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,300
Do you trust me? Do you
want to play the game?

105
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,440
You remember to be very
quiet during the game, right?

106
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,610
Caroline, wake up.

107
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,810
Help.God. Oh, god.

108
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,850
Help me! Help me, somebody, please!

109
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,940
Help me, somebody!

110
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,080
Somebody get me out of here!

Oh, my god, help me! Get me out of here!

115
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,490
Help! Help me!

116
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,150
Who's there?

117
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,970
Who the hell are you?

118
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,520
I woke up in a five-star floor
coffin just like you, pal.

119
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,220
Help! Help me!

120
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,020
Let me out! Let me out!

121
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,310
- Let me out!
- Noise. Not helping.

122
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,700
Doesn't matter. They're listening.

123
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,700
Anyone hear me over here? Help!

124
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,510
- You okay?
- Who's listening?

125
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,910
Aliens.

126
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,650
Pervs behind glass
getting off watching us.

127
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,550
Yeah, we're in outer space, right?

128
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,440
We're in a nuthouse, more like.

129
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,540
What humans you know build circular pod rooms
with stone cavities and peeping windows?

130
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,930
Definitely feeling
kind of lab-ratty here.

131
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,500
I'm leaving before the electric shock.

132
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,420
Sorry. It's a defense mechanism.
I'm just really terrified.

133
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,080
Anybody else got anything
better than aliens?

134
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,200
I'm serious about lab rats.

135
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,620
- Maybe we're supposed to be here.
- What for? I didn't do anything.

136
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,740
Do you know that?

137
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,830
I don't remember anything.

138
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,270
I mean, I know the days of the week, the
capital of Nebraska, but nothing about me.

139
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,960
My guess: We're prisoners of some sort.

140
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,670
We need to assess the situation,
formulate a strategy...

141
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,340
Run.

142
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,400
Strategically.

143
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,010
Yeah, and when they come in
with guns, what do we fight with?

144
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,200
We take the glass shade off the light
fixtures, splinter them. Use them as shivs.

145
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,650
Deranged millionaire serial
killer. That's what I think.

146
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,160
That's not stupider than aliens?

147
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,570
Hey, watch your mouth.

148
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,140
Hey, can we all act like
humans and not monkeys?

149
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,070
I know you, don't I?

150
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,570
How?

151
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,120
I think I have to get to the mountains.

152
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,070
Everything's okay there.

153
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,920
I lost something.

154
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,150
Maybe it's here somewhere.

155
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,460
They probably want to study
our reproductive systems.

156
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,070
Sex with aliens?

157
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,670
Come on. Who doesn't wanna
put alien guy back in the box?

158
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,430
What's behind me?

159
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,090
It's okay. Just walk towards me.

160
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,910
Someone's out there.

161
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,020
A lot of someones.

162
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,180
It's been very nice nearly
knowing you guys. Good luck.

163
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,850
Hey, hey, hold up. You need backup.

164
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,730
I want to know what they look like.

165
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm not sure I do.

166
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,150
Hey, we gotta get moving. I don't
wanna leave you behind, please!

167
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,390
- They're people like us.
- But so calm.

168
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,800
Maybe they know why we're here.

169
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,700
See? I think they like it.

170
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,750
So do we, like it like them. Got it?

171
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,970
What we don't want is
to get noticed, so...

172
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,090
until we know what's going on...

173
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,260
Good morning, Tango.

174
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,330
Good morning, Victor. Sierra, Mike.

175
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,930
Hi, November, your clothes
are in the changing room.

176
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,210
How are you, Echo?

177
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,620
Fine, thank you.

178
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,290
- That's not my name.
- Not names, codes. Military.

179
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,810
Who uses those besides...

180
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,010
are we government prisoners?

181
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,040
Everyone does look peaceful.

182
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,990
Maybe something bad happened to us.

183
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,430
And they're helping us heal.

184
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,370
That makes sense.

185
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,620
Good morning. We're having banana
pancakes for breakfast today.

186
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,670
I like pancakes.

187
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,130
We're all gonna die.

188
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,950
I like bananas.

189
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,620
They're naturally sweet.

190
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,250
They're high in potassium.

191
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,800
So's the earth's core.

192
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,950
But that's not food.

193
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,510
No, it isn't, Mike.

194
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,440
A food that's naturally sweet.

195
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,700
Apples, cantaloupe, uh,
kiwis, mango, mayonnaise.

196
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,590
Echo, is there something
wrong with your hand?

197
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,230
No, it's fine.

198
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,060
I don't think so. May I see it?

199
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,950
I'm going to need to take
you to see dr. Saunders now.

200
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,540
Hello?

201
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,060
Echo, what's wrong?

202
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,260
Uh, they made me come
see you. About my hand.

203
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,830
Oh, no, what happened?

204
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,480
Oh, my god!

205
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,730
Did they do that to you here?

206
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,670
Echo, please, sit.

207
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,010
No, I want to know.
What the hell happened?

208
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,030
Don't... they're watching.

209
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,540
You work for them. Who
are they? Where are we?

210
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,480
Please.

211
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,370
I'm not your friend in here, Echo.

212
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,490
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

213
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,800
I'm happy! I'm happy! Guys,
I'm relaxed and I'm happy!

214
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,560
I like banana pancakes.

215
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,350
I want to climb the rock wall now!

216
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,050
Isn't that what you want?

217
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,370
Tell me and I'll do it!

218
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,570
- Please, help!
- Let me.

219
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,690
Help! Somebody help me!

220
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,020
No...

221
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,480
Mike screwed up. Got
noticed. Nothing we could do.

222
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,290
He might be okay. The
doctor said she'd help.

223
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,560
- She did?
- You told her?

224
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,400
She knows we're not like the others?

225
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,630
She warned me. About the cameras.

226
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,400
Keep walking.

227
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,460
Coed showers? I don't believe it.

228
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,120
But we have to do it.

229
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,050
So, no big deal.

230
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,490
Okay, new york starting lineup,
1986, first base:Keith Hernandez;

231
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,030
second base: Wally Backman;
shortstop: Rafael Santana.

232
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,500
Keep your eyes right where they are.

233
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,170
Mookie Wilson: Left field...

234
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,410
third base: Ray Knight; catcher: Gary
Carter: Center field:Lenny Dykstra.

235
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,200
Hey, hey, it's Mike.

236
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,470
Hey, pal. You all right?

237
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,920
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Thank god. What happened to you?

238
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,850
I had a treatment.

239
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,910
Just a spa thing, nothing bad?

240
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,300
Did you see the doctor?

241
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,180
Dr. Saunders? She's so nice.

242
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,990
I was trying to tell these guys,
I think she's a prisoner, like us.

243
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,180
No cameras here. No one's watching.

244
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,930
Mike? Do you remember me? Lab rat?

245
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,600
Yes, you're Echo.

246
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,950
We woke up together,
trapped. We were scared.

247
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,500
I like sleeping in the pods.

248
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,890
Wait, where are you going?

249
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,190
I'm going to swim in the pool.

250
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,460
No, Mike, we're all gonna leave.
Come with us.

251
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,110
I do 30 laps every day.

252
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,010
It helps me be my best.

253
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,950
We lost Mike.

254
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,270
We save ourselves and we do it now.

255
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,210
I'm with her.

256
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,560
Okay.

257
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,350
Yes, mr. Dominic?

258
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,920
I was just informed we have
four actives preparing to escape.

259
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,250
Right on schedule.

260
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,920
Will you at least allow me to
brief the in-house security team?

261
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,000
The entire staff thinks they're preparing
for an exercise two months down the road.

262
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,700
They're not ready.

263
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,040
Every person in this house should
always be ready. For anything.

264
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:41,150
Echo, Sierra, Victor, and November
need real adversaries, real obstacles.

265
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,300
Freedom has to be earned.

266
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,620
We don't even have
the power to end this.

267
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,270
There's no kill switch;
we can't shut them down.

268
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,550
What if they make it out into the world and decide
to shoot up a liquor store and jump off a roof?

269
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't be melodramatic.

270
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,180
We could lose them all.

271
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,720
And there's a limit to what I'll
be able to clean up after the fact.

272
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,840
I've made my decision.

273
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,560
I forgot where the sauna is.

274
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,750
You told me.

275
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,930
I like the sauna.

276
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,990
Big surprise there.

277
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,090
He's very tired.

278
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,330
So, the light at the
end of the tunnel was...

279
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,170
Another tunnel.

280
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,220
No need to be aware of anything but
your breath moving through your body.

281
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,530
Tango... would you
like your treatment now?

282
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,110
It's time.

283
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,460
Come on. Right here.

284
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,300
Did something happen to them?

285
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,930
What's taking them so long?

286
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,550
They're just being careful is all.

287
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,020
We'll give them a little bit more time.

288
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,470
Why don't you tell me
something about yourself?

289
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,790
I'm just making small talk.

290
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,050
We don't remember anything, remember?

291
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,410
Sometimes I feel like we... we do.

292
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,420
The yankees.

293
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,310
The mets, but whatever. And you.

294
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,900
Are you sure?

295
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,610
Can you tell me anything about me?

296
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,860
I just got this feeling
in my gut that...

297
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,460
something bad happened to you.

298
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,450
Probably the same something
bad that happened to all of us.

299
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,200
I don't feel that way
about anyone else. Just you.

300
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:31,310
Is there any part of you
that... finds me... familiar?

301
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,530
- It's them.
- Thank god.

302
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,180
Nobody saw us, but who
knows what the cameras got.

303
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,950
Or who's watching them.

304
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,860
Sophie. You're off, too?

305
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,260
After a few hours of paperwork
to wrap up the client's file.

306
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,350
What kind of engagement were you on?

307
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,620
I can't believe you are cheating on me
with that perfect woman you just met.

308
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,150
Now I get everything in the divorce.

309
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,540
Easy stuff.

310
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,770
Seems tame next to the crap
you've been dealing with.

311
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,320
Echo's all right. They're just
giving her a few days' downtime.

312
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,860
I can use the vacation.

313
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,250
Ask me, she's not gonna last.

314
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,080
I haven't given up on her yet.

315
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,530
Look, Boyd, you're a classy guy, but
you really shouldn't get too attached.

316
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,780
It's like mr. Dominic
said. They're pets.

317
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,240
Even a good dog needs
to be put down sometimes.

318
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,270
Stairwell ends this level.

319
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,790
There's got to be another.

320
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,360
What's wrong? Look at me... look.

321
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,270
Tell me. What's wrong?
Keep an eye on the hall.

322
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,210
I remember... men.

323
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,120
They had guns. They took me away.

324
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,600
I remember the man who put me here.

325
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,870
Then, we'll get him, understand?

326
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,200
I will get him, but you got to be strong for me
now and go with us, so you can help me find him.

327
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,520
Still no windows. We
got to be underground.

328
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,430
We need to find another way.

329
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,680
This just keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

330
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,470
- What is all this for?
- Us.

331
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,050
These all say "Echo".

332
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,780
There's a rack for each of us.

333
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,550
Yeah, there is.

334
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,420
We can blend in more now.

335
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,250
This fits perfectly.

336
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,790
Yeah. Maybe these are
clothes from our former life.

337
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,680
Never mind. Let's go right now.

338
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,800
I thought we were getting changed first.

339
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,850
I have a daughter. Katie.

340
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,850
Okay. We'll get you out of here.

341
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,560
What's wrong?

342
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,970
She has a daughter.

343
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,760
Please help me find her.
I don't know where she is.

344
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,270
Someone's coming.

345
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,480
Who has the card thingy?

346
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,590
What did you just do?

347
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,330
- Call the elevator.
- What if somebody's in it?

348
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,000
We don't have a choice, do we?

349
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,100
Go up or go back. Anyone going back?

350
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,370
I can't believe we made it.

351
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,900
Start checking doors; see
if any of them are unlocked.

352
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,870
We need to tell someone
about what's happening.

353
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,630
Should we call the police, the FBI?

354
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,220
For all we know, this is the FBI.

355
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,890
What about everybody
inside that needs help?

356
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,670
We do nothing till we understand what
this place is and who we can trust.

357
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,900
Guys, car's coming.

358
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,090
When you wear the uniform, you
got to push it all down, bury it.

359
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,290
It never happened, right?

360
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,290
The good guys lost one today.

361
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,480
I had to watch a man die, and I'm
just supposed to make it disappear?

362
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,160
Guys, wait here.

363
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,100
Did you hear that? Someone died.

364
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,080
He said he was one of the good guys.

365
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,800
But he went in there. How
do we know who to trust?

366
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:59,110
We trust each other. We figure this out
together. We start with what we know.

367
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,780
You know your name's not Sierra.

368
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,620
And the guy that put you
here, what's his name?

369
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,810
I-I don't know.

370
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,420
No, you do know. What's his name?

371
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,900
His name...

372
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,240
his name...

373
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,700
his name is Nolan.

374
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,330
See?

375
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,580
And you know Katie, your daughter.

376
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,130
And you're gonna think hard and
remember where to find her, right?

377
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,170
And I know a mountain
house. It's safe there.

378
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,120
I need to go there.

379
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,340
Guys, look sharp. Wheels up.

380
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,900
Look out!

381
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,160
You know I don't understand
when you speak french.

382
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,950
Tango?

383
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,030
Let's get out of here.

384
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,480
On your toes, people.We
have a black suv,

385
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:19,240
license plate number 386pce embarking
with the following four actives:

386
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,720
Victor, Sierra, November, and Echo.

387
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,890
Here we go.

388
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,200
Wait.

389
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,640
What are you doing? What's wrong?

390
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,160
Get back in the car!

391
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,400
I can't leave.

392
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,530
Did you see Tango, that sweet girl?

393
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,720
That is not a costume
warehouse we just busted out of.

394
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,040
That's a people warehouse.

395
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,200
You have to come with us.

396
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,490
The army guy they brought back...
they're doing it both ways.

397
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,160
They make people go out and do terrible things,
and then bring them back and make them go away.

398
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,950
And you'll be putting
yourself back in there.

399
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,410
You didn't fight to get out for nothing.

400
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,330
Not nothing. You guys are okay
now. I go back in knowing that.

401
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,470
This thing-- it's too big. There's too many of them.
They got guns. What do you think you're gonna do?

402
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,390
Try and make a difference.

403
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,110
Echo. What are you doing here?

404
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,670
Don't touch that.

405
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,010
It's okay. I'm just gonna call Boyd.

406
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,310
Remember Boyd, your handler?
You know him. You trust him.

407
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,530
- I said don't touch it.
- Okay.

408
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,480
Uh, I'm a friend of his. Maybe I
can help. Do you know what you need?

409
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,000
Give me the key.

410
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,660
No one here wants to hurt you, Echo.

411
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,940
I don't want to hurt you.

412
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:40,080
I'm just gonna tell Boyd you're here, and he'll
come and take you for your treatment. All right?

413
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,700
You Jimmy?

414
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,020
Good day to you, too.

415
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,710
Ever seen one of these?

416
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,030
Uh, yeah. Just now, on
the counter in front of me.

417
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,490
I really hope you don't want to pretend
you don't butter your bread this way,

418
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,030
'cause I'm not in a
mood that's gonna care.

419
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,270
I'm just trying to figure out what
kind of business you think you got here.

420
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,340
Look at it.

421
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,310
Look. Any closer, and it will
come out of the back of my head.

422
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,780
This don't even exist yet.

423
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,960
Meaning what?

424
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,530
Meaning, if me and everyone else I know
powwowed, we still wouldn't figure this out.

425
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,730
It's gorgeous.

426
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,540
Can I trace where it was transmitting?

427
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,110
Absolutely. If you were E.T.

428
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,250
It inverts the frequency
into white noise.

429
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,560
The only way you could find it once
it hits the universe is to know exactly

430
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,230
which speck of dust you're
looking for and tune in on it.

431
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,250
What about scrambling it?

432
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,330
Someone put this on you? Huh?

433
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,960
You're gonna need an rf detector,
smart scrambler, and frequency jammer.

434
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,890
And to believe in god, 'cause I
don't care how big you think you are.

435
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,530
They're bigger.

436
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,560
Can't remember which way to go until I see
it, but I'm pretty sure we're almost there.

437
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,800
You've been saying that for 20
minutes while I've been circling.

438
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,190
I know. I'm so sorry.

439
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,640
- Stop the car.
- What?

440
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,400
- I know where Katie is.
- You do?

441
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,810
That's wonderful!

442
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,850
Let me out here.

443
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,610
Can I take you there after
we deal with this guy Nolan?

444
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,920
She says we're almost there.

445
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,610
I'm going alone.

446
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,400
We can't just leave you here.

447
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,400
Until we figure things
out, we should stick together.

448
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,680
Help each other.

449
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,220
I remember my life.

450
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,730
- You're sure?
- Yes.

451
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,190
All right then. It's why we left.

452
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,250
We decide for ourselves now.

453
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,210
Good luck.

454
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,580
You, too.

455
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,360
I hope it's easy for
you to go back home.

456
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,790
Whatever it is.

457
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,890
Well, let's get a tail on her.

458
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,260
November separated from the group.

459
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,650
Is that an active leaving
dr. Saunders' office?

460
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,560
Rewind it.

461
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,110
Oh, my god.

462
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,270
She was in the car.

463
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,970
Apparently she's got
one step ahead of us.

464
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,410
I should've seen this
coming. This is Caroline.

465
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,720
Minus the memories, but it's her and
this is exactly what Caroline would do.

466
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,260
Try and take us down by herself.

467
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,650
You want me to call it in? Round her up?

468
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,730
No, there's no harm in
letting this play out.

469
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,470
Caroline never was very realistic.

470
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,610
Apparently, this is
exactly what she was...

471
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,910
- Stop her?
- Immediately, please.

472
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,510
This is mr. Dominic. We have a rogue
active. Check the power room first.

473
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,620
Topher. Status.

474
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,410
Hard to see. Some confusion.

475
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,320
Are the actives afraid of the dark?

476
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,730
Who knows? They've never seen
it. We always leave the lights on.

477
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,900
Is this that power thing
from yesterday or...

478
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,820
- Echo.
- Really?

479
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,840
Did she cut the main line
or did she go for the...

480
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,950
Can you find her?

481
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,080
I'm looking out the window, but am
hindered by a lack of illumination.

482
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,790
Just be ready when they bring her in.

483
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
To do what?

484
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,600
No power, no chair. No wipey.

485
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,550
I am, btw.

486
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,050
Am what?

487
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,490
Afraid of the dark.

488
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,930
Hello?

489
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,920
Echo?

490
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,270
Not anymore.

491
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,560
We're experiencing a temporary
interruption of power.

492
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,080
We assure you there is no need to worry.

493
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,990
Everyone please gather
calmly on the main floor.

494
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,220
We should probably go
downstairs with everybody else...

495
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,520
Is that blood on your hands?

496
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,610
It's kinda dark. I was
hoping that it was...

497
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,310
Tell me what you do to people in here.

498
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,230
They come in one way and when
they leave, they're something else.

499
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,730
It's complicated. But...

500
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,500
I use a process of epifluorescent light.

501
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,560
Make it simple.

502
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,780
Simple, right.

503
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,110
I put them in a chair
and I program them.

504
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,210
You can't program people.
We're not freakin' computers.

505
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,130
Not that different.

506
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,330
Our-our brains are
natural motherboards.

507
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,510
Everything we think, feel, do:
electrical impulses fired by the brain.

508
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,710
I just hack the system.

509
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,060
What year is this?

510
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,010
2009.

511
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,010
How long have I been here?

512
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,650
A little while.

513
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,720
A day? A month?

514
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,210
Kind of more.

515
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,710
My head. Why I don't remember things.

516
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,270
You've done it to me. You
put me in this... chair.

517
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,550
Where?

518
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,980
Show. Don't tell.

519
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,440
Priya.

520
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,520
I'm surprised, uh, and confused.

521
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,630
Is this, uh, some kind of
frequent buyer reward or...

522
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,510
It's him.

523
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,830
Hey, what's going on?

524
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,980
A little blackmail, maybe? I
wouldn't put it past you people.

525
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,690
What you did to me
putting me in that hell.

526
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,170
What did I ever do to you?

527
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,180
You said no. And, uh,
nobody ever says no to me.

528
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,410
Because I wouldn't have
sex with you, you...

529
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,020
you took away my whole life?

530
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,130
Do you have any idea how
much trouble that was?

531
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:54,520
I mean, all the strings I pulled, and the palms
I greased, I could've bought pierre island.

532
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,700
But owning you is
better than real estate.

533
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,340
So, uh, you're not her handler.

534
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,520
We got out of that freak
show. She's never going back.

535
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,800
Ah, I get it. You kids hopped the fence.

536
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,720
It doesn't matter.
You don'exist anymore.

537
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,420
I'm more of a person than you.

538
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,210
Honey, you're programmed to give me
and-and anyone else whatever we want

539
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,120
whenever we want it.

540
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,410
Which...

541
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,810
you do with pleasure.

542
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,030
And sometimes, you even beg.

543
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,850
Okay.

544
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,250
I can afford one hell of
a security system, so...

545
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,430
I have one. All right, folks were on their way
to grab you up before you hit the elevator, so.

546
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,770
- Go.
- We got to go.

547
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,670
You will see me again.

548
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,670
Yes, and I look forward to it.

549
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,780
This way.

550
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,480
It'll be even better now.

551
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,400
You put this in and it makes us...

552
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,900
whatever you want?

553
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,590
Yes.

554
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:38,700
I mean, you have to have power
to do that, uh, electricity,

555
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,070
which we don't.So we can't.
You should put that down.

556
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,720
This is seriously screwed.

557
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,060
What the hell is wrong with you people?

558
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,830
We're good people. Nice people.

559
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,180
We help people become better people
by giving them what they need.

560
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,980
I don't usually do the sales pitch.

561
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,990
You murder people. You gut them and
use their bodies as playthings.

562
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,660
Who was I before you killed me?

563
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,630
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You are not dead, clearly.

564
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,840
You volunteered.

565
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,720
- You're lying.
- Okay.

566
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,220
You don't have your memories.

567
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,050
I didn't give them to you
so you don't remember that.

568
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,680
In there. Last time you put
me in there you made me what?

569
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:34,520
You as you were when you came
here only without memories,

570
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,350
which you will get back
when your contract is up

571
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,270
and you leave here and go
and do whatever you want.

572
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,240
Grow a belly, sew a quilt, spend
that truck of money you made having...

573
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,510
wow, just the time of your life.

574
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,610
Yeah, this is fun.

575
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,730
Isn't it?

576
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,800
Why am I not like them,
the rest down there--

577
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,750
what they're like when
you're not pimping them out?

578
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,770
We're running a test on you.

579
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,810
I remember a mountain.
Somewhere peaceful. Beautiful.

580
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,390
I feel happy there. I want to go there.

581
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,720
Is that real or is
that part of your test?

582
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,320
Real.

583
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,800
How come it's there if
you didn't give it to me?

584
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:25,720
It's coming from you.
It's what you need.

585
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,340
I have your memories.
You can have them back.

586
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,690
- You can do that?
- Totally.

587
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,310
But I have to go in there.

588
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,280
Well, yeah, but...

589
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

590
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,510
You first.

591
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,150
- Who are they?
- Maybe Nolan's guys.

592
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,660
- What do they want?
- Take us back, probably.

593
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,260
Or kill us.

594
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,490
That's the only way out.

595
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,900
This way.

596
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,350
Hey, it looks like it fits.

597
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,230
You can't imprint on top of a fully
functional brain; it'll implode.

598
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,320
Oh, is that why you keep us so simple?

599
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,000
Yes. Yes.

600
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,340
Does it hurt when you do it?

601
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,280
Pain is nothing more than
nerves talking to your brain.

602
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,030
Look, I'm just the science guy.

603
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,070
Up here looking down on
everyone, playing god.

604
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,040
I can help you with anything you want.

605
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,280
You just have to tell me.

606
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,660
I want you to let them go.

607
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,280
I don't have that kind of power.

608
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,810
What... No.

609
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,620
I'd pick the chair.
It's just a treatment.

610
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,120
God, no, no, no, no, no!
I can't. I swear I can't.

611
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,180
I can.

612
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,110
Stop the imprint, please.

613
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,630
My chair!

614
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,170
Did I just kill someone, or
should I aim this at her head?

615
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,920
She doesn't really understand.

616
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,360
You wanted to forget.

617
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,030
Who are you?

618
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,750
Adelle DeWitt.

619
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,530
I am responsible for this
facility and everyone in it.

620
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,220
Then, you are one sick bitch.

621
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,410
I eased your suffering.

622
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,030
Is that what you think
you're doing here?

623
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,570
I'm certain of it.

624
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,090
Taking away basic human rights...

625
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,740
free will...

626
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,570
my right to choose, feel, remember.

627
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:44,640
All relinquished by you
to our care and discretion.

628
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,370
Tell me why I would.

629
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,340
I can't.

630
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,090
I'd be breaking a promise I made to you.

631
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,890
All I can say is that...

632
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:59,820
you couldn't live with the consequences of
your own actions, and you no longer have to.

633
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,000
You're letting us all go.

634
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,320
You're free to leave.

635
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,020
Who are you to decide for the others?

636
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,440
Something you should
have been asking yourself.

637
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:14,230
I made the same promise to them to protect them
from the unbearable truths that brought them here.

638
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,970
I won't return those memories.

639
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,930
So, we agree. No one gets in the chair.

640
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,550
They'll be back.

641
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,470
Maybe.

642
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,660
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

643
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,970
If you didn't want to help me,
this wouldn't have happened.

644
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,060
Exactly.

645
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,340
When we were in that place, when
were like what Mike turned into,

646
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,940
but the rest of them
were empty I remember you.

647
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,140
What?

648
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,370
It's like I'm stuck inside my head somewhere,
and some part of me sees and feels...

649
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,590
it's like a bad dream
I can't get out of. I...

650
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,370
I can't talk. I can't move.

651
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,560
I can't be stronger than what's
taken me over, but I'm there.

652
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,800
It's so awful.

653
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:26,050
Somebody hurt you... like Nolan.

654
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,680
I could see it happening.

655
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:35,050
Oh, god, I could see his
face, but I couldn't stop it.

656
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,330
I trusted him.

657
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,860
Why did I trust him?

658
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,370
- I'm sorry.
- Wait... wait.

659
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,240
You wait for me when we go to bed
at night to make sure I'm okay.

660
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,380
What have they done to us?

661
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,170
I don't know which to hope for.

662
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,790
Feels like dying either way.

663
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,180
No.

664
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,040
We'll look for each
other like we always do.

665
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,820
We'll finish this. We will.

666
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,310
You can't take them outside as they are.

667
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,850
They'll find the stimulation, the
conflict entirely overwhelming.

668
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,930
They'll do just fine.

669
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,370
Your unbearable truth, lady...

670
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,840
you're not as important
as you think you are.

671
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,570
Next one goes where your
heart should have been.

672
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,090
Now show us out.

673
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,130
A tide is rising.

674
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:19,070
And until we learn how to turn it
back, we pile up the sandbags together.

675
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,470
Unless anyone here thinks
they've got a better idea.

676
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,850
We give them what they need.

677
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,600
Dr. Saunders.

678
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,640
Closure.

679
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,310
If actives have particularly poignant

680
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,590
or reoccurring experiences,

681
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,660
these can cause desires--
emotional needs--

682
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,840
or reactivate old ones that
existed before they came here.

683
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,400
Open loops.

684
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:59,800
If they were able to close those
loops, to get some sense of resolve...

685
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,600
You're recommending we allow them
to take a self-guided journey.

686
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,060
Just the priority cases.

687
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,410
Let the tide come in.

688
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:17,440
It's the only way to wash it back out.

689
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,300
Has the tide turned?

690
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,210
Are they better now?

691
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:29,680
Each active's brain was programmed to release
a sedative the moment they felt closure.

692
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,920
They're all back with us, so...

693
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,010
I have to assume they've resolved
the issues that caused them to glitch.

694
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,100
November needed to grieve for
her daughter. I understand that.

695
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:42,810
And Sierra...

696
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:46,440
she needed to confront the
man who took away her power.

697
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,630
One of them anyway.

698
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,440
As I recall, you
confronted the other one.

699
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,970
And Echo. She wanted to free us all.

700
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,380
What about Victor?

701
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:02,720
He wasn't going back to a
trauma or need from his past.

702
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,520
He had a more present need.

703
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,590
He needed to get the girl.

704
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,160
He's in love.

705
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:16,260
When Echo was leading them out,
I would like to have seen that.

706
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,090
Even if it was all a game. Your game.

707
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,600
Do you think I had fun?

708
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,190
I don't know you very well.

709
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,880
You have to look after Echo.

710
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,230
I have to look after all of them.

711
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,740
She wasn't leading them to freedom.

712
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,530
She was leading them to a world of terror
and chaos that would have destroyed them.

713
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,000
She's not leading them anywhere anymore.

714
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,030
You should be grateful.

715
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:47,030
Yeah. I'll work on that.

716
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,460
Paul Ballard, this is...

717
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,940
you don't know me, but I have a file.

718
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,090
And your name is in it, and I think we've met.

719
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,020
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Caroline.

720
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,420
But we're here, somewhere underground.

721
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,460
I'm trying to get everyone
out, but if I can't, please...

722
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,630
please find us.
