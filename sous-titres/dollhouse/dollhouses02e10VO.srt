1
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:05,519
Welcome to the Attic.

2
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:07,444
We're so glad to have you.

3
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,555
She's expired already?
She just arrived.

4
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
Strange.

5
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:28,070
She seemed fit enough to be a lifer.

6
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:37,104
So young and so fit.

7
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,039
It's a shame really.

8
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,958
Victor and Sierra...
where are they?

9
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:07,922
We don't use Active-codes here.

10
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,697
We use your real names.

11
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:13,535
My real name is Echo.

12
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:44,997
It's okay. I'm right here.

13
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,708
Look at me.
I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?

14
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,741
We got to move now.

15
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:01,949
There.

16
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:49,687
No! Behind you!

17
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:00,884
Welcome to the Attic.

18
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,809
We're so glad to have you.

19
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,798
Episode 210: <i>The Attic</i>

20
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:07,758
www.subbercafe.fr

21
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,156
His EEG electroactivity
readings are so slight,

22
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,206
it's probably just static
in the bedsheets.

23
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:15,090
I see.

24
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:17,950
I've tried homotopic
and heterotopic stimulation.

25
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,215
Haven't we all?

26
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:22,721
You don't view this
as a thrilling new project?

27
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:25,847
- You should be bouncing off the walls.
- I'm running out of options.

28
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:28,613
Paul has extensive
cortical scarring.

29
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,062
That part of his brain is done.
Irreparable.

30
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,689
If I'm gonna try anything else,

31
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:36,108
I need to install
the Active architecture.

32
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,569
And even then, there's
no guarantee it'll take.

33
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,796
I haven't spent all this time nurturing
an asset just to throw it away.

34
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:44,283
Get him stable enough
to handle the architecture,

35
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:48,742
- from there, I'll consider what's next.
- Alpha mapped his entire brain.

36
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,291
- I'll try and piece it back together.
- Maybe not.

37
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,336
I plan on making some changes
around this House today.

38
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:59,118
Perhaps his petulant personality
is a good place to start.

39
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:02,961
And we are in the market
for a strapping new Victor, are we not?

40
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,015
Is everybody in this House
in a coma?

41
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:15,869
Sorry.

42
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,633
No, by all means.
You want a blankie?

43
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,110
I was waiting for you.
Guess I dozed off.

44
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,241
Haven't been getting much sleep lately.
Some stuff going on at home.

45
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:28,742
I thought you were here 24-7.

46
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,538
I was when I had reason to be.

47
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,630
What do we know about the Attic?

48
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:40,046
No one comes back, Boyd.

49
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,658
But why?
What do they do to them in there?

50
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,720
I don't know.
Experimenting, torture...

51
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,974
I think they're testing
the limits of the human mind.

52
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,100
The brain is kept in a fear-induced,

53
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,475
adrenaline-fueled, overdrive state.

54
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,772
Like a problem you can't solve.

55
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:00,011
Either the nightmare
lasts forever, or...

56
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,028
Or it doesn't last at all.

57
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:19,722
Wait.

58
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,111
Don't be afraid.

59
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:22,796
That's new.

60
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:30,063
The premotor cortex is,
like, 15% functional.

61
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:34,059
The posterior parietal cortex
doesn't look as bad.

62
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:36,185
Yeah, but the SMA's
just scar tissue.

63
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,464
And the M1's totally fried.

64
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,129
Even with Active architecture,

65
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,967
Paul won't be able
to execute basic commands.

66
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:46,684
It's like his brain
is football team,

67
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:49,510
and I've got this whole new
set of brilliant plays,

68
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,810
but it doesn't matter,
because the quarterback's in jail

69
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:53,153
for dog fighting.

70
00:07:53,278 --> 00:07:57,028
Yeah, and it's not like his brain
can run the wildcat formation.

71
00:07:58,502 --> 00:08:00,436
That joke went under my head.

72
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,164
Wildcat formation?

73
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,338
The running back takes
a direct snap from the center?

74
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,798
The quarterback doesn't
even touch the ball?

75
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,312
It's a sports analogy.
You started it.

76
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,782
Wait. Don't shut up for a second.

77
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,585
You might be on to something.

78
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,981
Wildcat formation.

79
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,007
Topher's world.

80
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:27,697
I got it.

81
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,636
Adelle wants to see you.

82
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,055
Did she say why?

83
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:36,773
Does she ever?

84
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,062
Darth Vader kills lieutenants,
not Storm Troopers.

85
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,889
I'll be right back.

86
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:47,014
Cool.

87
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:14,553
I love you, pretty horsie.

88
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:21,299
I think we can all safely say
that this isn't real.

89
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,693
Dr. Saunders?

90
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,215
That's not a smart idea.

91
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,967
Boyd, where am I?
What am I doing here?

92
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,637
You stir things up,
you might bring the storm on yourself.

93
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,842
There are not a lot
of good people here.

94
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,117
There aren't?

95
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:03,769
What about my friends?
Where are my friends?

96
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,159
You have no friends.

97
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:14,993
Now be quiet.

98
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,992
Or I'll find something
to stuff that mouth up.

99
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,625
How are you feeling?

100
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:29,253
Not exactly good as new.

101
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,261
The headaches are getting worse.

102
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:36,428
Everything's going to be all right.

103
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,153
Now that you're here.

104
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,072
Thank God.

105
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,591
And how are you doing?
After Alpha.

106
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:48,823
I'm a ghost.

107
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,232
You can't fight a ghost.

108
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:55,922
This isn't right.

109
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,755
This isn't real.

110
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,607
What happened?

111
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:02,757
Come on, Echo,
be your frickin' best.

112
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:06,663
What happened to you?
Happened to you?

113
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,110
There is only one place where a Doll
is irreparably damaged as you.

114
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,235
The Attic.

115
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,282
You're not real.

116
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:26,733
That's real!

117
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,435
That's very real.

118
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:42,534
There you are!

119
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,664
So it's you!

120
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:58,581
You just can't...

121
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,844
stop... trying to kill me!

122
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,473
I'm not trying to kill you!
It is!

123
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,016
- What it?
- Down!

124
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,004
Of course, you'd be in my nightmare.
You were Rossum's rising star.

125
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,378
No, I was a defect,

126
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,758
and I'm pretty sure
you're in my defective head.

127
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,843
No, I'm in the Attic
trapped inside my own mind.

128
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,130
This is my mind!

129
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,180
Are we really arguing about this?

130
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,029
I've accepted it.

131
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,541
I chase Arcane,
I try to stop him from killing.

132
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:54,178
The reality changes,
but the enemy stays the same.

133
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:57,302
I'll never rest
and I'll never catch him.

134
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,273
That's pretty cool,

135
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:01,613
and I don't want to ruin
your whole Highlander vibe,

136
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:05,061
but I'm pretty positive
that this is my mind.

137
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,963
I think you just saved
my life, for real.

138
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,438
What do you mean?

139
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:12,564
That's the tree
from one of my childhood homes,

140
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:16,169
and those are my hateful
relatives playing croquet.

141
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,390
And that...

142
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:21,508
That's a long story.

143
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,467
How is this possible?

144
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:25,144
I think you are real.

145
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:27,013
I can feel it.

146
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,720
I'm not making you up
or remembering you.

147
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,268
The minds in the Attic
must be connected somehow.

148
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,146
Adelle finally put you in the Attic.

149
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,055
I could feel it
with that monster, too.

150
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,580
"Arcane."
It's what he calls himself.

151
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,934
I was trapped inside the NSA.

152
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:44,364
It felt like years.*

153
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,624
He came there to murder me.

154
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:49,661
I fought back, and I chased him out,
and I've been chasing him ever since.

155
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,164
So you travel from mind to mind?

156
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,457
I guess so, yeah.

157
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,835
I need to know how.
I need to find my friends.

158
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:58,832
He'll probably go after them.

159
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:01,415
He targets newcomers. He might
even lead us right into their heads.

160
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,732
How do you track him?

161
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:04,384
How does he get in and out?

162
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:05,760
He can sense fear.

163
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:08,571
He finds something
that you're deeply afraid of.

164
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:12,642
This would be the much badder kind.

165
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,540
Multiple minds thinking as one.

166
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:17,016
You're absorbed.
The individual ceases to exit.

167
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:19,811
This would be a much badder kind.
You're absorbed.

168
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:22,510
Multiple minds thinking as one.
You're absorbed.

169
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:24,029
My worst nightmare.

170
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:26,016
That would be the point.

171
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,511
Hold on. We don't even know
where he's going.

172
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,076
We have to travel together.

173
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,663
A stranger's mind's a big place.
It's easy to get...

174
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:35,626
lost.

175
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,045
Thank you.

176
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,885
Good afternoon.

177
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,844
How are you?

178
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:03,104
Lost?

179
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:09,074
Hey, Wildcat.

180
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:12,535
I've been thinking
about your theory,

181
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:14,291
and it might work.

182
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,790
Why not bypass the motor cortex?

183
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,226
We can reprogram another part
of the brain to serve its function.

184
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:21,751
Reprogram it to think

185
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:24,720
it is the primary motor cortex
and always has been.

186
00:15:24,845 --> 00:15:27,604
Obviously, we can't use
his <i>medulla oblongata</i>,

187
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:30,219
but there are plenty of parts
that'll work perfectly.

188
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,764
We just have to decide
what to sacrifice.

189
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,068
Sarcasm; already doesn't have that.

190
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,693
Memories of high school.

191
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,154
Fear of dancing.

192
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:44,611
What's up?

193
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:48,154
How was your "Come to Jesus"
with DeWitt?

194
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,975
What did she say?

195
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,545
Don't speak to me.

196
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:02,728
What did you say to Ivy?

197
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:06,311
I prepared her for the possibility
of taking over your position here.

198
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:07,812
What?

199
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:10,214
My position?

200
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:13,171
What are you gonna do with me?

201
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,633
I've done nothing wrong,

202
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:18,507
apart from the things
that got you your job back.

203
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:22,973
You gave us extraordinary technology
which will be used soon.

204
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:26,633
The question is whether you have
anything more to offer...

205
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:29,740
whether you can accept
radical change

206
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,198
or if you'll buckle under pressure.

207
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:34,126
I don't buckle.

208
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,917
Occasionally I swashbuckle.

209
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,498
Yes, you're quite a pirate hero,

210
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:43,293
swinging in
and dismembering Nolan Kennard.

211
00:16:46,947 --> 00:16:49,590
If you try to keep secrets
from the Corporation,

212
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:51,664
you may have every expectation

213
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,094
of being chopped into pieces
yourself.

214
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,791
How do you imagine that would feel?

215
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:10,935
Do you know a way out of here?

216
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:13,365
Oh, I can't leave.
I must stay

217
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,546
and try to enjoy myself.

218
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:18,227
Thank you.

219
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,248
Wouldn't want to end up
in the Attic.

220
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:23,979
But this is the Attic.

221
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,628
Rossum's been watching me closely
since I moved here to Tokyo

222
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,133
Ningyo Kaoku.

223
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,365
Have you seen my friends?

224
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:34,260
I thought I saw them,
but I was imagining it.

225
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,221
But I do think
they're really in here.

226
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:39,539
Well, I wouldn't worry.

227
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:41,601
I'm sure
they're enjoying themselves.

228
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,267
I love you.

229
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:57,234
I've always loved you.

230
00:17:58,891 --> 00:17:59,824
I know.

231
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,065
We're cornered!

232
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,476
Contact front!

233
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,787
Move and cover!

234
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,790
They got us pinned down
pretty good, Sarge. Any ideas?

235
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,101
I think it's a small company trying
to act big with this barrage.

236
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,172
There's no air support.
We should just hold up.

237
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,091
We got to take away the high ground.
Lay down suppressive fire!

238
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,225
Give me a window
to flank from the left!

239
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,814
Myers, you're with me.

240
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:36,383
What did you mean when you said
Rossum was keeping an eye on you?

241
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,735
In my recent transfer to Tokyo,

242
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:40,428
I was asked to report

243
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,430
any areas of weakness.

244
00:19:43,331 --> 00:19:45,767
I found that Rossum's mainframe

245
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:49,312
was both fallible and vulnerable.

246
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,271
Vulnerable how?

247
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,613
Well, that's why I'm here, isn't it?

248
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:57,362
Having that information
made me a point of weakness.

249
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,698
Rossum put me in here

250
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,588
to eliminate that point of weakness.

251
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:06,203
But it's better
than being in the Attic.

252
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,039
Not really.

253
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:14,212
- We have to run.
- I can't leave.

254
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,880
- I have to stay.
- Please...

255
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,675
- And try to enjoy myself.
- We have to go now!

256
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,302
But I can't leave till I'm done.

257
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:44,994
Stop doing that!

258
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,744
Sorry. It took me forever
to find you.

259
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,622
- Arcane is here.
- I know.

260
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,992
Listen, not only are the people
in the Attic connected,

261
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:54,973
but all the Attics
in different Dollhouses

262
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:56,879
all over the world are connected.

263
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,836
This dude's hooked up in Japan.

264
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,341
You think?

265
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,511
Now the meat won't be fresh.

266
00:21:18,182 --> 00:21:20,224
What happens
when Arcane kills someone?

267
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,904
The world disappears.

268
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:25,434
He's dead.

269
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,023
His brain's shutting down.

270
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:30,236
Then we're trapped in it.

271
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:35,667
You've been dragging your heels
a bit lately, Mr. Langton.

272
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,411
Tardy even. Spending more
and more time out of the office.

273
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:41,347
I've been taking care
of personal stuff.

274
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:43,446
And this stuff,

275
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,723
is it top secret?

276
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:48,095
It's personal.

277
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:52,348
- Are you still upset over Echo?
- We all are.

278
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:53,656
Yes, but you...

279
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,189
you've always been
like a father to her.

280
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,107
And you took her away from me!

281
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:02,356
Shelved her.

282
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:04,989
My only goal
was to protect that girl.

283
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:09,722
You knew where she was heading.

284
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,211
You encouraged her.

285
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,130
You put her in that Attic
as much as anyone else.

286
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:17,410
Is that what you tell yourself?

287
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:21,089
You didn't come because of Echo.
You had nowhere else to go.

288
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:26,490
You work for Rossum, and that means
your options tend to slim, to three:

289
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,971
carry out Rossum's work
without question,

290
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:31,154
the Attic...

291
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,433
or death.

292
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:37,223
The moment you stepped
into this House,

293
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:39,481
you, in effect, gave us your life.

294
00:22:41,347 --> 00:22:44,653
And you must decide
if that life is be put to good use

295
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,407
or laid to waste.
I have seen the future, Mr. Langton.

296
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,161
And it is not for the weak.

297
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:56,393
- I've been through this before.
- Then what...

298
00:22:56,518 --> 00:22:58,875
We got do the thing he fears most
to get out of his mind,

299
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,290
The thing he dreads.

300
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,972
"Enjoy myself."

301
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:06,801
Good times.

302
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:10,325
Lay down suppressive fire!

303
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,016
Give me a window to flank from the left!
Myers, you're with me.

304
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,861
- What are you doing?
- It's not safe.

305
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,735
Reinforcements are pinned down
in Herat.

306
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,250
There's no air support.

307
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,775
All right. Tony.

308
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,869
Don't be afraid. Take a breath.
You're in the Attic.

309
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:17,872
In the Attic, man.
None of this is real. Okay, fine.

310
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:19,665
Wait a minute.

311
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:21,305
I know you.

312
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:24,230
You need to stop being afraid.

313
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:25,671
This is all in your mind.

314
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,221
That explains a lot.

315
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,834
How long have we been in here?

316
00:24:39,235 --> 00:24:41,335
Feels like years, but who knows?

317
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,855
And you?

318
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,023
Longer.

319
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,131
- So this murderer...
- He's called Arcane.

320
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:49,946
Chasing's not gonna do it.

321
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,115
We got to take away the high ground.

322
00:24:52,745 --> 00:24:54,117
Go on the offensive?

323
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:56,470
We can't anticipate
where he's going.

324
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,759
We trap him.
Lure him in, pin him down,

325
00:24:59,505 --> 00:25:00,790
kill him then and there.

326
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:03,835
And we've got to hurry,
before he gets to Priya.

327
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:06,879
Priya's in here, too?

328
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,075
You know, this is a scenario
I never tried.

329
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,675
Rigor mortis.

330
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:31,055
The new Viagra.

331
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:33,990
It's all in my mind.

332
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,658
It's all in my mind.

333
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,882
There's no reason to be afraid.

334
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:53,445
You sure about that?

335
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:12,069
Oh, my God!

336
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,655
What have you done?

337
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Arcane?

338
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:20,805
Well, Clyde actually.

339
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:26,575
So this is your mind, Clyde?

340
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,558
This is your worst nightmare?

341
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:33,845
This isn't a nightmare.

342
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,677
This is the shape of things to come.

343
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:58,755
Does that take away the fear?

344
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:01,205
And the pain, too.

345
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,445
Sometimes.

346
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:05,873
That's what we're gonna do
to Paul, you know.

347
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,541
Take something away.

348
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:09,995
I heard.

349
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:12,838
That's gonna make him
more pissed off than he usually is.

350
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,006
Not if we take away his anger.

351
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,975
Anger will be all he has.

352
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,699
That woman is gonna drag us
straight to hell.

353
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,991
You shouldn't have brought me here!
It's too dangerous!

354
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:42,516
That was the idea.

355
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:44,735
Who are you?

356
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:47,275
How did you do that?

357
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:50,793
- You people are aware?
- Why do you call yourself Arcane?

358
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,135
Sounded bad-ass.

359
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:55,150
- All right.
- No, no. Please.

360
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:57,883
If I die, there'll be nobody left
to take down Rossum.

361
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,730
That's my line.

362
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:02,722
- You were trying to kill us!
- It was a necessary evil.

363
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,516
I was trying to take out
Rossum's mainframe computer.

364
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:08,980
Wait. We heard something about that.
The mainframe is vulnerable.

365
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,645
How do we take it out?
Is it accessible from inside the Attic?

366
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,116
Tell us how to destroy it.

367
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,600
You don't understand.
That's the problem.

368
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:18,125
You, me, everybody in the Attic,

369
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:20,325
we are the mainframe.

370
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:26,955
What do you mean
"We are the mainframe"?

371
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
We all have

372
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:31,334
repeating worst-case scenarios, right?
Problems we're trying to solve.

373
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,158
That's because the people in the Attic,
our brains,

374
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:37,960
are being used as processors,
human computers.

375
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,925
How is that even possible?

376
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,387
It's more practical really.

377
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,375
The human brain is 20 times
more powerful

378
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,556
than the most massive
multiprocessing computer in the world.

379
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:49,435
- Rossum has hundreds of them.
- Hundreds?

380
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,645
Many Attics,
all networked to a central hub.

381
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,236
Our brains continually soaked
with adrenaline from the fear,

382
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,560
running on maximum.

383
00:28:57,685 --> 00:28:59,935
The processing power behind Rossum.

384
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:02,290
And you were killing people.

385
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:05,660
I'm trying to put them out of misery,
freeing them from an eternal hell.

386
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:09,875
But mostly, I was trying to take out
Rossum's number of CPUs.

387
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,265
To prevent this.

388
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,077
How do you know this is true?

389
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:18,547
Because...

390
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:21,865
it was my idea.

391
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:30,351
We need to hole up,
find someplace safe!

392
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:32,905
It's your head, genius.

393
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:42,615
Let's go!

394
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:12,205
In my scenario,

395
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:15,135
I was constantly fighting myself,
at war.

396
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,615
Just trying to get home to my girl.

397
00:30:21,205 --> 00:30:23,237
In mine,
I was constantly making love to you.

398
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,825
And then you'd turn into
the rotting corpse of a rapist I killed.

399
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:32,405
Talk to us, Clyde.

400
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:34,965
Talk!

401
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:39,795
I'm one of the original founders
of Rossum.

402
00:30:40,515 --> 00:30:43,865
One of two, actually.
Me and my best mate at university.

403
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:45,926
I had discovered ECC...

404
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:46,934
ECC?

405
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:50,181
Encephalic Communication and Coding.

406
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:54,208
He was the one that had a plan for it.
I hadn't even begun to imagine

407
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,053
all the possible applications
for the technology.

408
00:30:57,485 --> 00:30:59,180
We thought we were making history.

409
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:00,441
We weren't wrong.

410
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,100
How did you end up here?

411
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,705
It was the very beginning.

412
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:08,307
Our first test subject
was to be imprinted

413
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,493
with my own personality.

414
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,950
We both agreed that it would be
too dangerous to imprint a persona

415
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:17,248
with my knowledge and ambition.

416
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:20,873
So we slightly modified Clyde 2.0,

417
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:22,171
we called him,

418
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:26,239
modified his persona
to have no aspirations

419
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:28,719
so that he would just follow orders.

420
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:30,653
And your friend betrayed you.

421
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:33,935
Another possibility
I hadn't imagined.

422
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,025
He was the only one I trusted.

423
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:43,285
He gave Clyde 2.0

424
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:46,065
the order to betray me.

425
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:51,015
That's how the Attic was founded.

426
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:53,994
They cleared my head out,

427
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:55,375
hooked me up,

428
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:58,145
I became a human computer.

429
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:00,584
First one in history, I suppose.

430
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,795
- And you've been here ever since?
- Yes.

431
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,505
That was 1993.

432
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:11,255
My nightmare, my loop,

433
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:14,473
has been to run
statistical probability scenarios

434
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,941
for where the technology might lead.

435
00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:20,465
All but three percent of them

436
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:22,825
include the end of civilization.

437
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,910
- What year is it?
- 2010, I think.

438
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:37,633
We don't know how long
we've been off the air.

439
00:32:38,195 --> 00:32:39,195
2010?

440
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:41,725
That's all?

441
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:43,835
Then there's still time.

442
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:46,463
We might still be able to stop them!

443
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:48,155
That's our mission.

444
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:52,011
The first thing they'll do is install
an imprinted person in the government.

445
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:54,054
- Yeah. They did that.
- They did?

446
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:57,068
Then they're way ahead
of my schedules.

447
00:32:57,193 --> 00:32:59,935
Your friend who betrayed you.
Who is this man?

448
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,972
I don't even know if it is a man.

449
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:04,721
That's the first thing they erase.

450
00:33:04,846 --> 00:33:08,029
I can't remember faces or names,

451
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,383
not to mention the fact
that Clyde 2.0's

452
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:12,561
probably switched bodies by now.

453
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:15,707
If we could eliminate
that backstabber,

454
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:19,381
and the copy of me
that does his or her bidding,

455
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,692
then we might be able to stop them.

456
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:25,646
But there's no way out
of here, is there?

457
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:29,182
No. There isn't. Believe me.

458
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,507
I've tried.

459
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,468
Even if we could find a way out,

460
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,054
we'd just be putting a blank face
to a name we don't even have.

461
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:38,849
There has been talk amongst
some of the security personnel

462
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,292
that they place here.

463
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,467
They mistakenly let a woman in.

464
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,916
She saw them.
She could identify them.

465
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,777
But apparently, they got to her, too.
They scrubbed her clean.

466
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,910
So, we still have no way of telling?

467
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,324
Yes! Caroline! That was it.

468
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,957
Wait, Echo.
Why does that sound familiar?

469
00:33:58,574 --> 00:33:59,574
It's me.

470
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:02,249
I was Caroline before I became Echo.

471
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:05,067
- Do you have any memories of...?
- Not hers.

472
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:07,038
Not in here.

473
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:15,487
We've got to find
a way out of the Attic.

474
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:16,930
There is no way out.

475
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,606
What if someone unplugs us?

476
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:21,017
Our minds are engaged, integrated.

477
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:24,410
Disconnection will fry the circuits,
turn our brains to mush.

478
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:25,535
I'm sorry.

479
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:28,565
Echo, get down!

480
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:30,943
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

481
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,990
I know a way out.

482
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:47,576
He's not going to take this well.

483
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,201
What's happening?
It didn't work?

484
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,121
- His brain is reorganized.
- It will take a minute to adjust.

485
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,796
What the hell did you do to me?!

486
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,671
You were in a coma, Paul.

487
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,807
Alpha damaged your brain.

488
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:46,064
We did it to save your life.

489
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,139
Did what?

490
00:35:57,085 --> 00:35:58,535
You made me a Doll?

491
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,617
Active architecture
was the only way to save you.

492
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,869
Then why do I feel like myself?

493
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,816
You are, but it's an imprint.

494
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,191
I'm sorry.

495
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:11,560
It was an order.

496
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:13,170
And we need you, Paul.

497
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,438
We don't have many friends left.

498
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:17,316
What do you mean?

499
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:22,402
They're in the Attic.

500
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:28,349
Wait.

501
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,049
This should be interesting.

502
00:36:33,348 --> 00:36:36,902
At some point, he's going to figure out
what we took away from him.

503
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:39,946
I know.

504
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:47,830
I'm not afraid to lose my life
taking you down.

505
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:49,816
I don't want to die.

506
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:54,024
Then only one of us
is going to b disappointed.

507
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:58,429
Any last words?

508
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:02,799
Listen.

509
00:37:03,277 --> 00:37:07,558
My worst-case scenario, my loop,
was getting out of the Attic.

510
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,602
The place
where our bodies are hooked up.

511
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,282
I think I can unplug.

512
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:15,921
Won't her brain turn to mush?

513
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,362
When a person flatlines,
the computer disengages.

514
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:23,198
That's right. It would.
To avoid any corrupted data.

515
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,175
If I can flatline
and manage to wake up,

516
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,282
then I can get out of here
and send help.

517
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:34,960
Your plan is to come back
from the dead?

518
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:39,009
Then you'll be there to revive us
when we flatline.

519
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:40,424
Wait a minute.

520
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,576
I can't risk you two;
I'm not normal,

521
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:47,702
so I think I can do this.
I've been through worse.

522
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,100
- And we haven't?
- Priya, please.

523
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:53,228
The only way this scenario worked
was if I didn't have to fight for you.

524
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:56,315
Then we'll fight for ourselves.

525
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:59,586
You don't have to look after us anymore.
You've been inside our minds.

526
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:03,111
You know we're just as abnormal
and just as ready as you.

527
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,051
We're a team now.

528
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:07,657
We go together.

529
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:11,930
We go together.

530
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:16,126
Are you in?

531
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,253
I'm staying.

532
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:22,799
I want out, but there are hundreds
of people being tortured here.

533
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,970
Rossum's feeding off it.
I got to help them.

534
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:27,292
Clyde?

535
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:30,724
My body's halfway
across the country, anyway.

536
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,310
We'll teach them to be aware.

537
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,771
- Face their fear.
- Might even be fun.

538
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,481
That would be nice.

539
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,273
If you succeed,
and you can get a signal to me,

540
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:42,398
we'll shut down the mainframe.

541
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:48,971
I guess I'm glad
I never did kill you.

542
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:52,047
Don't get sloppy.

543
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,360
Here goes everything.

544
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,210
We got it.

545
00:41:10,543 --> 00:41:12,843
The information we were looking for,

546
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:14,415
maybe more.

547
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:18,354
I understand the mainframe.

548
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:21,712
And I know how to get
at the heart of Rossum,

549
00:41:21,837 --> 00:41:23,542
or at least someone who will.

550
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:25,682
Your plan worked.

551
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:28,203
Thank you.

552
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:33,115
There is only one place
for a doll as irreparably damaged you.

553
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:35,325
The Attic.

554
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:39,513
They say it's whatever hell
you imagine.

555
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:43,208
But I think
it's something far worse.

556
00:41:43,836 --> 00:41:47,420
I think the Attic is where Rossum
is keeping some of its darkest secrets.

557
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:52,300
They are rabid in their protection
of whatever's hidden there.

558
00:41:53,522 --> 00:41:56,012
- And you want me to go in?
- I need you to go in.

559
00:41:56,322 --> 00:41:58,056
But far more importantly, I need you

560
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,532
to come back...

561
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,729
and bring the secrets with you.

562
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,940
It's the only way
we'll ever gain an edge.

563
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:09,775
"We"?

564
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:11,914
We can bring them down.

565
00:42:12,787 --> 00:42:15,237
Nobody's ever gotten out
of the Attic.

566
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:18,078
Nobody else is you.

567
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:21,524
And everyone else?

568
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,935
I think I've impressed upon them
the dangers we'll be facing.

569
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:37,137
We're ready.

570
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,940
We're one soldier shy.

571
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:50,433
It's time for me to meet Caroline.

572
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:53,979
It's time to win her war.
