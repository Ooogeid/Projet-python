1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,462
We need to get out of the city.
No tech, no printing.

2
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:05,921
<i>Look, we decided.</i>

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,383
<i>We go underground, deep as we can.</i>

4
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:11,598
- Who are you?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,972
- She's a Dumbshow.
- This is the way to Safe Haven.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,141
The chair? The memories will tell us
how to do?

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,770
Home, sweet home.

8
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,564
I need Topher
to put me in the chair.

9
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,273
Back me up on a drive, hard copy.

10
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,152
- You're copying yourself?
- In case something happens to me,

11
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,919
<i>I know exactly where</i> <i>we're going. </i>

12
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:32,624
Caroline?

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,660
The Butchers are coming.

14
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:51,438
I hope we find me alive.

15
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,626
Dollhouse 213: <i>Epitath Two: Return</i>

16
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:55,638
www.subbercafe.fr

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,373
Butchers!

18
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,249
Butchers!

19
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,674
Come on! Move, move!

20
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,018
Go!

21
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,934
Go! Come on!

22
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,613
How are there Butchers
all the way up here?

23
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:57,658
- We're nowhere near a city.
- Locals, got hit with a blanket signal?

24
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,942
They were wearing suits.

25
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,259
This was your finer class
of mindless kill-zombie.

26
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,587
Maybe they were
on a corporate retreat. Who cares?

27
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:12,168
We still need water,
and we're low on gas.

28
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:14,167
If we don't get
on Safe Haven soon...

29
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:16,262
Caroline, we've been
dodging the mobs for weeks.

30
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,846
- Are you sure we're on the right track?
- I think so.

31
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,974
I don't know. Last time I was up here,
it wasn't this bad.

32
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,535
I could see over the dash.

33
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:29,552
Whose body was this?

34
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:31,497
We don't know.

35
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:33,569
She was printed before we met her.

36
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:35,946
We stuck your brain in her
because you're supposed to be

37
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,700
the great and terrible Caroline,
the one who knows how save us.

38
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:42,620
The tech works.

39
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:46,051
In my camp...
in Safe Haven...

40
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:48,584
no one's been imprinted
since we set up.

41
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,504
We still have a chance
to make a true world.

42
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,391
A true world?

43
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:57,300
Look around,
tiny messiah... it's over.

44
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,844
Half the world's been wiped,
the rest have turned

45
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,014
into crazies trying to kill
the other half.

46
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,100
There's only a handful
of Actuals left,

47
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,861
which you, by the way, ain't.

48
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:10,594
We are lost.

49
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:12,386
We are not gone.

50
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,928
Is it going to be weird
for you to meet yourself?

51
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:43,482
Face to your real face?

52
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,802
It'll be sweet.

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,692
You were one of those magically
delicious super whores.

54
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:50,229
I bet you look great.

55
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:52,982
If I have to kick your ass again...

56
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,653
Let me see your ugly mug...

57
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,756
All right, that's enough.
Let's not bruise the merchandise.

58
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,625
Bring out the others.

59
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:32,897
- Where are we?
- Neuropolis.

60
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,921
The City of Minds.

61
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,235
- Neuropolis exists?
- Wait, what?

62
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:40,946
It used to be Tucson.
Rossum was run from here.

63
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,705
And you just didn't think
to mention that Safe Haven

64
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,951
was parked right next door
to the frickin' Death Star?

65
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:50,204
It had to be.
This is where we got the vaccine.

66
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,874
We were raiding it for tech
whenever we could.

67
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,594
You were here before.

68
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,842
So, what are they going
to do with us?

69
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:16,159
- Mr. Harding.
- What is it now? I'm eating.

70
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:18,486
Of course you are, sir.

71
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,028
Watch it.

72
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,111
You said you wanted a new suit.

73
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,623
We have a few
for you to choose from.

74
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,758
It's about time.

75
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:30,119
Can't believe I let this one
get so stretched out.

76
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:35,084
You'd be just as fat, Ambrose,
if we hadn't of run out of shellfish.

77
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:39,046
True, but we're having a hard time
finding acceptable replacement bodies

78
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:40,631
in the chaos out there.

79
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,011
Got to start taking better care
of ourselves.

80
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:47,995
You're right.

81
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,249
This time, I will.

82
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:52,601
Gonna start on the elliptical.

83
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:57,791
Where did this body come from?

84
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,651
He's a Dumbshow.
Poachers caught him in the wild.

85
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,944
Was he with anyone?

86
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,319
Just some girl.

87
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:04,683
Idiot!

88
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:07,788
What's the matter with him?

89
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,314
Couple Dumbshows never hurt anybody.

90
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:20,952
This is worse than Butchers.
By at least a lot.

91
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,385
- It'll be okay.
- Wait, you got a plan, wunderkind?

92
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,688
I guess I do.

93
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:47,614
Echo.

94
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,797
Still living the dream, Harding?

95
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,794
It is a little bit tarnished.

96
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:55,426
You ever think if you
didn't cut off Rossum at the head,

97
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,208
the tech might never
have gotten out of control?

98
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,298
You're a model of control,
butterball.

99
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,658
At least I'm having some fun.

100
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,245
Please.

101
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,225
You know I'm backed up.

102
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,559
Why do you bother anymore?

103
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:11,930
Ask me again sometime.

104
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,392
Does anyone need medical?

105
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,420
- Paul.
- Over here.

106
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:29,847
You do your doctor thing.
I'll find him.

107
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:36,872
She's lost a lot of blood.
She's in hypovolemic shock.

108
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:40,124
The brachial artery... it's healed up,
but we need to find oxygen.

109
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,711
Or an IV...
Supplement the remaining blood supply.

110
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:46,873
Here.
Let give you hand.

111
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:51,511
- Where'd you learn that trick?
- Same place you did.

112
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,457
I mean, yes.

113
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:07,375
I've been working.

114
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,696
I've been working.
Hard at working.

115
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:12,805
Please don't use a bullet.
Don't want to waste.

116
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,930
It's Paul.

117
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,895
I'm here with Echo.

118
00:08:16,865 --> 00:08:18,997
One bullet a day.
Don't want to waste.

119
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,000
One person down a day
until I solve the problem.

120
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,630
They shoot someone
if you don't invent what they want?

121
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,341
What they need.
Every day, a chain reaction.

122
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,511
Erase the world all at once.

123
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,205
How is he?

124
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:40,795
He's pretty far gone.

125
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,521
The prisoners?

126
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:44,785
One of them is me.

127
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:49,667
I think Harding was making him build
something to wipe the whole planet.

128
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:50,996
To solve the problem.

129
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:54,581
But people die if I do or I don't.
A new problem, chain reaction.

130
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,535
It's me.

131
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:00,456
- We're getting you outta here.
- So close.

132
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,791
I'm so close,
so close to solving both problems.

133
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,086
- They would have no idea.
- Close to what? Wiping everyone?

134
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,423
The opposite.

135
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,592
A reflection, like an echo.

136
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:16,051
Put things back the way they were,
minds back the way they were.

137
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,036
I can bring back the world.

138
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,368
Come and look at this.

139
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,715
Told you it'd be worth the wait.

140
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Awesome.

141
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,787
Do you want to go show your mum?

142
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,645
Gently.

143
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:01,715
Hey, Mom!

144
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,835
Hey, Mom.

145
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,606
Look, the strawberries are ripe.

146
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,149
Those look amazing.

147
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:10,655
Try one.

148
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:14,415
Go ahead.
You can trust your mom.

149
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,576
Let's save the rest
for dessert, huh?

150
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,744
Come here.

151
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:25,520
- Are these from the East house?
- Hill house.

152
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:28,800
They need help finishing the well
in the next few days.

153
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:31,029
Clearly,
if this is all they're producing.

154
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:36,385
Topher collapsed about a half mile back.
He's malnourished.

155
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:37,678
Needs water. Go.

156
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:47,485
We got him.

157
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:52,029
They were trying to get Topher
to build a pulse bomb,

158
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:55,660
send out some kind of chain-reacting
blanket signal, wipe everyone.

159
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,500
Everyone in the world?
Who's left?

160
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,090
- We came out of L.A.
- I'm amazed you survived.

161
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:01,965
Well, hold your applause.

162
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:04,140
There were 30 of us when we banded.

163
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:05,670
Who's worth wiping anymore?

164
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:07,280
Maybe a group overseas,

165
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,405
maybe us.

166
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:11,540
Maybe they're getting tired
of me killing them all the time.

167
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:12,715
Aren't you?

168
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:15,920
Thanks for the insight, Mini-Me,

169
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:19,028
but you missed the last quarter
of this game. We're not ahead.

170
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,376
The point is,
Topher thinks he can flip it,

171
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:24,096
create a pulse to restore
all the wiped minds.

172
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,644
He also thinks he's a little teapot,
short and stout.

173
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:29,730
Topher Brink is a genius,

174
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,816
and you'll keep a civil tongue,
or we'll put it in the stew.

175
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,444
Good to see you've mellowed...

176
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:37,571
What did they do?

177
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,866
They shot someone in front of him
every day he didn't finish.

178
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,285
We don't really eat
people's tongues.

179
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,160
Cool.

180
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,360
I've got a rocket scientist
or two in here.

181
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:50,025
They're not Topher's league,
but I don't think it's a fantasy.

182
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,720
The science seems sound.

183
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,495
But what would it mean?

184
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,959
Butchers, dumbshows,
everyone who's ever been wiped

185
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,926
or imprinted would go back
to their original identities.

186
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,233
Including us.

187
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,455
You finally get to be a real girl.

188
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:05,970
It sounds so simple.

189
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:07,095
It's not.

190
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,354
Anyone with Active architecture,
we'd be reset, too,

191
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:11,905
back before it all started.

192
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,732
- We'd forget...
- Everything.

193
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:20,030
Some of us can afford that,
but a lot of us can't,

194
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,340
and Topher doesn't have
everything he needs.

195
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:25,050
- This is where it gets interesting.
- It was dull?

196
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,134
To avoid the blast
and any reverberation,

197
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,827
we'd have to go deep underground
for a year or more,

198
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:31,980
and what Topher needs
to make the pulse work...

199
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:33,605
Is in the Dollhouse.

200
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:37,923
Come on!

201
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:40,842
I guess there really is
no place like home.

202
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:43,408
We just left that party.

203
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,129
- That party was on fire.
- We need a guide,

204
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:47,849
and you know the city
better than us.

205
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,686
I thought there was a vaccine.
You said there was a vaccine.

206
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,460
- There was, but this is new.
- Zone, power down a sec.

207
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,835
- Think about what this means.
- It means everything,

208
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,800
and somebody's got to step up.

209
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,125
The world still needs heroes, kid.

210
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:06,199
Did you really just say that?

211
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:09,890
What?
I was being inspirational.

212
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,706
You are so corny.

213
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,916
You're... fat.

214
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,835
Enough with the pep talk.

215
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:17,543
We need to get back.

216
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,506
You're going
to show us the way, or...

217
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:23,009
- She said you don't eat tongues.
- Maybe she should start.

218
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,687
I have listened to you whine
for way too long, Zone.

219
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:27,838
- This is bigger than us.
- Fine.

220
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:29,673
Then you take 'em.

221
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:31,143
You can send me a postcard

222
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,520
once we've reestablished
some sort of postal system

223
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:35,483
due to your heroics.

224
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,116
She loves it when you're corny.

225
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:38,734
For your 411,

226
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,277
I'm not some printed freak.

227
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,480
And the pulse...
it doesn't affect Actuals, right?

228
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,947
So I'm not heading back...

229
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,868
- What's that sound?
- You said you weren't followed.

230
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,786
The main gate.

231
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,245
A raiding party.

232
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,622
T, come here right now.

233
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,344
Sorry, English.

234
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,959
I got your message.

235
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:41,963
How can we help?

236
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:49,098
Sorry if you don't like our methods.
We like to take the offensive.

237
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,132
Most people have
a "shoot first" policy.

238
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,265
Us included.

239
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:56,556
You want to help with this,
or you want to play in the sandbox?

240
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,199
But why him?

241
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:04,156
I sent word with some of the Actuals
we set free.

242
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:07,259
- It was a long shot, I thought...
- But he's out of control.

243
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,448
They're Freakshows.

244
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,535
Tech heads...
exactly the sort of thing

245
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,161
I'm trying to keep T away from.

246
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:17,290
They're our only chance
of making it back through the wild.

247
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,084
But I don't want to go back.

248
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,047
I don't want to leave our home,

249
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,615
go down that hole.

250
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:29,010
It's not my idea
of a vacation spot either.

251
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,014
It's just the next thing.

252
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,114
Do I have to cut your throat?
What are you doing with the boy?

253
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,732
Showing him my mods, Vic.

254
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:46,194
No tech in front of the kid.
Do I have to upload that to your brain?

255
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,490
I got it. Log off.

256
00:15:49,363 --> 00:15:50,363
Easy.

257
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:56,329
You know, you can stay.

258
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,214
- I'll do the job.
- Come on.

259
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:00,333
Just takes me a while
to process things,

260
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,837
during which I yell.

261
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,432
I get what's at stake.

262
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,008
Who doesn't want to spend
some quality time with these

263
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:10,274
awesomely normal people?

264
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,670
I don't know.

265
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,389
Could be all right.

266
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,515
The little Asian's kind of cute.

267
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,018
She's a tech head, Mag.

268
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,205
She's a girl, Mag.

269
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,810
It's good to see him
productive again.

270
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:01,935
It is.

271
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:04,951
Yes, and who are you?

272
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,535
I'm Caro... I'm in the...

273
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,508
I'm just some kid.

274
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,884
Damn, you're twitchy.

275
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,602
You don't like girls?

276
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:36,492
Apparently, everyone does.

277
00:17:36,617 --> 00:17:38,417
I don't care for the tech.

278
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:42,614
So you're the weapons expert?

279
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:50,902
That's what that says, yeah.

280
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:56,533
You got to load that every time?

281
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,156
You can't just store it?

282
00:17:58,281 --> 00:17:59,715
Not unless you're Echo.

283
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,372
We want to stay sane,
we got to take something out first,

284
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,891
make room for it.

285
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:05,917
Take out what?

286
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,837


287
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,390
That's great.

288
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:33,666
How long have we been on the road?

289
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,091
Couple of hours.

290
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,365
How's the kid doing?

291
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:39,976
You can call him T.

292
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:43,747
He sleeps better than I do,
that's for sure.

293
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:50,795
The garden... looks like
it came a long way since I last saw it.

294
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,297
Three summers ago?

295
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:55,445
We've had some time to get it right.

296
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,760
I just mean...

297
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:00,722
I understand
it would be hard to leave.

298
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,290
It was our home...

299
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:04,593
away from all the horror.

300
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:09,689
Now I'm condemning him to that House,
that hell I was locked up in

301
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,127
for so many years.

302
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,568
So you can remember him,
remember raising him.

303
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,220
How ironic.

304
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:18,593
You'd have to kill me
to take those memories.

305
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,972
But I wanted him brought up away
from all the crap of this truck.

306
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,083
Well, we both did.

307
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:28,500
That's why we agreed

308
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,044
never to tell him,
to keep him away from me.

309
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,588
We agreed to keep him
away from the tech.

310
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,549
You chose to stay
steeped in it, Tony,

311
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,313
seduced by it.

312
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:41,095
You chose to be Victor.

313
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,223
- For our cause.
- For your cause.

314
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,726
I stopped fighting long ago.

315
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,354
I was fighting to protect you.

316
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,763
I would do anything for you,
for both of you.

317
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,429
Except the one thing
I asked you to do.

318
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,390
Man, you're gonna be hilarious
stuck underground for a year.

319
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:27,745
We're not there yet.

320
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,170
We'll get there.

321
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,745
This thing works, Rossum
is really going down.

322
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:35,900
Ambrose, Harding...
they'll just be hard drives on a shelf.

323
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:39,028
Yeah, and someone's going
to have to smash those drives.

324
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:42,365
Which is why we're staying down
till we know we're safe.

325
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:44,906
You keep bringing that up.

326
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:47,109
Because you keep pushing it down.

327
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:52,041
You think after the pulse,
the world's going to be all hunky-dory?

328
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,018
I think it's not your fight.

329
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,166
I think, for a good long while,
you're gonna have to be where you are,

330
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,715
and I think that scares you.

331
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:02,059
I hate when you pretend to know me.

332
00:21:05,068 --> 00:21:06,968
That's not a claim I'd make.

333
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:12,020
I've been knocking ten years,
you still won't let me in.

334
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:15,517
I've let you in a few times.

335
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:19,527
When you were sure
we were gonna die.

336
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,197
What happens if you're sure
we're going to live?

337
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,401
What do you think happens?

338
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,454
Come on, you're my analyst now,

339
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,329
so tell me what you think.

340
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:37,382
I think you've got a hundred people
living inside your head...

341
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,965
and you're
the loneliest person I know.

342
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:46,745
That's kind of sweet.

343
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,548
Not for the person who's with you.

344
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,314
We'll enter through the Union Plaza
metro station, the service tunnels.

345
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,520
The Butchers have killed most everyone
in the city and run out of food.

346
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:01,818
- So, they're thinning out.
- No, they got food.

347
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:04,280
We saw one eating his friend
the other day.

348
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,659
But it still means
there's less of them.

349
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:10,281
It also means
the strongest survived.

350
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,705
Super Butchers. Grand.

351
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,894
<i>We're almost there.
I'll get us as close as I can.</i>

352
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:28,874
I thought you said
there weren't many left.

353
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,082
There aren't.

354
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,134
But they're all here.

355
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:52,625
Ready?

356
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:55,248
We were born ready.

357
00:22:56,932 --> 00:22:58,243
Not technically.

358
00:22:58,683 --> 00:22:59,691
Yankee!

359
00:23:35,712 --> 00:23:37,415
Let's go! Move 'em out.*

360
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:39,709
Move!

361
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:40,965
They're armed.*

362
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:11,002
Holding up.*

363
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:25,630
We got 'em underground.

364
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,716
Move in!
Move in!

365
00:24:29,357 --> 00:24:31,427
Everyone, into the tunnel!
Now!

366
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,806
Go! Go!

367
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:47,966
It's okay.
You're gonna be...

368
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:54,909
Zone!

369
00:25:06,016 --> 00:25:08,054
That's all of us.
Seal the door behind us.

370
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,113
- What about...
- That's all of us!

371
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,019
We go down here.

372
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:26,565
Wait!

373
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:29,861
Last time we were here, your zombie
day spa was crawling with Butchers.

374
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:32,720
We need to drop some C-4
down the rabbit hole.

375
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:35,283
Then we risk destroying the tech
Topher's looking for.

376
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:38,476
If there were any Butchers down there,
they've probably torn each other apart.

377
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:39,700
Let's find out.

378
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:56,846
I try to be my best.

379
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,014
Hell.

380
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,223
Nope.

381
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:02,685
You'll have to keep digging,
if that's where you want to end up.

382
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:03,956
Alpha.

383
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:08,794
Thought we lost you in Reno.

384
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:10,610
I kinda let you think that.

385
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,768
I lost my stomach for the fight.

386
00:26:13,348 --> 00:26:15,203
Thought I'd help out
some people could use it.

387
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,584
Cleared this place out.

388
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,284
No wonder there's so many Butchers.

389
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,369
They know about the Dumbshow buffet.

390
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:26,322
Why would someone do something
so horrible to your face?

391
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:27,877
- Psycho.
- Lapsed.

392
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:30,922
We've got wounded.
Get Mag down here. I'll prep the meds.

393
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,548
Where's Big Bad Ballard?

394
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
We lost him.

395
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,867
Man, I'm sorry.
When did that happen?

396
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:40,417
Ten minutes ago.

397
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,062
Tell me where to look, darling.

398
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:48,606
Some things aren't
on the Cartesian Plane.

399
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:51,817
Is the tech
you're looking for in the lab?

400
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,193
The pineal gland!

401
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,947
The seat of consciousness.
I made it the seat of destruction.

402
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:59,631
How many people do you think
can sit on it before it breaks?

403
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:01,513
You don't mean the chair, do you?

404
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:05,991
What if there wasn't anything?

405
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:07,792
Then we took a road trip
for nothing.

406
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,523
We'd be okay with that.

407
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,379
What are you doing?

408
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:15,392
We came here for some juicy new prints.
Not to let you take our world away.

409
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:18,140
You stay down here,
you'll be shielded just like us.

410
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:19,955
You can stay who you are.

411
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,598
The ohm resistance of ten meters
of concrete is the equivalent...

412
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:25,643
We changed ourselves to survive
up there. To thrive.

413
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,271
Even if we don't get wiped,
you're still destroying who we are.

414
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,640
I've taken down guys
twice as bad as you

415
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:32,316
with guns twice as big.

416
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:35,069
Our guns aren't pointed at you,
sister.

417
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,287
Told him again and again and again,
guns don't help me think.

418
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,039
They just don't help me think.

419
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,501
- I can take 'em.
- You'll get him killed.

420
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,009
What's going on, Rome?

421
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,052
Upgrades, Vic.

422
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,454
- Tell me you haven't thought about it.
- Hold up.

423
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:05,422
We tweaked ourselves to fight the war.
It's ending.

424
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:07,727
Not anymore.
Not if they don't have him.

425
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:10,276
With all the tweaks on this computer,
we'll rule the Wasteland.

426
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:12,898
- Why wouldn't you want that?
- Because we're not Freakshows.

427
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:18,908
Well, okay, maybe I am.
And Echo.

428
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,936
Topher's a little off.
But Adelle...

429
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:24,093
she's a class act all the way.

430
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:27,001
It's just that I have worked so hard

431
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,620
to have a peaceful life here.

432
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,178
It's harder for me than most.

433
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:35,713
I get it.

434
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,924
You think I don't want every one
of those skills firing through my head?

435
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:41,637
I know how good it feels.

436
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,568
Skip learning the hard way.

437
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:45,666
Skip the long hours...

438
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,010
the sweat, the training.

439
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,998
Just to feel the thrill
of perfection.

440
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:57,474
But if we're going to rebuild the world,
I want to do it myself.

441
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,053
Sorry, boss,

442
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:05,158
that means
you stand with the Luddites.

443
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:08,621
Did he just call me a Luddite?

444
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,214
Looking for these?

445
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:23,204
We'll take him to the holding cell.
The tiny one to medical.

446
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,638
Figure out what to do with them
after we set off the EMP.

447
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,181
Let's go, Romeo.

448
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,853
God, she's so cool.

449
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:40,903
It's okay. It's okay.
Everything's going to be okay.

450
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,850
He's tired.

451
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:46,199
He's much worse when he's tired.

452
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,332
Tired?

453
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:49,719
Bedtime.

454
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,491
It was like this
when I bought the place.

455
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:08,139
Kill your idols.
There's a piece of truth.

456
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:11,893
I'm very glad you didn't clean up.

457
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,458
Yeah, it spoke to the
schizophrenic in me.

458
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:16,313
Well, both of them, actually.

459
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,025
He didn't come back for the tech.

460
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:33,080
He came back for an idea.

461
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,792
A synapse fires and I find a
solution before the problem.

462
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:39,412
How many times has
"B" come before "A"?

463
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:45,482
"Sniper. "

464
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:47,551
"Demolition. "

465
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,039
"Ernesto. "

466
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:51,221
He gave it up, Priya.

467
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:53,458
He knew he couldn't take you.

468
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,835
And he'll be back for
these, I guarantee it.

469
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,605
Well... let him!

470
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:02,251
Wonder if I'm in here somewhere.

471
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:03,826
"Memory of Priya. "

472
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,114
Pulls it out of his head,
along with "Being human. "

473
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,438
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- This!

474
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:11,619
This tech has been eating
at my life...

475
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,387
He's in love with you!

476
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:15,039
Are you really that thick?

477
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,208
This isn't something
that comes on a drive.

478
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,976
They tried to pull it out of him.

479
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:21,962
They wiped his mind for years,
and he never stopped loving you!

480
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:23,589
You want to kill the tech?

481
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,134
Kill it! Shut it down!

482
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,629
Lock him out!
Give him nothing!

483
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,082
You can string him along for years.

484
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:35,475
You've got years together and
what you should do is waste it!

485
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:37,931
Never tell him that you love him.

486
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:39,939
Never tell him that
you're grateful for him!

487
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:41,805
He's dead!

488
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:45,226
He's dead!

489
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,350
He's just...

490
00:31:48,057 --> 00:31:48,781
dead!

491
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:51,415
I never told him.

492
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,763
Paul's dead.

493
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:58,347
And I'm alone.

494
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,740
I'm all alone, I'm always alone.

495
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:12,285
<i>Welcome to Lecture One
in a three-part series entitled</i>

496
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,313
<i>"Neuroplasticity in Relation to
Cortical Imprinting. "</i>

497
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:23,774
Her face has a look about her.

498
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,884
<i>The most effective way
to imprint new pathways</i>

499
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,903
<i>is with a timed
electrostatic charge.</i>

500
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,148
<i>It simulates the natural
rewiring process of the brain.</i>

501
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,390
<i>Basic neuroplasticity...</i>

502
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:35,675
<i>every action affects
our neural topography.</i>

503
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,042
<i>We literally become what we do,
not what we've done or what we will do.</i>

504
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,333
<i>We're best defined by
our actions in the moment.</i>

505
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,335
<i>With a wavelength of more
than two meters,</i>

506
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,014
<i>little damage is done
to the surrounding tissue.</i>

507
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,439
Thank you.

508
00:32:53,994 --> 00:32:55,694
Greater than two meters.

509
00:32:57,824 --> 00:32:59,268
The connection goes there.

510
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,436
I know.

511
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:04,773
Does this mean we're finished?

512
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,652
- Where do we set off the device?
- High up, higher up.

513
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,713
Higher, the better. Gamma rays
bounce off the atmosphere.

514
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:14,890
- Is my old office high enough?
- Yes, yes, yes, perfect.

515
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:17,689
It'll hit the stratosphere.

516
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,914
A minor explosion cascades
into a major chain reaction.

517
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,284
- Explosion?
- It does the work for you.

518
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,337
You said it could only
be activated manually.

519
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,078
You're not coming back.

520
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:38,682
Small price to pay.

521
00:33:43,574 --> 00:33:45,439
I didn't want
to cause any more pain.

522
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:54,828
Is now a bad time
to ask for a favor?

523
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:23,831
I'd like you to meet your father.

524
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:42,084
I'm Anthony.

525
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,400
You can call me Tony.

526
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,010
That's my name, too.

527
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:56,260
Can I help you burn stuff?

528
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,638
You don't have to do it, you know.

529
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,033
At least not alone.

530
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,459
I do.

531
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:32,743
I'll fix what we did to their heads.

532
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,762
You fix what we did to
the rest of the world.

533
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,482
Your job is way harder

534
00:35:58,071 --> 00:35:59,071
Man...

535
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,468
- you don't waste any time.
- Shut up.

536
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,781
I don't have to.
I'm going.

537
00:36:04,352 --> 00:36:06,872
Our tiny Messiah's gonna
be a ten-year-old soon.

538
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,819
Somebody's gotta look after her.

539
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:12,817
- Caroline told me.
- And you, stumpy, are going nowhere.

540
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:15,255
Except maybe down.

541
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,197
Take care of her, Zone.

542
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,011
Try not to have any influence
on her of any kind.

543
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:22,749
And, you know,

544
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:25,099
look us up in a year or two.

545
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,028
Not if you paid me.

546
00:36:32,536 --> 00:36:34,036
What, what'd you do?

547
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:36,819
You know, before.

548
00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:39,154
I was at Berkeley.

549
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:40,975
Sociology.

550
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:42,354
You?

551
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:45,122
Landscape architect.

552
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,164
Would never have called that one.

553
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,176
People are such a mystery.

554
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:57,047
Alpha just left?

555
00:36:57,843 --> 00:36:59,593
He said he couldn't stay,

556
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,928
and if he was going to
become what he was before...

557
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,096
He won't.

558
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:06,617
He's evolved; he will again.

559
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:10,593
Well, I think he'd like to be
alone when he finds out.

560
00:37:11,454 --> 00:37:12,604
Just in case.

561
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:17,189
- And the rest of them?
- I'll lead them out,

562
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:21,530
make sure they all come
through the pulse all right.

563
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:24,188
I'm really the only one who can.

564
00:37:24,457 --> 00:37:25,951
Ever the shepherd?

565
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,019
Leading them into the light.

566
00:37:28,738 --> 00:37:29,738
For good.

567
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,647
Funny that the last fantasy
the Dollhouse should fulfill...

568
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:37,129
would be yours.

569
00:37:38,545 --> 00:37:40,845
I don't have any fantasies, Adelle.

570
00:37:44,052 --> 00:37:45,330
More's the pity.

571
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:01,335
Alpha said to dismantle all
the tech in the building.

572
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,216
He said you should
start with the chair.

573
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:46,859
Having second thoughts?

574
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:48,033
No way.

575
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:50,208
I'm the lucky one.

576
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,240
I get to start over.

577
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,105
What happened?

578
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,633
It's a long story, kid.

579
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:48,024
Don't worry about it.

580
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:50,053
Everything's gonna be all right.

581
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:45,641
Am I...

582
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:49,506
Are we...

583
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:52,039
You wanted me to let you in.

584
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:56,887
You sure you got room?

585
00:41:57,372 --> 00:41:59,022
I got a lot of baggage.

586
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:00,693
Childhood stuff.

587
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,394
We'll work through it.

588
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,032
<i>We've got time. </i>
