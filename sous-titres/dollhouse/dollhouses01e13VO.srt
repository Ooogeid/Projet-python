Are you looking for Safe Haven?

351
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:37,176
-What?
-What do you know about Safe Haven?

352
00:23:37,246 --> 00:23:38,679
It's a myth.

353
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:40,905
She's empty.

354

I know the way to Safe Haven.

358
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:02,935
You do?

359
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,736
I can show you the way.

how many Actuals are there.

362
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,372
Here.

363
00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:16,046
Here? This?

364
00:24:16,118 --> 00:24:18,177
Mag, grab the heavy thing.

365
00:24:19,054 --> 00:24:21,386
This is the way to Safe Haven.

366
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:25,421
You gotta be kidding me.

367
00:24:25,494 --> 00:24:26,688
Wait!

368
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:30,899
The chair. The memories will tell us
how to get there?

369
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,858
So we are on the right track.

370
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:34,333
'Cause the wind-up doll says so?

371
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,392
I told you there were answers.

372
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:36,597
-She's right. We keep going.
-Are you printed?

373
00:24:36,672 --> 00:24:38,367
This girl probably killed Lynn.

374
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,169
We should waste her, not take her advice.

375
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:41,834
Now, instead of finding food,

376
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,344
y'all wanna hang with dumb shows
and play with tech all day.

377
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:45,778
-Food.
-GRlFF: I think we're close.

378
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:47,645
There was this one girl, Echo.

She seemed like she could
withstand the prints.

380

-GRlFF: Where?

00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:56,347
If you point at the freaking chair,
I will end you.

383
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:58,017
In the kitchen.

You're giving away our Actives.

No, we're not giving them away.
We're charging a lump nine-figure sum.

This is wrong. You can't do this.

we can do whatever we want.

We've always been above the law, Adelle.

Only now, we're also writing it.

Everybody who matters is either
a client or one of ours.

409

if he has no fear and will live forever.

It is not what you set out to do, Adelle.

This is the time to choose,
Adelle, Mr. Brink.

someone who lives on,

the endless, epic arc of history,

421
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:57,441
or a quickly discarded,
decomposing vessel enriching the soil.

422
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:02,315
You both earned a place on the ark.
Mr. Brink, he practically built it.

423
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:06,176
So you can take this body if you want.
I won't fight.

we'll know and you'll have made a choice.

would somehow,

433
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:35,311
Does it hurt? It looks like it hurts.

He doesn't remember it hurting
when it's over, though, kiddo.

take people out of people
