1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,167
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:02,710
Sorry, sister.

3
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,004
- I stay, we both get nabbed.
- Don't leave me.

4
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,172
I was her best friend.
This is what I got for it.

5
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:09,967
This is my gift from Caroline.

6
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:11,927
And he took
all of Caroline's imprints?

7
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:14,347
Where's her original self?

8
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,516
- You have a backup?
- This was the backup.

9
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,978
Alpha mapped his entire brain.
I'll try and piece it back together.

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,564
You made me a doll?
Then why do I feel like myself?

11
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:25,947
You are, but it's an imprint.

12
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:27,861
There's only one place for a doll

13
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,945
- that's irreparably damaged.
- The Attic.

14
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,174
They say it's whatever hell
you imagine.

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,735
This is your worst nightmare?

16
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:35,864
This is the shape of things to come.

17
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,454
We got it... the information
we were looking for.

18
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:40,483
I know how to get
at the heart of Rossum.

19
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:43,628
- We're ready.
- It's time for me to meet Caroline.

20
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:50,935
Not this one.

21
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,433
Come on.
You said you'd give me the tour.

22
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:56,037
Here it is, all right?
It's just like any other office.

23
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,474
Can I have my key card?
I want to take you to the roof.

24
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:01,369
Why are you so nervous?
Whose office is it anyway?

25
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:03,633
It's nobody's.

26
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:06,420
Look, nobody's got a bar!

27
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:09,385
Come on, you want to get me fired?

28
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,239
I want to get you fired up.

29
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:18,911
- We really shouldn't be doing this.
- Come on.

30
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,414
But I mean, just in here.

31
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,938
You said you dummied up
the security feed.

32
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:25,918
No, I know,
it's just that I, you know,

33
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,962
I just don't want to leave any DNA.

34
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,857
Then don't make me bleed you.

35
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,515
What are you doing?

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,210
What I came here to do.

37
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,191
God, you're a thief?

38
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:46,938
I let a thief into the building?

39
00:01:47,195 --> 00:01:48,845
Relax. I'm not a thief.

40
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:50,359
I'm a terrorist.

41
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,318
I am so screwed.

42
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,654
The woman who works here...
What do you know about her?

43
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,882
Nothing. I don't know anything.
I work for a security company.

44
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:59,532
I'm practically a temp.

45
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,288
Rossum's not gonna give a temp
full access to their buildings.

46
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,791
Hello, Carrie-at-the-prom.

47
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:09,378
Off-the-chart smart.
Bet you could kill me with your brain.

48
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,244
What makes you a priority?

49
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:14,633
Full scholarship.

50
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:17,427
- What's in Tucson?
- I don't know.

51
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,812
Please, just put
all this stuff back.

52
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,239
What the hell is this?

53
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:27,354
I have no idea.

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,685
But that can't be in this building.

55
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:35,737
Then let's bring down the building.

56
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,506
See what's underneath.

57
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:39,806
Who are you?

58
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:41,494
Caroline?

59
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:44,872
We need to know what she knows.

60
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:47,036
Clyde said there was one person

61
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,710
who had seen his partner face-to-face,
and that was Caroline.

62
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:51,419
She can I.D. the man in charge.

63
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,764
- Or the woman.
- Or hermaphrodite.

64
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,683
Say, can we get back to the part

65
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,512
where the chair-less imprinting
tech that I designed,

66
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:03,244
which you handed over to Harding
in order to get the swank office back...

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,643
how that leads to the apocalypse?

68
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:09,395
'Cause I thought that was
kind of an interesting detail.

69
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,612
It doesn't matter
where the tech comes from.

70
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,734
We have to do more
than disrupt production.

71
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,403
As long as Clyde's partner
is still out there,

72
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:18,195
Rossum will go on.

73
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,990
We have to cut
the head off the snake.

74
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:22,660
And Caroline's the only one
who's ever met that snake.

75
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:26,121
She's been behind the curtain.
Now we need for her to take us there.

76
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:27,748
What if she won't?

77
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,168
You're impressive, you are.

78
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,467
You're carrying multiple constructs.

79
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,926
And something in you has allowed you
to fuse them into a kind of super ego.

80
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,657
Caroline isn't just one more personality
build you'd be adding to the mix...

81
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:43,680
she's real.

82
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,058
- Echo is real.
- You're damn right she is.

83
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,852
Ivy's right.
We actually don't know

84
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:50,855
what dumping Caroline
into Echo's brain will do.

85
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:53,175
Your original self
comes home to find

86
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,535
the house party that's
going on inside your head...

87
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,944
she might fight back.

88
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,362
- She'd lose.
- All right.

89
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,656
Pull Caroline from the vault.

90
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:03,702
Put Echo in the chair.

91
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,338
Is that really necessary?

92
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:19,466
- It's just a precaution.
- And not an unwise one.

93
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,676
Unlike the rest of you,
I've actually met Caroline.

94
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,425
You okay?

95
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:29,852
I'm good.

96
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:37,584
We haven't really talked
since you... died.

97
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:42,071
I guess we've both died since then.

98
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:45,326
Weird week.

99
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:50,330
Are you finally ready to meet the girl
who started the trouble in your life?

100
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:53,959
What? Janice Charles
from my fourth grade math class is here?

101
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:58,464
We're all set.
All we need now is...

102
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,613
Caroline.

103
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:01,800
Where's the wedge?

104
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:03,237
Gone.

105
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,095
What?

106
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,348
Caroline's missing.

107
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,683
Episode 211: <i>Getting Closer</i>

108
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,141
www.subbercafe.fr

109
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:38,801
Obviously clueless.

110
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:41,048
She is clueless.

111
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,421
She's at my party.

112
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:44,611
The be-atch comes up
to my boyfriend...

113
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:46,422
And you looked so hot. I mean...

114
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,172
- I looked so good.
- Amazing.

115
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,264
- You looked really good, too.
- Thank you.

116
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,670
Excuse me.
Are you finished?

117
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:55,737
You can take those.

118
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:59,149
So I was like, "You've got to be
kidding me," and she was like,

119
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,644
"No, I'm not. " Okay, be-atch.

120
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,541
I am not a waitress.

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,282
I'm not a waitress.

122
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,899
I'm just another person
standing here with a tray.

123
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,706
So, I was like,

124
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,417
- "You go anywhere near him..."
- It's very crowded,

125
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:19,278
and you ladies
are taking up four spaces.

126
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,964
- Also, you appear to be finished.
- We're not finished.

127
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:25,551
Does it look like we're finished?

128
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:28,345
- I just said that.
- God, was that the bisque?

129
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,848
Did you have the bisque?
I had the bisque...

130
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,435
It's coming up again!
Oh, God. Love your bag.

131
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,854
Take the table.

132
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:42,058
Care to join me?

133
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,780
You're not ill?

134
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,572
See, the mistake you made
was trying to reason with them.

135
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,036
But I find that even rude people
don't like to barfed on.

136
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:50,408
I imagine that's true.

137
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,580
- Caroline Farrell.
- Bennett Halverson.

138
00:06:57,855 --> 00:06:59,705
So I'm just going to guess.

139
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,736
Neuroscience major.

140
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,847
How did you know that?

141
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:06,050
Fish. Brain food.

142
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,093
Also brain books.

143
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,067
Of course.
I'm an idiot.

144
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,681
And a genius, probably.

145
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,169
Technically.

146
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:15,768
And you?

147
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:17,976
Not a huge genius.

148
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,065
What are you studying?

149
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,275
I'm still trying to pin it down.

150
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,886
I see all the things
they have to offer, and I figure

151
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,568
once I settle on one thing,

152
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:29,693
I've excluded everything else.

153
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,451
And there are a lot of things
I'd like to be.

154
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,885
<i>Get that thing out of my face.</i>

155
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,699
<i>It's for the video yearbook.</i>

156
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:44,379
<i>Okay, hi, Mom.
Are we done?</i>

157
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,529
<i>Is there someone
you'd like to say good-bye to?</i>

158
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:47,946
<i>Dieter and Meg.</i>

159
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,105
<i>And the girls of Sigma Tau.
Sister's forever.</i>

160
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,438
<i>Let's hope those venereal
diseases make you...</i>

161
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:56,073
She seems so innocent
in a way, doesn't she?

162
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:58,170
Unspoiled.

163
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:01,785
She wasn't, you know.

164
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:06,884
Caroline Farrell left quite a trail
of unhappiness in her wake

165
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,559
and not a few bodies.

166
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,663
Are you saying she's evil?

167
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:13,325
Worse.

168
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:15,187
An idealist.

169
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:18,287
<i>- And I want to travel.</i>
- I shouldn't be at all surprised

170
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,667
if it turned out her wedge had got up
and walked out of here on its own.

171
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:24,419
I was glad
when I heard it was missing.

172
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,172
It's only natural.

173
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,465
But I didn't take it.

174
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,425
I only considered it briefly.

175
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:32,219
<i>What can I say?</i>

176
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,058
<i>I want to do everything.</i>

177
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,764
<i>Is that too much to ask?</i>

178
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,947
Why would Echo
steal her own imprint?

179
00:08:39,072 --> 00:08:40,661
Because she's become a real girl.

180
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,393
And if Caroline were to come back,
she might cease to exist

181
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:46,070
or wind up nuts or very confused.

182
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:47,758
Okay, but it doesn't track.

183
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:49,527
Echo went to the Attic
for the cause.

184
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,445
Whatever that does to your brain
is worse than getting a roomie.

185
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,414
Now, this is just Rossum
being five steps ahead of us again.

186
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:56,410
We're there.

187
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,537
Harding runned this place for months.
His people were everywhere.

188
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,786
Rossum could have had them
grab the wedge at any time.

189
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,596
We have ignition.
Ghost chair's just been engaged.

190
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:07,342
Let's do this.

191
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,306
After Apollo's accomplished

192
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,207
bring Cassandra down
for a full diagnostic.

193
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,101
She's been complaining about...

194
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:22,603
That's wrong.

195
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,592
Something's happening.
Something unintended.

196
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:29,381
Not unintended...
intentional.

197
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:31,736
Cancel this imprint.
This imprint's been corrupted.

198
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:33,447
Corrupted from the outside.

199
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:34,977
School pranks.

200
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:37,451
This reeks of Topher Brink.

201
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:52,049
We're in.
She's here. We got her.

202
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:53,445
Is she okay?

203
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,882
Is she still cute?

204
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:56,361
Don't you hurt her.

205
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,321
Gingersnap.

206
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,006
- What is this? What are you doing?
- I'm taking you to see an old friend.

207
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,593
We're not leaving yet.

208
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,722
And the flight...
not too exhausting, I trust?

209
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:18,065
You used the company jet to abduct
the programmer of a rival House.

210
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:21,761
I'm certain I'll be kicking myself
come holiday bonus time.

211
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,616
I'm sure you'll be dead by then.

212
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,886
It's a very open space.

213
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,417
Quite a lot of beige.

214
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,790
You let them roam.

215
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,824
They roam like free-range chickens.

216
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,137
We keep ours more like veal.

217
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:42,446
Hi.

218
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:45,262
Welcome.

219
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,941
You routed through an I-09
to seize control of my chair.

220
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,195
Impressive.

221
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:52,149
Topher here is going to explain

222
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:55,133
why we've gone to such lengths
to procure your services.

223
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:57,030
You won't be getting my services.

224
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,278
But you don't even know
what we need yet.

225
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:01,743
I don't care.

226
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,900
This man assaulted me.
Struck me in my own lab.

227
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:07,014
I'd like to file a formal complaint.

228
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,919
Ms. Halverson, as you correctly noted,
you have been abducted.

229
00:11:11,196 --> 00:11:13,588
Now, you could be treated
as a prisoner or as a guest.

230
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,965
It's entire...

231
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,430
Can I get you anything?

232
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:24,837
- A diet soda.
- I have some!

233
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:27,753
I mean,

234
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:29,744
in my fridge.

235
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:31,919
Come on.

236
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,500
Well, lab's in here.

237
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,552
You showed me yours.
Let me...

238
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,448
show you mine.

239
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,371
I can...
I'm all right.

240
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,566
How long do you think
before they track her back here?

241
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:52,526
Sooner than I'd hoped, I'm afraid.

242
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,062
Damn romantic fools.
I'm surrounded by them.

243
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:58,050
He couldn't just leave her there.

244
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,643
No, I suppose not.
But I had hoped

245
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:03,885
for an outward appearance of normalcy
while we marshaled our forces.

246
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,789
However, any good battle plan
must be fluid.

247
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,060
We'll be going
into full lockdown mode.

248
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,334
You did a good thing.

249
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,197
Did I?

250
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:22,711
She walked away from me,
and I let her.

251
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,951
I never looked to see
if she was okay.

252
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,107
She was a person, and now she's...

253
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,707
nothing again.

254
00:12:33,196 --> 00:12:34,221
We'll fix it.

255
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:37,214
We'll make her right.

256
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,159
Once they've done this to you...

257
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:42,881
can you ever be right again?

258
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:52,480
Imprint wedge.

259
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,618
It's an original personality.

260
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:57,509
- What happened to it?
- It...

261
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,153
got damaged last year.

262
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,399
I only kept this around
to see if, as an exercise,

263
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:06,326
I could restore it.
You know?

264
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:09,250
Like you did
with the Hamilton wedge.

265
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,707
- You heard about that?
- That was legend.

266
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,630
Thing is, I still have no idea

267
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,754
which decompression algorithms
you used to recover the imprint.

268
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,942
The Hamilton wedge
was only missing half its data.

269
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,926
That's a one to two
compression ratio.

270
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,416
This is only one to four.

271
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:28,557
An exponential increase.

272
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,459
Failed test pins...

273
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:35,211
microcracks

274
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:38,692
in the spindle,
mag comp corruption...

275
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,694
Why do you need this one restored?

276
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:49,319
Would it sound OTT
if I said this could help prevent

277
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,746
the end of civilization
as we know it?

278
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,624
I would need
to understand the context.

279
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:58,295
You could use perceptual coding
to reassemble

280
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,636
the autonomic functions, I suppose.

281
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:03,132
How much data loss would we suffer?

282
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:04,714
One generation.

283
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:05,968
No loss.

284
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,715
Every memory will be intact.

285
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:10,840
Awesome.

286
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,618
Then maybe

287
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:17,213
we could work on the one memory

288
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:18,482
I'd like to erase.

289
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,798
I'm so sorry I hit you.

290
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:26,999
I didn't want to.

291
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,152
God, how I didn't want to.

292
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,319
I was trying to kill
your Active at the time.

293
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,082
You had your reasons.

294
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:37,566
Still...

295
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:39,418
that face.

296
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:40,939
Slugging it.

297
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:44,257
Not my first instinct.

298
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,631
I didn't think it was.

299
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,890
Some form of contact, but not...

300
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:53,926
Who's on that wedge?

301
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,605
Who are you trying to resurrect?

302
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:03,757
This person.

303
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:07,280
It's stupid.
Does it... does it matter?

304
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:08,630
It might.

305
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,910
It's not like
it's Stalin or somebody.

306
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,237
I didn't suppose that it
would be a historical figure.

307
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:17,938
Who is it?

308
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,810
Ready for your treatment?

309
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:31,596
I think I changed my mind.

310
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,598
No mind changing.
Come on. Back in the chair.

311
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,132
Is it so bad right now?

312
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:37,614
It's not bad.
It's just... dull.

313
00:15:38,008 --> 00:15:39,408
We're going to make you pop.

314
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:42,057
I'm not sure I wish to pop.

315
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:44,137
You're gonna pop. And like it.

316
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:46,937
In the chair. Lay back.

317
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,456
All right. You're starting
a big new job tomorrow.

318
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:52,086
You want to turn heads.

319
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:57,392
I'll mostly be studying them,
and there'll be rat heads.

320
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,959
Well, you want to look nice
for your vermin.

321
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:03,141
They're largely color blind,

322
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,338
though they can detect
some ultraviolet.

323
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,771
Then they'll love this.

324
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:09,132
The purple's really going
to bring out your eyes.

325
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,511
Close them. I'm kidding.

326
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:14,639
This is your color.
What your color should be.

327
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,359
You'll still be you; just more you.

328
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,409
I've often thought
I'd like to be less me.

329
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:23,996
More like...

330
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,109
You, actually.

331
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,128
Me? I'm still undeclared.

332
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:32,451
You know who you are.
You're so fearless.

333
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:35,412
I'd love to get a look
at your amygdala.

334
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:37,962
You'd have to buy me dinner first.

335
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:43,693
No one's ever done this
for me before.

336
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:47,964
Washed your hair?

337
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:49,896
Taken an interest.

338
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:00,441
It's me.

339
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,672
I'd have called. I don't trust
the land lines right now.

340
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,428
DeWitt's ordered the House
into full lockdown.

341
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,612
I think it's time we brought you in.

342
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:14,732
Do we get to have one drink first?

343
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:25,707
Are you scared?

344
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,437
Not anymore.

345
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:41,665
What did you do?

346
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:46,004
Her left arm may be dead,

347
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:48,274
but she's got
a terrific right cross.

348
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,316
If anyone asks.

349
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:55,448
Actually, if anyone asks, don't say
I got beat up by a one-armed girl.

350
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:57,581
What did you do to him?

351
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,568
Him? Him who?

352
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,514
I gave him his life back.

353
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:09,643
You made him a Doll.

354
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,966
I had to reconstruct
his neural landscape

355
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:17,137
based on the brain scans Alpha made
when he damaged it, but he's still Paul.

356
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:20,748
Same taciturn, self-regarding guy.

357
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,434
No, he's not the same.

358
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:24,185
He's different.

359
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,378
Half his brain tissue was scarred.

360
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:28,289
I had to do major rewiring,

361
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:30,282
which required healthy brain tissue.

362
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,922
There were two pieces of real
estate big enough for the job.

363
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:34,988
The motor cortex
or the cingulate gyrus.

364
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:38,022
So either he could live his life
trapped in a paralyzed body,

365
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:40,492
or I could take away something else.

366
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:42,568
Me, wasn't it?

367
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:49,285
Not his memories of you.

368
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:50,920
He's still got those.

369
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:53,963
Our connection.

370
00:18:58,802 --> 00:18:59,846
I think so.

371
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:02,921
The freshest, brightest paths...

372
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:05,731
Those are the ones I needed.

373
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:08,929
I think that was you.

374
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:15,226
You're still bleeding.

375
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,281
Why don't you let me do that?

376
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:20,033
Dr. Saunders?

377
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:22,202
Hop up.

378
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:28,062
Tilt your head back.

379
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:32,644
How did you...

380
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,964
You mean...

381
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:36,782
You two?

382
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,298
Wait.

383
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,544
Less talking would
mean less bleeding.

384
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,263
And I mean that in so many ways.

385
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:44,641
So you're the reason Boyd's been

386
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,726
all tardy and sleepy
the last two months.

387
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:48,626
Glad you're back.

388
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:50,230
You might not be.

389
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:53,650
That troublesome
one-armed creature, where is she?

390
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,953
I had to lock her up. Couldn't leave her
in the Lab unattended.

391
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:58,488
And your charm offensive?

392
00:19:58,787 --> 00:20:00,156
Mostly just offensive.

393
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:03,051
When Dr. Saunders is finished with you,
come and see me, please.

394
00:20:03,176 --> 00:20:04,193
Right-o.

395
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,284
- I try to be my best.
- Of course you do, my dear.

396
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,024
Try and have her back on rotation
as soon as is practicably possible.

397
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,106
- She is, after all, our Number One.
- Ma'am, a word?

398
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,162
Three months ago, someone
deleted a substantial portion

399
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,315
of security footage from the system.

400
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,790
Three months ago?

401
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,728
Not our system. The main building.
I only learned of it recently.

402
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:32,213
And?

403
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,790
I spoke to the security
officer on duty that night.

404
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:36,315
He admitted to it.

405
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:37,776
Freely?

406
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:40,661
Loudly. There was some pleading.

407
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:44,075
Turns out he let a young
woman into the building.

408
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,861
Your office, to be exact.

409
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:49,330
I'll ask Judith
to inventory my files.

410
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,648
I already did.
Two were missing.

411
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:53,759
One of them was Caroline Farrell's.

412
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,371
The security officer identified her
as the woman he let in.

413
00:20:57,496 --> 00:21:00,257
Thorn in my side, that girl.
I thought we'd finished with her.

414
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:02,282
She'd dropped off the radar.

415
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:04,436
You said there were
two files missing?

416
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,556
The other one was
Bennett Halverson's.

417
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:07,982
Damn.

418
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,484
Halverson is one
of Rossum's rising stars.

419
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:13,311
Rumor has it, the man at the top
selected her himself.

420
00:21:13,678 --> 00:21:16,491
Guess who's rooming with Bennett
Halverson at Tucson Tech?

421
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:18,993
- Who else knows about this?
- Just us.

422
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:21,821
Keep it that way.
We need to get to Tucson.

423
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:28,036
Benster.

424
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,604
You're home early.

425
00:21:29,994 --> 00:21:31,873
They were doing routine
maintenance at the lab.

426
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:36,247
You broke out the Tasty Couture.
Good choice.

427
00:21:37,427 --> 00:21:39,196
You said it was okay
for me to borrow it.

428
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:41,925
Yeah, totally. Rock on.
I kind of got it for you.

429
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:45,303
Is something wrong?

430
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,189
I wasn't snooping.
I just...

431
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:50,892
went into your closet
to find the outfit.

432
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,646
- Who are you?
- Bennie.

433
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:56,022
Who are you?!

434
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,990
I'm Caroline.
You know me.

435
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:01,402
I don't think I do.

436
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:03,537
Where did that file come from?

437
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:05,129
L.A.

438
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,047
The Rossum office in L.A.

439
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:09,494
Why do you have it?

440
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:11,329
Because I took it.

441
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:13,929
And it led you to me?

442
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,418
I saw you were valuable to them,
which means you're valuable to me.

443
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:20,121
You wanted to get close to them?

444
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,464
To hurt them?

445
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:22,863
A lot.

446
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,249
Bennett, Rossum is out of control.

447
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,864
They're doing things,
experiments not just on animals.

448
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:34,227
- If you'd seen what I'd seen...
- I thought you were my friend.

449
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:36,301
I am.

450
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,272
Then why won't you let me help you?

451
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:42,986
You're not... pissed
because I used you?

452
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:45,405
I'm hurt that you won't.

453
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:51,035
Do you want to blow up a building?

454
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,795
Hey, stud.

455
00:23:01,995 --> 00:23:04,235
Mother always wanted me
to date a doctor.

456
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:07,699
I wonder what mine wanted.

457
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,820
- Guess we'll find out.
- It's scary, isn't it?

458
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:13,346
We need Caroline.

459
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,684
We need you.

460
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,239
I keep thinking there is a me,
that I'm real,

461
00:23:19,662 --> 00:23:22,692
but every time I talk to someone,
they act like I'm doing tricks.

462
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:27,071
Paul never believed Echo was a person
even when he cared.

463
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:30,661
Now he's just waiting
for Caroline to kick me out.

464
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,076
That's never gonna happen.

465
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,244
Look,

466
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,437
I never met Caroline Farrell.

467
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:37,706
I know she drives DeWitt
about as crazy as you do,

468
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:39,500
so I figure she can't be all bad.

469
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:41,753
But I know you.
I've watched you grow.

470
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:45,590
I've watched you build yourself
from scratch against all odds.

471
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:46,997
Against us.

472
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:50,853
You're stronger than everyone here,
Echo, even Caroline.

473
00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:54,004
If she gets in there,

474
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:57,234
I think she'll be proud to know you.

475
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:07,730
I have to put the House on lockdown.

476
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:10,410
- You gotta do that now?
- Yeah. Orders.

477
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:12,158
Give me three minutes.

478
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,664
I'm glad you have found
something for us.

479
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,821
We were feeling
like a couple of fifth wheels.

480
00:24:20,946 --> 00:24:22,293
What do you need us to do?

481
00:24:23,105 --> 00:24:25,110
I need you
to get the hell out of here.

482
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:27,090
There's time.
Probably not much but some.

483
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,175
- Don't spend it here.
- I don't understand.

484
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:31,165
Look at her.

485
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:34,305
Understand?

486
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:36,808
We're about to go to war.

487
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,678
You never know
what you'll lose in a war.

488
00:24:38,803 --> 00:24:40,478
You never know
what you'll lose anyway.

489
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,658
Go, be with each other,
even if it's just for the night.

490
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:44,607
Thank you.

491
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,322
Guys...

492
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,992
If you somehow forget the way back here,
that's okay, too.

493
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,358
Clyde's dead.

494
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:04,783
Rossum's on to you.
They're coming.

495
00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:12,250
He said they're on to us.
Probably headed this way.

496
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,220
This could alter our plans
considerably.

497
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,047
Okay, am I the only one thinking

498
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:19,267
we're getting maybe a little too much
of our intel from The Matrix,

499
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,561
or possibly <i>Tron</i>, given the outfits?

500
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,502
We'll assume
the information is good.

501
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,910
We'll begin
evacuation procedures at once.

502
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:27,900
Every Active
to be brought to imprint,

503
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:31,779
their personality restored and released.
We can dispense with the niceties.

504
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,407
I'm not leaving behind
a House full of helpless creatures.

505
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:35,735
Behind?

506
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:37,076
Where are we going?

507
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:38,955
Tucson, obviously.

508
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:43,830
{\ROSSUM HEADQUARTERS
Tucson, Arizona}

509
00:25:43,955 --> 00:25:46,280
These are the labs
with restricted access.

510
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:48,087
Then those are the targets.

511
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:49,960
You sure you're up for this?

512
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:51,620
We're in it together, right?

513
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:52,895
Till the end.

514
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:54,986
Go.
I'll do my work from here.

515
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:11,652
You should be above
the first lab by now.

516
00:26:12,295 --> 00:26:13,295
Copy.

517
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:16,866
<i>The charge is in place.</i>

518
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,425
Ten minutes on the clock?

519
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:23,122
First charge is hot.

520
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:24,999
<i>No backing down now.</i>

521
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:43,809
I'm above a lab
just past the L junction.

522
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:45,519
It's not in the schematic.

523
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:47,271
Set the last charge and move on.

524
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:52,109
The only reason you build a room that's
not in the plans is to hide something.

525
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,362
- I'm going in.
- <i>You don't have time!</i>

526
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:57,740
When you get curious, you get dead.

527
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:02,912
Do you read?

528
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,494
- Bennett, we have to abort!
- What?

529
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,497
- There are people in here!
- You can't! The timers are set!

530
00:27:47,724 --> 00:27:50,340
I'll try and pull the detonator caps!
You have to run!

531
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:51,465
Help me!

532
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:52,962
- Run!
- I won't!

533
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:54,672
Run! Run!

534
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,924
He was in there too long.
He's going into shock.

535
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,058
- He needs to go to a hospital.
- Impossible.

536
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,583
My entire support staff
are engaged in the evacuation.

537
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:11,063
Evacuate him. He risked everything
to get his message to us.

538
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:17,945
Put him back in the Attic.

539
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:19,530
It's his best hope.

540
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,358
No, you bitch.

541
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:23,617
I'd rather die.

542
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:29,335
Well, I'd rather you didn't.

543
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:32,795
See that it's done.

544
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,060
- Let me take him.
- It's done, Mr. Ballard!

545
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:40,285
She's right.

546
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:42,386
His best chance
is back in the Attic.

547
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,500
And we could use someone on the inside
when we hit the mainframe.

548
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,932
I don't know you anymore.

549
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
I know.

550
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:52,813
Do you recall
your former neighbor Mellie?

551
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:57,379
You insisted she come along.

552
00:28:57,504 --> 00:28:59,612
I insist she be someone
who trusts you entirely.

553
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:04,015
We shan't have time
for any senate subcommittees.

554
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:07,578
What's happening?

555
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:09,580
Is this place what I think it is?

556
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,155
Are you taking it down?

557
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:16,565
We're taking it down.

558
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:18,923
And you found her?

559
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:21,335
You're Caroline.

560
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,844
He never gave up, you know.

561
00:29:24,155 --> 00:29:25,822
He never stopped looking.

562
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:26,847
I know.

563
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,103
Mr. Ambrose!

564
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:34,855
What a lovely late night surprise.

565
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:36,982
Are you surprised, Adelle?

566
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:39,265
Surprised and delighted.

567
00:29:39,615 --> 00:29:41,415
He doesn't look surprised.

568
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:43,765
He's paid not to look surprised.

569
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,460
What can I do for you?

570
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:47,685
You can go with these gentlemen.

571
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:49,950
They'll escort you
to your debriefing.

572
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:53,040
As of this moment, I'm taking over
the House and liquidating the inventory.

573
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:56,295
I beg your pardon?

574
00:29:56,485 --> 00:29:58,035
Let's not play games.

575
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:00,423
Nobody comes out of the Attic.

576
00:30:01,645 --> 00:30:03,801
There've been multiple breaches.
You're done.

577
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:06,554
- Take her.
- I don't think so.

578
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,989
Well, I guess we can agree
this carpet's done for.

579
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,257
Mr. Langton!

580
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:32,425
Bennett?

581
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,083
- Bennie?
- I can't move...

582
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,551
Move this stone!

583
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:54,226
What are you doing?

584
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,644
You were working late.
The building was attacked.

585
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:00,226
- They'll find you. You'll be fine.
- No, you can't leave me, I'm with you!

586
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:02,485
No, you're not.

587
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,612
Don't leave me!

588
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,021
Sorry, sister.

589
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:07,698
I stay, we both get nabbed.

590
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:09,617
I'm gonna make sure it's just me.

591
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,076
Don't leave me!

592
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:20,528
You're gonna bring her back.

593
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:23,756
- I don't think so.
- No, you're going to.

594
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,758
Or what, you'll hit me?

595
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,450
I considered that.

596
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:29,725
I also considered letting you go.

597
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:32,264
I don't want her back
any more than you do.

598
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,225
But the fact is, I need her.

599
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,560
I need what's in her head,
and I need you to get it.

600
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,180
I'll make you an offer.

601
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:42,066
You resurrect Caroline Farrell
long enough for me to save my friends,

602
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:44,902
and I'll let you do
anything you want to her.

603
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,780
I will hold the bitch down.

604
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:49,645
Deal?

605
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:52,117
Are you out of your mind?

606
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,395
But Ambrose is.

607
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:58,090
You think a ranking
Rossum board member

608
00:31:58,215 --> 00:32:00,584
would confine his consciousness
to a single body?

609
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:03,590
When he finds out you've killed him,
you'll be a target.

610
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,726
- How's he gonna find out?
- I'm going to tell him.

611
00:32:05,851 --> 00:32:08,001
Which is why you're going to run.

612
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:09,426
To draw their fire.

613
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,095
It is a war.

614
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:12,435
Yes, it is.

615
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:19,395
She should stay with the group.
She'll be marginally safer.

616
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:21,185
Thank you.

617
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:22,606
Thank me later.

618
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:26,115
Gary Walden.

619
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:28,665
Hey, Gare!

620
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,075
What do you know?
Term's up!

621
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:32,535
You're done!

622
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:34,665
Has it been five years?

623
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:37,475
Sure, sure.

624
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,127
Sanderson here is going to see

625
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,902
you make it back
into the real world okay.

626
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,845
Five years, huh?

627
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:49,678
So fast.

628
00:32:52,895 --> 00:32:56,345
Seems like I just got here yesterday.
You got a cigarette?

629
00:32:57,535 --> 00:32:59,185
Last Tuesday, actually.

630
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:03,445
That all of them?

631
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:04,665
One more.

632
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:15,367
You change your mind?

633
00:33:19,008 --> 00:33:21,540
Turns out Echo and I
share some common interests.

634
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,836
Give me a hand?

635
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:28,356
I'll give you both.

636
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:31,691
That wasn't a reference.

637
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:33,948
I'm going for a walk.

638
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,394
Thanks for grabbing these.

639
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,919
Where will you go?

640
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:47,107
I don't know yet.

641
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:49,632
I'll have to figure that out
on the move.

642
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:51,219
Somewhere they can't pinpoint me.

643
00:33:51,344 --> 00:33:52,988
- Where is that?
- I don't know.

644
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,698
And I wouldn't tell you if I did.

645
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,825
Echo's already in danger.
I don't want you to be.

646
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,496
It's an understatement to say
they have ways of making you talk.

647
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,123
Maybe I'll just keep moving.
I'll be okay.

648
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:07,836
You won't be able to go
to the hospital if you need it.

649
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,296
Some extra bandages.

650
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:10,791
I'm feeling fine.

651
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,843
You need these to fight off infection.
Fever is the first sign...

652
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:17,513
It's a through and through.
I'll be okay.

653
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,933
I wish we had more time.

654
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,134
I know.

655
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:29,659
I'll come back for you.

656
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,277
You understand?

657
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,224
I'll come back for you.

658
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,896
We are now officially evacuated.

659
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:45,457
I'm going to go in the back
and deal with the burn racks.

660
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,989
Take a message.

661
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,099
You're using nonlinear transformation
for all the cognitive controllers.

662
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,018
Yes, I am.

663
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:10,023
If you had a Dewey pin,
this might go a little faster.

664
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:12,773
Sure.

665
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:30,961
I'm sorry.

666
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:44,481
More of that if we prevent
the end of the world?

667
00:35:47,508 --> 00:35:49,784
You know,
I always had a crush on you.

668
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:51,857
Even when I thought you were a dude.

669
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:56,088
This is better.

670
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:09,369
He's in love with you.

671
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:11,126
I'm sorry?

672
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:17,582
I was the House doctor.

673
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:22,471
I used to be Number One.

674
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:25,221
I see.

675
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:27,703
Topher mentioned there had been...

676
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:30,813
It's nice to meet you.

677
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,190
Is that Caroline?

678
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,677
Do you really think you're going
to be able to get her back?

679
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,397
I'm confident of it.

680
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:43,867
Do you really think he likes me?

681
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:46,166
I didn't say "likes."

682
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:49,081
He's remarkable.

683
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:52,580
I honestly didn't think
he was capable

684
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:55,838
of admitting the existence
of another human being,

685
00:36:56,676 --> 00:36:58,090
let alone loving one.

686
00:36:58,878 --> 00:37:00,509
I think you're the remarkable one.

687
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:03,762
I couldn't find one, but...

688
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:25,137
Do not move.

689
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:33,435
You have much to answer for,
young woman.

690
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,633
I do?

691
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:36,908
You forced me to come to Arizona.

692
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:38,776
I loathe Arizona.

693
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:41,133
We taking her back to the House?

694
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:44,081
I don't think she's left us
with much alternative, Mr. Dominic.

695
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,339
Of course, sir.

696
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:50,976
I wouldn't dream
of keeping her from you.

697
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,995
Someone upstairs wants to meet you.

698
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,564
- Who?
- The head of the company.

699
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:03,030
You weren't invited?

700
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,323
No hard feelings.

701
00:38:05,234 --> 00:38:07,337
A trip to see our director
is generally one-way.

702
00:38:07,462 --> 00:38:08,712
Enjoy the ride.

703
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,962
Topher, I need you to focus.

704
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:23,304
Saunders did this.

705
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:24,904
Rossum got to her.

706
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:27,396
Probably months ago,
right after she left this place.

707
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:28,430
A sleeper?

708
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,641
Boyd loves her.

709
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,602
He'll have to adjust.

710
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,270
I'm going after her.

711
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:37,953
Or not.

712
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:41,944
We can bring her back.

713
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:44,321
We can bring Bennett back.
We can map...

714
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,540
There's nothing left to map.

715
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:52,148
The person who we need
to bring back now is Caroline.

716
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:53,473
Can you do it?

717
00:38:57,947 --> 00:38:58,947
Good.

718
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:14,108
I can do this.

719
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,186
I can do this.

720
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:19,272
I got it.

721
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:21,985
You get your chance, you slip out.

722
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:24,987
In the real world, you can write
your ticket anyplace you land.

723
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:28,782
I really do want to help you.

724
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,048
Then live.

725
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,882
You have a remarkable brain.

726
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:35,307
I think it should stay in your head.

727
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:39,449
Don't become me.

728
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,434
We're breached.

729
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:56,810
That's one word for it.

730
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,282
This won't do it.

731
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,368
I was loading the weapons reserve cache
up in the handlers' quarters.

732
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:15,203
Go!

733
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,419
How long?

734
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,525
This is going to take
just as long as it's...

735
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:27,632
Done.

736
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,092
Where is security?

737
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,887
Assume they're dead.
Let's do this.

738
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:35,932
Damn. I just had that replaced.

739
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:42,856
You should go.
Server room service tunnels.

740
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,191
Don't be ridiculous.

741
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,193
You're our general.
We can't lose you.

742
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,664
Good luck, all of you.

743
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:03,335
Stay back!

744
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:07,339
I've imprinted myself
with many useful skills.

745
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:08,924
You don't want to know.

746
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:22,270
Hang in there.

747
00:41:40,382 --> 00:41:41,932
Thanks for coming up.

748
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:43,416
It's terrific.

749
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:45,669
Can I get you something? Tea?

750
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:47,529
I hate tea.

751
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:51,947
So, not tea, then.

752
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:56,012
I mean... Look at you.

753
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:57,883
Caroline Farrell.

754
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:01,643
So, you're Rossum?

755
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:06,738
Rossum is just a name, actually.

756
00:42:06,863 --> 00:42:07,983
From a play.

757
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:11,876
Although, technically,
you're not robots, it seemed to fit.

758
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,240
Sorry. Clyde.

759
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:16,836
Clyde Randolph.

760
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,668
The second.

761
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:20,396
Well, like the fifth, actually.

762
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:22,038
I use a lot of bodies.

763
00:42:22,772 --> 00:42:24,002
I'll explain that later.

764
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,920
My partner and I have been
quite eager to meet you.

765
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:28,288
Why me?

766
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,069
Because you're very special.

767
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:34,217
You're going to help us
in ways you can't understand.

768
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:36,611
Not likely.

769
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:38,900
You don't have a lot of options.

770
00:42:39,843 --> 00:42:41,827
So I'm going to be
one of your zombies?

771
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:44,102
Open up my brain
like the rest of them?

772
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:48,564
You'll never be like the rest of them.
You won't be harmed in any way.

773
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:51,016
You're far too valuable.

774
00:42:51,141 --> 00:42:53,091
And I'm just gonna trust you?

775
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,780
With your life.
