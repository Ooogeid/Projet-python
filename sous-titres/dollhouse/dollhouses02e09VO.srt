1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,250
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:03,512
I want the real you.

3
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,337
And I want the real you.

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,091
Sometimes I think you're the most real
person I've ever met.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,718
Echo's not a blank slate.
She's a person.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,475
Everything you've imprinted her with
for the last six months is still there.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,891
What does that make her?

8
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:21,716
Miss Lonely Hearts.

9
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:26,149
Everyone likes to take something home
from the office once in a while,

10
00:00:26,507 --> 00:00:28,401
but he's the least
of your indiscretions.

11
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,644
I think they're trying to build
a portable device

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,408
that will be able to imprint anyone.

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,579
- They're grouping, aren't they?
- I sorry to say yeah.

14
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,456
Split them up in separate houses.

15
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,427
This has the potential
to change everything.

16
00:00:42,552 --> 00:00:43,833
I suspected as much.

17
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:45,378
You did the right thing.

18
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:50,461
Hurry, Sergeant! Orders!

19
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:55,213
- Shall we celebrate?
- There's no smoking in my office.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,184
When did you die?

21
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:04,657
Catherine, wait.

22
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:06,524
Darling, darling...

23
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,535
we need to talk.

24
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,153
I don't want to talk.

25
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,946
You want Roger.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840
I want to roger Roger.

27
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:15,574
Stop!

28
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,306
It would be dishonorable for me
to let this go on any farther.

29
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:27,962
There's someone else.

30
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:30,464
What do you mean?

31
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:33,233
I've fallen in love
with another woman.

32
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:35,989
Don't tease me.
That's patently impossible.

33
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:38,714
I'm afraid,
I'm afraid I'm quite serious.

34
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,189
So where did you meet
this other woman?

35
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:51,026
On one of your international
jet-setting trips?

36
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,004
The flat in London.

37
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:57,392
The condo in Rome.

38
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:01,586
Who do you think designs your life
when you're not with me?

39
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,999
I'm having a hard time
figuring it out for myself.

40
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:08,121
It's as if I met this woman
in a previous life,

41
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:10,683
as though our love transcends
our very being.

42
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:11,808
Come on.

43
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,433
You're not real.

44
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:15,508
You're a Doll.

45
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:19,377
One whose contract is up, and I was just
getting in one last go-round

46
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:21,973
before they release
your body into the wild.

47
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:25,936
And if anyone should be
getting upset, Roger,

48
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,261
it's you,

49
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:30,316
'cause this time tomorrow,
you're not going to exist anymore.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,528
Catherine, I'm sorry,
I know you're upset,

51
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,496
but don't make up stories.

52
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,746
I don't believe for a second
you'd ever stoop to the level

53
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:47,333
of those pathetic souls who have to hire
your programmable love dolls

54
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:50,143
to get what they need.

55
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,919
Do you see what I see?

56
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,384
- I don't see anything.
- Exactly.

57
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,639
There's nothing left
in Ballard's head.

58
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,384
Alpha scrubbed him clean.

59
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,625
Even if I could make the chair
work on someone

60
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,516
without Active architecture,

61
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:11,135
I'd be lucky if I could make
him walk in a straight line.

62
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,011
But he's stable, physically?

63
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:14,510
As a zucchini,

64
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:17,696
which is what he's gonna be
for the rest of his life.

65
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:20,406
Now my brain is starting
to feel like his.

66
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,234
Get some rest.
I'll deliver the news to Echo.

67
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,123
Another woman, Mr. Brink?

68
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:28,967
What?

69
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:33,629
- You're the only one here.
- Who else is in on this practical joke?

70
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:35,589
Boyd, Ivy?

71
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,233
If it was funny,
I want to take credit for it.

72
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:41,512
I don't think this was funny.

73
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,830
Miss Lonely Hearts was dumped
by Roger this evening.

74
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,895
Are you sure the dementia
hasn't got into her?

75
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,320
Stop being cute!

76
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,665
How long have you known
the identity of Miss Lonely Hearts?

77
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:55,519
You?

78
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,157
Oh, my God!

79
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:01,072
What have I said to you about her?

80
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:04,117
Octogenarian, walker jokes,

81
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,787
the thing
about the early bird special?

82
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:08,851
I didn't know.

83
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:13,961
If you didn't alter the imprint,
I want to know who did.

84
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:17,649
Roger came back early.

85
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:20,467
He didn't say why it ended,
but my money's on a broken hip.

86
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,274
What?

87
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,521
She definitely didn't do it.

88
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,560
It wasn't on our end.
Roger's parameters

89
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,278
were exactly as you, she...

90
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:34,229
She requested.

91
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:38,631
So where did the mystery woman
come from?

92
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:42,364
Has anyone seen Sierra?

93
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:46,316
Look on the bright side.
Roger didn't reject you.

94
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:47,691
No, Victor did.

95
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,468
It's just grouping,

96
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:52,145
which won't be a problem
after we set him free tomorrow.

97
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,459
Just make sure this doesn't happen
with any other Actives.

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,723
Clients can't being rejected by Dolls
who are programmed to love them.

99
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,348
Yeah, we're lucky
this happened to you.

100
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,571
If anyone finds out about this,

101
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:08,011
you won't be so lucky.

102
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:24,634
I don't think that's a smart idea.

103
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,749
DeWitt's watching you.

104
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,038
If you upset her,
you're gonna end up in isolation again.

105
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:32,105
Or worse.

106
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,853
I haven't seen Paul
since they stabilized him.

107
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:38,293
- What if I don't get to see him again?
- That's not gonna happen.

108
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:40,908
Topher's working every angle.

109
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,841
Say good-bye to Victor.

110
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,469
His contract ends first
thing in the morning.

111
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:47,420
I thought you'd be glad.

112
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:49,657
I was gonna
use him to help me get everyone out.

113
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,559
He's already been used for five years.
You'll manage without him.

114
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,099
Everything's slipping away from me.

115
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:57,940
Before, it was memories,
but I figured out how to hold onto them.

116
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,067
And now that I have
something real...

117
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,778
people I care about...
they're slipping away from me, too.

118
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:07,282
I'll talk to DeWitt about Paul.
Maybe she'll change her mind.

119
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:09,971
Absolutely not.

120
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,973
Paul Ballard is brain-dead
because of Echo.

121
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:15,457
Funny, I thought he had Alpha
to thank for that.

122
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:18,544
It's all of a piece.
Echo brought Alpha to the house.

123
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:20,973
She made him jealous.

124
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,840
It all starts with Echo.

125
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:25,009
- You got it all figured out.
- Hardly.

126
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:28,476
I still want to know what's going on
in that very special brain of hers.

127
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,514
She's not a blank slate anymore.
She's a person

128
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:31,788
like you or me.

129
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:33,976
And keeping her away from Ballard
is killing her.

130
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,494
- Perfect.
- You want her to suffer.

131
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:39,023
Pain reveals who you really are.

132
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:40,983
Let's see who this girl really is.

133
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:44,729
Are all the arrangements
for Victor's release finalized?

134
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,108
Everything's set.

135
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,450
Would you mind handling
the final paperwork for me?

136
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,203
Usually, you handle Active releases.

137
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:56,040
I thought it gave you
a sense of satisfaction

138
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,934
- seeing them through.
- When I've recruited them.

139
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,120
Victor was assigned to this house.

140
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:05,435
He wouldn't know me from you.

141
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:10,524
I saved my strawberries for you.

142
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:12,361
They're my favorite.

143
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,977
Victor, it's time
for your treatment.

144
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,737
Will you sit with me at dinner?

145
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:23,312
That would be nice.

146
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:27,070
You're not coming back.

147
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:29,740
When you get out of that chair,
you'll have your original personality.

148
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,012
You need to say good-bye to her.

149
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:35,329
If you don't get a chance
to say goobye, you'll regret it.

150
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:41,418
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye. I'll see you at dinner.

151
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:51,553
Afghanistan war vet, severe PTSD,

152
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:52,994
which we cured.

153
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:56,288
This one actually makes
me feel good about myself.

154
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:59,181
The last thing
he remembers is reclining in that chair

155
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:00,811
five years ago as I explained

156
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:02,898
to him the last thing
he would remember

157
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,419
is reclining in the chair.

158
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:07,944
I was probably standing
right... here.

159
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,156
Did it not work?
Did something go wrong?

160
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,023
You were not just standing there.

161
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,789
And you were wearing
different clothes.

162
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,332
Well, not that different.

163
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:23,867
- What did I just tell you?
- That five years would seem like...

164
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,378
five seconds.

165
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:27,451
Welcome to the future

166
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:30,508
where cars fly, robots
serve our every whim

167
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,548
and genetically engineered
dinosaurs rule the Earth.

168
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:36,807
It's pretty much the same
as when you left.

169
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,142
And the war?

170
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,269
- Is it...?
- It's still going on.

171
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:43,346
So that's it.

172
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:46,024
Five years just like that.

173
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,008
It wasn't just like that.

174
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:51,238
Right. Five years
I don't even remember.

175
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:53,972
I don't know.

176
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,368
It almost seems too easy.

177
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:59,332
We've set up a trust fund
in your name.

178
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:02,708
Reserved a suite at the Hyperion
until you find something more permanent.

179
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:06,587
Found several employment opportunities
should you choose to work.

180
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,514
If people ask,

181
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,762
you spent the last five years
at a VA hospital

182
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,676
as part of an experimental program

183
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,939
that treats veterans
for post-traumatic stress.

184
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,181
We've created a paper trail
to verify your story.

185
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,115
For the first 3 months,

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,978
you'll come into the Dollhouse
on a bi-weekly basis for a diagnostic.

187
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:24,704
For a year following that,

188
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:27,284
we'll send a representative
into the field to check on you.

189
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:31,077
If you have any problems,
you can call us 24 hours a day.

190
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,268
But I don't expect any trouble.

191
00:09:34,393 --> 00:09:37,664
This entire process was designed
so you can slip into your old life

192
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,889
without realizing you were gone.

193
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,158
Congratulations, Mr. Ceccoli,

194
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,045
you're a free man.

195
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:09,483
Episode 209: <i>Stop-Loss</i>

196
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,386
www.subbercafe.fr

197
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,041
<i>With an increase in troop numbers,</i>

198
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,710
<i>U.S. military forces begin</i>

199
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:18,855
<i>a new offensive against insurgents</i>

200
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,179
<i>in the southern regions
of Afghanistan.</i>

201
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:24,016
<i>Reports coming out of Kandahar</i>

202
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,893
<i>indicate that two more regions
had been secured.</i>

203
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:06,678
- How long he you been sitting here?
- I'm waiting for Victor.

204
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:08,884
We're going to have dinner together.

205
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,493
Victor's not coming back.

206
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,280
But he always comes back
from his treatments.

207
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,739
This time he isn't.

208
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:23,962
He left. For good.

209
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:26,621
He wouldn't leave me.

210
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,456
He's free.
They gave his life back to him.

211
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,447
But you're not happy for him.

212
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:37,086
I needed him.

213
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,550
I thought he could help me
get everyone out.

214
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sad, too...

215
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:45,367
but not for us, for him.

216
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,788
He's not ready to be by himself.

217
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,375
Excuse me.

218
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:20,532
Have we met before?

219
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,957
- Where's Paul?
- He's not dead...

220
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,785
- if that's what you're thinking.
- What did you do to him?

221
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:14,984
Mr. Ballard...

222
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:18,786
has been moved
to a more secure location,

223
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:22,003
one where your illicit key card
will be of no use.

224
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,150
No need to fret.

225
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:28,538
He's receiving top-notch care.

226
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:33,238
Do you think that anything goes on
in my house without my knowledge?

227
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:37,792
I don't know, it seems like
a lot went down without you knowing.

228
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:43,624
Well, I'm not surprised that Paul...

229
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,712
and Boyd managed to keep
your secret from me,

230
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:47,887
but Topher?

231
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:51,866
He can barely keep
a belch to himself.

232
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:56,899
Come on, don't be rude...
it's just a friendly chat.

233
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:58,760
You really want to do this?

234
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:00,685
Pretend that we're equals?

235
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:02,615
- Go toe to toe?
- Why?

236
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:04,920
You having trouble keeping up?

237
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,670
You think I'm scared of you?

238
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,764
I have a serial killer in my head.

239
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,639
Yes, if memory serves me,

240
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:13,221
one that's petrified of women.

241
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:18,095
All those people in your head,
I know their deepest, darkest secrets.

242
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:21,104
You're forgetting who put them there
in the first place.

243
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:23,607
So now you're trying to take credit
for making me?

244
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,315
You didn't make me.
I made me.

245
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:30,990
You may think all these people
knocking around in my head are useless,

246
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,241
but that's 40 more brains
than you have.

247
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,175
So I think we can agree
that I'm smarter, tougher,

248
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,123
and a whole lot scarier
than you could ever hope to be.

249
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,015
If you're so powerful,

250
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,394
why are you still in my house
sneaking around,

251
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,570
trying to find
your comatose boyfriend?

252
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:51,760
Lady, if I wanted to be
somewhere else, I would be.

253
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,740
But there's work to do here.

254
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:56,442
Now, you can be on my side
or you can be on Rossum's,

255
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,017
but the time
for playing both is over.

256
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,170
Protocol says
I maintain a Doll's biolinks

257
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,930
for 90 days
after they leave the house

258
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:22,330
to monitor the reintegration
of their original neural topography.

259
00:18:22,455 --> 00:18:24,769
- That's Victor's readout?
- Was Victor's readout.

260
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,395
At 1:53 AM last night,
his biolinks went kaput,

261
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,816
as in no signal.

262
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,693
I can't even raise his GPS.

263
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,490
I'll send a van to bring him in.

264
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:37,073
Those aren't "I'll send a van to bring
him in for a diagnostic" squigglies.

265
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:40,035
They're "fight for your life"
squigglies.

266
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:42,365
I'm on my way.

267
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,525
I need your help.

268
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,645
- All clear.
- Same here.

269
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,335
Ready to process the room?

270
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:16,196
You want FBI, private investigator,
or should I surprise you?

271
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:18,860
So, how exactly does this work,

272
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:21,185
you accessing other personalities?

273
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:24,218
I used to have to make an effort
to switch between imprints,

274
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:26,683
but now I can slip back and forth
without even thinking.

275
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:28,083
Who am I talking to now?

276
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,327
You're always talking to Echo.

277
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,497
But Roma Klar and Eleanor Penn
are duking it out in the background

278
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:36,610
over who gets to help me
figure this one out.

279
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,535
I'll take all the help I can get.

280
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:42,055
They came through the front door.

281
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,848
No sign of a struggle.

282
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:48,561
And they left the place pretty clean.
Whoever did this, they're professionals.

283
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:50,445
It was an inside job.

284
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,273
You see a clue I don't?

285
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,810
Victor's been out of the house,
what, less than 24 hours.

286
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:57,850
Which isn't enough time
to be on anyone's radar.

287
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:01,860
And they knew enough about our tech
to deactivate his biolinks and GPS.

288
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:04,285
Looks like
you're working on a theory.

289
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,005
Who the hell are you, huh?

290
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:11,130
Somebody better say something!

291
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:14,116
Anthony Ceccoli, sergeant,
Third Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment...

292
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:15,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's me.

293
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:17,520
Who are you?
What do you want?

294
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,895
We apologize for our methods,
but they were necessary.

295
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:22,645
Hagan?

296
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:25,890
- You got transferred to the 160th.
- We all got transferred.

297
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,960
The military called us
broken soldiers,

298
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:31,080
didn't know what to do with us,
so they packed us away for five years.

299
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:34,774
- If you tell your commanding officer...
- We don't follow traditional structure.

300
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,515
Officially, we're not a part
of the United States armed forces.

301
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,690
No kidding.

302
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:42,480
- Why'd you bring me here?
- Military was supposed to fix us.

303
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,140
They took away the pain,

304
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:46,870
the fear, the shame,
but they left us empty.

305
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:49,020
Do you know why?

306
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:51,958
'Cause we're soldiers.
We need something to fight for.

307
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:54,544
We can give you something
to fight for.

308
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:57,945
You want me to be a soldier.

309
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:01,565
Where do I sign up?

310
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,765
Victor's file was accessed
three months ago,

311
00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:11,059
with continued break-ins
leading up to his release.

312
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:13,945
Someone was making sure
he was still on schedule.

313
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:15,815
Can you run a back-trace?

314
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:23,990
It's a Rossum server.
Defense-grade firewall.

315
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:26,205
Can you hack into it?

316
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,619
Someone in here can.

317
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:43,343
That's just for immunizations,
right?

318
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:46,930
It'll be easier for us to explain
after we put this in.

319
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,726
You'll never be alone again.

320
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:26,094
Have you ever heard of Scytheon?

321
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,507
It's Rossum's military contracting wing,
their answer to Blackwater.

322
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,391
They're the ones
who kidnapped Victor.

323
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,306
They've got a dossier on him.
Personal history, military records,

324
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:36,980
Dollhouse engagements.
They've got it all.

325
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,052
He's been placed
in a classified program,

326
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:40,927
code named: Mind Whisper.

327
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:44,654
It's being operated out of a bunker
on the California/Nevada border.

328
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,265
According to this,

329
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,950
Mind Whisper has recruited
dozens of ex-Actives.

330
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:53,162
The Active architecture allows
their minds to blinked via neural radio.

331
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:55,081
They hear what everyone thinks,

332
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:57,195
see what everyone sees.

333
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,437
Rossum's building an army.

334
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,205
They kidnapped Victor.

335
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:21,485
Rossum's building an army?

336
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:26,255
Remember what happened last time

337
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,669
we poked our noses
where they didn't belong.

338
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:33,661
We failed and I nearly lost control
of the House or something like that.

339
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,122
I'm giving you a chance
to help Victor.

340
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,600
They've turned him
into some kind of soldier.

341
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,275
That's what he wants.

342
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:43,715
And isn't that why
we're in business?

343
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:47,025
To give people what they want?

344
00:23:57,455 --> 00:23:58,655
Neural radios?

345
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:02,969
That's the short-bus version
of this tech.

346
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:04,544
What's the endgame?

347
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,019
Groupthink.

348
00:24:08,144 --> 00:24:10,447
And not the bad kind
that gave us the Bay of Pigs;

349
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:11,449
this would be

350
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,168
the much badder kind.

351
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,060
Multiple minds thinking as one.

352
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,544
Imagine war minus the individual.

353
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:27,278
He's thinking
about one single thing: the objective.

354
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:30,384
Soldiers who won't stop fighting
until they've accomplished the mission.

355
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,974
Once you're absorbed in the group mind,
the individual ceases to exist.

356
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,681
If we don't rescue Victor

357
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,850
before he's fully integrated
into the group mind,

358
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:40,397
we lose him for good.

359
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:58,468
This wasn't on the schedule.

360
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:01,457
Load me up.
We're going to war.

361
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:11,761
I got what I need.
Keep them coming.

362
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:16,139
Field medic, advanced triage,
and it comes with a Texas twang.

363
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,034
Have anything else
that might be useful?

364
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,347
- Why didn't you let me in on this?
- You were on a need-to-know basis.

365
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:23,118
Need-to-know or need-to-fetch?

366
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:24,903
The Flying Cardona Brothers?

367
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:28,109
She's breaking into
an underground bunker, not the Big Top.

368
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,128
No, acrobatics makes sense.

369
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:34,031
You want Enrique or Ernesto?

370
00:25:34,764 --> 00:25:35,764
Ernesto.

371
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:37,387
My choice, too.

372
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,495
DeWitt's out cold.

373
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,565
We got at least half the day.

374
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:45,376
After we're done here,
can I go to her office with a Sharpie?

375
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,677
You've been downloaded with
everything from basic G.I. Jane

376
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:52,509
to nuclear physicist weapons maker

377
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:54,963
who secretly yearns
for nuclear disarmament.

378
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:56,512
Did everything take?

379
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:01,371
Locked and loaded.

380
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,825
But I need one more thing
to pull this off.

381
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,105
All I have left
is naughty pirate wench.

382
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,997
You promised me
I wouldn't remember that day!

383
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:25,022
You told me I could skip it!

384
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,752
- Calm down.
- Why? I don't want to remember Nolan!

385
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:29,837
I don't want to remember any of it.

386
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,506
Get her a beer.

387
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,133
I couldn't delete that day,
because then you wouldn't remember him.

388
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,135
I don't want to remember Nolan.

389
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,304
Not Nolan.

390
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:40,515
I couldn't delete that day
because you wouldn't remember Victor.

391
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:44,852
Before I wiped you,
you told me you knew.

392
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,605
You saw Victor
and you told me you knew.

393
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,191
That I loved him?

394
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:51,457
Exactly.

395
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,198
Why?

396
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:00,434
What's going on?

397
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:05,927
His name's Anthony now.

398
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:10,456
If he's started to lose his identity,
you're our best shot at pulling him out.

399
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,754
Has Victor...

400
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:14,959
I mean, Anthony, ever met me?

401
00:27:15,296 --> 00:27:16,296
As Priya?

402
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:18,153
He's met Sierra.

403
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,838
Think Priya with all the complications
stripped away.

404
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:25,019
So why not just send me as her?

405
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,479
Because you'd still be figuring out
how to buckle your seatbelt.

406
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:44,437
How do we get in?

407
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,126
We get caught.

408
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:56,512
I just lost Echo's GPS.

409
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:57,925
They're inside the bunker.

410
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,552
You really think we'll be able

411
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,263
to pull this off
without Cruella DeWitt finding out?

412
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,459
Don't piss off a blind girl.

413
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:35,296
Now we just need to make sure
Anthony sees me.

414
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,858
He's already seen you.

415
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,667
One of them sees us,
they all see us.

416
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:39,792
Come on.

417
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:43,466
So he'll come to us?

418
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:44,641
Eventually.

419
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:46,694
Stay right there.

420
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:02,557
I'm so glad it's you.

421
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:07,308
Anthony's gone.

422
00:29:11,998 --> 00:29:14,794
Anthony's gone, but what about Victor?
I know he's in there.

423
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,988
You're trying to confuse us.

424
00:29:17,113 --> 00:29:18,881
You're not gonna confuse us.

425
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,077
Victor remembers me.

426
00:29:25,202 --> 00:29:27,348
He couldn't forget; I didn't forget.

427
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:31,560
Anthony, lower your weapon.

428
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:35,219
They don't want me to remember.

429
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:39,504
<i>Eliminate target. </i>

430
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:40,861
They want me to kill you.

431
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,566
<i>Eliminate hostile target. </i>

432
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,926
I remember.

433
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,809
Are you in control?

434
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:02,023
If she's here,
it helps me to remember.

435
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,514
It helps me to stay focused.

436
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:07,847
They're not happy.

437
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:10,278
What's the fastest way out of here?

438
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:13,209
If we follow
the electrical conduits,

439
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:14,979
it'll lead to a service tunnel.

440
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:16,981
There's a utility hatch at the end.

441
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,899
Then that's where we're going.

442
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,652
You take the lead.
I'll bring up the rear. Got it?

443
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,574
- You hit him. Why'd you hit him?
- He's still connected.

444
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:28,915
Anything we tell him, they hear.

445
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,746
Now half the squad's headed
for that service tunnel.

446
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:34,637
In five minutes, they'll realize
they went the wrong direction.

447
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:36,083
What is the right direction?

448
00:30:36,363 --> 00:30:39,712
I'm gonna figure out a way
to change the group mind's orders.

449
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:42,840
You're gonna hold down the hallway.

450
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,464
You know how to fire a gun?

451
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:47,094
My grandfather took me hunting
in Gippsland once.

452
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,596
So you know how this works?

453
00:30:49,154 --> 00:30:52,016
Why, I shot at rabbits.
I didn't hit anything.

454
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,196
Same idea, just bigger targets.

455
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:07,626
Judith!

456
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:11,872
Judith, can you get that?

457
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:21,374
What is it?

458
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:24,393
Yes, Mr. Harding.

459
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:25,685
Of course I am aware

460
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,434
that two of my Actives
are on an engagement.

461
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,014
What sort of House
do you think I run?

462
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,826
No, I wasn't aware
that it is a Rossum training facility.

463
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,072
Of course.
I will have them recalled immediately.

464
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:58,332
They're not in control.
I'm in control.

465
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,100
But they can hear you.

466
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:01,710
And I can hear them.

467
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,621
It's a tactical advantage.
I know every move they're gonna make.

468
00:32:04,746 --> 00:32:06,006
<i>Target's acquired. </i>

469
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,238
There's two soldiers,
A-team formation.

470
00:32:15,363 --> 00:32:17,961
XM8 assault rifles,
MK23s and flash grenades.

471
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,723
They're about to make
an offensive move.

472
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,439
I'm Anthony, by the way.
You can call me Tony.

473
00:32:24,248 --> 00:32:25,598
Nice to meet you.

474
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:31,686
So you're from Australia?

475
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:34,451
Maybe we should save the small talk
till after the gunfight.

476
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:35,776
No, it's good.

477
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:38,825
The more I can remember
about me... us,

478
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:42,001
the easier it is for me
to keep them out.

479
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:48,802
You sent Echo and Sierra
to retrieve Victor.

480
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:54,135
- Someone had to make the call.
- I ordered you to leave it alone!

481
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,584
I was hoping you wouldn't
remember that conversation.

482
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,394
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that you're a drunk.

483
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,230
You're obsesd with keeping Echo
under your thumb.

484
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:06,006
And you'll do anything you can
to keep Harding smiling.

485
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:07,481
We may not have agreed,

486
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:10,113
but at least we put this house
and the Actives first.

487
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:12,299
What happened to that woman?

488
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:17,053
She's standing in front of you.

489
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,370
No, she's not.

490
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:21,227
If you don't find her soon,
you're gonna lose control of this House,

491
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:23,250
and I'll be the one
knocking down your door.

492
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,882
I hope it doesn't
come to that, Mr. Langton.

493
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:13,249
Your elevation's off.
You keep going high right.

494
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,928
I'm not hitting anything,
if that's what you mean.

495
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:17,721
And I don't plan to.

496
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:21,517
Okay, come on. We got to go.

497
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:26,602
You don't want to shoot!

498
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,838
Remember five years ago?
Outside Qalat?

499
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:30,718
It wasn't that much different
than this.

500
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:33,743
We fought side by side.
Not against each other.

501
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,456
Think about it!

502
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:39,495
I will shoot you if I have to.

503
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:50,157
Hurry.

504
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,239
<i>Group mind disengaged.
Eliminate.</i>

505
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,553
Keep it together.

506
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:03,064
For me.

507
00:35:58,006 --> 00:35:59,631
We just got company.

508
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:00,808
A whole lot.

509
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,262
Where? I don't see any others.

510
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:05,496
She's inside.

511
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:14,453
I knew you were going to do that.

512
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,216
And you knew I was going to do that.

513
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,027
Only four? I'm hurt.

514
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,276
<i>Disengage targets.</i>

515
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,403
<i>Eliminate target.</i>

516
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,864
<i>Disengage target. Stand down.</i>

517
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,976
<i>Eliminate target. Fire.</i>

518
00:37:00,497 --> 00:37:01,597
Echo's down.

519
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:04,457
We're alone.

520
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:07,268
We're on our own.

521
00:37:22,624 --> 00:37:23,824
What happened?

522
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:25,367
They missed.

523
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:32,986
Echo changed their marching orders.

524
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:35,523
What did she tell them to do?

525
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:37,118
Go home.

526
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:44,386
Favorite breakfast food?

527
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,096
Pancakes with strawberries.

528
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,002
We really have lived another life
with each other.

529
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:50,727
Or just had breakfast.

530
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:54,436
I can feel the rest of it
just beneath the surface.

531
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:57,376
I wonder if we'll ever
remember everything.

532
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:59,201
I mean, really remember.

533
00:37:59,385 --> 00:38:00,552
It doesn't matter.

534
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:03,956
I wouldn't mind discovering
all these little things about you again.

535
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,769
Do you think
that was our first kiss?

536
00:38:20,376 --> 00:38:21,173
Out.

537
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:24,259
We're in the middle of the desert.

538
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,514
Out of the car.

539
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,638
I don't have to explain it to you.
Take her and go.

540
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,354
Guys, we don't all have radios
in our head.

541
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:33,903
I can't take you back
to the Dollhouse.

542
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:37,217
You have your original personalities.
You found each other.

543
00:38:37,628 --> 00:38:40,567
You should leave.
Start your life together now.

544
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,403
There's no reason to wait
until I free everyone else.

545
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,253
There are GPS chips
implanted in your bodies.

546
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:47,783
Find them. Cut them out.

547
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,662
- You need our help.
- She's not going to change her mind.

548
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:54,498
There's enough traffic on the main road.
Someone will pick you up.

549
00:38:55,538 --> 00:38:57,038
I don't need thanks.

550
00:38:57,595 --> 00:38:58,794
I don't need good-byes.

551
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:05,161
Do us a favor and look us up
after you get everyone out.

552
00:39:06,574 --> 00:39:09,574
If I get everyone out,
you'll have to look me up.

553
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:11,213
Caroline F...

554
00:39:23,037 --> 00:39:24,421
You can't do this to her!

555
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:25,894
Really, Mr. Langton,

556
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:28,863
I think you were bonded to Echo,
not the other way around.

557
00:39:28,988 --> 00:39:31,638
This is going to blow up
in all our faces.

558
00:39:37,304 --> 00:39:38,659
All of Rossum is chattering

559
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:41,962
about how you single-handedly
defeated an entire army.

560
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:44,631
Harding was so impressed
by your performance,

561
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,758
he's devising ways
to turn you into a weapon.

562
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:50,654
- We know whose side you came down on.
- I told him you're far too dangerous.

563
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:52,848
There's no way to control you.

564
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,351
But you're still going
to hand me over to him?

565
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:59,379
You've disrupted
countless engagements.

566
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:01,371
Brought Alpha into my House.

567
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:02,546
Deceived me

568
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,502
with the help of Paul Ballard.

569
00:40:04,707 --> 00:40:07,674
Dragged Topher and Boyd
into the fun.

570
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,281
And now Victor and Sierra.

571
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:11,241
You leave a wake of destruction

572
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,710
wherever you go.

573
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:18,290
There is only one place for a Doll
as irreparably damaged as you.

574
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:23,444
The Attic.

575
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,133
They say it's
whatever hell you imagine,

576
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:31,595
but I think it's
something far worse.

577
00:40:35,635 --> 00:40:37,869
She shouldn't be able to do that.

578
00:40:38,878 --> 00:40:40,678
Welcome to the conspiracy.

579
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:43,410
Can I go back
to getting you juice boxes?

580
00:40:43,603 --> 00:40:45,003
What's the holdup?

581
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:51,907
Neuromods set
for chemical saturation.

582
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:54,625
LTP depotentiated.

583
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:56,629
Transmag primed.

584
00:40:57,751 --> 00:40:58,948
We're ready.

585
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:01,833
There has to be another
way to deal with this.

586
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:05,045
If you don't want to do this, I
can find someone else who does.

587
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:08,173
Even if it means imprinting someone else
with your personality.

588
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:23,748
I'm sorry.

589
00:41:50,814 --> 00:41:52,664
Send her body to the Attic.

590
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,919
Then do the same
to Victor and Sierra.
