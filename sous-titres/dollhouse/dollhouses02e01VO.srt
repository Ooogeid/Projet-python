1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,820
Big day.

2
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:05,823
Is it?

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,423
Trust me.

4
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,474
With my life.

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,949
We're okay, right?

6
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:15,956
- She's not going to...?
- Glitch?

7
00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:17,950
She's fine, Agent Ballard.

8
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,778
Sorry, Mr. Ballard.

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,663
39 personalities
all wiped clean away.

10
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:28,156
If she acts funny,
her handler tells me.

11
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:31,016
I just know this one's
been long-term, and today...

12
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:33,143
Was definitely one for the books.

13
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,743
But this is the Dollhouse, frenemy,

14
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,703
and nothing happens without my...

15
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,121
What the hell?

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,780
What?

17
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:44,251
Saunders.

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,703
We're okay, right?

19
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,682
You're fine.

20
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,011
She's fine.

21
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:56,869
I'm gonna go to sleep.

22
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:00,351
It's not that bad.

23
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,460
It's the last thing
she should be doing.

24
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:04,463
You're not Echo's handler,
Mr. Langton.

25
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,691
- You're head of security now.
- As head of security,

26
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,007
I'm telling you this
engagement poses a risk.

27
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:12,947
This is coming along well.

28
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,116
Thank you.

29
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:16,403
We made a deal with Paul Ballard.

30
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:17,910
Either we honor that deal,

31
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:19,439
or he exposes us,

32
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,164
or I order you to do something...

33
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:23,529
extreme.

34
00:01:24,093 --> 00:01:27,591
I'd like to avoid the latter two.
I have plans for the erstwhile agent.

35
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:28,920
You're touching my face.

36
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:31,034
Move along.

37
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,246
He hunted the Dollhouse for months.

38
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:35,593
The Bureau kicks him out
and you think that just flips him?

39
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:36,804
He's one of us now?

40
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:39,569
No, I expect he's looking
for something else...

41
00:01:39,694 --> 00:01:42,821
a darker purpose perhaps,
or a weakness.

42
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,282
And there's his extreme
devotion to Echo.

43
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:48,033
So he uses her
to fulfill some sad fantasy

44
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,975
about righting old wrongs
by doing something worse.

45
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,836
Why in particular does
this engagement bother you?

46
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,662
After that news anchor...

47
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:57,785
Which one?

48
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,079
The one who wanted to be rolled
in eggs and flour and dipped.

49
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:02,973
Tempura Joe.

50
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:05,101
Such a lonely soul.

51
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,900
I thought I'd seen it all,
but this engagement...

52
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,167
Honestly, this one's sick.

53
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,844
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

54
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:33,527
to join this man and this woman...

55
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:01,762
Épisode 201: <i>Vows</i>
v. 1.00

56
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:03,544
www.subbercafe.fr

57
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:29,573
Do you want to know what I've been doing
while you overslept?

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,294
If you tweaked an imprint,
I'll throw you through that window.

59
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:36,799
I'm just moving things along.
We are backed up like LAX at Christmas.

60
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,296
It's the autumn rush.

61
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,680
Temperatures plummet
to the high 60's.

62
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,766
The leaves fall off
that one tree on Wilshire.

63
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,201
People need comfort.

64
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:50,943
What's up with you?

65
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,893
If you little worker bees
aren't too busy,

66
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,579
I was promised a treatment.

67
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:57,028
Sierra.

68
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,447
- Nobody called down.
- I can't have the other one?

69
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:03,576
The man one?

70
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,128
I need caffeine.

71
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,146
Ivy?

72
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:09,332
I'm on it.
They didn't change you.

73
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,750
I'm not comfortable with...

74
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,169
Orientals.

75
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:16,463
It'll only take a second.

76
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:19,925
It's not a racialist issue.
It's just that...

77
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:24,054
Well, your culture's not
really the thing, is it?

78
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,329
Have a seat.

79
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:30,637
I suppose I'm at your mercy.

80
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:32,665
In fact,

81
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,927
if you were to tie me down
and spank me,

82
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:39,147
I could hardly be expected
to resist, could I?

83
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,687
I'll keep that in mind.

84
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:44,617
How many more today?

85
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,703
Well, the Jonas Brothers
are back in town.

86
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:48,972
Say no more.

87
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,107
Voracious little nippers.

88
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:54,928
Oh, my God!

89
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:57,463
Are those from the lab?

90
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,589
I don't care, just get them!

91
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,259
- That one went there!
- Come here.

92
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:04,845
I didn't know
your problem with rodents.

93
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,305
Clearly somebody knew.

94
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:09,183
Come here.

95
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,646
Is this your idea of a joke?

96
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,665
You designed me, Mr. Brink.

97
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:19,552
I guess it must be
your idea of a joke.

98
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:22,655
I designed you to be
a not crazy woman!

99
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,949
You've got to stop messing with me.

100
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,701
I don't seem to be able to.

101
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,035
<i>Maybe your work's not up to par.</i>

102
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,931
My work is pristine.

103
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:37,126
If you're losing it,
that's your fault.

104
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:39,206
<i>Are you sure?</i>

105
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,820
I know what I know.

106
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,467
<i>Put the rats back in the maze,</i>

107
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:44,576
Topher,

108
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:46,762
before one of them bites you.

109
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,353
You busy?

110
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:55,623
Just...

111
00:05:56,311 --> 00:05:57,648
dealing with some vermin.

112
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:00,312
Is this about Echo again?

113
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,866
Victor.

114
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:05,272
I didn't know
if you were copied on his results.

115
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:07,992
The scars are practically gone.

116
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,663
One more surgery,
you'll never know they were there.

117
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,628
Yes, I was surprised
that Ms. DeWitt would authorize

118
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:16,625
such an expensive
process for an Active.

119
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,653
When she didn't before.

120
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,131
There's no reason
she couldn't do the same for you.

121
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:25,344
I like my scars.

122
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:27,967
They bring out my eyes.

123
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:31,590
Without my scars,
I might as well be one of them.

124
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,102
And sooner or later,
Ms. DeWitt will remember

125
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:38,097
I was a more lucrative asset
when I was.

126
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:41,275
- There's no way that I would allow it.
- DeWitt is not the type of person...

127
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,792
What if she went over your head?

128
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,021
I'm very tall.

129
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:57,958
Before you knew...

130
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,838
Before either of us knew
that I was a fake...

131
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,006
Claire.

132
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:06,045
An Active, a Doll...

133
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:09,345
When you thought
I was just a doctor,

134
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,264
you didn't care much for me.

135
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:15,430
We disagreed about things.

136
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:18,955
So should I interpret
this new concern as pity?

137
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,415
Curiosity?

138
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,425
Deviant excitement?

139
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,245
There's no judging in the Dollhouse.

140
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,324
You seem to be having a hard time.

141
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,532
My entire existence was constructed
by a sociopath in a sweater-vest.

142
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:36,288
What do you suggest I do?

143
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,315
Have dinner with me.

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,220
I think you should
get out of here for awhile.

145
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:47,091
And I'd be glad of the company.

146
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,335
I don't...

147
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,305
go out.

148
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:58,865
I'm afraid to leave this place.

149
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,075
I have a problem with crowds,

150
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,425
with...

151
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,275
people,

152
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,444
and sunlight,

153
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,030
open spaces,

154
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:12,145
noise,

155
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:14,385
pets.

156
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:21,575
For some reason,
I'm just built that way.

157
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:28,395
Every person I know
is pretty poorly constructed.

158
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:32,755
Everyone has an excuse
for not dealing.

159
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:36,155
But eventually, that's all they are.

160
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,515
Excuses.

161
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,175
What's yours?

162
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:52,385
This is Hugo.

163
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:55,534
No, the shipment
is only delayed a day.

164
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:00,945
Mr. Klar is busy today.

165
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:16,485
Roma Klar.

166
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,265
Mrs. Roma Klar.

167
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,395
I thought you were keeping
your first name.

168
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:26,535
It's unbelievable.

169
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:28,115
What?

170
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,305
I found the woman of my dreams.

171
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:36,355
You'll meet her later tonight.
She's lovely.

172
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,225
I found the thing
that everyone spends their lives

173
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,900
thinking they're gonna find,
but grieving that they haven't.

174
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,295
She's in my arms.
She's mine for life.

175
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:52,325
And all I can think is...

176
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:54,925
I'm gonna step on her feet.

177
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,513
I'm practically paralyzed.

178
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:00,078
We should have taken those lessons.

179
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:02,900
I don't wanna have a wedding story
where I step all over your feet.

180
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,269
It'd relieve the pressure.

181
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:07,735
Seriously, these heels are insane.

182
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:10,265
Take them off.

183
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:12,145
When it's time.

184
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,205
It's time. It's past time.

185
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,145
Can I wish everyone away?

186
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:19,905
No, it's my wedding day.

187
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,575
And I never want it to end...

188
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:26,245
until my wedding night.

189
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:50,285
Hey, partner.

190
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,345
How was last night? You okay?

191
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:54,835
I'm so sore.

192
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,375
My feet, perv.

193
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,678
Why do people get married
in frickin' stilettos?

194
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,625
Go on. Work for a living.

195
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,585
How about Klar?

196
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,320
He said, "I do".

197
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:11,935
I heard that part.

198
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,190
Did you cry?

199
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,225
Little tear, one eye?

200
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:19,205
Geez, what is with you?

201
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,210
The biggest arms dealer on the coast
just plighted his troth to me.

202
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:25,908
For five years, the Bureau couldn't get
his cousin's dog walker

203
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,393
to give them the time of day.
Now I'm the Missus.

204
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,582
Five years ago,
I still cared about due process.

205
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:34,580
The Bureau's going to coo like doves
when we give them Martin Klar.

206
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:36,855
Then we sneak off into the night.

207
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,730
Forget we were ever here.

208
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,585
Is this about the sex?

209
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,625
I know, for you,

210
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:51,561
the act of love is the most intimate
and precious thing two people can share.

211
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:54,356
But it's just bodies. It's useful.

212
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:57,415
And with Klar, it's pretty damn fun.

213
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,946
- Man's got a work ethic.
- I think you might be a demon.

214
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:02,295
I'm justice.

215
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,430
I'm blind when I need to be blind.

216
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:06,660
Well, you're inside now,
so open your eyes.

217
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:07,975
I have.

218
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,355
This is Martin Klar, okay?

219
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:13,166
I can't even get him to tell me
where the honeymoon is.

220
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,217
There's not gonna be any honeymoon.

221
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:17,879
I do this till it's done.

222
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,980
I mean, there's no movement
from suppliers?

223
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,719
All the small arms guys we knew
are accounted for or out of the game.

224
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,310
I still think Klar
is moving something new.

225
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,180
Well, we know Pavel Hund
is in the market for dirty bombs.

226
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:32,894
- They were really thick in the '90s.
- That was AKs, not plutonium.

227
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,625
Klar wouldn't touch
something that hot.

228
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,950
He married me.

229
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:40,485
How long have we been partners?

230
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,506
Three years.

231
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,383
Have I ever said I'm sure
and been wrong?

232
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:50,115
I'm guessing not.

233
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:51,755
Trust me.

234
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,670
Everything we've worked for
happens now.

235
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:55,750
Not quite yet.

236
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:59,045
Not until you've had your treatment.

237
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,465
- Wait.
- No. A treatment sounds great.

238
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,830
- I need her.
- Her protocol says she comes in.

239
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:07,554
Long-term engagements are tricky.

240
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:09,723
Got to check the wiring.

241
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,475
And the plumbing.

242
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:14,795
I want Echo back
as soon as she's checked out.

243
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:17,485
You're the client.

244
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:24,112
How are you feeling?

245
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,145
A little sleepy.

246
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,701
They tell me you had a big night.

247
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,952
Who tells you?

248
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:35,832
You're gonna feel a little pressure.

249
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,495
Clean bill of health.

250
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,440
Did someone say that to you?

251
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,085
- To call me that?
- You were number one.

252
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:28,843
I don't remember the rest.

253
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,471
Alpha cut up my face.

254
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,267
Do you remember that?

255
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:37,355
Why?

256
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:40,445
So you could be number one.

257
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:44,596
Am I?

258
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:47,865
You are.

259
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,485
I try to be my best.

260
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:57,535
Good for you.

261
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,475
You're done.

262
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:03,795
Go and be your best.

263
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:10,025
No one is their best in here.

264
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,393
What is more precious
to a human being than their mind?

265
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:21,509
Everything we feel, see,

266
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:24,337
everything we are
is controlled by our brains.

267
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:29,767
They are the most powerful
and delicate part of the human machine.

268
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,312
As some of you know,
I lost my mother to Alzheimer's...

269
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,394
years before she died.

270
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,649
Since I took office,
I have made health care

271
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:42,005
and medical research a top priority,

272
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,840
and I call you all here today
to tell you

273
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,636
I am shocked and appalled
by what I have found.

274
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:49,422
There is nothing less
than a conspiracy

275
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,218
spearheaded by
the Rossum Corporation

276
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:56,059
<i>to withhold medical advancements,
to use radical illegal...</i>

277
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:58,202
Well, this is charmless, isn't it?

278
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,359
What do you think, Mr. Langton?

279
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:01,688
I like his suit.

280
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,351
You may well be missing the point.

281
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,401
He knows how to wear it, too.

282
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,787
Money. A lot.

283
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,114
And he was born into it.

284
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:14,873
He'll have connections.

285
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:16,600
We have connections.

286
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:18,590
He also has ambition.

287
00:17:19,282 --> 00:17:20,914
Which he wasn't born into.

288
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:25,207
Money like that, you either coast
or you shoot for the stars.

289
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,558
This one isn't going away.

290
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,175
How is it he wasn't on our radar?

291
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,600
We weren't on his.

292
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:34,594
I'm sure he was looking for a cause.
Someone gave him us. Recently.

293
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,638
Any idea who?

294
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:39,600
Mr. Ballard.

295
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,705
We were just about
to talk about you.

296
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,979
Did you see Senator Perrin's
press conference?

297
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,148
Just now. Nice suit.

298
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:50,115
Have you ever talked
to Senator Perrin?

299
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,304
Have you?

300
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,324
- Mr. Langton.
- Ms. Dewitt.

301
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:01,621
He reminds me of you.

302
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:07,115
I mean it. If you're pointing fingers,
you should be looking at Boyd.

303
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:08,929
I know why I'm here.

304
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:10,738
Do you?

305
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:16,295
I can't beat you.

306
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,383
The FBI kicked me out for trying.

307
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,765
Maybe the Senator can,
and I'll raise a glass.

308
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,880
In the meanwhile, I'm a kiss away
from taking down a gunrunner

309
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:25,166
the FBI couldn't touch.

310
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,408
A kiss away?

311
00:18:26,934 --> 00:18:27,939
Echo married him.

312
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,734
And my reports put you no closer
to closing than you were

313
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,661
when their eyes first locked.

314
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,504
Are you shutting us down?

315
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,742
I want you to consider
becoming Echo's handler.

316
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,299
I don't work for you.

317
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,863
No, you work
for the betterment of mankind.

318
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:48,114
Fighting crime by listening
to Echo have sex.

319
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,599
It's terribly noble.

320
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,236
We don't have audio
inside Klar's house.

321
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,091
You never ask about November.

322
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:58,595
- Who?
- Mellie.

323
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,613
Well, Madeline, actually.

324
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:02,949
But she was Mellie
when she was with you.

325
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:06,770
When you used your leverage
to have her released instead of Echo,

326
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,350
I thought you must have really
cared for her.

327
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:12,578
- Are you threatening her?
- Now I think you were just...

328
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:14,795
done with her.

329
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:16,571
But not with Echo.

330
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,407
You still need Echo for something.

331
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,326
But you'll never get it...

332
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:24,496
with the ex strutting
about the place.

333
00:19:24,926 --> 00:19:26,283
You're a sick lady.

334
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,167
Well, I'm not asking you
to handle me.

335
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,111
Echo's special.

336
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:32,405
You know it.

337
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,635
Alpha knew it.

338
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:36,508
She was evolving even before
he dumped all her personas into her.

339
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,301
Policy would be to send her
straight to the Attic,

340
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,632
and if this goes too far,
I still will.

341
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:44,244
But I'm a little bit curious.

342
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:46,518
You want to study the rat
before you slice it up?

343
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:49,113
Well, that is how science works.

344
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:53,223
What we learn here
feeds Rossum's crucial research.

345
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:55,277
As much as it feeds their coffers.

346
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,955
She hasn't shown me anything weird.

347
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,404
I wouldn't risk this mission
if she had.

348
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,815
Echo has three more years
on her contract.

349
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:08,661
I would prefer her to have someone in
her corner who really cared about her.

350
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,638
Even unreasonably.

351
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,946
You're working an angle.

352
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,608
With the exception
of the very special and the comatose,

353
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,705
have you ever met
someone who wasn't?

354
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:20,491
Think about it.

355
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:24,222
It'll pass the time
during her honeymoon.

356
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:34,189
Hugo, is everything on track
with the shipment?

357
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,383
Good. Then tell me what it is you...

358
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:40,154
If it has to be in person,
it can wait until the morning.

359
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,742
It can absolutely wait
until the morning.

360
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,421
I'll call you.

361
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:53,347
You were gone too long.

362
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:58,269
You won't tell me where we're going,
so I had to buy one of everything.

363
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,679
Well, supper's laid out.

364
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:01,890
Are you hungry?

365
00:21:03,724 --> 00:21:04,653
Are you?

366
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,089
Ten seconds ago, I swear I was.

367
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:10,841
I think you're controlling
my thoughts.

368
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:13,209
It's easier than you'd think.

369
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:19,798
Women.

370
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,083
What the...?!

371
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:52,936
What the hell?!

372
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:57,724
Are you drunk?

373
00:21:58,286 --> 00:21:59,817
I'm just trying to be my best.

374
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,729
I don't want your best.

375
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:06,668
I think you do...

376
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,623
That is the minority vote.

377
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,369
And you tricked it.

378
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,690
A guy's asleep.

379
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,540
Could have been Fozzie Bear
and it would have...

380
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:27,303
Not that I think about Fozzie Bear.

381
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,181
Let's stop playing games.

382
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:33,935
How does this qualify
as not playing games?

383
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,229
Because this is the endgame.

384
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,398
This is where it all leads.

385
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:41,172
You design someone to hate you

386
00:22:41,297 --> 00:22:43,376
so you can convince them
to love you.

387
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:46,656
I could whip up a love slave
any day I wanted to.

388
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,331
But that wouldn't be
a challenge, would it?

389
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:52,781
Slaves are just slaves.

390
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,166
But winning over your enemy...

391
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:00,503
the one person guaranteed
to reject everything you are...

392
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:03,796
that's real love.

393
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:07,682
More real than anything up
in the world.

394
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,339
And I understand it now.

395
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:13,012
I love you.

396
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:15,061
I love you.

397
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,024
You need a frickin' treatment!

398
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:24,527
Why shouldn't I love you?
Aren't you lovable?

399
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,530
Aren't you Big Brother?
Aren't you the Lord my God?

400
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,354
Why should I fight your divine plan?

401
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:32,560
Because you're better than that!

402
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,455
Because you're better than me.

403
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:47,925
Dr. Saunders was dead.

404
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:52,555
And Whiskey was out of service,
at least temporarily.

405
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:55,578
So DeWitt gave me the call.

406
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:57,243
"We need a new doctor.

407
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:59,796
"One who's committed to our cause,

408
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:03,232
"who's kind and efficient
and will look after our Actives."

409
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,859
So why didn't you stop there?

410
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:08,780
Because I was designing a person,
not a Roomba.

411
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,450
I needed you to be whole.

412
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:14,702
If you agreed
with everything I said,

413
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,580
then we would miss something,
and someone would get hurt.

414
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:20,124
You don't care if people get hurt.

415
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:21,281
You don't know me!

416
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,700
That's the contract.

417
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:38,628
You don't know me,
and I don't know you.

418
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:42,157
Not fully, not ever.

419
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:47,894
I made you question.

420
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:51,592
I made you fight for your beliefs.

421
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:55,667
I didn't make you hate me...

422
00:24:58,708 --> 00:24:59,858
You chose to.

423
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:20,971
How do I live?

424
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:27,165
How do I go through my day

425
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,105
knowing everything I think

426
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,646
comes from something I can't abide?

427
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,290
So you aren't really
gonna sleep with me.

428
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,403
I can't stand the smell of you.

429
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,325
I did that...

430
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:50,996
so we never...

431
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,807
Why didn't you find out
who you really used to be?

432
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,665
You had your chance.

433
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,597
Maybe DeWitt
would even re-imprint your old identity.

434
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,385
You've earned it.

435
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,905
Because I don't want to die.

436
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,039
I'm not even real.

437
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:26,209
I'm in someone else's body,

438
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:29,683
and I'm afraid to give it up.

439
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,176
I'm not better than you.

440
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:39,584
I'm just a series of excuses.

441
00:26:43,813 --> 00:26:44,685
You're human.

442
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:47,682
Don't flatter yourself.

443
00:27:19,374 --> 00:27:20,374
Honey?

444
00:28:03,443 --> 00:28:05,493
That desk was my grandfather's.

445
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:07,059
I know.

446
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:09,562
So I'd prefer
if you didn't stab it to death.

447
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,330
This is your fault.

448
00:28:17,935 --> 00:28:19,929
I'm all ears.

449
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:23,133
You know I can't stand surprises.

450
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:25,708
You have to tell me
where we're going.

451
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,966
Half the fun of a honeymoon
is packing and...

452
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:32,293
Maybe not half.

453
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,007
Wait. You say this from experience?

454
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,882
From your many marriages?

455
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:41,085
What's up?

456
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:45,014
What, besides you assaulting
a family heirloom?

457
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:46,936
I'm sorry.

458
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:49,839
I didn't leave a scratch.

459
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,757
It's all right. Don't worry.

460
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,903
I can always have it refinished.

461
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,206
What, no self-defense training?
No second gun in the ankle holster?

462
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:11,588
Please...

463
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:14,418
I can't believe he'd leave you here
without any kind of defense.

464
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:16,570
I don't know
what you're talking about!

465
00:29:16,695 --> 00:29:19,106
Do you take this man

466
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,822
to be your lawfully-wedded husband?

467
00:29:22,257 --> 00:29:23,384
Martin, I love you.

468
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:27,005
To love and honor,
in sickness and in health

469
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,885
so long as you both shall live?

470
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,768
- I do!
- Who are you?!

471
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:34,248
My name is Roma Klar.

472
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,994
Yes, it is.

473
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:41,811
It's comical.

474
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:48,736
It is, I understand,
the key to comedy, the timing.

475
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,206
One day,

476
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:54,912
one day wed, and I get this!

477
00:29:56,309 --> 00:29:58,359
Proof that my wife is my enemy.

478
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:02,117
Paul Ballard...

479
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:06,303
Where did he find you?

480
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,232
I mean, you're not Bureau.

481
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:12,748
Witness Protection?

482
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,030
Starving actress?

483
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:17,343
What did he promise you?

484
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,445
- Is he your lover?
- I've never seen this man.

485
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,244
This is a photo!
Have you see this man, darling?!

486
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:27,950
It's fake! It's Photoshopped!

487
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,220
Or this guy,

488
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,996
he asked me for the time
and had someone snap a picture.

489
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,744
- Why?
- To hurt you!

490
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,347
He's your enemy.
He comes at what's closest to you!

491
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:37,793
Well, good for him!

492
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:41,657
I thought
you were gentle and honest.

493
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:45,009
He knew better,
you wife-beating piece of...

494
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,427
Don't touch me!

495
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,366
- I'm sorry.
- Who has enemies like that?

496
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:53,581
Who the hell are you
that people hate you that much?

497
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,645
I'm not stupid.

498
00:30:56,996 --> 00:31:00,547
You're not just a frickin' financier,
but I don't care!

499
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:04,181
I didn't marry your job!

500
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,814
I married you.

501
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,100
I can't be wrong about you.

502
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,202
Look at me.

503
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:18,209
Forget everything and look at me.

504
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,088
I am your wife.

505
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:26,662
For the rest of my life...

506
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:29,410
I am and will always be

507
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,744
Mrs. Eleanor Penn.

508
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:36,811
Wait.

509
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:41,337
Who did they make me this time?

510
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,256
Aren't they lovely?

511
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,939
Of course,
they're just little bombs.

512
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:13,097
But they're not actually dirty bombs

513
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,269
until you've inserted them inside
the plutonium.

514
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:17,672
But then they're just
ordinary looking.

515
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:21,002
I like the heart of the thing.

516
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:24,775
The mechanism,
the light from within.

517
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,741
That's why I loved you.

518
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,013
I never lied to you...

519
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,209
not about anything that mattered.

520
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,230
<i>It's Ballard.
Let me talk to Topher Brink.</i>

521
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:02,262
Please hold.

522
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:10,744
This is Topher. What up?

523
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:13,616
<i>- Something's not right.</i>
- With Echo?

524
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:15,934
Her handler said she spiked
about two hours back.

525
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:18,053
<i>Can you access that?</i>

526
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:19,278
I can, I am.

527
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:22,082
Why didn't he move in?

528
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,086
He said it was excitement.
They were being newlyweds.

529
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,213
Yeah, that's not hot monkey love.

530
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,343
I got zero serotonin.
Theta activities to the CA1 are peaking.

531
00:33:33,685 --> 00:33:35,980
That was pain, and panic.

532
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,123
<i>- How did he miss this?</i>
- What do you see now?

533
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:43,103
She's amped, but there's drop-offs.
It's kind of random.

534
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:45,981
She could be concussed.
I'm calling it.

535
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,067
You move in now,
Klar will kill her for sure.

536
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:50,027
You got a better plan?

537
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:52,780
But I do have a much worse one.

538
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
Sir.

539
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:06,919
My God, this is becoming surreal.

540
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:09,887
Bring her out.

541
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:12,174
It's Paul Ballard.

542
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:16,717
Special agent in charge
of bugger all.

543
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:18,971
Hello, Martin.

544
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:21,981
Have you come to wish us joy
on our nuptials?

545
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,310
Let her go.

546
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:25,880
But we're very much in love.

547
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,856
You don't know who her.

548
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,024
Well, I know it's not the FBI.

549
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:36,771
I think I'm going to keep this gun.

550
00:34:36,896 --> 00:34:38,410
I'm going to treasure it.

551
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:42,246
- You're making a mistake.
- You're the expert in that field.

552
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,040
Did he tell you he was still
with the FBI?

553
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,543
Not ousted in disgrace?

554
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:52,256
Did he forget to mention his pathetic
failed attempts to catch me,

555
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:53,674
or anyone?

556
00:34:57,852 --> 00:35:00,314
I'm just so anxious
to know what he said

557
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:03,725
that put you in bed
with a man who represents

558
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:06,729
everything that he will never be.

559
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,273
What?

560
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,175
I don't understand
anything you're saying.

561
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:14,648
Where's Donny?

562
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:16,989
Roma, love, it's the wrong act.

563
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,992
It's not an act.

564
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:24,647
God,

565
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,578
my head is on fire.

566
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:29,293
Bring Mommy a Vicodin.

567
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,071
I'm starting to feel like maybe
she's not taking this seriously.

568
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,672
She doesn't get what's happening.

569
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:36,258
The pressure or something.

570
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,510
She cracked.

571
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:41,497
You couldn't take it.

572
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,936
This is the man from the picture.
I don't know him.

573
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,688
Just give it up.

574
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,231
Your name is Caroline.

575
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,469
I would never hurt you.

576
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,410
I bet everything on you.

577
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,331
I traded my life for this,
and you couldn't even...

578
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,458
All you had to do
was remember who you were.

579
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,711
You can't remember?
Nobody home?

580
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:16,465
We're going to die, and this scumbag
is going to walk because of you.

581
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,052
The Chinese restaurant...
you remember that!

582
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:26,266
Whoever you think you are...

583
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:31,502
- I swear, I don't want to hurt you.
- I know.

584
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:34,566
I'm counting on it.

585
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,537
Get the plane started.

586
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:13,427
Let's go, sweetie.

587
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,855
Honeymoon's over.

588
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,539
It's all over the news.
Arms deal gone wrong.

589
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:35,692
Your friend's plane was nabbed.
So was he.

590
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:37,044
You got your man.

591
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,582
She got him.

592
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:40,859
Well, she wouldn't have

593
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,858
if you hadn't seen
what her handler failed to.

594
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:46,754
Topher said her readings
were all over the place.

595
00:38:46,879 --> 00:38:48,529
Yeah, well, concussion.

596
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,540
Did I fall asleep?

597
00:38:58,367 --> 00:38:59,817
For a little while.

598
00:40:31,944 --> 00:40:32,944
I'm sorry.

599
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:34,729
I...

600
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:39,177
I guess I wasn't exactly my best.

601
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:42,953
I'm trying to do what's right.

602
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:46,693
And I'm having a harder and harder time
figuring out what that even means.

603
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:52,909
And maybe I should have gotten
you out of here first thing.

604
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,451
Instead I put you through...

605
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:02,000
- I know you don't remember it, but...
- I remember everything.

606
00:41:04,135 --> 00:41:05,985
Sometimes I'm someone else.

607
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:09,465
And then I come back,

608
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:11,791
but I still feel them...

609
00:41:12,752 --> 00:41:13,595
all of them.

610
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:18,005
I've been many people.

611
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:22,520
I can hear them.
Sometimes suddenly.

612
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,347
I'm all of them,

613
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,400
but none of them is me?

614
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,047
Do you know who's real?

615
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:38,651
Caroline.

616
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:43,565
I want to find her.

617
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:46,586
I want to find all of them.

618
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,237
Real them.

619
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:50,772
They can be found.

620
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:53,792
We are lost...

621
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:57,294
but we are not gone.

622
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,061
Will you help me?

623
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:13,613
I swear, no matter what,
I'm with you.

624
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,799
Everything's gonna be all right.

625
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:22,845
Now that you're here.

626
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,899
Do you trust me?

627
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:29,336
With my life.
