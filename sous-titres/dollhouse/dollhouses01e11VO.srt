1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,630
The dollhouse is bigger than I ever thought it was.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,530
Every time I look deeper, I find more clients,

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,710
larger amounts of money

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,330
and a web of financial and political
connections all over the world.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,110
I think the dollhouse is underground.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,480
Not underground like it's a secret.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,490
Underground like it's somewhere beneath los angeles.

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,410
You work for the NSA.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,040
You haven't figured it out?

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,410
Use your deductive skills.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,310
You're a doll.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,370
Why did you want to bring down the dollhouse?

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,160
If it weren't for me, Paul Ballard would've found you already.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,820
Do it.

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,110
Congratulations, Mr. Langton.

16
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,290
For what?

17
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,380
For becoming our new head of security.

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,470
I've seen this before.

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,930
Alpha.

20
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,120
Alpha is dead.

21
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,140
After what he did...

22
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,540
they tracked him down and put a bullet in his brain.

23
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,330
They'd never lie to us about something like that.

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,850
Would they?

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,740
"As soon as the prince kissed her,

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,770
the spell was broken and Briar Rose opened her eyes.

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,770
And as she looked at the face of the handsome young prince,

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,850
the whole kingdom began to magically awaken all around the

29
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,580
the cooks in the kitchen and the boys in the yard

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,840
all rubbed their eyes and looked around them."

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,250
This is crap.

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,250
I'm sorry?

33
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,500
Crap.

34
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,180
Don't you know what that means?

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,630
You don't like the story, but the others are listening.

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,460
So, maybe we could talk about this afterwards.

37
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,230
The spell was for a hundred years.

38
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,800
So, he shows up on the last day and takes credit for saving her?

39
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,930
Okay.

40
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,130
What's your name?

41
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,850
That's Susan.

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,960
Really?

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,320
My name's Susan, too.

44
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,410
That's a really good point,Susan.

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,790
She knew the curse.

46
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,850
"You will touch a poison spindle on your 15th birthday."
Right.

47
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,680
So, if it's me, I'm not exploring the castle on my 15th birthday,

48
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,930
groping any spindles I find lying around,

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,540
especially when I think she might've actually
had a vague idea what the hell a spindle is!

50
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,530
I don't think her parents told her about the curse.

51
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,480
If she knew, maybe they could've hid her.

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,980
Or she could've just run away!

53
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,220
Or what about this?

54
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,820
She could've just woken herself the hell up!

55
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,210
It was a curse; she couldn't...

56
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,210
just should've woken herself up!
Susan, stop. That's enough.

57
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,750
Let me go!

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,890
Let me go! Leave me alone!
Come on.

59
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,550
Okay, that's it for today.

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,950
Everyone back to your rooms, and I will check.

61
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,290
Well, guess I hit a trigger.

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,830
Yeah, something reminded her of what she's been through.

63
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,520
I'm not surprised.

64
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,490
That story always bugged me, too why I picked it.

65
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,400
Sorry if I blew your routine.

66
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,580
You...

67
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,810
thought that could happen?

68
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,050
Someone told me I could help her.

69
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,240
I was going to ask you to point her out.

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,740
Guess I didn't have to.

71
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,620
But when are you going?

72
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,860
Where?

73
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,350
I don't know.

74
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,780
Is this about Caroline?

75
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,130
Did you find her?

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,880
No.

77
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,680
Were you going to tell me?

78
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,050
If I'd come by tomorrow instead of today...

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,080
Paul, talk to me!

80
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,700
What is there to say?

81
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,980
Just tell me why.

82
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,690
We're not good for each other.

83
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,330
Around you...

84
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,950
we're not good for each other.

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,250
No, no. Paul.

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,450
You're in my way.

87
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,590
You're under a lot of stress.

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,810
I've been smothering you.

89
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,370
I'll back off; we can take a break.

90
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,910
That's probably a good idea.

91
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,040
But just a break is all we need.

92
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,600
Can you talk to me anyway?

93
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,180
You think you can't trust me.

94
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,930
And you're right to pay attention to that feeling

95
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,610
but you need to make sure that you're
laying the blame where it deserves to be.

96
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,700
Look at me!

97
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,450
Look at the real me,

98
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,210
and really think about whether I've ever told you anything

99
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,970
I didn't believe with all my heart.

100
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:24,340
You know, you just said exactly what I needed to hear.

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,500
And that's why I'm leaving.

102
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,820
What?

103
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,670
I'll deal with this later.

104
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,900
Please, this is...

105
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,960
Stop being so cruel. Can't you see this is killing me?

106
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,660
You'll get over it.

107
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,620
What's on it?

108
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,590
We don't know.

109
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,550
It was hand delivered for Mr. Dominic today.

110
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,810
We haven't been able to unlock the data that's inside.

111
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,940
You think it's from the NSA?

112
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,500
We know he was their inside man.

113
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,860
With him suddenly off their radar,

114
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,820
this may be them reaching out, trying to find him.

115
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,380
What do we need to open it?

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
A tech expert?

117
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,050
I mean, surely we ca imprint an active with the skills we need.

118
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,040
I think we can assume they've taken precautions

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,400
so that Mr. Dominic is the only one who
can retrieve the data without corrupting it.

120
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,220
Well, you'd better ask Mr. Dominic then.

121
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,420
Right.

122
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,890
Right.

123
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,370
Mr. Dominic is in the attic.

124
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,430
You don't really think we should let that stop us, do you?

125
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,320
We keep placing her in foster homes and she keeps bouncing back.

126
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,200
She cuts school and gets in fights.

127
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,140
We've taken five knives off of that girl.

128
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,360
Different times.

129
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,480
I don't even know how she gets those.

130
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,110
Steals them off other kids, shoplifts them,

131
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,560
some deli's just have cups with steak knives in them on the tables.

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,760
You can get in and out.

133
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,500
The mother died of a drug overdose when she was very young.

134
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,090
And the girl was left with the woman's boyfriend,

135
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,590
a small time drug dealer, part time pimp.

136
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,030
Probably thinking that she could start
earning money for him when she got older,

137
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,640
but turned out that last part wasn't
necessary, half the age, twice the price.

138
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,800
You know anything about Susan that wasn't 
in the report when they handed her to you?

139
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,950
I'd be shocked if you did.

140
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,560
She's not going to tell you.

141
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,560
She lies to her therapist; she's useless in group.

142
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:20,670
That's pretty specific for someone who's
known Susan for all of five minutes.

143
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,200
I've known her much longer than that.

144
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,300
They're not the same.

145
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,040
They kind of are.

146
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,280
Look closer.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,150
This one is the imprint I gave Echo this morning.

148
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,450
This one is the 11 year old.

149
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,530
Yeah, I see similar response patterns,

150
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,770
signs of depression and instability.

151
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,600
So, what's the deal?

152
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,650
The kid's a mess.

153
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,560
Past trauma has her emotions, reactions,

154
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,300
intellectual development all frakked up beyond recognition.

155
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,340
But if she gets help, really works,

156
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,350
deals with the soup of her life, she gets to be...

157
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,660
a nice lady with the tragic past but...

158
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,070
the healthy head.

159
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,250
Echo's imprint is the kid grown up?

160
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,810
Names and dates, tiny details changed, but in general, yeah, this is her.

161
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,710
If she grows up okay.

162
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,910
Echo's like the living example of the kid's best possible future.

163
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,260
So, she thinks she's a volunteer helping a kid like her...

164
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,520
but she knows exactly what to expect.

165
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:38,260
And the kid sees that maybe there's a decent future for her.

166
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,100
Whole approach, my idea.

167
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,150
Whole engagement, actually.

168
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,560
How did you sell Dewitt on it?

169
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,130
Everybody wants to be righteous when they can afford it.

170
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,350
Even Topher Brink.

171
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,350
This feeling, it is not unlike pride.

172
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,520
Topher.

173
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,870
Okay.

174
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,260
End of the pride parade.

175
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,630
Tell them to bring up Victor.

176
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,510
I don't know.

177
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,030
I don't know what I did wrong.

178
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,370
It's okay.

179
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,660
I tried so hard.

180
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,530
I did everything I could think of.

181
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,880
Right here.

182
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,730
It was right here.

183
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,990
Can I?

184
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,880
You keeping that book?

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm fixing it.

186
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,490
I see that.

187
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
They call that editing.

188
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,470
You could make a living out of it.

189
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,450
You really hate that she didn't save herself, don't you?

190
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,560
Of course, she was 15.

191
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,080
That's pretty big.

192
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,020
If she was littler, say

193
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,280
six or seven or eight...
You can always run away.

194
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,380
Really?

195
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,090
I couldn't.

196
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,640
When did you want to run away?

197
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,900
In the middle of the night,

198
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,790
it always seemed like I could run away when it would get light.

199
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:20,260
Sometimes I'd get dressed and lie there waiting for the sun.

200
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,660
But when it came up, he'd be there, pretending things were normal.

201
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,890
And it seemed so much better to just pretend, you know?

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,460
It seemed like I'd imagined all the other stuff,

203
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,570
and I really wanted all of that to be something I'd imagined.

204
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,990
And I ended up feeling like I was just as guilty as he was.

205
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,210
Like it was a crime we were committing together.

206
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,930
And every time someone calls me a victim,

207
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,170
I feel like I'm the biggest liar in the world.

208
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,390
You can't keep coming down here.

209
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,620
Director's already giving me suspicious eye.

210
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,760
I'm aware of that, Loomis, but this is huge.

211
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,920
Look.

212
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,520
You carry all this with you?

213
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,850
All this stuff that led me nowhere.

214
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,440
Hilarious.

215
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,820
Lubov.

216
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,430
My connection to the russians.

217
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,680
He knew nothing.

218
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,830
All dead ends.

219
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,210
The farther I reached, the worse I did.

220
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,520
But then...

221
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,560
they came to me.

222
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,240
Your neighbor?

223
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,160
The one you fingerprinted?

224
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,480
You're certain now that she's...
A doll.

225
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,450
Well, I was going to say, "a victim."

226
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,470
I followed her to 23 flower.

227
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,670
The dollhouse.

228
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,370
You just flashed your badge, swooped in on them like prince Valiant?

229
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,840
I got no badge unless I swipe yours.

230
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,510
Besides I didn't need it. I pulled a hat over my eyes and went right in,

231
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,280
and rode all around in their elevators,

232
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,610
checked out the stairs and the conference rooms.
Oh, yeah?

233
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,790
Wrong building.

234
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,920
But I figured it out.

235
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,340
I was in the building you can see.

236
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,890
I've got to get in the other one the one that's invisible.

237
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,490
Well, sure.

238
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,580
No, no, no, listen to me.

239
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,080
This isn't crazy, okay?

240
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,580
Look, under the one building, there's another.

241
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,680
Underground.

242
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,960
Look, Caroline said she was underground, right?

243
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,170
So, I looked at all the records for the building at 23 flower.

244
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,100
They had all the normal contractors and such,

245
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,010
but they also had an environmental systems consultant.

246
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,660
This guy.

247
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,890
Why would they use him?

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,910
He does one thing.

249
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,070
He's an expert in buildings that recycle
their own air and water and power.

250
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,140
Closed systems.

251
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,330
They're underground,drawing hardly any power, so it's like...

252
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,160
it's like they're invisible.

253
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:08,020
It's a good thing I'm relatively sure you're not crazy.

254
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,690
We have a job for you, Mr. Dominic, if you don't mind.

255
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,240
I'm in the chair. Of course.

256
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,240
Mr. Dominic, please.

257
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,020
A communication has arrived for you
from your handlers at the NSA, and...

258
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,380
we're really curious about it.

259
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,810
Whose hands are these?

260
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,400
Whose body am I in?

261
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,770
Victor?

262
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,270
Okay... okay.

263
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,080
No... no.

264
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,520
So, me my body I'm,

265
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,090
I'm in the attic.

266
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,960
I knew it. I knew it!

267
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,010
And now you want me to help?!

268
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,660
After doing that!

269
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,090
Doctor?

270
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,330
Sedate him, please.

271
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,590
No...

272
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,060
Topher.

273
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,200
Adelle, please, come on, don't... don't give me the shot, please.

274
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,070
Don't give...

275
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,190
whiskey.

276
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,760
He wants a drink instead.

277
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,990
I'm not surprised.

278
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,330
No.

279
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,270
No.

280
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, God.

281
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,490
That was...

282
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
Necessary.

283
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,180
Doctor, he's calm now.

284
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,730
Is there perhaps something else we can give
him to make him more receptive to our questions?

285
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,320
No.

286
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,370
No, I'd rather not.

287
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,660
Right.

288
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,860
Let's get started.

289
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,530
I know.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,710
I know, they always think that. Tell an adult.

291
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,830
Tell a teacher.

292
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,600
Tell a priest.

293
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,000
But if he says he knows them all,

294
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,160
that they won't believe you...
He said he knew the cops.

295
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,560
All of the cops.

296
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,830
Did you have a chance you didn't take?

297
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,850
Four times.

298
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,920
Four times, I saw a way to go, and I didn't go.

299
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,730
You couldn't have gotten away.

300
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,320
He was bigger and stronger and older.

301
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,730
It's okay.

302
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,240
It's okay to get rescued by someone else if you're young or small or

303
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,810
you just can't do it yourself.

304
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,440
Hey, you know this story?

305
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,350
Yeah.

306
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,310
Read it again, okay?

307
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,380
But this time...

308
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,270
think of yourself as the prince.

309
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,910
I didn't save anyone.

310
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,820
Hey, remember what you said.

311
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,090
The prince shows up at the last minute, takes all the credit.

312
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,840
That means briar rose was trapped all that time, sleeping...

313
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,270
and dreaming of getting out.

314
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,350
The prince was her dream.

315
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,200
She made him.

316
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,610
She made him fight to get her out.

317
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,450
Prince.

318
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,250
The prince was a boy.

319
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,180
Yeah, but that's not his fault.

320
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,710
Susan?

321
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,270
There's a van here for you.

322
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,030
And it's the kids' dinnertime.

323
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,370
I got to go.

324
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,950
Okay.

325
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,240
I'll come back.

326
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,700
Okay.

327
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,880
Susan.

328
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,910
You let me sit here very close to you.

329
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,920
You felt safe.

330
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,600
Which tells me...

331
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,370
you got a blade on you somewhere,

332
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,960
so just give it to me now, and I won't tell anyone.

333
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,720
Thank you.

334
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,100
Good talk?

335
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,180
A start.

336
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,250
Well, did you tell her you're going to come back?

337
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,460
Yeah.

338
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,720
It will be a little while, though.

339
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,950
Just...

340
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,520
be ready.

341
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,630
She's close to moving forward, but it's going to hurt.

342
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,690
Are you Stephen Kepler?

343
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,100
Okay.

344
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,040
what was that name again?

345
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,800
Stephen Kepler is that you?

346
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,340
Well, there's a lot of aspects to that question.

347
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,800
You're not from the thai place, are you?

348
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,250
Yeah. I wanted tofu satay.

349
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,970
Don't worry.

350
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,990
You're not in any trouble, but you are an expert in a field I am...

351
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,180
interested in.

352
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,630
Can I come in and talk for a minute?

353
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,630
Let's talk out here. It's nice.

354
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,070
The hallway goes...

355
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,840
down there all the way, and...

356
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,100
there's lots of...

357
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,350
spacious...

358
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,810
air.

359
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,250
Am I still breathing?

360
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,760
No.

361
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,100
Carrots.

362
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,160
Medicinal carrots.

363
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,950
Personal use for medicinal carrots
that were here when I moved in,

364
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,130
and I'm holding it for a friend.

365
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,550
You design environmental systems.

366
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,330
Yeah, th... that's my thing.

367
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,890
Self contained.

368
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,540
Renewable everything.

369
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,710
I mean...

370
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,130
the ultimate goal is, complete self sufficiency,

371
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,570
but without a lot of money, you know,

372
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,200
the best you can hope to do is to offset your carbon footprint.

373
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,180
You know, I care about my carbon footprint,

374
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,540
but most people out there are...

375
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,110
making carbon snow angels.

376
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,230
You know Earth Day was last week?

377
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,150
I haven't been.
Hilarious.

378
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,030
Earth gets one day.

379
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,130
All right, the other 364, we're...

380
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,060
we're cranking the ac in our Hummer,

381
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,740
and then, one day a year, ooh, we'll separate the plastic.

382
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,190
You know what I think?

383
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,300
I think that once we die out

384
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,830
a couple hundred years Earth is going to have a "people day."

385
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,910
You know, to remember us.

386
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:36,040
One day a year, she is going to laugh
and laugh and shake our bones.

387
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,310
Recycled urine?

388
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,240
I'm kidding.

389
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,410
It it... it's not fully recycled.

390
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,070
I'm tinkering with that.

391
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,090
I also have pom.

392
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,150
Let's say I do have a lot of money.

393
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,390
You can design a truly self contained system?

394
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,180
Air, water, heat.

395
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,870
You wouldn't even have to use the greed...

396
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,880
maybe a little, depending on how big it is.

397
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,230
So, you can make a building disappear?

398
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,800
Only if you paint it exactly like what's behind it, and then you stand...

399
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,420
but you could bury it underground.

400
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,620
Underground... it's best, you know,

401
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,390
insulation, structural integrity.

402
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,060
You don't have a lot of money.

403
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,780
I'm looking for something.

404
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,180
Yeah, no, you need to make an appointment with Stacy.

405
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,990
You could e-mail me... don't e-mail me.

406
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,790
You know, I'm not comfortable having people in
my home that aren't delivering me thai food,

407
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,440
and I'm not talking about past clients.

408
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,520
Tell me about the dollhouse.

409
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,700
Ah, man.

410
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,310
I told you, you're not in trouble.

411
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,110
You are naive.

412
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,120
They will kill me, and you, and then kill me again.Please.

413
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,220
I shouldn't have said anything.

414
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,560
And now there's a gun.

415
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,660
You built the dollhouse.

416
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,690
I built the shell.

417
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,140
Can you open the shell?

418
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,930
What if I don't tell you?

419
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,560
Probably.

420
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,320
But I don't know where it is.

421
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,940
That was years ago.

422
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,700
You know, I... I... I designed it from here.

423
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,130
I never leave here,man.

424
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,800
Then, this will be a real adventure for you.

425
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,480
You're coming with me.

426
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,310
Why would I choose to do that?

427
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,840
I don't remember using the word "choose."

428
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,060
There is a girl named Caroline being held there against her will.

429
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,910
Now, I'm the only person who knows how to find the dollhouse,

430
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,740
and you're the only person who knows how to get in.

431
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,700
And as much as it pains me to say it,
that makes you my new partner.

432
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,450
Then, can I hold the gun?

433
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,120
Never saw it before.

434
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,340
Come on.

435
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,340
It's from your best friends and handlers at the NSA.

436
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,870
No, it isn't.

437
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,600
We didn't communicate that way.

438
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,940
We have phones.

439
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,860
It came in an envelope.

440
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,160
It was hand delivered.

441
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,310
Who else would be trying to contact you covertly?

442
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,410
Alpha.

443
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,720
I guess he didn't hear about the regime change.

444
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,270
Let's open it.

445
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,890
What's it going to be?

446
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,540
I don't know.

447
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,130
He never sent me anything before.

448
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,360
Whether it's from the NSA or from Alpha makes no difference.

449
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,250
It's intended that you should be able to open it.

450
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,010
Therefore, you should be able to open it.

451
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,150
We just need a password that you would guess.

452
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,650
It shouldn't be hard.

453
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,560
Alpha.

454
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,850
Too easy.

455
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,850
Try it.

456
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,350
If we're wrong, it could all disappear.

457
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,170
Wait.

458
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,010
Alpha?

459
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,890
Just like that?

460
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,720
Alpha?

461
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,460
He used to sign his stuff in art class like that.

462
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:02,560
They thought it was a fish, but it was his name over and over again.

463
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,330
First sign something was different.

464
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,070
He means the greek letter.

465
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,310
Try a greek alpha.

466
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,620
How...?
Change font.

467
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,730
Paul Bunyan?

468
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,400
Did not anticipate that.

469
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,370
There's a lot of those statues in northern
plains cities Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota.

470
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,980
Tucson.

471
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,610
What?

472
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,570
I've see that dreadful statue from the window of the center in Tucson.

473
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,620
What's the center?

474
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,430
Never you mind.

475
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,930
Is that the dollhouse hq?

476
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,340
Because I've always wondered...

477
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,820
I've got to make some calls, get them to increase their security.

478
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,740
If Alpha is in Tucson God!

479
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,230
They found a body in an alley in Tucson this morning.

480
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,970
Slashed with a knife.

481
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Send Sierra.

482
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,810
So, um...

483
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,430
back on the shelf?

484
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,030
Look, if we could take some time, then we could prepare.

485
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,940
We could get some supplies.

486
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,170
We could get some rope. Rope is always good.

487
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,530
We have to go now.

488
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,150
Because why?

489
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,090
They had a spy watching me.

490
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,840
Someone...

491
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,590
close to me, who turned out to be a doll.

492
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,390
Is this the fabled Caroline?

493
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,730
Someone else.

494
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,300
So I figure I've got a day or two before they figure out I know...

495
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,560
and kill me.

496
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,830
This this other doll are you're going to save her, too.

497
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,720
No.

498
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,670
She told me herself she can't be trusted.

499
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,660
She warned me.

500
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,670
After I get Caroline out, I can come back.

501
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,760
Come on.

502
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,120
We're here?

503
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,630
So soon.

504
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,630
Let's go around the block.

505
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,410
Come out.

506
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,950
Come on, man!

507
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,360
This is like one of those buddy cop movies
where you're the hard nosed FBI agent

508
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,770
and I'm the guy who hates buddy cop movies.

509
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,450
Get out of the car or I show the DEA your carrot plantation.

510
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,800
Okay.Okay.

511
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,410
I am sorry to do this.

512
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,130
But we've got to get in there and save her.

513
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,750
Then what?

514
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,130
We go in there, then we're in there.

515
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,770
There's... there's more people in there.

516
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,250
I'm not good with people.

517
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,820
They're not people.

518
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,910
I'm not good with that sentence either.

519
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,810
The helicopter better be waiting,

520
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,480
because whatever is up with this body
of yours, it's changing every minute.

521
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,810
Tissue's breaking down from bacteria, the body's own chemicals.

522
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,380
You've got putrefaction, fermentation.

523
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,230
And not to mention the effects of insects and other animals,

524
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,570
then you got the elements: rain, condensation...

525
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,280
one FBI trained forensic specialist.

526
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,790
It's a tall order for a rush job.

527
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,890
Sorry about that.

528
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,190
It's all right.

529
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,330
It's a quiet night anyway.

530
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,640
Echo's just coming in,and then we're sleepy bye.

531
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,910
How far?

532
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,860
Ten stories.

533
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,980
It's the best way in. I'm sorry, man, it's just how it is.

534
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,410
Let's go.
No. No way.

535
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,690
You'd go down there?

536
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,370
You showed me this thinking I'd give up?

537
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,960
I was nurturing a tender throbbing
hope that you'd give up, yes!

538
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,300
Well, I'm not.

539
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,080
Show me the real way in.

540
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
No, that's the real way in.

541
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,280
I just thought that you'd give up.

542
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,530
Wish we had rope.

543
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,180
Hello, Echo.

544
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,280
How are you feeling?

545
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,940
Did I fall asleep?

546
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,110
Falling!

547
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,530
Falling now!

548
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,780
You're not falling.

549
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,140
I have your ankles.

550
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,460
Let go!

551
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,290
Okay, no, no, no, no.

552
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,270
Don't let go.

553
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,470
Ankles, ankles, ankles, ankles, ankles, ankles!

554
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,750
No. No.

555
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,220
Riding up, riding up... I'm getting a wedgie.

556
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,420
Say, this is...

557
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,900
clean and enclosed. I'm staying here.

558
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,860
Come on.

559
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,850
Just because we can move forward, we must?

560
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,900
You know, this is the same expansionist
thinking that lead to the trail of tears, man.

561
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,540
Carrots.

562
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,320
"One day, a hundred years later,

563
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:22,360
a young prince heard about Briar Rose and
of the deep sleep and the sharp thorns.

564
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,990
The prince said, 'I will not let this stop me.'

565
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,560
'I'm as strong as any spell.'

566
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,190
'I'm as strong as any thorns.'

567
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:38,220
'I won't let anything stop me from reaching her and saving her.'

568
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,580
'I will go and rescue the sleeping beauty.' "

569
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,240
It's real.

570
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,460
You know, this is pretty unusual,

571
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,610
federal agents in the middle of the night shift.

572
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,030
It's a high priority case.

573
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,180
This thing hit the system and bells went off all over the FBI,

574
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,360
from Quantico to the tiny telephone in hoover's casket.

575
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,570
So...

576
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,370
it's a signature you're looking at?

577
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,150
Yeah.

578
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,070
Someone's getting slash happy.

579
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,530
All homeless guys?

580
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,550
Clearly not.

581
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,460
Homeless people smell primarily like human excretions sweat,urine.

582
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,790
This guy...

583
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,390
this guys smells like garbage over a layer of clean skin.

584
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,800
Not even old garbage, either. He...

585
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,580
he smells like yesterday's breakfast, not last week's.

586
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,650
I think I'll take over from here.

587
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,540
They told me this was going to be the a new eden.

588
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,380
Eden wasn't a prison.

589
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,610
What, are you kidding?

590
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,910
The apples were monitored.

591
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,350
Plus,they didn't have a steam room that could
recirculate human sweat and put it right back...

592
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,150
we're going to be on camera the moment we set foot in there.

593
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,330
But remember my plan where we don't?

594
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,470
Can you do anything about their surveillance?

595
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,480
From a computer, probably.

596
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,530
Their fail safe should be on the same system
as the life support cycles I designed.

597
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,680
But we'd have to access one and until then,

598
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,770
we suffer from unsightly visibility.

599
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,200
Wait here.

600
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,950
If you'll come this way, please.

601
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,870
I am not good with people.

602
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,010
Not good with the blood and viscera of people, okay?

603
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,020
Take off your clothes.

604
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,420
What, you're gonna dress like a doll?

605
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,760
Those probably won't even fit a guy...

606
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,650
Oh, no, come come on!

607
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,220
This is...

608
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,610
I'm not comfortable.

609
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,360
My arms are chilly.

610
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,570
Shut up.

611
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,670
Oh, change is good.

612
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,540
Go change.

613
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,650
Yes, we can!

614
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,050
You know, this cotton it's organic, I'm pretty sure.

615
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,330
That's a plus.

616
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,120
I'm going to die. I'm going to die in pajamas.

617
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,170
Person I don't know.

618
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,680
Actually, I'm from upstairs. Security review.

619
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,870
I have a work order here.

620
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,040
Maybe you can...

621
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,030
what the hell was that?

622
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,400
Is that some kind of like joy buzzer stun gun?

623
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,660
I mean, officially, I deplore the violence,

624
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,160
but that was totally worth the loss of karma points.

625
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,060
Help.

626
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,670
Computer.

627
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,190
You can take down security from there, right?

628
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,410
I could, if this guy wasn't a paranoid freak.

629
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,980
There's like a thrillion layers of passwords on here.

630
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,040
This isn't company stuff.

631
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,390
This is his own personal minefield.

632
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,260
I need a different computer.

633
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,000
Let's go.

634
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,550
Wait. Wait. Hold on.

635
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,710
Let me watch for a minute, see if I can notice a pattern,

636
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,810
security patrols, anything.

637
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,110
All right, would you look at this place!

638
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,700
I mean, first of all, feng shui up the ying yang.

639
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,000
Also, I designed parts of it,

640
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,160
but I did not design the stone cold foxes in the small clothes,

641
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,580
and the ample massage facilities.

642
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,540
I mean, don't get me wrong, I heart my porn, but this is cool.

643
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,360
This is a bad place.

644
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,440
Bad people, maybe.

645
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,180
Good place.

646
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,000
Man, this is the future.

647
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,460
The machine feeds them what they need,

648
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,290
the machine takes away what it needs.

649
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,410
A closed system, the earth is not harmed.

650
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,730
Yeah, we're all just cells in a body.

651
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,560
Cells in a body?

652
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,270
That's the future?

653
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,360
We're all functional, interchangeable?

654
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,200
We already are, man.

655
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,100
What, you didn't you know that?

656
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,830
I was trying to tell you, you know,

657
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,120
we're all just atoms in the big continuous universe and the best,

658
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,170
the best that we can do is to try not to kill it from the inside.

659
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,500
No.

660
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,550
There's more we can do.

661
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,070
Yeah, okay.

662
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,300
If you really think you have a choice.

663
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,370
Let's go. There's a lull in traffic.

664
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,590
Come on.

665
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,380
There should be offices down this way, if I remember correctly.

666
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,990
What?

667
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,490
The stairs lack risers.

668
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,610
What?

669
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,940
The vertical part that makes the back of each stair is called a riser.

670
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,990
I know what they are.

671
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,540
Okay, wait, hold, hold. Okay, see,

672
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,220
sometimes when I go on stairs that don't have risers,

673
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,750
I get this feeling, this awful sensation,

674
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:58,190
that something's going to just reach out
and grab my ankle like a claw or a tentacle.

675
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,700
This is life or death.

676
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,960
Could be a hand, could be an ordinary hand.

677
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,920
Come on!

678
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,690
Hurry up.

679
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,600
There's a terminal in there.

680
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,190
If I can get to that, I can shut down all the security.

681
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,040
I can open this place up like an oyster

682
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,680
we can go out in the elevator, as pretty as you please.

683
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,270
Okay, fine.

684
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,920
Oh, God.

685
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,380
I know that guy Lubov.

686
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,270
My whole life.

687
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,910
My whole life isn't real.

688
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,790
It's a small world, right?

689
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,490
I went to grade school with Jenna Elfman.

690
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,390
Just point me to where they sleep.

691
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,300
Is it that way?

692
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,890
Cool off.

693
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,780
Man, think.

694
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,140
You know, compose yourself mentally, man.

695
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,810
Prepare.

696
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,630
What are you doing?

697
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,180
The best that I can, Mr. I stun all my problems.

698
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,520
I don't know how to slam all the doors shut on the security areas,

699
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,550
but I do know how to adjust the oxygen nitrogen co2 mix in their rooms,

700
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,080
so they won't wake up if the alarms go off.

701
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,160
Okay.

702
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:27,870
Do that.

703
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,430
Now, the dolls I designed the sleeping compartments
that collects the carbon dioxide and methane

704
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,720
everybody farts and cycles it all into the environmental controls.

705
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,740
What?
You need to know this.

706
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,330
The pods are locked.

707
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,870
She's locked into a pod?

708
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,460
There are lights inside.

709
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,170
If the light is on, the pod is locked.

710
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,090
Do not try to open a locked pod.

711
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,120
All hell will break loose, my tall man.

712
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,380
As I unlock each pod remotely, the light will go off.

713
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,840
Wait.

714
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,280
Go.

715
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,010
Okay.

716
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,170
I said go.

717
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,210
The course is clear.

718
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,730
Go now!

719
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,190
All right.

720
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,390
Down...

721
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,600
that hallway.

722
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,110
Wait.

723
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,320
Oh, no. That's right.

724
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,580
They flip a switch, you'll kill me without even knowing it.

725
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,790
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,480
Caroline.

727
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,660
Sorry, Agent Ballard.

728
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,560
You don't get the girl.

729
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,630
Give me your gun.

730
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,050
I don't have a...
You didn't come in here without one.

731
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,990
Put it on the floor now.

732
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,090
Who are you?

733
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,490
I'm Paul.

734
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,010
You lled me.

735
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,370
You asked me to come get you.

736
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,140
Echo, why don't you go for a swim?

737
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,090
Your name is Caroline.

738
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,900
You've been brainwashed.
Echo, go!

739
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,390
You hurt Paul.

740
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,480
Echo.

741
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,530
What are you, then, her pimp?

742
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,760
You get her ready, send her out, clean her up after?

743
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,170
I keep her safe.

744
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,560
You think you're helping her. You're wrong.

745
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,540
You can't get her out.

746
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:33,430
I got in.

747
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,960
I could've brought the whole house down
on you, but I'm giving you one chance.

748
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,250
Go back the way you came. Now.

749
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,520
Echo, run!

750
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,720
I'm supposed to go swimming.

751
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,850
Caroline, you don't have to do what they tell you.

752
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,190
I know you're scared, but it's okay.

753
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,430
Let me go!

754
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,210
You heard the lady.

755
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,330
Alarms...

756
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,580
off.

757
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,950
Backup alarm...

758
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,410
calling out. No.

759
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,200
Calling... in. No.

760
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,250
Motion sensors...

761
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,800
disabled.

762
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,390
Manual alarm disabled.

763
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,590
Pod locks switched.

764
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,810
Victor, what happened?

765
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,450
People were fighting on me.

766
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,680
Backup doors reinforced.

767
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,500
Security team...

768
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,540
sawing wood.

769
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,970
Think they'll just let her go?

770
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,010
Let her live outside?

771
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,030
She's not...

772
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,070
living now.

773
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,780
Even if you got her out alive, they'd hunt you down and kill you both.

774
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,800
Lower oxygen, up the co2.

775
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,420
Stay asleep.

776
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,420
stay asleep.

777
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,960
I'm going to get you...

778
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,430
We have to stop.

779
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,040
No. Echo.

780
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:56,890
Run.

781
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,830
Run!

782
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,090
Run!

783
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,110
Stay here. Wait for me.

784
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,670
I'll come back to get you.

785
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,990
I trust you.

786
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,070
All right, we'll have you fixed up in...

787
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,480
Alpha.

788
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,500
Well, you kept my gift.

789
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,640
Yes. Of course.

790
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,380
Now you.

791
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:14,860
Yes.

792
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,710
Of course.

793
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,960
They're unique, you know.

794
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,090
Turns out different every time.

795
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,970
Victor's, for example.

796
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,660
they're much deeper.

797
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,970
Have you always...

798
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,710
wanted to be a doctor?

799
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,160
It's a simple question.

800
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,470
Answer now.

801
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,220
Yes.

802
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,290
That's a lie.

803
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,910
Let's try another.

804
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:05,240
Did you really think you could just walk into the dollhouse?

805
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,380
When everyone knows it doesn't exist?

806
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,680
Tell me about the first time you met me.

807
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,810
You were new.

808
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,230
You had signed the a agreement,and they'd just...

809
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,540
you'd just beep wiped for the first time.

810
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,640
Your handler brought you to me for an exam.

811
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,730
And did you examine me?

812
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,330
My whole body?

813
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,230
Yes.

814
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,430
And was I fine?

815
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,160
Healthy?

816
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,060
Intact?

817
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,680
Yes.

818
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,930
This is so teresting.

819
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,340
I wish we had more time.

820
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,530
We don't have time?

821
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,080
You are digging yourselves in so deep, you have no idea.

822
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,710
I'm a federal agent.

823
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,550
You've been suspended.
The penalties for interfering with a federal agent

824
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:05,470
you are no longer protected by those laws.
In the performance of his...

825
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,080
You really justify this?

826
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,330
What you do to these people?

827
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,320
You can live with this?

828
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,790
You're the one who came in here and assaulted one of our residents.

829
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,120
Yes. There's indignation enough for everyone to have seconds.

830
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,480
If you really didn't want me here,

831
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,290
then maybe you shouldn't have filled
my life with so many interesting lies...

832
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,670
you have been quite a challenge.

833
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,530
Oh, is that why you tried to kill me?

834
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,010
Twice?

835
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,310
It might be good for us both that I failed.

836
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:32,380
I don't even care that these people signed themselves over to you.

837
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,560
There is no provision for...

838
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,370
for... consensual slavery.

839
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,190
It is wrong.

840
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,320
You know it's wrong.

841
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,550
You feel it in your bones.

842
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,650
What you did to Caroline is wrong.

843
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,980
You know so many things.

844
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,260
Facts and names.

845
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,050
What do you think, Mr. Langton?

846
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,090
What do you mean?

847
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,950
Shall we put him in the chair?

848
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,470
Echo?

849
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,550
Come here, please.

850
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,230
Echo.

851
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,800
I know you.

852
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,010
I remember something about you.

853
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,900
I remember everything about you.

854
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,090
It's okay.

855
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,710
It'll be all right.

856
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,610
You know I don't need your consent.

857
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,050
You asked my opinion.

858
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:46,860
In my opinion, this man hasn't agreed to this, and his crime isn't...

859
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:52,900
Dewitt.

860
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,400
Yeah, this is Special Agent Gerhardt calling for the director.

861
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:57,290
Go ahead.

862
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,920
Didn't want you to have to wait for my report, madam director.

863
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,770
The mo is right for your suspect.

864
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,990
That's a positive.

865
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,130
The name we got on the vic is Stephen J. Kepler.

866
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,510
Stephen J. Kepler.

867
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:10,460
Got it.

868
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,030
He was some kind of specialist in environmental design.

869
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,060
The interesting part is that he wasn't killed in Tucson.

870
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,300
He was killed in los angeles and planted here.

871
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:22,980
Kepler's in our system.

872
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,490
He's got a subcontractor number from ten years back.

873
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,460
He helped build the dollhouse.

874
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,960
Alpha isn't in Tucson.

875
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,750
Oh, I know you.

876
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,480
Of course you do.

877
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,570
I told you I'd come rescue you.

878
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,170
My prince.
