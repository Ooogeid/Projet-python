1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,569
<i>Previously on Dollhouse...

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,504
I have a message for you
from inside the Dollhouse.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,106
Who? Who sent you?

4
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,240
My name is November.

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,309
Mellie. Your name is Mellie.

6
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,144
They've been using this body
to spy on you for months.

7
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,479
Don't do this.

8
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,681
The Dollhouse knows you know.
They will kill you.

9
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,749
Tell me who.

10
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:17,816
You warned the NSA Sierra was coming

11
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,985
so that they could plant this file

12
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,453
for her to find.

13
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,357
Get what you can out of him

14
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,893
about the NSA and have Topher
prep him for the Attic.

15
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:28,894
Do it.

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,505
Jack!

17
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,673
I'm taking him around the park.
He needs to stretch his legs.

18
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,509
All right.
I'll see you later.

19
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,878
We won't be long.
Be good.

20
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,212
Hey, am I ever?

21
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,451
Come on. Ha. Come on.

22
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,620
So, someone said
there was gonna be tennis...?

23
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,221
Is that what I said?
Because I was pretty sure

24
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,890
I said Long Island iced tea.

25
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,291
Wait, wait, there's tea in this?

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,760
We're not playing tennis?

27
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,096
Because I got this damn
hypercarbon racket,

28
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,564
or whatever the hell
this thing is.

29
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,800
Hey, uh, Jack...

30
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,136
Where's Margaret?

31
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,915
Addy.

32
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,717
Adelle?

33
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,286
What's wrong?

34
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,587
You look terrible.

35
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:33,125
Margaret, I'm sorry
to be the one to tell you.

36
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,496
You're dead.

37
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,766
Boyd.

38
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,034
Hey.

39
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,670
How's the promotion treating you?

40
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,372
You must be thrilled.
I mean,

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,874
you were no fun
as Echo's handler

42
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,976
and now you get to be
twice as no fun

43
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,711
as head of security.
Yeah, well.

44
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,179
So far, not a lot to do.

45
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,314
Miss DeWitt's keeping
the Dollhouse idle

46
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,783
for the most part,
after Dominic...

47
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,819
After Dominic.

48
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:34,987
Yeah.

49
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,523
Most of the Actives are on rest.

50
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,891
Echo's out, though?

51
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,792
Uh, yep.

52
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,060
What is she, uh...

53
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,563
Having trouble letting go,
Papa Bear?

54
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,964
Aw.

55
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,300
We put a dead lady in her.

56
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,068
That's what I heard,
but I didn't believe it.

57
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,538
A dead client?

58
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,508
I guess she's special friends
with Adelle, or something.

59
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,511
I mean, not special friends.

60
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,215
Although, late night,
too much wine...

61
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,218
So we can give you
life after death.

62
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,387
Only if we really like you.

63
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,190
Hey, uh, Boyd...

64
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,158
I need an Active.

65
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,326
What?

66
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,861
Why?

67
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,063
I'm doing my annual anterior

68
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,599
insular
cortex diagnostic,

69
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,668
and though it may sound simple,

70
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,671
it's actually a very complicated
super-specific imprint

71
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,339
and I need head of security

72
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,075
to sign off on a subject.

73
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,376
Is there risk?

74
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,645
Not if I know
what I'm doing.

75
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,014
Um...

76
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,217
Sierra's been idle the longest.

77
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,387
Look at you
with the big decisions,

78
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,189
big boss-man.

79
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,158
Life after death.

80
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,227
Where does that end?

81
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,028
Same place it begins.

82
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,430
Death.

83
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,036
This is so... stunning.

84
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,938
Really.

85
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,774
Last thing I remember
is coming here a month ago

86
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,210
for that dreadful
process of yours.

87
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,212
Well, if we'd spoken
in the meantime,

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,547
I'd have been able to tell you

89
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,616
about the last three weeks
of your life, but...

90
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,817
Well,

91
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,552
this way I don't have
to remember dying.

92
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,886
Undoubtedly a plus.

93
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,089
God, it's all a plus.

94
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,757
I mean, more life!

95
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,092
Can you imagine?

96
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,661
And this body...

97
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,163
Nice work, Addy.

98
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,899
I'm pointing
to the sky.

99
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,901
Shame it's only
a loaner.

100
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,670
That was always
the deal.

101
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,839
I swear I've never felt
this good.

102
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,173
Did being young

103
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,341
feel this good?

104
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,709
I seem to recall
it was rather nice.

105
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,944
I wonder why we gave it up.

106
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,245
Please.

107
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,314
You're, what, ten
years younger than me?

108
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,349
And, oddly,
15 years older.

109
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,018
Just remember,

110
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,319
it's temporary.

111
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,355
Just a chance to
indulge my curiosity.

112
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,357
See my own funeral.

113
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,959
Who wouldn't want that?

114
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,897
To hear what the world
really thought of us?

115
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,233
To count up the number
who love us?

116
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,537
Addy?

117
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,938
Are you all right?

118
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,474
Well, let's see.

119
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,544
My friend just died.

120
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,782
Come on.

121
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,550
We've got a funeral to go to.

122
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,154
Then maybe you can
help me wrap this up.

123
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,724
Wrap this up?
Your life?

124
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,661
Well, I thought maybe
I'd solve my murder.

125
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,701
massive heart attack.

126
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,603
I was perfectly healthy
and ridiculously wealthy.

127
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,506
And wealth can be a
dangerous thing to have.

128
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,843
You suspected
this might happen.

129
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,545
When I was three,

130
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:50,382
my nanny put ground glass
in my nap time snack.

131
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,951
She wasn't going
to let me eat it.

132
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,021
She was going to be the hero
who caught it just in time.

133
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,257
I snuck a cookie and spent
two weeks in the hospital.

134
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,560
Forgive me if I'm
the suspicious type.

135
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,862
You had the scans
so you could come back

136
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,530
and solve your own murder?

137
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,132
I like a puzzle.

138
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,900
Are you certain
you're ready for this?

139
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,135
Of course.

140
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,470
Come on, let's go in.

141
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,206
I used to say I'd be late
for my own funeral,

142
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,907
but I didn't mean it.

143
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,052
Not a bad turnout.

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,388
I'd like to hear more
weeping, of course.

145
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,490
You know, you don't have
to do that for my benefit.

146
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,658
Be all chipper.

147
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,227
Oh, come on, my dear.

148
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,562
I'm doing exactly
what you would.

149
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,264
Stiff back,
stiff lip.

150
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,166
You know that's
how you'd play it.

151
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,267
Margaret.

152
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,602
Not Margaret.

153
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,337
I'm Julia now.

154
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,373
You've really thought
this through.

155
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,343
I started mentioning
Julia now and then

156
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,811
to my family before
we started the scans.

157
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,781
I wrote myself
into my own will,

158
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,483
instructed the family
to expect me...

159
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,219
While you spy on the servants

160
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,754
and the family friends
and the business associates.

161
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,589
A spy?

162
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,758
No, no, Addy.
I'm a ghost.

163
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,326
Welcome.

164
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:12,531
We are here to remember
a very special woman.

165
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,435
Margaret Bashford
wasn't the first of that name.

166
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,016
She was a formidable
woman.
Let me introduce

167
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:18,537
you to the family.

168
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,704
Shh.

169
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,473
I want to hear
how great you were.

170
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,942
Over there...

171
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,611
Nicolas and Jocelyn.

172
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,146
My God.

173
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,815
Your children.

174
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,517
Watching them go
through this.

175
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,852
One buries one's parents.

176
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,754
Unpleasant, but natural.

177
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,957
Do let's focus.

178
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,393
...like her namesake, strong...

179
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,029
Oh, my brother William came.

180
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,231
I haven't seen him
in a dog's age.

181
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,300
Seems somewhat
the worse

182
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,801
for being
stupefyingly drunk.

183
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,403
So, no change there.

184
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:57,008
And lined up along the walls,
the loyal household staff.

185
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,511
The grooms from the stables.

186
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,213
Well, who are
all the others?

187
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,881
Oh, you know.

188
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,150
All my closest friends.

189
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,253
I should probably
remember their names.

190
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,822
Every one of
them a suspect.

191
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,357
Ooh, someone's tardy.

192
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
Oh...

193
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,530
Jack.

194
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,999
You never met my
husband, did you?

195
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,934
He is young.

196
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,536
Mmm.

197
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,772
When I met him, I stopped
becoming such a regular customer

198
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,040
at the Dollhouse.

199
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,175
I can see why.

200
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,611
I was a lucky woman.

201
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,747
Until recently.

202
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,662
Almost there.

203
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,665
Almost there.

204
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,970
Almost...

205
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:08,947
Yes.

206
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,082
Tell me you got Speed Force 3.

207
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,584
And downloaded the bonus maps.

208
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,252
Pizza?

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
On its way.
Beer in the fridge.

210
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,955
Dude!

211
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,792
Oh, I've also got this new kind
of Battleship game I invented

212
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,127
with real explosions.

213
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,728
What, like you can
really get hurt?

214
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:24,729
Yeah.

215
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,231
My man.

216
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,432
Appetizers.

217
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,134
Word.

218
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,773
Get ready to have

219
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,576
your ass kicked
and possibly

220
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,210
lose an eye.

221
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,151
You're a better cook
than you think.

222
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,586
Hmm.

223
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,888
I don't think pasta
should be that, um...

224
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,023
...snappy.

225
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,959
It's al dente.

226
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,561
That's Italian
for "Ow, my teeth."

227
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,965
Um...

228
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,967
I know the quickest way
to kill a relationship

229
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,635
is to take
its temperature, but...

230
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,438
are you okay?

231
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,174
I'm just tired.

232
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,642
Okay.

233
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,510
So, there's nothing new?

234
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:13,745
Nothing with work?

235
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,149
You don't talk about
the Dollhouse much anymore.

236
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,652
No. I don't.

237
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,855
Okay.

238
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,857
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,159
I know I'm being...

240
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,931
I'll be fine.

241
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,834
I'm fine and you're adorable.

242
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,936
You're beyond
adorable, you're...

243
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,339
If you say "adorabubble,"
I'm leaving.

244
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,108
I wasn't going to,
but I love the fact

245
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,276
you thought it was
the next logical word.

246
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,449
I'll clear.

247
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,618
No, no, no.

248
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,655
Wow. What a gentleman.

249
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,757
Well, it could also be
I made a mess in the kitchen

250
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,358
and I don't want you to see.

251
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,288
You don't seem like
an old friend.

252
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,524
I was backpacking,

253
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,892
like the kids do.

254
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,928
She sort of took me
under her wing and

255
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,096
showed me Morocco.

256
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,632
Hmm. And you
stayed in touch.

257
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,968
She'd call and
we'd talk for hours.

258
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,937
We were very close.

259
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,272
Hmm.

260
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,708
I think she liked
having an outsider

261
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,043
to sort of share
her little insights with.

262
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,244
Huh.

263
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,446
Always gushing

264
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,548
about her loved ones.
You know how she was.

265
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,486
What?

266
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,954
We're talking about
the same woman, right?

267
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,322
Tall, blonde hair.
Margaret Merriam

268
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,957
Bashford.
Stern look
stuck on her face?

269
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,225
Mid-50s, liked horses?

270
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,526
Yes. Margaret.

271
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,261
I knew her very well.

272
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,067
Mom wasn't exactly
a bundle of warmth.

273
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,303
She tended to
push people off.

274
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,672
Like a bulldozer.

275
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,973
She did like to befriend

276
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,575
complete strangers
for short outbursts,

277
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,809
and have them stay
for the weekend

278
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,511
wearing all of my clothes.

279
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,780
Bulldozer? That wasn't a stranger.

280
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,281
that was Camille Beauvais,
the tennis player.

281
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,150
Well, she was a stranger
to me, and she was rude.

282
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,985
She just looked better
in your clothes than you did.

283
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,453
Oh, my God,
you slept with her, didn't you?

284
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,155
Technically, no,
we didn't sleep...

285
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,492
Ah, Nicky, just like me when I was your age.

286
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,527
Wooing all the women

287
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,028
and sort of
worthless.

288
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,463
He is not worthless.

289
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,831
Nicolas has loads of potential.

290
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,001
Margaret told me.

291
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,170
It's funny how you
not doing anything

292
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,471
was called potential,

293
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,473
and me working my ass off
was called a pipe dream.

294
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,143
This isn't a funeral for
your photography career.

295
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,878
Oh! What do you know, Uncle Bill?

296
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,713
We haven't seen you
since Mother banned you

297
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,515
after the boat fiasco.

298
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,016
I was, like, 12.

299
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,819
Yes, Margaret could be awful,
but so can I.

300
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,821
And from what I can gauge,
the two of you are hideous.

301
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,856
So, come on.

302
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,191
You should have seen our mother.

303
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,793
Of course, you would
have turned to stone.

304
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,695
Margaret was nothing
like Mother!

305
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,197
Your... mother.

306
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,000
You knew Nana?
Right now we should
be drinking...

307
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,067
I wasn't aware you'd stopped...

308
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,068
To Margaret.

309
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,405
To the woman she was, and to all

310
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,873
she left behind.

311
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,175
Split three ways.

312
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,312
I know Margaret was guarded,

313
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,348
but she did have
a soft side.

314
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,984
She fell in love with Jack.

315
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,420
Mm-hmm.

316
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,689
Well, she did like him better
than she liked us, I suppose.

317
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,326
She loved you.
I haven't seen much of Prince Charming.

318
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,695
Deep in grief, I suppose.

319
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,764
Well, after she slapped him down
at long last,

320
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,199
he's sulking.

321
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,667
Slapped him down?

322
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,935
She left him the horses.

323
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,170
She knew he didn't know
anything about them,

324
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,840
didn't care about them, but he
got them instead of money.

325
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,142
Don't you think... No.

326
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,379
That's because she treasured
the horses and she trusted him.

327
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,948
Well, I'm glad

328
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,916
that she's not around to see
how he's taking that.

329
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,551
Oh, what did he expect?

330
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,919
They were in love.

331
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,822
Julia, I know
we're being terribly shocking,

332
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,891
and you're being
charmingly loyal,

333
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,893
but you may want
to brace yourself.

334
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,797
You may be here to
mourn Margaret Bashford,

335
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,366
but the rest of us,
we just live here.

336
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,445
Hey.

337
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,280
Oh, Nicolas.

338
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,615
I needed some air.

339
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:47,085
I think I need to explain
something about tonight.

340
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:52,223
Mother thought sentiment
made you... cloudy.

341
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,959
I know we sound harsh,

342
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,461
but she never
would've wanted

343
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,430
a bunch of flowery tributes
that people didn't mean.

344
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,300
She was that hard?

345
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,168
Well, a lot of it was fear.

346
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,439
Huh. She was terrified
that we'd have no ambition,

347
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,808
so she made us work
for everything.

348
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,811
I like numbers, percentages.

349
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,715
So, she decided I'd
work on Wall Street.

350
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,684
Rode me about it every day.

351
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,252
She wouldn't let it lie.

352
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,521
That's not so...

353
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,923
I was 12.

354
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,592
She wanted the best for you!

355
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,528
Yeah.

356
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,863
I'm sorry.

357
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,266
I'm not trying to lecture you.
I'm trying to...

358
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,601
comfort you.

359
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,936
You are?

360
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,872
Inside, she...

361
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,043
She told me that she cried
over all your pains,

362
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,378
and she thought...

363
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,380
she thought all the time
about what it was like

364
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,884
when you were small
and she could hold you and...

365
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,386
and how proud she was

366
00:15:55,454 --> 00:16:00,191
when you grew into this
handsome, confident man.

367
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,061
Whoa!

368
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,329
Are you, uh, gonna...

369
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,331
Ugh! I don't, uh...
Yeah?

370
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,665
I don't think so.

371
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,100
You okay? Want
some water? No?

372
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,335
No. I'm okay.
Okay?

373
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,371
Well, I mean, it seemed
like you wanted to...

374
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,206
No.
Subconsciously?

375
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,542
No!
You said
you wanted to comfort me.

376
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,710
Not with my tongue.

377
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,311
You also checked out my body.
I saw that.

378
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,246
God! Oh!

379
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,615
Okay, well,

380
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,952
this is a new personal
worst for me.

381
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,787
I'm so sorry.

382
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,456
I had too much wine.

383
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,725
Look, I...

384
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,960
gotta go.

385
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,695
Okay.
Yeah.

386
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,637
Oh, hey.

387
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,808
Wrong room, my mistake.

388
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,243
No, wait.

389
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,112
You must be Julia.

390
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,381
Margaret told me
about you.

391
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,883
I don't know
how I got so turned around.

392
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,686
Well, it's a big place.

393
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,959
Jack...

394
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,328
what Margaret did--

395
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:15,833
I hope you know
it was a gesture of trust.

396
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,303
What-what... what she did?

397
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,506
Leaving you the horses.

398
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,408
It was her way of saying

399
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,978
she knew you weren't in this
for the money.

400
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,213
Right.

401
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,817
So you get it?

402
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,387
The, uh... horses...

403
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,890
her real loves...

404
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,258
my reward.

405
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,460
Her real...? No.

406
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,561
That's...

407
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,264
You were with them
tonight, weren't you?

408
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,533
They call me a killer
or just a gold digger?

409
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,002
Killer?
Why would they say that?

410
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,103
Search me.

411
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,905
Inheritance like I got?

412
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,307
Not exactly worth
killing for, is it?

413
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,886
Addy, it's just so...

414
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,022
ugly.

415
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,524
I love these people,
but I don't like them.

416
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,560
What if one of them...?

417
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,261
Oh, God.

418
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,564
Killed you?

419
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,965
Am I being paranoid?

420
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,800
You spent a year and a half

421
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,802
having regular painful
brain scans

422
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,405
because you thought
someone was going to murder you.

423
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,208
So, paranoid
is still a contender.

424
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,043
I thought it would be a maid.

425
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,177
Margaret...

426
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,879
Someone who resented my money.

427
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,682
A distant friend, maybe.

428
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:42,420
God, Adelle,
there's just so much anger.

429
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,990
At least the first time I died
thinking people loved me.

430
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,426
All just a worthless illusion.

431
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,828
Illusions aren't worthless.

432
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,931
They're at the heart
of most relationships.

433
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,434
I suppose you'd be out of a job
if they weren't.

434
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,902
We'll figure this out.

435
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,903
Of course.

436
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,806
I should've stayed dead.

437
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,285
Yes?

438
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,191
Eternal life.

439
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,460
Nice adjective.
Excellent noun.

440
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,061
Is there more?

441
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,265
Is that something
we offer now?

442
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,633
Because...

443
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,403
...if it is, that's...

444
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,141
You realize that's the beginning
of the end.

445
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,777
Life everlasting--
it's...

446
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,279
it's the ultimate quest.

447
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,648
Christianity,
most religion, morality

448
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,650
doesn't exist
without the fear of death.

449
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,984
I'm not planning on presiding

450
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,953
over the end
of Western civilization.

451
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,755
This is a one-time situation.

452
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,490
You know that you're asking her
to voluntarily die

453
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,824
when the time comes.

454
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,326
Well, if she resists,

455
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,296
I have a new head of security
who handles that kind of thing.

456
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,597
Hmm.

457
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,299
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,205
You can still help
Echo, you know.

459
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,539
Tell me your take on this.

460
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,309
First instinct.

461
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,611
Follow the money.

462
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,645
That's not easy.

463
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,647
It is when the money runs.

464
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,182
I've looked into the horses.

465
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,986
One of them, King's Ransom, was
a derby contender not long ago.

466
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,155
So the husband stands
to make a bundle.

467
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,823
So does the buyer.

468
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,459
I thought I'd send someone to
take a look around the stables.

469
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,629
A breeder with a naturally <i>
curious streak.

470
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,566
Drew Chilton?

471
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,901
Glad to meet you.

472
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,402
Thanks for coming
all the way out here.

473
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,238
Well, you've got
some fine incentives.

474
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,272
Yes, I do.

475
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,840
One in particular.

476
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,375
Right this way.

477
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,810
Hope you've been
treating him right,

478
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,111
a fine horse like that.

479
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,613
Oh, fresh water,
fresh oats,

480
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,881
and barbecue
on the weekends.

481
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,917
Who among us could
ask for more?

482
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,220
So, this place been
in your family long?

483
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,929
Hey.

484
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,264
Go away.

485
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,232
Sure.

486
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,737
Wait. I'm... I'm sor... sorry.

487
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:17,241
Um... I'm just...

488
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,243
God, I'm so emo.

489
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,613
Are you?

490
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,016
Uh...

491
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,350
I have to say,

492
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,353
there's a part of me
that's not sad

493
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,555
to see someone
mourning my friend.

494
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,157
Is that what this is?

495
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,499
You lost your mother.

496
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,435
It's only natural
you'd be so elmo.

497
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,770
Emo.

498
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,204
That's not a word, sweetie.

499
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,373
God, you sound just like her.

500
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,211
She didn't even know me.

501
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,048
She didn't know me
any more than you do.

502
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,249
She didn't want to.

503
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,984
I'm sure that's not true.

504
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,087
I take pictures.

505
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,588
I'm good.

506
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,824
She never came to a single one
of my exhibitions.

507
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,859
You were serious about that?

508
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,297
I mean, obviously
you were serious about that.

509
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,302
You're right.

510
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,972
That was very bad of her.

511
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,441
I don't... I don't know
what to say.

512
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,310
All of her lectures
about being practical,

513
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,779
and then she throws herself
at some little tropical cookie

514
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,114
she picked up in Manila.

515
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,382
He is my age!

516
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,584
Some tropical...
Jocelyn!

517
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,919
He played her like a fool.

518
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,654
He spent her money,
and he probably slept

519
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,423
with every woman
who set foot in this place.

520
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,758
Did he...

521
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,828
Tell me, did he ever try...

522
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,096
With me?

523
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,530
God, no.

524
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,366
Although I wouldn't
put it past him.

525
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,201
If you don't believe me,
go talk to him.

526
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,169
When your ass hits the sheets,
you'll know.

527
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,005
I spent my whole life,

528
00:22:55,073 --> 00:23:00,444
watching her being...
you know, tough,

529
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,180
and it was okay
that she didn't let me in

530
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,883
because she didn't
let anyone in.

531
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,052
Right?

532
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,387
And then, uh...

533
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,389
two years ago, she meets Jack,

534
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:16,794
and she's all fluttering
and whispering secrets,

535
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,463
and then...

536
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,532
now there's you.

537
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,609
Whatever.

538
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,417
Holy...! Oh.

539
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,684
Sorry.

540
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,053
You can't be here.

541
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,756
I need you to run some prints.

542
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,091
They're entered,

543
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,359
all keyed up.

544
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,830
Just need authorization.

545
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,707
Comfy?

546
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,709
I... I shouldn't do this.

547
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,378
I got prints
on someone

548
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,612
who might be a missing person.

549
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,381
You got prints on someone

550
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,882
who might be a Doll, you mean?

551
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,217
They are missing people,
you know.

552
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,586
They just... don't know it.

553
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,258
My God, it's her.

554
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,526
How do we access the file?

555
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,195
Polly Keller?

556
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,132
Oh, my God.
What...?

557
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,400
They're gone.

558
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,968
What just happened?

559
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,310
I just started to believe you.

560
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,952
Earth-identical gravity and
atmosphere on other planets.

561
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,119
Is that two?

562
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,054
I'll give you one.

563
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,088
That's fair.

564
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,890
One ecosystem
for a whole planet.

565
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,391
Good.

566
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:58,362
Human-alien cross-breeding
without scientific intervention.

567
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,396
Nice.

568
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,831
Flame-y explosions

569
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,700
and sound in a vacuum.

570
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,001
Yes!

571
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,402
Good job.

572
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,571
Oh, but there's
so much more.

573
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,075
Light speed travel, space storms
and a sexy sexy alien.

574
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,078
Uh-uh, I said
classic sci-fi errors.

575
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,681
Now you're just attacking
good storytelling.

576
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,350
Speaking of sci-fi,

577
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,918
can we play with the sleepies?

578
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,753
No.
Come on, Topher.

579
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,788
We could have them
battle one another

580
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,191
and bet on them
like gladiators.

581
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,529
We can't play with the sleepies.

582
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,564
Or we could have them
act out skits we write,

583
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,000
film it and see who gets
more hits on YouTube.

584
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,268
That's...

585
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,003
not a bad idea, but no.

586
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,838
You want to play chess?

587
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,774
A variant? Flying chess.

588
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,909
Excellent.
But how about

589
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,510
every time you lose a piece
you drink?

590
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,678
Sounds good.

591
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,015
Advantage, me.

592
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,291
Hey.

593
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,993
I couldn't
help, but...

594
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,629
Are you going somewhere?

595
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,830
Yep.

596
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,300
I got the first ticket
to Not Here.

597
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,801
Margaret belonged here.

598
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,102
I didn't.

599
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,270
I just belonged to her.

600
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,978
She seemed very devoted to you.

601
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,646
Hmm.

602
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,315
Yeah.

603
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,956
Was it hard?

604
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,191
Was what what?

605
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,362
Being married to someone older?

606
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,831
A man like you

607
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,567
would have options.

608
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,938
Hand me that tie?

609
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:53,177
Maybe you didn't
exercise those options.

610
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,878
Maybe...

611
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,080
maybe you waited
very patiently

612
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,482
till you were free.

613
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,225
I know who you are.

614
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,227
I don't know

615
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,564
which of them hired you,

616
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,599
but I know a spy
when I see one.

617
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,801
What are you trying
to find out?

618
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,203
If I killed her,

619
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,739
or if I'm onto
the person who did?

620
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,409
Either way, what
Wearing her perfume,.

621
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,245
trying this
summer stock seduction.

622
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,716
You working for Nicolas?

623
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,685
Jocelyn?

624
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,654
Tell them they're looking
in the wrong place.

625
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,022
Tell them I'm
selling the horses

626
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,490
because I can't stand
the constant reminder

627
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:40,758
of the woman I loved.

628
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,861
Oh.

629
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,463
They want a
real bad guy--

630
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,299
tell them to look at
dear old Uncle Bill.

631
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,505
He just came
for the funeral.

632
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,007
Oh, no.

633
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,509
Didn't he mention that?

634
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,844
He came the day
before she died.

635
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,146
He did?

636
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,849
That was after
the last...

637
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,818
the last time I spoke
to Margaret.

638
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,319
He showed up
out of nowhere.

639
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,355
Needed to talk to her.

640
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,424
About what?

641
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,928
She said she'd
tell me later.

642
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,730
If I had to guess,

643
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,465
I'd say he wanted
to borrow money.

644
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,268
And I guess she said no.

645
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,241
William?

646
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,194
h, there, there you go, boy.

647
00:28:34,262 --> 00:28:35,629
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

648
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:37,464
Okay, okay.

649
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:39,733
Not short on spirit.

650
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,269
Oh, gorgeous.

651
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:44,371
I worked with his sire
a few years back.

652
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,273
This one's got better hooves.

653
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:47,674
What about EIPH?

654
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:49,777
No history of
hemorrhaging.

655
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,814
His lungs are fine.

656
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:55,883
Who the hell are you?

657
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,219
I'm gonna buy this here horse,
if everything works out.

658
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:02,222
He barely waited for her body
to be in the ground.

659
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,724
What was that?

660
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,659
This was my mother's horse.

661
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,728
It was her favorite... thing.

662
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:09,997
I can't believe
the bastard's selling it.

663
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,498
He should.

664
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,667
This horse has got another
year of racing in him.

665
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:14,668
You think so?

666
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:15,769
At least.

667
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,672
Won't fetch this price
forever, though.

668
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,941
You know what, I don't want
to hear about it.

669
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,443
Whatever you're
doing, stop.

670
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,611
Stop thinking, stop testing.

671
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,181
He's not for sale.

672
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,661
Do you believe in ghosts?

673
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,331
Uh, sort of.

674
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,166
Just recently.

675
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,872
Margaret and I moved into
this house when we were kids.

676
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,540
We were convinced
it was haunted.

677
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:56,643
Slept in the same bed
the first night.

678
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,413
Anyway--

679
00:29:59,481 --> 00:30:03,016
I'm getting the same
creepy feeling again, now.

680
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:07,020
Like Margaret is lingering here.

681
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:09,656
And she's angry.

682
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,191
Why would she be angry?

683
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,093
'Cause she wanted more time.

684
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:15,762
You know, we hadn't said
one word to each other

685
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,165
in 13 years.

686
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,134
She wouldn't pick
up the phone.

687
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:23,303
'Cause she was
too damn stubborn.

688
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:24,571
And you?

689
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,073
Why wouldn't you call?

690
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,142
'Cause I was too
damn stubborn.

691
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,679
But fate grabbed an old fool
by the scruff of his neck

692
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,748
and brought me here.

693
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:37,184
Just in time.

694
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,987
The day before she died.

695
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:42,289
I just knocked
on the door.

696
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:47,628
Can't say she was thrilled
to see me at first,

697
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:50,330
but I expected as much.

698
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,833
The important thing--
we reconciled.

699
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,703
Can you...

700
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,206
can you tell me what she said?

701
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,576
"Hey, remember the time...?"

702
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,311
"Yeah, yeah."

703
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:08,015
No, it wasn't
the words that mattered.

704
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:10,551
It was...

705
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,986
she just looked in my face

706
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:15,789
and I looked
in hers.

707
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:18,659
And we just both knew there
was no reason to stay mad.

708
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,698
Here's to you, Margaret.

709
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:32,272
Mm.

710
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,675
Well, I guess I was
the lucky one.

711
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:36,777
Nicolas would be coping
with this better

712
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:40,080
if he'd talk to her
about his debts and all that.

713
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,150
Addiction--
not for the faint of heart.

714
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:51,858
In a world where all men

715
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:55,529
are guilty until proven dead,

716
00:31:55,597 --> 00:32:00,467
one man stand as our only hope
in the fight against...

717
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:44,411
Aw!

718
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,313
I told you I've
got your back.

719
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,815
Nice.

720
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,618
Or "I told you
you'd get it in the end."

721
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:54,221
"The quickest way to a man's
heart is through his back."

722
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:57,891
"I'm sending you bac<i>k
t</i>o the future... of being dead."

723
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:00,694
This one's going nowhere.

724
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:02,329
What are we at?

725
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,097
Tied up. Best of seven?

726
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:06,166
Eleven.

727
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:08,869
Hey, you.

728
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,375
How was your day?

729
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:16,743
Uh, you know,

730
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:17,911
fine I guess.

731
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,746
I let myself in
a little while ago.

732
00:33:19,814 --> 00:33:20,847
Hope you don't mind.

733
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,015
You have a key.

734
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,551
I know, but it's just...
your apartment

735
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,286
and with everything lately,

736
00:33:26,354 --> 00:33:27,788
I don't know, I don't
want you thinking

737
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,456
I'm in here nuzzling your
shirts while you're gone.

738
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:31,124
Anything weird like that.

739
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:32,359
Good to know.

740
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,927
I mean, they smell really good.

741
00:33:33,995 --> 00:33:35,262
Some of them not so much,

742
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:36,630
but overall your shirts
are nuzzle-worthy.

743
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,701
Joke.

744
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,569
Geez,

745
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:44,604
so grumpy.

746
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:51,478
That looks nice.

747
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:53,480
It's Cabernet.

748
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:54,915
I bought it.

749
00:33:54,982 --> 00:33:56,416
I should have gotten
white, though.

750
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:57,684
Red wine makes
my teeth purple.

751
00:33:57,752 --> 00:33:58,719
Paul, we have to talk.

752
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,554
Okay.

753
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,855
Well, you don't have to talk,

754
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:04,991
but you have to let
me talk at you.

755
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:06,827
Because I've been
thinking a lot, and...

756
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:09,062
Just let me do this, okay?

757
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,465
Good.

758
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:14,935
Paul...

759
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,970
Mellie.

760
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:20,340
I like being with you.

761
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:23,176
I love it, actually.

762
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,512
And you say
everything's fine,

763
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,414
so I'm going to stop
asking if it is.

764
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,517
If that means lying next to you
while everything's not fine,

765
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:33,320
then that's
what I'll do.

766
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:34,955
I will give you

767
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:38,525
what you need and let you
take it from me.

768
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:41,561
And if you want to give back,
give back.

769
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,463
But it doesn't have
to mean anything.

770
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:46,066
It doesn't have
to mean anything.

771
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:51,898
I've still got it,
don't I, handsome?

772
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:00,674
I know. I miss you more.

773
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,155
Strange-- he doesn't like most people.

774
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:16,656
Who's there?

775
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:21,695
I have a better question.

776
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:26,533
Did you think I wouldn't
recognize my own mother...

777
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,535
Mother?

778
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:33,773
Honestly, it's a relief.

779
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,376
I couldn't tell a soul
what was going on,
Mm-hmm.

780
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,612
and it was
proving difficult.

781
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,447
How did you know?

782
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:41,848
Well, little things,
you know,

783
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,683
like the way you moved.

784
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:46,152
And I watched you through
your window the other night

785
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,889
when you were trying to go
to bed in your old room.

786
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,090
Same routine as always.

787
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:52,058
You checked the shutters,
flipped the light switch

788
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,027
down the hall
that's impossible to find.

789
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,196
Nobody knows where
it is but you.

790
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:58,198
But I didn't really know

791
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:01,234
until I saw you
with King's Ransom.
Oh.

792
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,569
It was definitely after

793
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,837
I tried to kiss you.

794
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,238
Oh...

795
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,008
Well, I should
hope so.

796
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:11,878
But, I mean, how would you
ever even think it was possible?

797
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:14,714
The Dollhouse.

798
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:16,216
In Manhattan, right?

799
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:18,084
I am a customer.

800
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,319
Nicolas.

801
00:37:19,387 --> 00:37:20,387
What? So are you.

802
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:22,889
We're all adults here, sort of.

803
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:25,425
I didn't use it
for anything like this.

804
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,460
I mean, life after death?

805
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:29,429
I never even
considered that.

806
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,031
I don't get to keep it.

807
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:33,767
I didn't think so.

808
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,336
Although,
the possibilities...

809
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:39,506
Living forever,
moving from body to body.

810
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:41,675
Brilliant.

811
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,678
People should know that
you are to be feared, Mother.

812
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:47,280
Even after death.

813
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,648
Feared?

814
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,718
Nicky,

815
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:54,354
I only ever wanted
you to be happy.

816
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:55,822
I'm your mother.

817
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,058
I'm supposed to
bear your burdens,

818
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:02,462
even if you
lost everything.

819
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:07,200
I couldn't stop.

820
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:10,570
Gambling is all
about ups and downs,

821
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:13,773
and when it seems like
you have all these...

822
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:15,875
all these resources,

823
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:19,079
you can just wait around
for another upswing,

824
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:21,514
so I-I kept
chasing losses...

825
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:23,350
And then you
hit bottom.

826
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:26,286
And I went below it.

827
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:27,821
Nicolas.

828
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,925
That's millions.

829
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:34,394
I knew that you would
be ashamed of me

830
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,630
and that you wouldn't
let it lie,

831
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:39,699
so I-I couldn't tell you.

832
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,369
I couldn't tell you.

833
00:38:42,436 --> 00:38:43,470
Okay, okay.

834
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:45,972
We'll...

835
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,408
It'll be all right.

836
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:50,276
After you died,

837
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:52,679
part of me was relieved
because you never knew.

838
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:56,516
But now, I just want you back.

839
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,953
You were taken
from me too soon.

840
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:03,690
Smart boy.

841
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,158
You suspect that, too.

842
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:07,594
Look, he's supposed to be worth
over $4 million.

843
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:09,262
Go, go, go!

844
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:12,465
You think you can hustle me?

845
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,200
Oh, what the hell
do you mean?

846
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,069
King's Ransom
has been juiced.

847
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:18,538
Anabolic steroids,
stimulants.

848
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,873
Enough to make
his heart pop.

849
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,642
You really think you
could hide this

850
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,010
with a little
clomiphene citrate?

851
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:26,046
I mean, masking agents can't
hide themselves, you know.

852
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,681
If I wasn't looking for it,
I might have been fooled,

853
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:29,716
but I ain't a baby
in this freaking business.

854
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:32,552
You were going
for a money grab.

855
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,020
Trying to pass
that horse off

856
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:35,789
as race ready,
raise his value.

857
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:37,323
He looks that way now,

858
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:39,225
but a couple weeks
without that stuff,

859
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,528
he'll be put to pasture.

860
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,329
I know you're
new to this,

861
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:44,764
but in layman's terms,

862
00:39:44,832 --> 00:39:47,367
you just made yourself
a $4 million pet.

863
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:28,742
He killed me.

864
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:29,909
Oh, God.

865
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,344
Whatever he gave
to King's Ransom,

866
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:32,512
that's what he used on me.

867
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,713
Okay, okay.

868
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:34,948
Calm down.
We have to think.

869
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,750
Why? Why don't I
just walk out there

870
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:38,551
and let him kill me twice?
I'm dead anyway.

871
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:39,919
Because you can prove
that he did it.

872
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:41,554
You can get him the
punishment that he des...

873
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:46,426
Run!

874
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:03,610
Sorry to disturb
you, ma'am.

875
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:06,579
Not at all.

876
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:07,781
Victor tested the horse

877
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:09,382
and I just got
the results.

878
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,683
My hunch was correct.

879
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,519
They were tied together.

880
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:13,987
Your friend was
killed with a drug

881
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,522
that was being
given to the horse.

882
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:19,058
The killer masked it, so
the coroner didn't find it.

883
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:21,561
Any idea who?

884
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,763
No.

885
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:25,431
If I went in...

886
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:27,400
She has a new handler.

887
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:29,702
You're going to have
to get used to it.

888
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,405
Yes, I guess I am.

889
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:35,575
One other thing,
Ms. DeWitt.

890
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:39,312
Are you aware of this
Topher situation?

891
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,248
Yes.

892
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:45,952
There's no need to address
the issue with him.

893
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,787
I allow him one of

894
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:51,257
thes<i>e diagnostic tests
e</i>very now and<i> again.

895
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:57,764
So, I guess Topher
can make friends.

896
00:41:57,832 --> 00:42:00,800
Loneliness leads to nothing good.

897
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:03,570
Only<i> detachment.

898
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:06,773
<i>And sometimes the people</i>
who most<i> need to reach out

899
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:09,175
are the <i>people
least</i> capable of it.

900
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:11,277
In any c<i>ase...

901
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,615
<i>...it only happens once a year.

902
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:29,362
Come on, come on, come on.

903
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,797
He's coming.

904
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:31,998
What's your plan?

905
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:33,466
You got a gun stashed somewhere?

906
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,235
No. You know how
I feel about guns.

907
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,636
Though I'm warming up
to them right now.

908
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:38,538
Evidence.

909
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:40,039
There-There is evidence
that he killed you.

910
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:41,507
Just the drug,
but we can't prove...

911
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:43,009
No, not that.

912
00:42:44,678 --> 00:42:46,045
A letter from Margaret Bashford

913
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:47,847
in her own handwriting,
written a week ago

914
00:42:47,915 --> 00:42:48,882
and hidden somewhere
in this room.

915
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:50,550
Nicky, that's brilliant.

916
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,518
Great letter. Says that
he'd do it, when he'd do it,

917
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:55,355
and how he'd do it.
Okay.

918
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:58,224
to eat this up.

919
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,699
What was the date,
the day I died?

920
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:07,901
The 19th.

921
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:12,605
It's all here.

922
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,807
How he'll use
the same masking agent

923
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,677
he's been doping
the horses with to...

924
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:19,545
Jack didn't know
much about them.

925
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:21,547
Uh, we have to hurry.
Let's find a place to hide it.

926
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,752
How would he learn
how to drug a racehorse?

927
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:27,420
Well, he must
have had help.

928
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:28,688
It's not that hard to find

929
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,623
someone with that type
of knowledge, you know?

930
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,758
He must have, uh...

931
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,301
Oh, Mother.

932
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:46,940
You could never let things lie.

933
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,061
Nicolas.

934
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,696
What are you doing?

935
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,698
What in the hell do I have to do
to get you off my damn back,

936
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,799
Mother?

937
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,134
This was difficult the first time.

938
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,469
But being around you more,
it's getting easier.

939
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:00,603
Nicky, I love you.

940
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,239
I can even see why
you drugged King's Ransom.

941
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,274
You thought you could sell him,
get out of a hole.

942
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:06,609
I had to make him
worth something.

943
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,611
In case all you only left me
was the damn horses.

944
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,279
But Jack got
stuck with them.

945
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,581
Even better.

946
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,216
So, you were going to kill me,
no matter what.

947
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,584
It was the only way to
get out of the hole, Mom.

948
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,785
I didn't expect
you to come back.

949
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,220
Or Jack to figure out
you did it.

950
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,055
Jack gets into
everything, doesn't he?

951
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,390
My business.

952
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,492
My mother's bed.

953
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,730
I really am sorry, Mom.

954
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,831
No!

955
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,566
This is going
to sting a little.

956
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,938
I knew it was you.

957
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:04,817
Darling!
Are you all right?

958
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:06,819
He killed my wife.

959
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:08,755
Jack, are you all right?!

960
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:10,623
He murdered Margaret.

961
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:11,924
He killed my wife.

962
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:15,128
What the hell is going on?

963
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:16,763
Call an ambulance.

964
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,764
And the police.

965
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:20,633
Okay.

966
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,007
Margaret.

967
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:29,609
Yes?

968
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,811
I hope she didn't know...

969
00:45:31,879 --> 00:45:34,714
didn't know the truth
about her son.

970
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:36,582
It would have killed her.

971
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,651
It did.

972
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:48,127
"...most likely
with clomiphene citrate

973
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:51,297
or any other drug used
to mask the doping of horses..."

974
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:52,765
My God. She knew?

975
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,334
"...on or around the 19th.

976
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:58,037
"You will also find

977
00:45:58,105 --> 00:45:59,839
"enclosed a last will
and testament,

978
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:02,175
"adjusted in light of these
recent discoveries.

979
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:03,342
"As you may imagine,

980
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,179
"Nicolas now gets nothing,

981
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:08,448
"but he will be spending
his life behind bars no doubt,

982
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,183
"so what use would it be to him?

983
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,019
"In any case, that means

984
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:15,421
"more for everybody else.

985
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:18,191
Yay."

986
00:46:18,258 --> 00:46:20,493
Mother wrote this?

987
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,298
"Jocelyn,

988
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,401
"I know that the tone
of this document

989
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:30,636
"may seem out of character,

990
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,005
"but in these final days,
I am feeling different,

991
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:34,707
"wise and full of warmth,

992
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:38,678
"and I would love to say
a few things to each of you

993
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:41,547
before I go."

994
00:46:41,615 --> 00:46:44,584
That was pretty crazy last night.

995
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:48,421
I don't know if I can handle
that all the time, but...

996
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:50,356
I kind of liked it.

997
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:53,159
Not all the time, though.

998
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,695
So, you going to do
more hunting today?

999
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:57,263
For Dollhouse clients?

1000
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:00,299
I've found one.

1001
00:47:08,775 --> 00:47:10,843
I don't know when
I'll have the chance

1002
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,845
to see something
like this again.

1003
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,583
I wish Margaret was here.

1004
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,323
You could, um...

1005
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:26,926
pretend she
could hear you.

1006
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:32,064
No, I... I don't believe
in that stuff.

1007
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,135
I just hope I did what
I could when she was here.

1008
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:37,436
You know?

1009
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,375
I tried to show her
as best I could that she was...

1010
00:47:45,712 --> 00:47:47,280
...he was my favorite person.

1011
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:49,849
Plain and simple.

1012
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:54,987
But I'll never know
if she believed me.

1013
00:47:55,055 --> 00:47:58,891
I have a feeling she did.

1014
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:23,482
Tell me you weren't tempted,
even a little

1015
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,284
not to come back
here today,

1016
00:48:25,352 --> 00:48:28,821
just to disappear
in this body.

1017
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:32,058
Maybe a little.

1018
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:35,027
But I've had my turn,

1019
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:37,096
and the people I love
are moving on.

1020
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,299
Besides...

1021
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,335
Besides?

1022
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:44,804
I know you, Adelle.

1023
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:47,006
You're too much like me.

1024
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:50,376
I wouldn't have gotten as far as the airport.

1025
00:49:00,254 --> 00:49:02,521
Addy?
Yes?

1026
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:06,959
Will I see my whole life flash before my eyes?

1027
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,894
Every single moment.
