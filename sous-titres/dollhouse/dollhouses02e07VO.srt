1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:01,375
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:03,586
I remember everything.

3
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:05,455
I've been many people.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,140
I'm all of them,

5
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:09,842
but none of them is me.

6
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:13,304
- You're out of your jurisdiction.
- You have my Active. I'd like her back.

7
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:16,335
I trust we'll find her undamaged.

8
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,643
I'll let my programmer know
you're coming.

9
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,102
Good-bye, Caroline.

10
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,022
I'm Bennett.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,482
What's up with your arm?

12
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,152
We plug my disruptor into the biolink
system and put them to sleep.

13
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:30,098
We need to find Echo.

14
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,894
She's lost in the world
in Doll-state,

15
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:34,173
utterly helpless.

16
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,237
Bennett has twice
the resources I have.

17
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,362
She thinks she runs that House.

18
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:42,487
And she might, for all I know.

19
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:44,587
But there is one thing

20
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:46,752
of which I am certain.

21
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:49,382
I have a cooler office.

22
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:52,455
What happened in DC?

23
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,391
It's confidential.

24
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:58,669
If you want me to learn,

25
00:00:58,794 --> 00:01:01,477
at some point, you're going to have
to trust me with important information.

26
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:05,012
I will never trust another woman
as long as I live.

27
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:09,371
She totally went

28
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:11,897
all Cylon on me and sent

29
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:15,116
a sleeperized assassin
after Echo right behind my back.

30
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:16,826
Disarmed me with her arm

31
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,370
and glasses and face.

32
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,434
Mostly.

33
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,737
But underneath it all,
she is ice-cold.

34
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:24,542
No, truly wicked.

35
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,919
With a shriveled-up

36
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:28,964
raisin of a heart.

37
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:31,757
I wonder what she's doing right now.

38
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:35,901
- So, what happened?
- I punched her in the kisser,

39
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,939
not what I was planning
to do there, by the way,

40
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,481
and knocked her out cold,

41
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:42,059
which she might have been impressed by
if she hadn't been out cold.

42
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:43,565
I mean to Echo.

43
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:45,855
What happened to Echo?

44
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,119
We don't know.

45
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,373
She could be anywhere.
It's been days.

46
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:53,070
I don't think she's in the DC area.

47
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,656
How can she travel
without detection?

48
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,574
She might be hitchhiking.

49
00:01:58,506 --> 00:01:59,606
Hitchhiking?

50
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,371
No tickets, no records.
Don't need money.

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,866
Rossum is watching us very closely.

52
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:10,046
Paul Ballard is still AWOL.
Find him.

53
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,259
Find Echo.

54
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,094
Even if it is in a ditch somewhere.

55
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,381
Episode 207: <i>Meet Jane Doe</i>

56
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:07,358
www.subbercafe.fr

57
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,391
You know you have to pay for that.

58
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:48,354
With money.

59
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,021
That's right.

60
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,397
Where do I get it?

61
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,595
I hear it grows on trees.

62
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,861
Why don't you move along, girl.
I don't want any trouble.

63
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:58,410
Where is this tree?

64
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:00,573
Right through that door right there.

65
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:22,111
- Lady, we don't take those.
- I would like money, please.

66
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,318
I need money... Dinero.

67
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:25,728
<i>Comprende</i>?

68
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,311


69
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,043
Yeah, I know. You've got food stamps.
We don't take them.

70
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:32,932


71
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:36,191
You're going to have to leave
so I can take care of other customers.

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,569
Go on...
before I call the cops.

73
00:04:39,107 --> 00:04:39,862
Police.

74
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:41,066


75
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,406
Out.

76
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,178
There.

77
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,014
You don't have to be sad anymore.

78
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:10,559
- My name is Echo.
- Galena.

79
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:12,300
Hey there!

80
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:14,647
A little help here, sheriff?

81
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,733
Did you pay for that stuff?

82
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
Run.

83
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,910
Sheriff's department!

84
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,494


85
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,829
You no <i>habla</i> English.

86
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,546
You... are under arrest.

87
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,680
I marvel at the way
that they slip into a role,

88
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:08,686
into a life, unaware, unfeigned.

89
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:10,755
And I'm grateful
than I can afford it.

90
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,930
That I possess
the "means to satisfy my vagaries",

91
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:16,205
to quote the Marquis de Sade.

92
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,567
Thank you, Adelle.

93
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:22,042
That will be all.

94
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:24,153
And be sure to get

95
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,636
Mr. Caviezel's request
in the pipeline.

96
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:27,943
Of course.

97
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:36,103
She's the woman who sets up
these sensational little outings for me?

98
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,820
Every single detail.

99
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,134
She's gifted.

100
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,817
And quite a beauty herself.

101
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,112
In her day.

102
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,827
Mr. Kleinhan in 23
is asking for a sheet change,

103
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:54,747
Mrs. Willis in 31 needs
something to help her sleep,

104
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,798
and Mrs. Fini in 32 wants us
to put Mrs. Willis to sleep

105
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,794
because she keeps
singing show tunes.

106
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:01,327
Noted.

107
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:02,451
Deb called in.

108
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:04,329
Her head's been
in the toilet all night.

109
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,289
That means I get the jail run.

110
00:07:06,704 --> 00:07:09,470
Giving flu shots to the fine men
and women at County.

111
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,831
No, but Dr. McConnell's coming by.

112
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,393
Weren't you two going to have
another snack machine date?

113
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,476
There's nobody else
who can cover for Deb.

114
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:19,455
Unless...

115
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:23,568
I walked right into that.

116
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,817
Give it ten more minutes.
If Delta's SR levels don't drop

117
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,397
below an eight, pull him out.

118
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:33,035
And get Jacobson on the phone.

119
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,079
We're extending him to an overnight.

120
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:45,800
- Another engagement from upstairs?
- This client seems to quite enjoy pain,

121
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,968
or should I say,
derives pleasure from inflicting it.

122
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,430
- You don't approve.
- I don't have to.

123
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,913
It's already in the pipeline.

124
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,064
Feels like ages ago
that we actually weighed a request

125
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,241
against an Active's chance
of survival,

126
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,110
let alone well-being.

127
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,905
We've always put them at risk.

128
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,988
We just don't lie
to ourselves about it now.

129
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,867
You sound like Harding.

130
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:17,157
I can never tell
if you're bent out of shape

131
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,374
because you're no longer
in control of the welfare of our Actives

132
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:23,001
or because you're no longer
in control.

133
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:27,885
Who are you?

134
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:29,848
I'm Jane from the hospital.

135
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,073
Deb is sick.

136
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,847
Did I ever meet you before?

137
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,601
Don't think so.

138
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:41,163
You run a tight ship.

139
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,005
Yeah, nothing gets in
or out of here without my say-so.

140
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,779
That's how I keep
the scum off the streets

141
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,697
and away
from pretty things like you.

142
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,033


143
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,871
There you go.
Nurse.

144
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:06,294
- Can you sit down, please?
- She doesn't speak any English.

145
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,755
Strip down for the doc.

146
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,944
Are you hurt?

147
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,021
Has she been to the doctor?

148
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:26,607
Don't know.
She never said anything was wrong.

149
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,444
- Do you speak Spanish?
- No. Not like we're Immigration.

150
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,447
Still waiting
for their lazy asses to deport her.

151
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:41,883


152
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,047


153
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,294


154
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:49,589


155
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,907


156
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:54,594


157
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:56,099


158
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,439
So, we're done here?

159
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:11,085
Sorry.
I forgot to put it on vibrate.

160
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,296
She's got to get back to her cell.

161
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:16,907
Her rib's broken,

162
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,531
so I'm going to give her
something for the pain.

163
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,560
You're out of basic painkillers.

164
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:26,918
I'll have to bring
a new supply tomorrow.

165
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:28,487
In the meantime...

166
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,508


167
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,594


168
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,520


169
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:52,443
You checking up on me again?

170
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:54,048
I got it.

171
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,134
- I'm simply waiting.
- You're looming.

172
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,333
You don't see me looming
in your office.

173
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,113
Stop looming.

174
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:04,371
You said "looming"
so many times now that it sounds

175
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,998
like a nonsense word.

176
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,548
- What do you want?
- I just wanted to brainstorm.

177
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:16,926
- What were you thinking?
- Not with you.

178
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,137
What are you thinking, Doctor?

179
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:21,573
What I'm thinking is

180
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,723
if we're lowering the
cortical theta rhythms

181
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:25,774
to below four hertz,

182
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:28,938
it's possible the EEG
is being rendered useless.

183
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,326
You're suggesting
it might not be able

184
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:33,392
to pick up an impulse
from a single axon.

185
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:36,195
Maybe not. We'd need a new way
to read the projections

186
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,770
from the neocortex.

187
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,464
That's a radical theory.

188
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:41,019
What's my name?

189
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:42,694
- Doctor...
- Brink.

190
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:44,211
Radical.

191
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,250
Dr. Radical.

192
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,626
I've burned out another dozen Cplds,
trying to cool this thing down.

193
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,772
I'll order a couple hundred more.

194
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:54,892
These are polycrystalline
diamond composites.

195
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:57,770
- Do we have the budget for that?
- Indeed we do.

196
00:11:57,895 --> 00:12:01,012
As Mr. Harding says, anything
in the name of progress.

197
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:15,372
Hello?

198
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,120
You okay?

199
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,779
Fine.

200
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,207
Only, next time
don't wait for the attack.

201
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,627
Take the offensive
like we've been practicing.

202
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:36,338
Sometimes a girl likes to be chased.

203
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,758
Hungry?

204
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,568
You got in the jail?

205
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,372
Deborah missed her shift
with a stomach bug.

206
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:47,558
Which you gave her.

207
00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:50,478
It'll pass.
It's actually very cleansing.

208
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:53,188
You didn't tell me you were going
to make the move this week.

209
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,513
I wasn't sure.

210
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,596
But her coffee was just sitting
there begging for a dose.

211
00:12:57,721 --> 00:12:59,471
Can't put it off forever.

212
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:01,096
Is Galena all right?

213
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,815
She's a prisoner, Paul,
and she's not cut out for it.

214
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,035
She's getting hit.

215
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,598
I'm not sure
who's doing it, maybe Sheriff Rand.

216
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:10,873
He's not exactly a people person.

217
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:12,458
I guess that's what I am-

218
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,149
a people person.

219
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:18,725
Mac and cheese, huh?

220
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:22,364
You're not sick of it, right?

221
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:26,180
36 personalities and not
one of them could cook?

222
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,668
- Look who's talking.
- Honestly, I'm surprised.

223
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:31,894
For a romantic engagement,
there would definitely be food involved.

224
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:35,419
More terrifying insights
into the mind of Paul Ballard.

225
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:36,855
No, that's primal.

226
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,276
Sex and food are sisters
in human desire.

227
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,403
I never did a sister act...

228
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,031
with food...

229
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:45,074
with cooking food.

230
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:47,548
Okay, I'm done.

231
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:49,222
I'm moving on.

232
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:52,456
You get the layout of the jail?

233
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:55,047
All up in the House of Ideas.

234
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:58,550
I'll fire up the recall later
when I get a second wind.

235
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:00,575
- Headaches?
- Not too bad.

236
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,466
What did you access?

237
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:05,111
The medical stuff
is coming pretty easily,

238
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:07,550
thank God
Joel Mynor's wife was a nurse.

239
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:11,679
I also had to speak Spanish to Galena,
but that barely gave me a twinge.

240
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:14,065
Casing the prison was dicier.

241
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:16,703
That imprint was
borderline Rain Man.

242
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,357
Doesn't play well with others.

243
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:20,804
We can take it easy tonight.

244
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:23,641
I want to get physical.

245
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:26,447
Accessing muscle memory
relieves the pressure.

246
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:28,541
Tomorrow's a big day.

247
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,287
We got any candles?

248
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,370
What for?

249
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,020
This is our last night.

250
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,628
Once we break Galena out,
we're done.

251
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:40,244
Done?

252
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:43,657
I can't train forever.

253
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:46,526
If I can get Galena out,
that means I'm ready.

254
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,096
We have to go back
inside the Dollhouse.

255
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:53,184
You know this.

256
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:55,872
Paul, you know this.

257
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,675
So what are the candles for?

258
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:05,735
Candlelight.

259
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:08,710
When I took out that deputy,

260
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:10,715
it wasn't like a glitch,

261
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,185
the skills,

262
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:13,535
it was like...

263
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:15,289
a wave,

264
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,165
just everything rushing over me,

265
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:21,115
and then the wave pulls back,

266
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:23,975
and you see what it washed up.

267
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,815
Picking up the shells and smooth stones
from the shore,

268
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,635
collecting myself.

269
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:33,335
Why then?

270
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:37,270
Why not right after Alpha dumped
all the engagement personas in you?

271
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,625
I think it was because of Bennett.

272
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:42,635
The DC programmer.

273
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:45,665
She showed me something
Alpha didn't.

274
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,345
You said Bennett gave you
her own memory.

275
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,570
Of Caroline.

276
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,585
And it wasn't...

277
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,635
I didn't like it.

278
00:15:57,265 --> 00:16:00,835
Well, that's Bennett's perception,
and she doesn't sound remarkably stable.

279
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:04,165
But the idea
that Caroline might not be...

280
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:09,725
I've been saving this body for her.

281
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:13,014
- But I'm not her.
- You don't know that.

282
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,517
You've resisted the wipes
from the start.

283
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:19,145
You tracked down my cell
and you couldn't remember my name.

284
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,273
You knew I would help you,
keep you from DeWitt.

285
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,090
DeWitt was Caroline's enemy,
not Echo's.

286
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:27,236
Maybe it was Caroline
picking up those shells.

287
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,504
I'm not her!

288
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:31,615
My name is Echo.

289
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:37,415
I didn't mean to upset you.

290
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:41,615
You do help me.

291
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:44,855
You're my best friend.

292
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:56,655
Let's keep it that way.

293
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,235
You think I'm a freak.

294
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,425
Or a child.

295
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:09,775
I think I don't have the right.

296
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,005
It's not my other...

297
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:15,315
personas that make me feel
what I feel.

298
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,450
The Dollhouse made you fall in love,
over and over.

299
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:21,624
You told me that.

300
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,919
They also made me
aggressively sexual

301
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:27,380
and phenomenally creative in bed.

302
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:31,050
Now, that's just cruel.

303
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,835
Also sociopathic,

304
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:35,245
inexperienced, blind,

305
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:37,640
and at least seven times, gay.

306
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,320
There's a lot of noise
from the Chorus Girls,

307
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:42,945
but they're not me.

308
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,565
There is a me.

309
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:53,515
This is me.

310
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,275
Who is it?

311
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,517
Just messing with you.

312
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:13,680
I need you to sign off
on this engagement order.

313
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:16,350
Do you like the new
profile input interface?

314
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:17,725
I do, actually.

315
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,745
Just one of the many
new improvements around here.

316
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:24,320
What else does Harding
have you "improving"?

317
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:27,070
It's on a need-to-know basis.

318
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,375
Well, I need to know.

319
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,800
And why is that?

320
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:33,820
You think we're keeping secrets
from you, Adelle?

321
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:36,050
Haven't we eliminated those
from this House?

322
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:38,475
Of course. I was just curious.

323
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,198
I had a scientific mind
before I was transferred,

324
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,660
- if you remember, Matthew.
- I do.

325
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,735
Curiosity is what brought
this House into being.

326
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:49,165
True, and Topher here
will bring it into the future.

327
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:53,461
I have to say,
one of your finest moment, finding him.

328
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,004
This guy...

329
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,320
Which reminds me, I'd love to have you
in a meeting with the Northern Division.

330
00:20:58,445 --> 00:20:59,500
I'd be delighted.

331
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,052
Show off some of your concepts.

332
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,970
As long as I don't have
to wear a suit.

333
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:08,025
Don't you have a ghost to chase?

334
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:13,731
Topher's finally showing
his true colors.

335
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,643
Can you give me anything?

336
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:16,984
That's right.

337
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,402
It's Rawlings.

338
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,696
- Has he got a lead ?
- I've followed enough trails.

339
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,550
If you don't have confirmation it's her,
just get me confirmation it's not.

340
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:25,775
- When can you come in?
- Soon.

341
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:30,225
I'll bring her in soon.

342
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:34,168
Tell me where you are.

343
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,120
After spending all that time and money
on these untraceable phones?

344
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:39,395
I'll let you know when it's time.

345
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:42,468
Look, I don't need you in the field
if you're not producing.

346
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,679
<i>If we stick to the plan,
I'll drop you a clue today.</i>

347
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:46,610
Use a credit card or pay phone.

348
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:48,307
- Good enough?
- <i>I have to tell you,</i>

349
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,900
this may not be
the best time to come in.

350
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,020
<i>I don't think we have a choice.</i>

351
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:55,135
She's not saying anything,

352
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,983
but her headaches are getting worse.

353
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,068
She's deteriorating.

354
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:02,405
- I thought she was getting smarter.
- <i>She is.</i>

355
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,675
And it's taking its toll.

356
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:07,451
<i>I'll wait for your signal.</i>

357
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,619
Good luck.

358
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,085
Who was that?

359
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:19,325
He's ready when we are.

360
00:22:42,225 --> 00:22:43,790
What's wrong with you?

361
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:45,323
Sheriff, we got a situation.

362
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:49,076
She collapsed on her way
to the cafeteria for lunch.

363
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:54,582
Dilated pupils,

364
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:57,263
disorientation,
and signs of seizure.

365
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:58,961


366
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:00,338


367
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:02,380
It's epidural hematoma.

368
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:03,633
Skip the doctor talk.

369
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,375
Head trauma.
Wonder how that happened.

370
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,626
Slowed pulse, low blood pressure,

371
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:17,115
and cognitive response is...

372
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,340


373
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,268


374
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,525
Non existant.

375
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:24,990
The zipper compartment.
I need the syringe, labeled Mannitol.

376
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:26,115
Come on.

377
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:28,755
What is it?

378
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:31,953
Osmotic diuretic.
I need to reduce her ICP.

379
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:35,589


380
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,770


381
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:39,126


382
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,589
Call a doctor.
I can't stabilize her myself.

383
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,508
What are our chances if we don't?

384
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:49,912
What's happening? Do something.
Why aren't you helping her?

385
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:52,473
Do me a favor
and stop asking stupid questions.

386
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:56,769
She's in cardiac arrest.
Call a doctor! Now!

387
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,319
Never mind.

388
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:11,175
Time of death.

389
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:12,952
12:36 PM.

390
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:14,287
Time of death?

391
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:16,330
There's no time of death.
Do something!

392
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:18,865
She's gone.

393
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:20,636
Where is her medical file?

394
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:22,950
What, you're worried
I filed a report on her abuse?

395
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,880
You know how it works in here.

396
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:26,833
You have to maintain
total authority,

397
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,718
and sometimes the boys
get carried away.

398
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,970
Now, give me her file.

399
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,811
If I help this go away,
you have to do something for me.

400
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,273
- What?
- Promise it won't happen again.

401
00:24:42,743 --> 00:24:45,191
And if you don't want the feds
coming all over you,

402
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,861
I make the body disappear.

403
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,009
She's a nurse.

404
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,944
Do you know
how many undocumented patients

405
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:52,510
come into the hospital where I work?
Sometimes they die.

406
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:54,759
And when they do,
we never find out who they were.

407
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:58,515
In Spanish, we call them Fulano,
Mengano y Zutano.

408
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,375
I'll write an emergency room admission
slip time-stamped this morning,

409
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:05,296
stash her in a holding room
and say she died during a shift change.

410
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,840
It's better
than dumping her body in a ditch.

411
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,640
If we're going to do this, I need
to do it while the body's still warm.

412
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:19,698
Get her out of here.

413
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:22,364
Let's go.

414
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,592
My shift change is coming up.
We have to hurry if we want it to work.

415
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:55,137
We got a medical emergency.

416
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,640
So we're going to have
to skip the usual sign-out.

417
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:01,602
My God, she's a zombie!

418
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:03,938


419
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:06,232


420
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:08,901
What the hell are you up to?

421
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:11,945
If they were allowed to speak.

422
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:14,626
You're right.*

423
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,546
You asked to see me.

424
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,221
- Mr. Ambrose.
- Hello, Adelle.

425
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:24,166
This is Talik Raj Amin.

426
00:26:25,757 --> 00:26:26,751
Assalamu alaikum.

427
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,946
Walaikum assalam.

428
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,297
He'll be managing
our new House in Dubai,

429
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:31,931
unveiling next month.

430
00:26:32,311 --> 00:26:34,719
I wanted to introduce you
since you will be communicating

431
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,762
a lot over the next few weeks.

432
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:38,688
We plan on transferring
a few Actives

433
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:40,891
from this House to his care
for the grand opening.

434
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:44,734
If it goes as well as we project,
we'll have to send them all.

435
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:47,898
Could you please compile
a list of recommendations?

436
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,693
Mr. Langton will fill you
in on the details.

437
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,641
Feel free to use my elevator.

438
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:59,410
I want to make sure
you get the cream of the crop.

439
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,280
You need to take this House back.

440
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:11,035
And how am I supposed to do that?

441
00:27:13,943 --> 00:27:16,756
The Adelle I knew
would never ask me that question.

442
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,091
You're going to stay in here

443
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,642
until I figure out exactly

444
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,174
who you are,

445
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:37,365
and if I don't like what I learn,

446
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:40,117
you may end up like one of them...
what did you call her?

447
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:42,411
Fulano, Mengano.

448
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,094
I mean business.

449
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:52,392


450
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:53,589


451
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:56,298


452
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,398
I can get us out of here,
no problem.

453
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,491


454
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:08,171
... out of here, no problem.

455
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,260
This isn't good.

456
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,826
We use the chair
for intake and out...

457
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:24,183
goers.

458
00:28:25,284 --> 00:28:27,331
The process only takes
minutes, thanks to me.

459
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:29,458
But wouldn't it be

460
00:28:29,627 --> 00:28:33,296
more efficient if we didn't have
to use the chair for both?

461
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:36,828
"Yes" is the answer.

462
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:41,172
This will eliminate that problem.

463
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,806
As well as the problem

464
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,748
of Handlers having
to wrangle in an Active

465
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:49,134
with an obnoxious personality.

466
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,095
A remote wipe.

467
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:56,068
You're out in the world.
The deed is done.

468
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:57,500
The client is happy.

469
00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:01,815
You only have to be
within 50 yards of an Active.

470
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,764
How're you gonna straight up
just lie to my face, white boy?

471
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:06,743
You told me
you were taking me on a treatment.

472
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:09,081
I ain't got time
for no nerd convention.

473
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:14,462
Did I fall asleep?

474
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,488
A perfect Doll-State.

475
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:20,051
No call and response needed.

476
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,678
Just an easily herdable Active

477
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:24,448
ready to head home.

478
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:38,784
Well done.

479
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,475
I'll give you the specs
for the other Houses,

480
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,282
but I'll have ten units

481
00:29:43,717 --> 00:29:45,698
- working within a week.
- Fantastic.

482
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:48,473
I knew I was right
to put my money on you.

483
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:50,623
Are they grouping?

484
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,677
They... technically...

485
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:56,435
They're grouping, aren't they?

486
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,060
I'm sorry to say, yeah.

487
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,298
Oh, it's okay.

488
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,456
- It happens all the time.
- It does?

489
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:04,303
It's very common,
and easily dealt with.

490
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:06,764
It is? Of course it is, yeah.

491
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,766
Split them up,
place them in separate Houses.

492
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,476
They'll be fine.

493
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,087
The girl would be perfect for Dubai.

494
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,661


495
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:22,363
Help us!

496
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,336


497
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,527
I don't know what you're saying.

498
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:37,184
It's okay.

499
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:42,420
We will be okay.

500
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:44,370
It's okay.

501
00:30:49,253 --> 00:30:50,808
Now I understand everything.

502
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,727
Goodness gracious.

503
00:30:57,974 --> 00:30:59,119
Blue skies.

504
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:10,202
I need a tension wrench.

505
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:12,120
I don't understand.

506
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,803
Something metal.
Small, flat, flexible.

507
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,422
Underwear.
Right outside that door

508
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:25,468
is a hallway with a T-junction.
We're going left.

509
00:31:25,637 --> 00:31:28,054
There's a guard station to the right.
They'll follow us.

510
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,598
None of the guards inside are armed,

511
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,017
except for pepper spray, batons

512
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,307
and three cell mags.

513
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:37,493
Which means we don't get close
enough to let them use any of those.

514
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:38,731
You understand?

515
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:41,317
You're not a nurse, are you?

516
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:44,467
Right now, no.

517
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:47,929
Come on.

518
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,166
Stop right there!

519
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,520
Come on!

520
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,358


521
00:32:22,687 --> 00:32:23,908
Hang on, darling.

522
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,027
Simple closed circuit.

523
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:42,420
Inductor 17

524
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:45,256
to capacitor eight.

525
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,477
- You're not going anywhere.
- Stay in the corner.

526
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:07,320
All available personnel
to the South exit.

527
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,037
To the South exit!

528
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,803
Are you okay?

529
00:33:33,524 --> 00:33:34,847
I can't keep this up.

530
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:39,551


531
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,282
You know how?

532
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,358
I do now.

533
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,707
Stearns, in the car!

534
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,674
Are you insane?

535
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:12,134
FBI. I'm working
with Department of Corrections,

536
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,637
investigating allegations
of prison inmate abuse.

537
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:17,306
- I have a few questions to ask you.
- What the hell are you...

538
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,017
<i>Where is her medical file?</i>

539
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,227
<i>Are you worried I filed
a report on her abuse?</i>

540
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,849
<i>You know how it works in here.</i>

541
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,024
<i>You have to maintain
total authority,</i>

542
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,264
<i>and sometimes the boys
get carried away.</i>

543
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:29,028
You go after either of those women,

544
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:31,904
this tape lands on the desk
of every prison official in the state.

545
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:36,325
Why are you wasting your time
on some border-hopping nobody?

546
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:38,075
I'm not.

547
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,704
I'm wasting my time on you.

548
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:41,414
Don't make me waste any more.

549
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:46,563
I've been hearing
about your new device all day.

550
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,212
I don't need to see it.

551
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,593
I'm sure it's very impressive.

552
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:54,176
With the resources at your disposal now,
I'm surprised it took you this long.

553
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:55,548
It didn't.

554
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,722
I finished 2 months ago.

555
00:34:57,982 --> 00:34:59,849
I spent the rest of the time trying

556
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:01,761
to come up
with another way to do it,

557
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:03,999
a stupider way, a parlor trick...

558
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:05,396
that wouldn't lead

559
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,614
to anything else, anything bad.

560
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:09,351
What else, Topher?

561
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,260
What "bad"?

562
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:14,313
Harding's got me working
on a portable remote wipe, right?

563
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,350
I saw Bennett working
on a somatosensory system override.

564
00:35:19,207 --> 00:35:21,120
And there are, what?
22 Houses, right?

565
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:22,552
23 now.

566
00:35:22,677 --> 00:35:24,707
Each working on their own small

567
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,462
specific relatively harmless
technology.

568
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,296
- So I got to thinking...
- It's a component.

569
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:35,049
- It's a piece of a larger hole.
- And the next question is...

570
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:37,021
For what?

571
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:39,314
I think they're trying to build

572
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:43,351
a portable device
that will be able to imprint anyone

573
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,520
without any Active
architecture implants...

574
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:50,283
any innocent on the street

575
00:35:51,122 --> 00:35:52,652
with a new personality.

576
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:56,717
That's unnerving.

577
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,612
What's unnerving is

578
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,332
I figured out how to do it.

579
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,990
This is something
that Harding must never know.

580
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:36,445


581
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,679


582
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:43,518
Your taxi's here.

583
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,021


584
00:36:50,394 --> 00:36:51,594
It's Lisa now.

585
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:54,999
Take care, Lisa.

586
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:02,555
You are...

587
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,309
the strangest woman I have ever met.

588
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:09,803
Thank you.

589
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:21,045
One down.

590
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:24,417
This was just a test run.

591
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:27,805
Things are going to be a lot harder
when we go back to the Dollhouse.

592
00:37:28,282 --> 00:37:29,582
I can handle it.

593
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:31,375
We should get ready to move out.

594
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:35,014
I just want to make sure our operation
is cleaned up now that we're finished.

595
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:38,032
Are we?

596
00:37:54,955 --> 00:37:57,636
Just once. Just here
while it's still just the two of us.

597
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:58,761
Is there?

598
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,069
Really?

599
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:03,282
Just the two of us?

600
00:38:08,742 --> 00:38:09,842
I guess not.

601
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:15,771
Hello, Echo.

602
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,588
Ready to come home?

603
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:21,878
I try to be my best.

604
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:02,608
This is everything.

605
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:05,482
A good deal more than you asked for,
as I understand.

606
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,120
I have to say, I'm surprised.

607
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,733
Topher Brink is a genius,

608
00:39:09,858 --> 00:39:11,809
but I didn't realize
he was actually smart.

609
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:16,063
This... has the potential
to change everything.

610
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,648
I suspected as much.

611
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:20,160
You did the right thing, Adelle.

612
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:23,713
I imagine you only did it in the hopes
that I would give you your House back,

613
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:26,210
but I don't much mind.

614
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:29,235
I did it because I understand
how it works now.

615
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:31,592
How much Rossum has at stake.

616
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:33,514
And you're on board?

617
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:36,459
I accept the situation.

618
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,191
I did believe that

619
00:39:38,316 --> 00:39:40,796
the power we have
could be used to help people, but...

620
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:42,126
It can.

621
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:43,901
And it is, Adelle.

622
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:47,518
But in the end, power is always used
to get more power.

623
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,362
And if Rossum has this much,
I have little interest

624
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,141
in being on the other team.

625
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,676
I have to ask.

626
00:39:56,913 --> 00:40:00,181
Did you ever consider
just imprinting a Doll to kill me?

627
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:06,405
I'd like to think I'd have had
the courage to do it myself.

628
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,419
Ever the idealist.

629
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:12,956
Well, this is a great occasion.

630
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:16,706
Shall we celebrate?

631
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:21,477
There's no smoking in my office.

632
00:40:23,132 --> 00:40:25,007
Are you out of your British mind?!

633
00:40:25,763 --> 00:40:27,510
I acted in the best
interest of the House.

634
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:31,138
You gave Rossum
the deadliest tech I've ever heard of.

635
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:32,556
Which you designed.

636
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:35,352
I was trying to figure out
what they were up to!

637
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,603
You were fascinated.
You were playing.

638
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:39,814
Don't put this on me.

639
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:42,733
I trusted you!

640
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:45,152
Well, who thought
that was a clever scheme?

641
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,283
You are the coldest bitch
on this planet.

642
00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:57,751
That's the last time
you will ever speak to me like that.

643
00:40:57,876 --> 00:41:00,126
Or at all, unless you're spoken to.

644
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,568
You're off R&D
and back on programming.

645
00:41:04,693 --> 00:41:08,449
You will imprint these Dolls
with dedication and precision.

646
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,788
And you will follow
every single one of my commands

647
00:41:11,913 --> 00:41:14,249
as if they were
your heart's most deep desire.

648
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,499
And what happens if I don't?

649
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:21,807
I would hope, as someone
who does care for you,

650
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,223
that you will never find that out.

651
00:41:26,632 --> 00:41:30,197
I rule the House.
I won't let anyone challenge that.

652
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:32,875
Not ever again.

653
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,683
Ballard's been looking
for her the entire time.

654
00:41:58,406 --> 00:41:59,406
Oh, really?

655
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,558
And brought her in the very
moment he found her, right?

656
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:06,206
I nursed her
back to health for a week.

657
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,528
- She was living like an animal.
- Then someone needs a treatment.

658
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:13,824
Yes. I enjoy my treatments.

659
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:15,274
She's having headaches.

660
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,810
They're becoming unbearable
from what I can tell.

661
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,434
I'll see what I can do.

662
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,359
Or we'll see just
how much more she can bear.

663
00:42:23,593 --> 00:42:25,211
- What?
- No treatments just yet.

664
00:42:25,923 --> 00:42:27,735
I want you to place her
in isolation.

665
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,839
What?

666
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,050
No, you can't. She's in pain.

667
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,845
She looks fine to me.

668
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:38,307
Besides, she's lasted
through these last months.

669
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:41,067
A few more days won't hurt.

670
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:46,579
Come on.

671
00:42:48,152 --> 00:42:50,052
We all know Echo is special.

672
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:54,156
Let's see what she's capable of.

673
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,710
It's good to have you back, love.
