1
00:00:02,822 --> 00:00:04,722
(static)

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,925
When you hear the words
"Dollhouse,"

3
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:09,527
you probably think of little
girls playing tea party.

4
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:11,463
But for some people
in Los Angeles,

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,997
those words have
a different meaning.

6
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:14,298
A darker meaning.

7
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:16,067
Yeah, everyone knows that.

8
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:18,402
They get people programmed
to do whatever.

9
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:21,072
Could be for sex
or, you know, kill a guy.

10
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:22,740
They're out there.

11
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,308
The dolls.

12
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:28,145
Seeming to crop up
first in the late '80s,

13
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:31,583
the Dollhouse is one of L.A.'s
most enduring urban legends.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,917
The story is simple.

15
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:36,253
Somewhere in the city
is an illegal establishment

16
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:39,290
that rents out to the very rich
and the very connected

17
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:40,925
programmable people.

18
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:43,227
People who can take on
any personality

19
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:44,696
except their own.

20
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,498
Nothing more
than science fiction

21
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:47,932
according to most everybody,

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,934
a big foot for the big city.

23
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:52,403
But what's interesting
about this urban legend,

24
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,373
is the wide spectrum
of reactions we encountered

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,777
from everyday Angelenos
to the very idea of a Dollhouse.

26
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:01,212
Oh, it's happening.

27
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:04,382
There's one thing people
will always need is slaves.

28
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,050
Well, some of the
versions of the story

29
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:09,020
say the dolls themselves
are volunteers. There's only

30
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:11,523
one reason someone
would volunteer to be a slave

31
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,658
is if they is one already.

32
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:16,628
Volunteers. You must be
out of your (bleep) mind.

33
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:20,064
So, being a doll,
you do whatever.

34
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:22,000
And you don't
got to remember nothing.

35
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:25,336
Or study.
Or pay rent.

36
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:28,740
And you just party
with rich people all the time?

37
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:30,675
Where's the dotted line?

38
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:33,177
A spokesperson
for the Governor insists

39
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,613
that this legend
is nothing more than that.

40
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:39,483
And stories of an F.B.I. task force
investigating the Dollhouse

41
00:01:39,552 --> 00:01:41,419
have been flatly denied.

42
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:43,421
But the rumors persist.

43
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:45,355
And like every good fairy tale,

44
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,425
the story grows more intricate,

45
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:49,093
and more divisive,

46
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,762
every decade.

47
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,830
(T.V. clicks off,
remote clatters on desk)

48
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:01,739
No.

49
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,808
It can't be that easy.

50
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:06,143
This is my case.

51
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,712
You closed it.

52
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,048
What, you come in my house,
dig through my garbage, too?

53
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,316
You're out of
hand cream again.

54
00:02:14,152 --> 00:02:15,453
This the alleged victim?

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,089
Guy said she had
a face. Damn.

56
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:19,591
No wonder you're foraging

57
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:20,959
for hand cream.

58
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,094
Had a million bucks,
I could blow it on that.

59
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,662
Did you track this
payment from Crestejo?

60
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,998
The Mayfair fund?

61
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,668
Told you to stay out
of my soup, Ballard.

62
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,837
Afraid you'll have
to reopen the case?

63
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:34,739
Act like a federal agent
for five minutes?

64
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,007
This is my report.

65
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,909
If there is some

66
00:02:37,977 --> 00:02:40,177
giant conspiracy that's
sucking the brains

67
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,512
out of nice, young people,

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,881
then this bit of tail
that you're chasing

69
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,985
is A: effectively dead,

70
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:48,854
and B: a whore.

71
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,955
A mindless whore,

72
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:53,157
just your type.
No disrespect.

73
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,691
I'm sure she still
has a heart of gold.

74
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,561
(Tanaka grunts)

75
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,663
What happened there, Ballard?

76
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,865
I strike a nerve?
Yeah.

77
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:02,033
Felt like this.

78
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:03,268
(screams)

79
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,439
You are not long for this world.

80
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,207
I think you'd
better lie down.

81
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,809
I mean it.

82
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,444
Someone's going to put you down.

83
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:15,646
And I pray to God
I'm there to see it.

84
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:17,214
(groans)

85
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,950
Come by any time.

86
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,801
Sierra is alone.

87
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:39,804
I like to be alone sometimes.

88
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:42,140
It's peaceful.

89
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:46,544
Sierra sits with us most days.

90
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:49,446
Am I wrong?

91
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:52,184
When we go to sleep,

92
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,918
I hear her.

93
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:56,954
Maybe she
didn't see us.

94
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,626
(screams)

95
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:08,232
(Sierra continues screaming)

96
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:12,737
Do you feel
uncomfortable at all?

97
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:14,806
No. Should I?

98
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:16,908
No.

99
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,309
Did Victor

100
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:21,746
upset you,
do you remember?

101
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:23,414
Victor wants to pretend.

102
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,982
"pretend"?

103
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,650
He pretends we're married.

104
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:32,189
I see.

105
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:38,096
Something's up?
Yes.

106
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:40,865
Sierra's had sex.

107
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,033
No, sir.

108
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:43,300
You know for sure?

109
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:46,337
Her last engagement was
with the Governor's niece

110
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:48,005
at a children's
cancer ward.

111
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:49,306
I examined her

112
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:50,908
post-engagement anyway.

113
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:52,143
This happened
while she's been here.

114
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,145
What did she say about Victor?

115
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,146
That he liked to play.

116
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:58,549
Wait, the dolls
don't have sex drives.

117
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:00,018
That's part
of the deal, right?

118
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,521
What do you guys know?
Since when

119
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:05,656
do you care
what happens to her?

120
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:07,191
Since I was hired to.

121
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,359
Just because I'm
not Andy Griffith

122
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:10,461
with these guys doesn't
mean I want to see

123
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,029
them abusing each other.

124
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:15,199
If Victor's off-program,
then he could be

125
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,301
Jekyll and Hyde-ing
just like Alpha did.

126
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,370
We can't jump
to any conclusions.

127
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:21,038
No, but we can go
to the videotape.

128
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,140
How long has she...?

129
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:23,674
Two days.

130
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:26,911
If Victor was alone with her,
it won't take long to find.

131
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,612
Mr. Hearn,
when you figure out

132
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,081
what happened...
Then I go to DeWitt.

133
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:32,549
If Victor is
playing doctor

134
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,451
when not imprinted
with an M.D.,

135
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,587
then he goes to the attic.

136
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:40,023
(door slams)

137
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:41,659
Victor wouldn't...

138
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,928
She did scream
when she saw him.

139
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:46,297
And we both know
he's been focused on her.

140
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:47,598
There's a difference

141
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,568
Between being attracted
to someone and hurting them.

142
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:51,836
Has she shown
any other sign?

143
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:53,337
Anything you can remember?

144
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:55,439
Echo:
When we go to sleep...

145
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:58,876
When we go in the pods,

146
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:01,812
Sierra cries.

147
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,980
Am I right?

148
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,982
I'm right, right?
Am I right?

149
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,184
Tanaka's going
to the Director.

150
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:07,819
You know he threw up
after you pulled

151
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,653
that Vulcan grip crap.

152
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,289
And yes,

153
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:14,158
I think you're right.

154
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,128
This is the Crestejo account.

155
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:20,664
Big payment to the Mayfair fund,
which means nothing.

156
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:22,867
Mayfair is a hedge,
and it's spread thin.

157
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:24,568
But that
payment went in

158
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,137
right when his daughter
was kidnapped.

159
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:29,173
And you still think he hired
the Dollhouse to get her back.

160
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,607
I surely do.

161
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,444
Now you have a similar sum

162
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:35,812
transferred to the Mayfair fund
from Q-Field.

163
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,081
And this is the fun part:

164
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,883
You have the same amount,

165
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,617
from Q-Field to Mayfair,

166
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:44,388
every year on
the exact same day.

167
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,657
Q-Field is a subsidiary
of Redwing,

168
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:47,758
a majority share of which

169
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,393
is held by...

170
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:51,128
Joel Mynor.

171
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:53,664
And Joel Mynor is
on your list of potential

172
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:55,299
Dollhouse clients.

173
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,168
Man, even I know
about this guy.

174
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:58,602
He's that internet mogul.

175
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,438
He created Sourceress,

176
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,508
E-tilites, Bouncy the Rat.

177
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:07,444
My kids fiercely love
Bouncy the Rat.

178
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:09,812
Dotcom billionaire with serious
commitment issues,

179
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:11,548
who shows up
at every charity gig

180
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:13,852
with a fabulous nobody
on his arm.

181
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,020
I've liked this guy for a while.

182
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:18,021
You ever thought
about asking him out?

183
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,023
I'm never going to get
to Caroline.

184
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:22,727
Whoever she is,
the Dollhouse has buried her.

185
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:25,662
I've got to get to them first,
and Joel Mynor is my ticket.

186
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,199
Whatever he's paying for,
it's happening soon.

187
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:30,268
I need
everything on him.

188
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,404
You mean everything
admissible by a warrant

189
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,972
that you got,
because anybody

190
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,909
in the whole wide bureau
believes you're not insane.

191
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:41,578
I mean help me out.

192
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,118
Getting shot didn't even make
you pause, did it?

193
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:53,391
I'll help you.

194
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,525
The Director sees
what we're up to,

195
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:58,695
he's going to help you out.

196
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,498
So the one fund got transferred
to the other fund,

197
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:04,868
and that's the same
as the <i>other</i> other fund,

198
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:06,604
And that's all important.
That's it.

199
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:08,072
Exactly.

200
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,941
You have a very
glamorous job.

201
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,542
How do you think
I can afford

202
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:13,377
To take you to all these
fancy places?

203
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,812
Hey, this is the nicest
offer I've had this month.

204
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,814
Or last month.

205
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:20,717
Weren't you,
um, seeing someone?

206
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:22,186
Hmm?
Rick.

207
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:23,654
Dick.

208
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,589
Really?
I thought it was Rick.

209
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:27,225
Oh, his name is Rick.

210
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,926
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

211
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:30,761
He said he didn't see me
as "a long-term investment."

212
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:31,929
Said he wanted to, uh,

213
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:34,131
"dump the stock
before it went public."

214
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:36,732
He talks like that.

215
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,235
He works at a doughnut shop.

216
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:40,171
What a Rick.

217
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,707
Yeah. Hey, I get that I'm not
the gold standard in l.A.

218
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,909
Please, you're gorgeous.

219
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:50,247
But I do have access
to important

220
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:52,482
government information
that I don't understand.

221
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:55,752
It boils down to this:

222
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,021
Today was a slightly better day
for the good guys

223
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,790
than it was for the bad guys.

224
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:02,593
Just one more tiny step to get
me closer to bringing her in.

225
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,861
Them.

226
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:05,629
What?

227
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:07,798
Bringing <i>them</i> in.
You said "her."

228
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:10,201
Oh. Well...

229
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,236
"her" is being held captive
by "them."

230
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,805
Along with a lot of other
people, if I'm right.

231
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,241
So if I really catch
my client in the act tomorrow

232
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:20,444
with a doll, I'm closer
to freeing them all.

233
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:23,780
Including, but not limited to,
"her."

234
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,782
Is that fair?

235
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,852
It's your job.

236
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,597
We're all clear in there.

237
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:41,965
Okay, I don't want
to see anybody

238
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,667
in the house
or around the house,

239
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:44,968
and that includes the boys.

240
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,237
They get it.

241
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:47,471
You'll be very much alone.

242
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,521
Joel?

243
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,157
Hi, honey.
Are you okay?

244
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,259
You sounded so serious
on the phone.

245
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:09,527
I'm a serious guy.

246
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:10,928
You're a dork.

247
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:13,697
Louanne's covering for me,

248
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:14,998
so this can't
take forever.

249
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:17,535
You may have
to owe her one.

250
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:19,104
I did something.

251
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:20,571
Something bad?

252
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:41,125
Woman:
<i>Oh, Joel.</i>

253
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:43,927
Joel:
<i>The oven, uh,
gets food so hot,</i>

254
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,629
<i>it actually goes
through this thing called</i>

255
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:47,864
<i>the "cooking process."</i>

256
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:50,000
<i>It's very scientific.</i>
(woman giggles)

257
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,370
<i>Um, and I think there's
something in the fridge.</i>

258
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,177
I'd like you both to
turn around very slowly.

259
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,845
What's the matter,
Mr. Mynor?

260
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,714
Did you two want to be...

261
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,451
Alone?

262
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,087
If they'd had it in my day,

263
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,122
I'd have had Betty Grable
every night.

264
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:49,490
Or Ida Lupino.

265
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,493
Every man that fought
for his country

266
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,895
should have the right
to an Ida Lupino.

267
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,764
You mean if it was real?

268
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:59,300
If I could hire a doll
and he could

269
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:02,570
be anyone and do anything
with no consequences,

270
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,973
I would want him to...
(giggles)

271
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,576
Oh, my God, I'm so not
going to tell you.

272
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,345
Okay, whoever you are,

273
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:11,346
I think you've
made a mistake.

274
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:12,447
What's happening?

275
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,081
Caroline?

276
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:15,617
Okay, you've definitely
made a mistake.

277
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:16,784
What do you call her?

278
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:18,085
Please put the gun away.

279
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,320
My name is

280
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,855
Rebecca Mynor, and this
is my husband, Joel.

281
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:23,189
We just bought
this house.

282
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,426
We did, right?

283
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,495
You didn't just break
in to impress me?

284
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:28,630
No, it-it's paid for.

285
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:29,997
This is all a big mix-up.

286
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:31,332
Please tell me
your name.

287
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,667
I'm Paul Ballard.

288
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:33,801
I'm with the F.B.I..

289
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:37,071
I knew it.
What?

290
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,607
It's porn, isn't it?

291
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,176
The internet venture
that suddenly pays off.

292
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:43,479
You did porn!

293
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,280
My husband does porn!
No, I don't do porn!

294
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,714
You're in huge trouble.

295
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,215
Your name is Caroline.

296
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,784
You don't know this,
but you're being fooled.

297
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,785
You're being used.

298
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:51,786
Okay,
I'm giving you

299
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,188
one last chance to leave.

300
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:54,188
Joel,

301
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,855
please don't make him angry.

302
00:12:55,924 --> 00:12:57,525
I would never hurt you.

303
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,025
(taser clicking)
(grunts)

304
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:01,162
I'm so sorry, Mr. Mynor,
he attacked one of our men.

305
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,564
Echo: Who is this?
You know this man?

306
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:04,965
Is this a porn man?
No,

307
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,066
there's no porn!

308
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:07,402
Don't yell at me.

309
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:08,670
I'm not yelling at you.

310
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,471
I just...
I don't like this house.

311
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,206
Sweetie...
I...

312
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:13,574
(men grunting, Echo screaming)

313
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,421
God!

314
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,824
Joel!
You need a treatment.

315
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:33,828
(screams)
Joel...

316
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,665
Porn.

317
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:39,768
(all grunting)

318
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,171
(tires screeching)

319
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,573
(engine roaring)

320
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,210
(coughs)

321
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:50,845
Hope you're not thinking
about leaving, Mr. Mynor.

322
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,046
Can I assume

323
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:55,115
none of my security guys
need an ambulance

324
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,652
or a hearse?

325
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,320
They'll be fine.

326
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:03,523
Why don't you, uh, tell me
what you're looking for?

327
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,125
I found what I was looking for.

328
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:06,126
Really?

329
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:07,395
Figured you'd be
a lot happier

330
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:08,996
right about now.

331
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,898
Tell me about the Dollhouse.

332
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,100
(laughing):
The doll...

333
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:15,370
Uh, it's pink and it opens up

334
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,572
and there's teeny furniture,

335
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,075
and you put the boy doll
on top of the girl doll

336
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:23,010
and we learn about urges.

337
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:29,316
What's her name?

338
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:31,753
Rebecca--
she told you.

339
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,754
Really?

340
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:34,355
How do you
know Rebecca?

341
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,189
We've been married
for seven years.

342
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,958
(chuckles)

343
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,293
So that's your fantasy?

344
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,830
All the money in the world,
the most elaborate,

345
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:45,132
high-class underground
operation ever designed,

346
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,735
and you just want
to play house?

347
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,537
I guess the rich
really are different.

348
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,905
Why, what's your fantasy?

349
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:52,973
Oh, I'm okay right here
in the real world, thanks.

350
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,376
Oh, don't, no,
you have a fantasy.

351
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:56,744
Okay, we all do.

352
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,045
We need it to survive,

353
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,615
and I think your fantasy

354
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,884
is about my Rebecca.

355
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:05,152
Her name is Caroline.

356
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,354
Right.

357
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,289
A few years ago, she
was a student, and then

358
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:09,689
she had her identity
ripped from her

359
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,293
so she could play love slave to
every loser with a wad of cash.

360
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,461
But then

361
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:16,531
the brave little F.B.I. agent
whisked her away

362
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:17,632
from the cash-wielding losers

363
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,468
and restored
her true identity,

364
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:23,571
and she fell in love with him.

365
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,872
It doesn't go like that.

366
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:27,174
(scoffing):
I saw how you were with her.

367
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:29,544
It was,
it was almost cute.

368
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:31,345
We're not here to talk about me.
Hey,

369
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:33,247
I don't have to be here at all.

370
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:35,450
I mean, you're not going
to arrest me.

371
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,553
Pretty sure you're not going
to kill me, so...

372
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,089
If we're going to talk,
we're both going to talk.

373
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:46,994
I mean, she,
she changed things for you.

374
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:51,766
So you're the head
of this F.B.I. task force

375
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:55,102
to uncover the Dollhouse,

376
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,371
and you're working hard,
you're chasing leads,

377
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,709
you're cracking skulls,
but it's just work.

378
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:06,046
And then you meet this girl
or you...

379
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:08,182
you see her
somewhere, huh?

380
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,518
Caroline?

381
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:11,752
And suddenly...

382
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,753
(cork pops)

383
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:15,389
...it gets personal.

384
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:23,396
Tell me you haven't
thought about it.

385
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,064
You know, her,
her grateful tears,

386
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:30,037
her, her welcoming embrace,
her warm breath.

387
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,006
Are you married?

388
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:33,107
Was.

389
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,107
Oh,

390
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:35,275
That's...

391
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:37,645
Is there someone
in your life right now?

392
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,646
This is getting old.

393
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:40,948
Of course not.

394
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:43,150
No, there's no room
for a real girl, is there,

395
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,986
when you can feel

396
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,622
Caroline beckoning?

397
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:51,325
(chuckling): You know, I have to say
I-I think your fantasy

398
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,761
is even sadder than mine.

399
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,162
Won't know until I hear it.

400
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,163
Well,

401
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,467
it didn't involve
drinking alone.

402
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,703
Saunders: Victor, can you
tell me about Sierra?

403
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,704
Sierra is beautiful.

404
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,072
(typing)

405
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,141
There's a lot of beautiful
girls here, bro, it's...

406
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,176
pretty much the idea.

407
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:11,378
Beauty.

408
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:12,646
Sierra is different.

409
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,381
How is she different?

410
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,785
I'm sorry.

411
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,887
Victor,

412
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,157
do you remember being in
the showers with Sierra?

413
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:25,993
You were watching her?

414
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,262
How does Sierra make you feel?

415
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,034
Better.

416
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,802
I can't believe this.
I'm filling in

417
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,471
for Ramirez for a week and
my active invents rape?

418
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,506
We don't know
what happened yet.

419
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,408
Victor might have just
triggered a memory.

420
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,410
Well, Hearn's
out for blood.

421
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,746
Hearn hasn't found
anything on the tapes.

422
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,448
Nobody has.

423
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:48,850
How is that
even possible?

424
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,585
Every square inch of
this place is monitored.

425
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,754
If two actives
are going at it...

426
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,390
What do you think
DeWitt'll do?

427
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,725
You think she'll
come down hard?

428
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,695
It was probably
just a mistake.

429
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:03,064
These dolls, they're
smiling all day.

430
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:04,198
Then Sierra's
crying in bed?

431
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,100
Why always then?

432
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,568
Maybe she's broken.

433
00:18:07,636 --> 00:18:11,338
You figure she's broken?

434
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:12,707
They're all broken.

435
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:22,583
Rebecca was amazing.

436
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,753
She was a nurse and...

437
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,021
(laughing):
...I was a basket case,

438
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,124
So, you know,
not a, not a bad match.

439
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,927
I was the guy
with the almost great idea--

440
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:38,100
floogle
and blahoo! And facebooger.

441
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,502
I was, I was just always
one step behind,

442
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,638
and she was cool with it.

443
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,640
And did she look
exactly like Caroline?

444
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,775
No, but--

445
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:51,879
Eat it, f-bitch-I--
she was beautiful

446
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,414
and she knew it
and she loved me.

447
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:56,117
I mean, I had been...

448
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:58,418
(sighing):
I had been given a gift.

449
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:01,521
And now you're hiring zombies.

450
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:02,790
You know Rebecca's dead

451
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:04,925
Because you've done
one iota of research

452
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,828
in between beating up
licensed security people.

453
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,396
Right?

454
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,198
And you know I don't
live in this house.

455
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,732
Place is empty.

456
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:14,068
Shame-- big place.

457
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,069
(scoffs)

458
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,403
This place.

459
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,472
This place could fit
in my bathroom.

460
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,975
I mean, this place could fit
in my guest bathroom.

461
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:22,009
All right?

462
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,645
I mean, I finally got
one step ahead.

463
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,412
"Bouncy the Rat."

464
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,747
Kids love it.
Ooh, they do.

465
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:30,686
I mean,
long story still kind of long,

466
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,254
my first check had more zeros
than the Luftwaffe.

467
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:35,255
The Japanese--

468
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:38,559
They had the Zeros,
not the Germans.

469
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:40,260
(sighs)

470
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:41,662
It was money.

471
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,564
All right, it was
roll-around-in money

472
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:45,299
and Rebecca had no idea.

473
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,234
She'd been supporting
the both of us for years.

474
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:48,468
I mean ridiculous hours.

475
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:50,037
We were living
in a one-room shack,

476
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,140
and I knew this house
was exactly her type.

477
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,477
I paid cash and I called her up.

478
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:58,445
I said,
"meet me at this address,

479
00:19:58,513 --> 00:19:59,446
it's really important,"

480
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:01,348
and she was worried,
you know,

481
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,783
I could hear it.

482
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:06,020
Sh-she probably thought this was
a police station or something,

483
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:10,523
But... You know...

484
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,961
thinking about the look
on her face

485
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:16,630
when she saw this place

486
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:19,466
and I told her it was ours.

487
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,407
Sanitation truck...

488
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:30,111
sideswiped her car...

489
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,413
three blocks from here,

490
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,219
and I heard the impact and...
(sighs)

491
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:41,188
they said it was quick.

492
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:46,061
I guess that, you know,
they always have to say that.

493
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,528
Right?

494
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:52,199
But she never got
to see this house,

495
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:55,870
and she never knew I made good.

496
00:20:55,938 --> 00:21:00,641
So every year on this date,

497
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,843
I pretend she does.

498
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,946
I get to see
that look on her face

499
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,850
and I get to show her
our extraordinary home.

500
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,489
And then you sleep with her.

501
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:17,958
It is a fantasy.

502
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:21,262
I'm sorry for your
loss, Mr. Mynor.

503
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,498
It doesn't make you anything
other than a predator.

504
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:27,768
Well, I'm sure I'm in need of
some serious moral spankitude,

505
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:32,039
but, uh, guess who's not
qualified to be my rabbi.

506
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,842
Well, I'm perfectly happy
to let a federal judge...

507
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,277
Throw you in jail, hmm?

508
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:39,880
I mean, we got trespassing,
we got assault,

509
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,216
and what <i>you've</i>
got is a girl

510
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:43,383
you're obsessed with,

511
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:47,087
who I think we can both agree
is not here.

512
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:49,355
I mean, this is not
"beat up the geek," big guy.

513
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:51,458
This is
the internet establishment.

514
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:54,995
You put me in front of a judge,
he'll take <i>you</i> down.

515
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:56,864
He'll throw the Kindle at you.

516
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:59,232
(siren wailing)

517
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:02,036
(chuckling):
Oh... Oh.

518
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:06,707
I, I think one of my guys
must have called 911.

519
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,143
Um, do you want
to stick around,

520
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,477
see who gets cuffed or...?

521
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,678
This is all going
to come apart.

522
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,215
You might not be punished
and I might not be alive,

523
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:15,816
but this house will fall.

524
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:19,753
The first hurdle
in my business is the people

525
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,323
who will not accept the change
that's already happened.

526
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,623
Go.

527
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:26,426
Go live in
your real world.

528
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:29,296
If you ever did.

529
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:35,035
Happy anniversary.

530
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,570
If you could have somebody be
the perfect person,

531
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:47,873
the moment you wish for that you
know you're never going to get,

532
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:50,376
and someone signed on
to do that,

533
00:22:50,444 --> 00:22:53,946
to help you...

534
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:57,616
I think that could be okay.

535
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:02,188
I think that could be
maybe beautiful.

536
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,124
It's human trafficking,
end of story.

537
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:06,691
It's repulsive.

538
00:23:57,777 --> 00:24:00,413
This is Boyd Langton
for Mr. Dominic.

539
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:08,054
Yes, you need to take Victor
off the floor.

540
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,055
I'm sure.

541
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:12,291
Isolate him... and his handler.

542
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,701
I did something bad.

543
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,903
What did you do?

544
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,739
Nobody will tell me.

545
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:29,341
Victor, I need you

546
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:30,742
to come with me, please.

547
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:32,078
Where?

548
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:34,213
I need you to come
with me, please.

549
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,986
Why did Sierra scream at me?

550
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,990
Bicks:
Who authorized this?

551
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,191
I didn't rape
the doll.

552
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:49,061
Lawrence, Lawrence,
I didn't do this.

553
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:50,162
You know me, man.

554
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,297
I wouldn't do this, man.

555
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,764
Come on, you know
I didn't do this!

556
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:54,100
I didn't do this!

557
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,968
Where are they
taking Victor?

558
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:58,304
Why don't you go
paint something?

559
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,805
Nice work, man.

560
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,577
Echo: <i>Where are they
taking Victor?</i>

561
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,079
Echo, I'm trying
to protect Sierra.

562
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,182
Sierra cries.

563
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,917
Not anymore.

564
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,085
Mellie:
Is this enough?

565
00:25:13,153 --> 00:25:14,354
Thanks.

566
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:21,025
Are you, uh, always
gonna show up bleeding?

567
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:22,694
'cause it's kind
of funny

568
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:24,863
how I'm not
getting used to it.

569
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,168
It was her.

570
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,902
You met Caroline?

571
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,238
I saw Caroline.

572
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:33,572
I met Rebecca.

573
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,441
And I let both of
them get away.

574
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:36,809
So, it's all true.

575
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:38,043
I knew it was true.

576
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,212
I just didn't expect...

577
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,014
If it had been
anybody else,

578
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:43,516
the jail cells
would be full,

579
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,252
and I'd be busy writing the
great American arrest report.

580
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,786
I never thought
it would be her.

581
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:49,121
Did you get the guy?

582
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:51,423
The... john,
the... client.

583
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:52,625
What are they called?

584
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:55,461
I talked to him.

585
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:56,962
And?

586
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:11,043
And you kissed him?

587
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,378
I'm sorry.

588
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,079
I'm not.

589
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:15,548
I mean, I am.

590
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,982
I-I mean, you are.

591
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,116
Don't do that.

592
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:19,885
Don't inflate the stock
before you dump it.

593
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:21,587
Uh...

594
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:24,990
Don't think about her
and kiss me.

595
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:27,159
I wasn't, uh...

596
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:28,895
Forget it.

597
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:31,029
I think it's best
we forget it.

598
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:32,097
Would be stupid, anyway.

599
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:34,533
We're neighbors,
we should just...

600
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:35,834
we should be
neighborly.

601
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:36,835
Great.

602
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:37,836
Yes.

603
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:38,970
Neighborly.

604
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:40,406
Can I borrow
a cup of sugar?

605
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,507
(both laughing)

606
00:26:41,575 --> 00:26:43,809
Like that.

607
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:47,312
So, why don't you tell me
about today.

608
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,584
The guy's name was Joel Mynor.

609
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:55,221
Joel Mynor from
<i>Bouncy the Rat?</i>

610
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,992
Do you trust me?

611
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:35,861
With my life.

612
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:37,630
Do you want to play the game?

613
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,400
No.

614
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:46,505
But you remember to be very
quiet during the game, right?

615
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:49,308
Noise is upsetting.

616
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:51,777
Lift up your dress.

617
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:01,520
That wasn't quiet.

618
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,155
(Hearn groaning)

619
00:28:03,222 --> 00:28:04,723
Wasn't meant to be.

620
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:09,795
Why didn't you tell us you
were setting up Hearn?

621
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:11,363
Boyd:
He had to be clear.

622
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:13,532
He had to be flush
with success,

623
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,434
or he'd never
have tried again.

624
00:28:15,502 --> 00:28:17,202
You will never take
action like that

625
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,904
on your own again
inside these walls.

626
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:19,905
Am I clear?

627
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:22,541
You're clear.

628
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,943
A bonus has been wired
to your account.

629
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:27,379
I don't need a bonus.

630
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:31,049
Well, I need to give it to you.

631
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:32,584
That's all.

632
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,655
Ms. Dewitt.

633
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,028
(sighs)

634
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:47,866
What do we do with Hearn?

635
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,168
I'll let you know.

636
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:53,271
And you saw the other
thing, the tap?

637
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:56,809
Joel Mynor from <i>Bouncy the Rat?</i>

638
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,043
He was on the cover of <i>Wired.</i>

639
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,348
You read <i>wired?</i>

640
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:04,115
You can see the cover in stores.

641
00:29:04,184 --> 00:29:06,152
Brownish hair,
pudgy, kind of cute?

642
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:09,521
I don't remember
him as cute.

643
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,855
Dominic:
Ma'am,

644
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:13,926
Do you have an
exit strategy?

645
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:17,027
We have a handler
abusing an active,

646
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:19,430
a federal agent
interrupting an engagement,

647
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,234
spilling his guts
to the nearest civilian.

648
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:25,035
I take much of that
as my responsibility,

649
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:26,539
but the higher-ups

650
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,107
will target you if
this all goes south.

651
00:29:29,176 --> 00:29:33,178
Your concern is touching,
but my bags are not packed.

652
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:35,680
You will bring
the handler to me.

653
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,750
And as for the intrepid agent...

654
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,420
Tell Topher to prep Echo.

655
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:46,592
I think they're ready
for a second date.

656
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,100
Hey, everyone's got
their fantasies, right?

657
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:56,932
A guy wants to know
what it's like,

658
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,133
you know, to be
with another man.

659
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,002
just once,
nothing queeny.

660
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,303
Two guys
checking it out,

661
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:03,906
and then the
other one forgets.

662
00:30:03,973 --> 00:30:06,541
That could be sweet
for some guys.

663
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:11,680
(chuckles awkwardly)

664
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,361
Oh-ho.

665
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:27,996
You're bad.

666
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,230
Mmm.

667
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,703
You're a naughty girl.

668
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,738
Oh.

669
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:39,273
Okay.

670
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:43,479
Uh... But you're
not <i>that</i> girl.

671
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:48,883
That girl has
control issues

672
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:52,219
that don't mesh well with the
enhanced combat skill set.

673
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:54,488
You can re-cluster
the inhibitors

674
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:56,023
to offset the dissonance.

675
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,525
Don't we want aggression?

676
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:59,729
And precision.

677
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:01,461
I need a
soupcon of rage.

678
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:03,264
Hmm?

679
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:05,967
Not a whole tasting menu.

680
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,672
Mmm.

681
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:11,773
And now I'm hungry.

682
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,307
(sighs)

683
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:16,277
Find out if the kitchen
has the almond-crusted salmon.

684
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:20,016
I live to serve lunch.

685
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:27,723
Uh-huh.

686
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:31,926
And hello, gorgeous but deadly.

687
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:40,334
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

688
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:46,875
Upload imprint to file drive.

689
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,244
(humming)

690
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:51,680
Topher.

691
00:31:53,314 --> 00:31:54,816
I'm in my process.

692
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,350
I'm...

693
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,453
What's the scuttlebutt?

694
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:01,521
Echo's been engaged.

695
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,725
Well, that does happen.

696
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:05,025
I'm not on it.

697
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:06,762
I'm on hold.

698
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:08,328
(chuckling):
Yeah.

699
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:11,732
You put another handler through
a plate glass window, big guy.

700
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,801
That's 48 hours chill time, min.

701
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:16,070
What is she doing?

702
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,371
Echo?

703
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:21,342
Oh... Life coach gig.

704
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,914
You know, remind some doctor
why he helps kids

705
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:29,283
who have, you know, gross kids.

706
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,285
They don't think
I can handle that?

707
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:34,455
Uh, not everything
is about you, infinite ego man.

708
00:32:34,523 --> 00:32:36,156
You know, you did
nail the guy

709
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,357
who was messing
with Sierra.

710
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:39,629
You should go out and get drunk
and beat your chest.

711
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,330
Echo will be here
when you get back.

712
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:43,732
Hey.

713
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:46,334
How did you figure out
it was Hearn, anyway?

714
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,004
Is it a cop thing?

715
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,639
Reading people?

716
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,473
You do the work.

717
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,543
Well...

718
00:32:55,645 --> 00:32:57,078
Good work.

719
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:59,146
(humming)

720
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,582
(sighs)

721
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:11,258
(computer trilling and beeping)

722
00:33:11,326 --> 00:33:13,662
(typing)

723
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,301
Ready to play?

724
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:25,807
Adelle: Can you imagine at all
why it is you are not dead?

725
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:30,445
You probably got
something worse planned.

726
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:32,848
You gonna erase my brain,

727
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:35,750
turn me into one
of your fantasy boys?

728
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:38,219
I find it a bit sad
that you think of yourself

729
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:41,322
as a candIdate
for anyone's fantasy.

730
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:43,725
Ah, you know you're
a little sweet on me.

731
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:46,061
(screaming)

732
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:48,262
(Hearn hyperventilating)

733
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,930
You think I'm
gonna beg?

734
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,199
You want to kill me?

735
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:52,834
You want to put me in the attic?

736
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:54,570
I can't stop you.

737
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:56,404
The jig is up.

738
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:57,406
How many times?

739
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,406
(panting)

740
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:02,143
I can find out, but I want
to hear it from you.

741
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,713
Four.

742
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:06,514
Dominic:
You're disgusting.

743
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:08,148
Don't give me that.

744
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:10,551
You put her
under some fat, old emir,

745
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,020
it makes it better
because she thinks

746
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:13,789
she's in love for
all of a day?

747
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,555
We're in the business
of using people.

748
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,691
You understand less about
this business than you think.

749
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,293
And you don't get how it
actually works down there.

750
00:34:20,363 --> 00:34:22,062
You put a bunch
of stone foxes

751
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:23,564
with no willpower
and no memory

752
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:25,398
running around naked.

753
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,969
Did you think this
wouldn't ever happen?

754
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:30,939
Did it make it better?

755
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:33,607
That she didn't struggle?

756
00:34:33,676 --> 00:34:35,211
No.

757
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:37,578
It made it easier.

758
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,414
Mr. Dominic, would you leave us?

759
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,684
Ms. Dewitt, I...

760
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:43,785
I'll be perfectly safe.

761
00:34:43,854 --> 00:34:45,719
Please.

762
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,760
We <i>are</i> in the business
of using people.

763
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:56,363
The question is,
what is the best use

764
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,432
for someone like you?

765
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,703
This woman is a problem for us.

766
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:08,008
She's learned too much
about the organization.

767
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:10,979
It wasn't her fault,

768
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:12,281
really.

769
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:14,982
I need her killed,
and it can't be clean.

770
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:17,385
This is your chance
to avoid the attic.

771
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:20,889
You may even consider it
something of a promotion.

772
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:22,523
After all,

773
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,225
this one will...

774
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:26,395
probably struggle.

775
00:35:27,529 --> 00:35:29,531
(breathing heavily, moaning)

776
00:35:47,617 --> 00:35:49,482
My God.

777
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:51,520
You're so...

778
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,188
Neighborly.

779
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:55,555
(both chuckling)

780
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,658
So...

781
00:35:57,727 --> 00:35:59,793
Can I borrow a
cup of sugar?

782
00:35:59,863 --> 00:36:01,162
(laughing)

783
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,797
I don't think
I got any sugar left.

784
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,211
(groaning)

785
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:19,814
I'm not gonna
freak out on you.

786
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:22,350
Uh... good.

787
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:24,285
When you tell me this
is all a mistake

788
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:25,754
and we should forget
it ever happened,

789
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,521
I'm gonna be very cool.

790
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,590
You're gonna be bothered
by how cool I am.

791
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:33,461
What if I don't say that?

792
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:34,629
I'll still be cool,

793
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:37,064
But not <i>as</i> cool.

794
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,600
What if you tell <i>me</i>
it was a mistake?

795
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:42,170
Oh, God, you're
gonna be so clingy,

796
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:43,471
weeping and moping,

797
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,840
texting me.

798
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:46,207
It's too embarrassing.

799
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:48,508
I am not a piece of meat,
you know.

800
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:50,246
I have a heart.
(chuckling)

801
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:53,248
Blah, blah.

802
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:01,621
I was thinking
about Caroline.

803
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:03,625
Well, I wasn't.
(laughs)

804
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,625
I believe you.

805
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:08,129
And...

806
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:10,131
I believe you
should find her.

807
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,100
I think what they're
doing is wrong.

808
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:14,102
And I don't love seeing
you get beat up

809
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:16,104
and shot, but...

810
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:18,172
I think your work
is important.

811
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:22,344
Then help me out.

812
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,346
Is this the part where you
dress me up and use me as bait?

813
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:26,949
'cause those movies
never end well.

814
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,754
It's the part where I run
down to Tiki Port

815
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,756
and grab us dinner
and we go over my files

816
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:38,426
and you give me your
perspective on some stuff.

817
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,428
Might see something
I didn't.

818
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:42,262
You think I'd be helpful?

819
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:43,932
Yeah.

820
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,936
That's the sweetest thing
you've done for me all day.

821
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:48,938
Well...

822
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:51,439
What about the,
um...

823
00:37:51,506 --> 00:37:53,441
the other things?
(chuckles)

824
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,375
Fetch me spring rolls.

825
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:59,146
Then we'll bust this case
wide open.

826
00:37:59,215 --> 00:38:02,184
(distant traffic noise,
horns honking)

827
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,156
(indistinct chatter)

828
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:11,961
(door creaking)

829
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:34,883
Whoever you are,

830
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,717
I swear I don't want
to hurt you.

831
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:38,354
I know.

832
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,154
(groans)

833
00:38:42,691 --> 00:38:44,225
I'm counting on it.

834
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,258
You think it's not happening?

835
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,120
You think they're <i>not</i> controlling you?

836
00:38:52,826 --> 00:38:54,094
Don't worry about it.

837
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,129
Just sit back

838
00:38:56,197 --> 00:38:59,064
and wait for them to tell you
what to buy.

839
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:01,535
(groans)

840
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:08,641
(grunting)

841
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:15,180
(groans)

842
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:19,852
(grunting)

843
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:26,926
(groans)

844
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,768
(groans)

845
00:39:36,637 --> 00:39:38,539
(pots clanging)

846
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,111
(groans)

847
00:39:50,852 --> 00:39:52,953
(bowls and plates crashing)

848
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:57,357
(grunting)
(groans)

849
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,627
(groans)

850
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,734
(grunting)

851
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:09,602
(groans)

852
00:40:16,143 --> 00:40:17,477
(grunting)
(groaning)

853
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:26,320
(groans)

854
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,156
(groans)

855
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:45,238
(groans)

856
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:49,176
(panting)

857
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:51,211
The Dollhouse is real.

858
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:52,479
They know you're
after them

859
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,879
and they are going
to have you taken

860
00:40:53,947 --> 00:40:55,615
off the case.
That's why they sent me.

861
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,684
(panting)

862
00:40:58,918 --> 00:41:00,887
Why are you
telling me this?

863
00:41:00,953 --> 00:41:02,887
We have a person inside.

864
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,557
This person corrupted
the imprint

865
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:06,227
while the programmer
wasn't looking,

866
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:07,760
added this parameter.

867
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:09,262
Is this the person

868
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,930
that sent me the tapes and picture?
No.

869
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:12,965
This is their first
communication.

870
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:16,000
Security inside
is very tight.

871
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,004
Where is it?

872
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,305
You can't know that.

873
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,309
You're going about this
the wrong way.

874
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:23,844
I have to take down
the Dollhouse.

875
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,445
There are over 20 Dollhouses,

876
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:27,379
in cities around
the world.

877
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:28,449
They have ties
to every

878
00:41:28,516 --> 00:41:30,482
major political power
on the planet.

879
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:32,518
You cannot possibly
stop them alone.

880
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:34,387
You're going to help me?

881
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:36,889
The person that
sent this message is.

882
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:38,559
Why?

883
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,592
The Dollhouse

884
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,760
Deals in fantasy.

885
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:42,027
That is their business,

886
00:41:42,094 --> 00:41:43,896
but that is not their purpose.

887
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:45,430
What is?

888
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,434
We need you to find out.

889
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,635
We'll contact
you again--

890
00:41:48,703 --> 00:41:51,137
if possible,
with this same body.

891
00:41:51,203 --> 00:41:53,740
But you have to let
the Dollhouse win.

892
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:55,875
Make them back off.

893
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:58,844
You have to trust me.

894
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:01,814
(footfalls)
he's got

895
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:02,682
A gun!

896
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:06,586
You have to go now.

897
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:08,289
He'll live.
You'll be blamed.

898
00:42:08,355 --> 00:42:09,555
The engagement is complete;

899
00:42:09,623 --> 00:42:10,990
they'll never know
I spoke to you.

900
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,324
No.
You have to go.

901
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:13,760
They don't want

902
00:42:13,828 --> 00:42:15,861
to kill you, but they will
protect the information.

903
00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:17,598
Call an ambulance!

904
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:19,266
Officer down!
Go!

905
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:20,732
You can't just....
They will protect

906
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:22,268
the information.

907
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:23,303
They don't want
you dead.

908
00:42:23,371 --> 00:42:24,469
But anyone else....

909
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:26,205
Mellie.

910
00:42:28,742 --> 00:42:30,742
(door lock clicks)

911
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:46,293
(screams)

912
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:49,027
(screams)

913
00:42:57,738 --> 00:43:00,004
(crying)

914
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:02,141
(screaming)

915
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,848
(phone ringing)

916
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:11,016
(crying)

917
00:43:13,854 --> 00:43:15,521
(grunting)

918
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,021
(crying)

919
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,758
Paul (on machine):
Leave a message.

920
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:22,027
Adelle: There are
three flowers in a vase.

921
00:43:22,094 --> 00:43:25,832
The third flower is green.

922
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:27,566
(groans)

923
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:30,469
(groaning)

924
00:43:39,445 --> 00:43:42,314
There are three flowers
in a vase.

925
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:44,350
The third flower

926
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:46,418
is yellow.

927
00:43:50,557 --> 00:43:52,559
(crying)

928
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:07,207
(crying)

929
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:28,300
Forget morality.
Imagine it's true.

930
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,500
Imagine this technology
being used.

931
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:35,314
Now imagine it being used
on you.

932
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,316
Everything you believe,

933
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,818
gone.

934
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,320
Everyone you love, strangers.

935
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,555
Maybe enemies.

936
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,557
Every part of you
that makes you more

937
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:49,229
than a walking cluster
of neurons

938
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:52,230
dissolved
at someone else's whim.

939
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:55,066
If that technology exists--

940
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:56,234
It'll be used.

941
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,238
It'll be abused.

942
00:44:58,305 --> 00:45:00,238
It'll be global.

943
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:03,242
And we will be over.

944
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,746
As a species.

945
00:45:05,812 --> 00:45:07,812
We will cease to matter.

946
00:45:09,783 --> 00:45:12,785
I don't know, maybe we should.

947
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,086
Dominic: I understand.
Thank you.

948
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:47,887
We'll talk soon.

949
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,891
Agent Paul Ballard was
suspended of duty pending

950
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,393
an investigation into the
shooting of Officer Hardin.

951
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,428
Accusations of violent
paranoia, the attack

952
00:45:56,496 --> 00:45:57,762
on Mr. Mynor's bodyguards,

953
00:45:57,832 --> 00:45:59,498
the feud with
the Borodins,

954
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:02,068
as evidenced by the break-in
at his apartment.

955
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:03,402
Hearn's fingerprints?

956
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,738
Came up Russian.
A floater,

957
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,738
not linked to
anyone with power.

958
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:07,906
It's all tied
together, ma'am.

959
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,074
With a pretty bow.

960
00:46:09,143 --> 00:46:10,943
And our sleeper active
performed perfectly.

961
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:12,611
I replayed the tap.

962
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,113
More than once?

963
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,447
It did not lack
for poetry.

964
00:46:15,516 --> 00:46:18,449
Bring her in so Topher
can run a diagnostic.

965
00:46:18,518 --> 00:46:20,453
Are we pulling her?

966
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,453
Now that Ballard's
off the case?

967
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:23,723
No. A man like Ballard

968
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:25,156
doesn't take himself
out of the game,

969
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:26,658
just because of this.

970
00:46:26,727 --> 00:46:28,660
Besides...

971
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:30,662
She loves him.

972
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,264
You played
a good hand, ma'am.

973
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:33,934
I played a very bad
hand very well.

974
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,102
There is a distinction.

975
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:37,168
Of course.

976
00:46:41,707 --> 00:46:43,242
I want you to contact
your counterparts

977
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:44,410
in all the other houses,

978
00:46:44,477 --> 00:46:46,012
tell them about what
happened to Sierra.

979
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:48,012
That won't look
good for you.

980
00:46:48,082 --> 00:46:49,949
It can't happen again.

981
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,516
Anywhere.

982
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:52,617
She's alright?

983
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,488
Topher did everything
he knows

984
00:46:55,555 --> 00:46:59,492
to remove the experience.

985
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,160
Ignorance in this case,

986
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:02,795
truly is bliss.

987
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:04,730
I don't think
they're as ignorant

988
00:47:04,797 --> 00:47:06,164
as they're supposed to be.

989
00:47:06,232 --> 00:47:08,168
No.

990
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:09,836
We're working on it.

991
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,473
Good day.

992
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,840
You have a book.

993
00:47:14,908 --> 00:47:17,844
I enjoy looking at it.

994
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,746
Would you like to see?

995
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,562
Hello, Echo.

996
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,703
You've drawn a picture.

997
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,703
It's very good.

998
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:48,607
It isn't finished.

999
00:47:49,643 --> 00:47:52,211
The picture?

1000
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,850
It isn't finished.

1001
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:01,520
You'd like it to be finished?

1002
00:48:01,586 --> 00:48:03,656
(mellow guitar intro playing)

1003
00:48:03,723 --> 00:48:08,793
<i>if I could write out
my own dream</i>

1004
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:14,232
<i>for the next time
that I sleep</i>

1005
00:48:14,301 --> 00:48:18,938
<i>you'd be the first one
that I see</i>

1006
00:48:19,004 --> 00:48:23,809
<i>and I the last one
that you keep</i>

1007
00:48:23,877 --> 00:48:27,779
<i>the dream would go on and on</i>

1008
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:30,615
<i>while we sway</i>

1009
00:48:30,684 --> 00:48:34,719
<i>against all things
thrown our way</i>

1010
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:38,023
<i>and the morning
would be so cruel</i>

1011
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,191
<i>when it came</i>

1012
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,164
<i>with sunshine
and warmth to bring</i>

1013
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:49,668
<i>for announcing the end
of my sweet dream</i>

1014
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:51,703
<i>for announcing
the end of my sweet dream.</i>

1015
