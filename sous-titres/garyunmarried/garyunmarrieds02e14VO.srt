1
00:00:01,036 --> 00:00:03,304
Oh, my gosh. I think I have tennis elbow.

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:04,839
I think--think I have tennis wrist.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,674
I think I have tennis ass.

4
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,476
But I think that happened

5
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:10,612
From when I tried to jump over the net.

6
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:12,380
I would have gone easier on you, gary,

7
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:14,382
But you said you played tennis all the time.

8
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:15,483
I do. I play tennis every day,

9
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:17,685
But the racket's a lot heavier

10
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,454
Than those little plastic controllers.

11
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:23,124
Well, maybe from now on,
you and I should stick to indoor sports.

12
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,726
Wow. Yeah.

13
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:26,127
Wh-what's this? I only get one arm?

14
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:28,262
I can't--I can't lift it. You gotta--

15
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:29,263
There you go.

16
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:30,365
Knock, knock.

17
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,899
Oops. Sorry. Oh.

18
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,336
Yeah. Hi. You know what's even
better than saying, "knock, knock"?

19
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:36,504
Knocking.

20
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:39,340
I'll go get the kids. Great.

21
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:40,441
Hey, allison.

22
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:42,977
Hey, sasha. Nice to see you. In the morning.

23
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:45,313
I didn realize you guys
were at the sleepover stage.

24
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:47,649
Oh, no. We just met for
an early tennis date.

25
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,918
Ha! Oh. You're serious. Wow. Yeah.

26
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:53,154
One time I tried to play tennis with gary.

27
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:56,791
He was so disappointed the can of
balls didn't have pringles in them.

28
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:59,527
Mm. Yeah, well, it's true
he's not as good as louise.

29
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:01,963
Boy, that girl can sure
power 'em over the net

30
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:04,165
For a girl with arms like a barbie doll.

31
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,602
Ooh. You--you played tennis with louise?

32
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:10,571
Yeah, last week, after tom and
I went to the batting cages.

33
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:12,340
Huh. Those two are such a blast.

34
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:14,876
Yeah. I know. I have fun
with them all the time.

35
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:17,245
Last week was movie night, "doctor ivago."

36
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:21,649
Tom said, and I quote, "that was
the loest movie I've ever seen.

37
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,951
[laughing] yeah.

38
00:01:23,952 --> 00:01:26,821
So you're preachin' to the choir. Boy.

39
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:28,556
Kids'll be out in a minute.

40
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:30,191
Ok, ok. I'll just-- I'll be in the car.

41
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:31,192
Hey, allison. What?

42
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:32,894
Can I have the kids this weekend?

43
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:33,928
What, on valentine's day?

44
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:35,196
I'd've thought you 2 lovebirds

45
00:01:35,197 --> 00:01:36,931
Would have planned to do something alone.

46
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:39,100
Here's the thing. Sasha
wanted to do something special

47
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,568
With tom and louise. That's all.

48
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,070
Oh. Really?

49
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:44,839
I scored thiinvitation to this
huge new arcade in the valley,

50
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,974
And I st think the kids would love it.

51
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:48,843
Oh, gosh. An arcade.

52
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:50,611
In the valley. Ahh.

53
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:51,846
Those--I mean,

54
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:54,515
Those places are always
so crowded and dirty.

55
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:57,218
At what point are you gonna
get some help? Seriously.

56
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,920
With the germs, you're like a maniac.

57
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,955
You put so many toilet
seat covers on the seat,

58
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:02,290
Your feet don't even touch the ground

59
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,891
When you go to the ba-- gary.

60
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:08,162
You know what? I shared a
bathroom with you for 15 years.

61
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:10,932
What exactly was wrong wi the
inside of the toilet bowl

62
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:13,468
That was not good enough
for your pee. Huh? What?

63
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,002
Hey, guys, you ready to go?

64
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:15,970
Yeah, mom.

65
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:18,306
Bye, sasha. Thanks for dog my nails.

66
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:20,675
Hey, thanks for doin' mine. Bye, shoe.

67
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:21,843
See ya, dog.

68
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,813
Wow. Wow, you got nicknames, huh?

69
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,715
We played monopoly last night.

70
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:29,383
Yeah, tom was the shoe. I was the dog.

71
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:30,952
Louise was the top hat.

72
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:32,820
See ya later, beer cap.

73
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,757
Ha ha. Beer cap.

74
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:37,391
Yeah. We, uh, lost a couple pieces,

75
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,861
So I had to borrow one
from the checkerboard. Oh.

76
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:43,865
So, allison, is it ok if I
take them to the arcade?

77
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:46,067
Yeah. I guess, you know, as long as you

78
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:48,035
Checked it out and they wanna go, ok.

79
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,470
What's wrong with you? What's the worst

80
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,705
That could happen? It's an arcade.

81
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:52,540
Gee, let me see. The security guy

82
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,808
Tackles you to t ground

83
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,409
For tipping over the quarte
r-pushing machine.

84
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,678
I put, like, $40 in that machine.

85
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,480
I didn't get anything, bubkes, nothin'.

86
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:00,982
Then an 8-year-old comes by,

87
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,683
Puts in one quarter, wi the jackpot?

88
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,385
Not on my watch. All right.

89
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:13,023

90
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:16,914
Hey, curtis, what do you thk sounds better,

91
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:19,717
A hot-oil or a 4-handed massage?

92
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:22,286
Oh, gary, didn't you learn your lesson

93
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,288
Last time you were in koreatown?

94
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,723
It's not for me, curtis, ok?

95
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,057
It's for sasha, all right?

96
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:29,093
I thoughit'd be nice for valentine's day,

97
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:31,128
Get her a nice spa gift certificate, ok?

98
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:33,030
And for the record, that place in koreatown,

99
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:34,732
I thought that was legit, all right?

100
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,601
And I--I did learn the words in korean

101
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,703
For, "let go."

102
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:40,905
A spa gift certificate?

103
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:43,841
You been seein' sasha for,
like, what, 6 weeks?

104
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,809
No, you are under no obligation

105
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,346
Honor the big-ticket holidays
until at least 3 months in.

106
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:51,015
I like--I like sasha, though, you know,

107
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,950
A lot, and things are going really great.

108
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:54,652
She's makin' an effort with the kids.

109
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,853
Last night, she played operation with them

110
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:58,522
So long I had to replace the light bulb

111
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:00,324
In that naked fat guy's nose.

112
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,825
Yeah. Ok, just set the bar low.

113
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,861
If y go crazy and set expectations too high,

114
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,429
Then you have to keep outdoing yourself

115
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,797
For the restof the relationship.

116
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:08,832
That's true. You know, with allison,

117
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,134
My first gift was gold earrings.

118
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:11,936
By the time we'd been together 10 years,

119
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:13,504
She wouldn't take off her bra unless

120
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,306
There was a new mercede.

121
00:04:15,307 --> 00:04:17,508
You bought allison a mercedes?

122
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,643
No, but after 10 years of marriage, I really

123
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:22,212
Didn't care if the bra was onr not. I just--

124
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:23,414
All right. Ok.

125
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,649
Just don't make the same
mistake with sasha, ok

126
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,452
If you have to get her anything,
set the bar low.

127
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:29,553
Sasha: Hey, guys.

128
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:31,655
Ooh, curtis, I'm loving
that new sweater vest.

129
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,458
Hey, gary, this girl is one
in a million right here.

130
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,026
You better be treatin' her right.

131
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,027
All right? Mm-hmm.

132
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:40,297
[mouths words]

133
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:44,835
All righok.Mm-hmm.

134
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,103
All right, there you go.

135
00:04:46,104 --> 00:04:49,840
I don't know why it took 39 yearsto figu.

136
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:52,710
[knocks] hey, gary.

137
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,378
Oh, is that for me?

138
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,046
Is it ticking?

139
00:04:58,183 --> 00:04:59,817
Why are you here?

140
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:01,852
Because you don't pick up
your phone when I call.

141
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:03,654
Because I have caller I.D. I know it's you.

142
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:05,389
Ok. Well, if you would have answered,

143
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,324
You would know that the kids are grounded,

144
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,559
So they're staying with me.

145
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,561
No. Grounded? Why? Well, why?

146
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:12,296
Because I asked them to
take in the groceries

147
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:13,664
From the car. They put it off

148
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:15,032
Playing video games. I ended up having

149
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,400
To throw away $100 worth of food.

150
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,668
So I'm sorry, but they're not gonna

151
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:19,737
Be able to go to sasha's
little arcade night.

152
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:22,339
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You can't do this, not this weekend.

153
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,408
Everybody is really lookin'
forward to it, allison.

154
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:26,443
Gary, I'm sorry, but the kids have to learn

155
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:28,045
That there are consequences
to their actions.

156
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:29,580
Besides, you're not the one whose car

157
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,749
Is gonna smell like blue cheese for a month.

158
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:35,119
My van has smelled like blue
cheese for, like, 5 years.

159
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,220
I don't care. That's true.

160
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:37,421
Why are you sabotaging

161
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:39,857
Sasha's time with the kids?

162
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:41,625
I am not. Yes, you are.

163
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,460
Please! Anyone who is sleeping with you

164
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:46,230
Is taking a hit for the
entire female species, gary.

165
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:48,265
I mean, I appreciate that, ok?

166
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,402
But I-I'm not gonna-
I'm not gonna bend the rules

167
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:53,871
Just because sas has
some silly arcade plans.

168
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:56,006
You're jealous 'cause the
kids have fun with sasha.

169
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,241
Ok, why would I be jealous?

170
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:58,942
I am just as much fun as sasha.

171
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,611
No, you're not. Hey, you know what?

172
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:02,112
You know what? For your information,

173
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,615
I, uh--I took the kids
to the beach last week.

174
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,116
We all had a great time.

175
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,151
Yeah, I heard about that.

176
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:08,619
You put so much sunscreen on 'em,

177
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,721
They looked like they were in a silent film.

178
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:18,696
So that's 4 for dinner in
the green knight section.

179
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:21,365
Um, and what time does the joust start?

180
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:24,234
"when the sun is nigh over the hills"?

181
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,472
So, like, half past nigh?

182
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,208
Ok. Ok, great.

183
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:34,845
Hey, gary, I just made dinner
reservations for before the arcade,

184
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:36,780
But if you wanna drink, you're gonna have to

185
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:37,881
Bring your own grog. Sorry.

186
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:38,982
They lost their quor license

187
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,217
After the black knight

188
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:42,786
Shot the r knight in the parking lot.

189
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,521
Sasha, look,

190
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:46,757
I don't think arcade night's gonna happen.

191
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,692
Allison, uh, she grounded the kids.

192
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:49,693
What? It's terrible.

193
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:50,661
Oh, no. Yeah.

194
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:52,529
Oh, they would have loved it. I know.

195
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,766
Hey, but I got somethin'
that might cheer you up. Ok?

196
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:59,103
I know we didn't talk a
lot about valentine's day,

197
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:00,471
But I--I just went for it.

198
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:02,506
Gary, that's so sweet.

199
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,441
Oh, you really shouldn't have.

200
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:05,576
We must on the same page,

201
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:08,479
Because I got somethin' for you, too.

202
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,747
No way. Yeah.

203
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:11,215
Awesome. You open yours first.

204
00:07:11,216 --> 00:07:12,549
Ok. Ah, that's glued.

205
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,685
You're never gonna get it. Here.

206
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:17,554
There you go.

207
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:18,756
Ok. Oh, gary,

208
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:20,824
You know it's the thought
that counts, right?

209
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:24,294
I really hope you didn't do
anything too extravagant.

210
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:26,964
[disappointed] oh, good. You didn't.

211
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,333
You got me...

212
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,535
Wristbands.

213
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,237
Yeah. And-- and a matching headband.

214
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:36,840
It'll keep the-- the sweat out of
your eyes next time we play tennis.

215
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:38,809
Wow. Wristbands.

216
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,977
And a matching headban hee.

217
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:42,746
Wow. That's-- it's so practical.

218
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,481
Gary, I don't think mine is quite as--

219
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:45,949
Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

220
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,585
It's the thought that counts,
just like you said.

221
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:51,555
Oh, my god!

222
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:55,759
An autographed kirk gibson
baseball card from 1988!

223
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,327
Yeah!

224
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:59,029
Oh, my god!

225
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,397
How did you get this?

226
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,633
I--I went to a sports memorabilia auction.

227
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:06,336
The only way I got it was
by outbidding kirk gibson.

228
00:08:06,337 --> 00:08:08,772
Whoo! This is awesome!

229
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:09,907
He autographed it!

230
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:12,276
This is wh he hit the
home run off of eckersley

231
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:13,977
In the world series, and you got it!

232
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:19,516
This is incredible! This is so...

233
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:24,221
I, uh--I don't even know what to say,

234
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:25,422
Except...

235
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:28,992
Bo-oi-oi-oing! Ha ha ha ha!

236
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:31,962
Gotcha! You got served.

237
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:34,164
[laughs] what are you talking about?

238
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,532
You thought that was your
real valentine's day present?

239
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,801
Oh, it's not? Ha ha ha! No.

240
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,203
That's like a total goofy gift.

241
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:42,206
What kind of a guy gets
his girlfriend wristbands

242
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:44,775
And a matching headbd for valentine's day?

243
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:48,011
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You should've seen your face.

244
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:49,580
Whoo!

245
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,716
You were like, "
I'm breakin' up with gary brooks."

246
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:54,585
I was a little surprised.

247
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,787
You were surprised?
Wait how surprised you're gonna be

248
00:08:56,788 --> 00:09:00,724
When you see your real gift, whh is
at my house right now waiting for you.

249
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:01,725
Really? Yeah, really.

250
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:03,327
Ok. Now I'm getting excited.

251
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:06,463
Yeah, I hope you wear your min
d-explosion-prevention helmet,

252
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,899
Because I don't want to be raping pieces

253
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,134
Ofute sasha's brains off the ceiling

254
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:14,705
From when you see the present and
your head explodes off your body.

255
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:17,174
Ok, so I should come over around 5:00?

256
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:18,175
5:00 is awesome.

257
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:19,877
5:00 gives me plenty of time to...

258
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:22,646
Do nothing, because it's already
at my house waiting for you,

259
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:24,915
Like just waiting for you to be there.

260
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,750
Ok. All right. Ok.

261
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,518
Gary, I hope you didn't go overboard.

262
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,721
Don't worry. I won't.

263
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,990
Curtis, how could you do that to me, man?

264
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:34,658
You sold me down the river with sasha.

265
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,493
You told me to set the bar low.

266
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:38,061
I made a fool out of myself.

267
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:39,730
Why? What did you get her?

268
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:42,633
I t her terry cloth wristbands
and a matching headband.

269
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:44,434
A-are you crazy?

270
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:46,270
I didn't mean set it that low.

271
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:47,905
Seriously, wristbands?

272
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:48,906
And a matching headband.

273
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,607
Why does everybody leave out the headband?

274
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:53,377
That is only a good valentine's day gift

275
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:56,747
If you're dating 1977 john mcenroe.

276
00:09:57,715 --> 00:10:00,717
Are you dating 1977 john mcenroe?

277
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:02,019
No.

278
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,221
Then why did you buy athletic equipment

279
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:06,290
For 1977 john mcenroe?

280
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,591
I don't know. I freaked out.

281
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:09,760
I made a mistake,
ok? But now I'm in deeper trouble,

282
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:11,962
'cause I told her the
real gift is at my house.

283
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:13,664
Which is...

284
00:10:13,665 --> 00:10:16,700
Which is what? Tell me, man.
Don't leave me hangin'.

285
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:24,269
Hey, allison.

286
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,637
What are you doing here?

287
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:26,905
Uh, you're not pickin' up your phone.

288
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:29,141
Yeah, 'cause I have caller I.
D. I know it's you.

289
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:32,444
What was the name of the store
the mall that I used to go to

290
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:33,912
Whenever I had a problem with you?

291
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:35,080
Uh, you mean conundrum?

292
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,715
Look, I don't like that you use fancy words

293
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:37,816
Now that we're not together anymore.

294
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,484
Just tell me the name of the place, ok?

295
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:42,154
No, gary, the name of the
store is called conundrum.

296
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,488
That is the name of the store?

297
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:44,956
Yeah. Yeah. Ok, what is all this?

298
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:47,659
Oh. Well, uh, even though I always
have a great time with the ds,

299
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,728
Yeah. Yeah. I decided to kick it
up a notch tonight. Is all this?

300
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:51,096
"no holds barred."

301
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:52,831
Oh, what? So now you have
to say things differently?

302
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:54,800
No, you rented the movie "no holds barred."

303
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:55,901
It's-- oh.

304
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,636
Hulk hogan and joan severance.

305
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:59,004
This thing's amazing.

306
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,205
Ok, gary just-- just get out of here

307
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,707
And let me have my fun night. Put it back.

308
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,108
Alternate ending? Are you kidding me?

309
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:04,943
Nobody better breathe a word of what happens

310
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:06,345
Until I see this for myself.

311
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,312
Gary, get out.

312
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:08,647
I'm leaving. Get out.

313
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:10,148
Bye. Kids, dinner!

314
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,118
I got burgers and milkshakes,

315
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,987
And I made some cookies for dessert.

316
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:19,491
But if you want to eat them as
an appetizer, go ahead, huh?

317
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,928
Maybe it's backwards night.

318
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,865
How crazy is that, right?

319
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,667
But I thought we were grounded.

320
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,102
Oh, it doesn't mean you can't have fun.

321
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,903
Well, it does, actually.

322
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:34,339
You know what? I also-- I alsoot some movies

323
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,142
That we could--we could watch
all night long if we want.

324
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:38,677
You know what? Wouldn't that be fun?

325
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:41,246
What are you gs waitin' for? Just dig in.
Go ahead. Here we go.

326
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,950
So we don't have to worry about
growth hormones in meat anymore?

327
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:48,086
Tom, girls like tall guys, ok?

328
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,889
What's in this cookie? It tastes weird.

329
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,493
Oh, uh, real sugar and white flour.

330
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,695
I know. And you know what?

331
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,063
Whenou guys brush your teeth tonight,

332
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,599
I'm not even gonna time you.

333
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,067
Right?

334
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:04,903
Arthese r-rated movies?

335
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,705
Yeah. I just got you guys all the stuff

336
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,440
You been begging me to see.

337
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,342
Uh, the pg-13 ones are for louise.

338
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:11,843
But I'm not even 13.

339
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:13,945
Mom, are you having a nervous breakdown?

340
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,747
No. No, honey, I'm not.

341
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:17,716
These movies are full of sex and violence.

342
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:20,619
Ok? And thinking about either one
is gonna keep me up all night.

343
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,456
Ok, and you're the one who's always
talking about the correlation

344
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:27,092
Between sleep deprivation and
poor performance in school.

345
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,094
Ok, so what? Are you giving up on me?

346
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,128
Am I that far gone?

347
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,997
Oh, honey, come on, tom.

348
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:33,999
No. You know what, mom? You're scaring me.

349
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,100
Oh, my gosh.

350
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,903
I may as well put this
sugar high to good use.

351
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm going to go to my room and
learn latin before I crash.

352
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,175
But you guys! You guys, look!

353
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,477
You didn't even-- you didn't
see the video game I got.

354
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:47,245
"resident evil 5."

355
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:48,647
Look.

356
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,248
Whoever kills the most zombies

357
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:54,052
Doesn't have to take
their calcium supplement!

358
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:00,192
I'm tellin' you, curtis,
in spite of what you told me,

359
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:02,527
I was able to fix things with sasha, ok?

360
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,563
I went to the mall, my old reliable spot.

361
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,231
I was able to right the ship.

362
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:07,399
But, hey, word of advice.

363
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,067
Don't stop at the hair-extension kiosk

364
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:11,436
Unless you wanna come
home with a fake ponytail.

365
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,971
All right, I gotta go. See yolater.

366
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:15,140
[knocking on door]

367
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:20,245
Hey, gary. Hi. Hey, what's up?

368
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:22,280
Come on in. Ooh.

369
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,086
Am I here to watch you sign the
declaration of independence?

370
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,388
I can't get it out. I need your help.

371
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,091
Ok. Ow, ow, ow.

372
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,159
That hurts a lot.

373
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,460
There you go. Ok. Here.

374
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:36,428
Come on in.

375
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:38,463
Sorry I'm late. I would have called

376
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,599
But I decided not to sweat it.

377
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,068
Ah ha ha! Yeah! Right?

378
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:44,903
Those things.

379
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:47,372
L-o-l.

380
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:50,108
I can't believe you thought
that was your real gift.

381
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:52,577
Which means you're really
gonna go crazy when you see

382
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,713
Your real valentine's day gift.

383
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,782
Ah hah hah. Ooh.

384
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:59,284
I love the store, conundrum.

385
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:00,252
Yeah, it's nice.

386
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,287
I got you a gift receipt for you,

387
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,588
In case you wanna return it,

388
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,223
But I think their printer was broken,

389
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:06,525
'cause they put today's date on,

390
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:07,993
Even though, you know, I bought this,

391
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,227
Like, 2 weeks ago. So whatever.

392
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,228
That's weird.

393
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,230
Ok. [gasps]

394
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:15,300
Oh, gary, what a beautiful locket.

395
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:16,301
That's right.

396
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,736
You know, I saw that,

397
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:18,870
It just said sasha.

398
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:19,871
Oh ho ho.

399
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,640
I love it. Thank you.

400
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,175
Open it up. There's a picture inside.

401
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:26,878
Ohh! What a cute picture of louise.

402
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,446
Yeah. That's me, actually.

403
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,682
I was--I was a pretty scrawny kid.

404
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:31,683
Oh.

405
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:33,852
Gary, it's perfect.

406
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,320
Thank you.

407
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:37,188
Hi, dad.

408
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,557
Oh, goodness gracious.

409
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:39,758
What are you guys doing here?

410
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,793
Mom. Yeah, she told us to get in the car,

411
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:42,794
And I didn't ask questions.

412
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:44,362
I was afraid she was trying

413
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:46,498
To stuff a twinkie in my mouth.

414
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,133
Hey, gary. Hey, sasha. Uh,

415
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,968
I just wanted to let everyone know

416
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,503
That arcade night is back on.

417
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:53,405
So gget your stuff. What?

418
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:54,773
Yay! All right!

419
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:57,676
Thank you, allison. That's great.

420
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:58,677
Yeah. You know what?

421
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:00,245
We were havin' such a great time

422
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:01,813
At my house. I thought, you know,

423
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:04,416
It's just not even fair to
have the fun stop there,

424
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,850
So have at them, you know.

425
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:07,485
Let the good times roll.

426
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,255
With antibacterial hand spray. Rit there.

427
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:11,423
Great.

428
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:12,724
Well, we should probably get going

429
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:15,160
So the kids have more time
to play before they close.

430
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:17,596
Yeah, I'll go put the
champagne in the fridge.

431
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:18,763
Aw, yeah.

432
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,933
You know, I, uh-
I need to sit down a second.

433
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,668
Are you ok?Yeah. I just, uh...

434
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:26,004
I think I poisoned myself with processed mts

435
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,441
And preservative-laced dairy, but--[gasps]

436
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:31,543
I'm gonna be fine once I puke.

437
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,378
Yeah. It's gonna be good.

438
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,379
Wh--

439
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,181
Wow. That's, um-- hmm?

440
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,450
That's a really interesting locket.

441
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,051
Oh, this? Ah, yeah.

442
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:42,287
Gary actually gave this to me. Yeah.

443
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:45,523
A locket was always his "get
out of the ghouse" gift. Yeah.

444
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:48,827
As--as I recall, I think he gave this to me

445
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:50,996
When he went out drinking for oktoberfest.

446
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,031
He didn't come home till November.

447
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:57,135
Mmm. His "get out of the
doghouse gift," huh?

448
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,036
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

449
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,838
So if you ever get in a fight with him

450
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,706
Or if he screws up, you can always count

451
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:03,308
On a piece of jewelry comin' your way.

452
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,510
Yeah. Seems like a pretty safe bet.

453
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:06,811
We're ready. We're ready.

454
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:08,113
Ok, kids. Let's go.

455
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,382
All right, allison. Well, see you later.

456
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:13,952
Tell gary I love my locket
as much as I love yours.

457
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:17,288
What? Aren't you gonna wait for gary?

458
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,827
Oh, crap.

459
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,563
Where's, uh-- where's sasha?

460
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:28,500
Uh, she left for the arcade with the kids.

461
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,536
Without saying good-bye?
That's a little bizarre, don't you think?

462
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,304
Yeah. Yeah, I think she's a little mad.

463
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:36,541
Ah, I don't think so,not after .

464
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,413
Allison, is that-- mine.

465
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:43,415
And you decided to-- yeah.

466
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,749
Am I-- oh, so much.

467
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,551
Gaah!

468
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:48,486
Why would you wear it here, now?

469
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:49,788
How was I supposed to know?

470
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:51,623
I don't have a crystal ball of stupidity.

471
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:54,793
The only one I know of
is attached to your neck.

472
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:56,161
I gotta go get her.

473
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:57,829
Sasha!

474
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,031
Oh, man, I hope it's not too late.

475
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:01,700
It's too late. She's gone.

476
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,134
That's great.

477
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,436
The locket was supposed to be

478
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:05,904
The gift to make everything better.

479
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:07,272
Now erything's a million times worse.

480
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,607
Why is it so hard to find the perfect gift?

481
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,176
Gary, it's because of
the way you buy a gift.

482
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,610
You always have an agenda--

483
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:13,611
Lowering someone's expectations,

484
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:14,979
Getting someone to forgive you,

485
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,148
Getting someone to have sex with you.

486
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,783
That's what gifts are for.

487
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:19,784
Ok, gary,

488
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:21,119
Sten to me.

489
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,521
You don't give someone a gift
to get something in return.

490
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:26,624
You give them a gift to show
them how you feel about them.

491
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,094
What? When did this start?

492
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,161
Ok,

493
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:33,164
Why don't yo have it start tonight?

494
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,533
You're right. I gotta get to the arcade.

495
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,001
To tell her...

496
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,369
To tell her what?

497
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,572
Why won't anybody finish a sentence?

498
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:46,878
Quit cutting me off.

499
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,913
Ah, women drivers.

500
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:52,784
Women drivers? Your character's a girl.

501
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:55,620
I like what she's wearing.

502
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,323
Oh. There's sasha. Go talk to her.

503
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,624
Yeah, I don't thinso.

504
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,292
She's holding a mallet.

505
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,863
Gary, you'll be fine.

506
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,531
That's what you said at the grand canyon

507
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:09,734
When you kept telling me to
back up to get my picture taken.

508
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,469
So you, uh-- you have the thing?

509
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,704
Yeah, I got the thing.

510
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:13,872
All rit, well, go.

511
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:22,981
Hi. Oh.

512
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:24,349
Hi.

513
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:27,385
Bet you're pretty mad, huh?

514
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:28,586
Yeah, little bit.

515
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:32,390
Well, all I have to say
to that is bo-oi-oing.

516
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:35,527
Bu-whup. I got you again.

517
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,796
Because the locket--

518
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,430
Why am I even doing this?

519
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:40,899
It barely worked that one time.

520
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm sorry. I got you those wristbands,

521
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:46,805
And I just freaked out, and I tried
to fix it the only way I know how.

522
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,006
I'm sorry, ok?

523
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,742
And I just freaked out, gary, I'm not so
much madx it as I am embarrassed, ok?Now
how.

524
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,510
Because the difference
in our gifts clearly show

525
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,312
That you don't feel the same way about me

526
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:56,915
As I feel about you, and that's fine.
I mean, we haven't--

527
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,918
Sa-sasha, I didn't want to go too
far too fast with the first gift,

528
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,553
So I was gonna set the bar low.

529
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,254
I could have set it a lot lower.

530
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:04,756
You don't know how close you came

531
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:07,325
To getting an e-card with a
singing and dancing pickle, ok?

532
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,628
Look, gary, let's-- let's just
forget the whole thing, ok?

533
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,564
Let's forget valentine's day ever happened.

534
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,532
I won't even say, "valentine's day."

535
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:17,468
From now on, I'm just gonna say, "v.D." ok?

536
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:18,436
Ok.

537
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,705
You know what's great about v.D.?

538
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,908
Is that it brought you
and I closer together.

539
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:27,245
Uh, I got somethin' for you.

540
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:30,415
Uh, actually, why don't you put down
the mallet in case you don't like it.

541
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,385
You know that machine, you put $5.00 in it,

542
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:37,288
And they give you a penny
with a message on it?

543
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,358
"I butt you"?

544
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,559
Yeah.

545
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,928
The heart came out upside down,

546
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:47,131
But that's how I feel, so...

547
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,500
This is a perfect gift.

548
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,907
And just for the record,

549
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:57,942
I butt you, too.

550
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:59,544
[laughs]

551
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,579
There you guys are.

552
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,947
How you doing, allison? You vin' fun?

553
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:06,516
Yeah, I'm tryin'.
Look at me eatin' a hot dog, huh?

554
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:07,551
Ah-choo. Uh.

555
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:08,885
I was eating a hot dog.

556
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:10,986
Here.

557
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:14,022
Hey, the-- the mechanical
bull is 18 and over.

558
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,091
One of you's gotta try it.

559
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,358
Not me, little man.

560
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,993
Once I tried a mechanical bull,

561
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:20,796
I had to sit on fron peas for a week.

562
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:22,364
Mom?

563
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:24,734
What? A mechanical bull, and get thrown

564
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:27,336
And spun around in every direction. Ah...

565
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,537
Sasha?

566
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,372
No way. I can never stay on those things.

567
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:31,373
It's way too hard.

568
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,476
Show me the bull.

569
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,479
I can take it easy on you if you like.

570
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,414
What, are you kidding?
Kids are over there watchin'.

571
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:39,782
There you go. Tom: All right.

572
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:42,852
Good luck, mom.

573
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,420
Yeah. L right.

574
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:45,921
Ohh!

575
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:47,957
Louise: Go, mom! Tom: All right!

576
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,925
All right, allison.

577
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:55,331
Whoo! Go, mom!

578
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:57,166
Allison, watch out! Your shirt!

579
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:01,103
Allison, your shir-- oh, and they're out.

580
