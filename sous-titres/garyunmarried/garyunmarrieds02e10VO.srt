1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,605
Curtis: Hey, gar.
Now let me ask you
something.

2
00:00:03,606 --> 00:00:05,606
Charlene's out of town
for a few days

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,608
And I'm watching
her daughter michaela.

4
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:10,344
Any ideas how to entertain
a 13-year-old girl?

5
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:12,846
Oh, why don't you
take her to, like,
pepe's pizza?

6
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:15,419
That place is cool.
They got video games,
they serve pizza.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,454
Heck, they even serve
beer over there.
You know what?

8
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:20,721
If you go, I'll go
with you. What time
do you want to go?

9
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:23,301
Morning, guys.
Hey, could we turn on
the air? I'm boiling.

10
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:24,089
Of course
you're boiling.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,257
You're wearing
a sweater.
It's 75 degrees out.

12
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,284
I just miss
wearing sweaters.

13
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:30,280
You know, you guys have
no change of seasons here.

14
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:33,861
Winter in l.A. Is blond guys
in flip-flops sitting
outside starbucks

15
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:36,789
Working on
their screenplay idea.

16
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:40,957
Ok, first of all,
it's a miniseries.

17
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,440
I guess I just miss home.

18
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:45,454
Hey, I know
what'll cheer you up.

19
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:47,467
Let's go out to dinner
at my favorite restaurant.

20
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:50,454
Oh, that barbecue place?
Oh, I don't know.

21
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:54,752
There's a picture of
a pig wearing a top hat.
It weirds me out.

22
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:56,226
Let me tell you something.

23
00:00:56,227 --> 00:00:58,776
Anytime you see a pig
wearing formal wear,

24
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:00,921
That's class.

25
00:01:00,922 --> 00:01:03,399
Besides, we're going
to my other favorite
restaurant--leo's.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,815
Come on. What do you say?
It'll be like our first date.

27
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,863
Oh, gary, I actually
wanted to talk to you
about that.

28
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,839
Can I see you
in my office?

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,030
Oh, yes, principal warden.
I've been a very bad boy.
Maybe you can give me an "f".

30
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:20,615
I talk too much.

31
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:25,270
Look, I like you,
gary.

32
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:26,812
It's just I'm
wondering if we have

33
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:28,753
Too many things
stacked against us.

34
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,727
I mean,
we work together,

35
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:34,776
And just the thought
of dating a divorced guy
really scares me.

36
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:37,118
You see, um,
it's just

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,092
When my mom and dad
got divorced,

38
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,596
My dad went through
this whole string
of women

39
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:42,436
And he wasn't
really there
for any of them.

40
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:45,447
Between weekends
with us and all the
fighting with my mom

41
00:01:45,448 --> 00:01:48,157
They just got
the last scraps
of his attention.

42
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,164
Look, if you and I date,
that's not gonna happen

43
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:51,034
'cause I'm gonna give you
my full attention.

44
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:53,677
Curtis: Gary,
you got to see this.
What is it?

45
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:57,187
That...That's an example
of something

46
00:01:57,188 --> 00:02:00,098
That will never happen
once we start dating.

47
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:02,707
Look, gary, I'm sorry.
I just don't think
it's gonna work.

48
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,745
Well, I should let you know,
I'm the type of guy,

49
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:06,518
When I'm faced
with insurmountable odds,

50
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,790
I have a can-do attitude.
I'm sorry, gary.

51
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,802
The answer's no.
Well, there's
nothing else I can do.

52
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:16,313
What is it, curtis?
It better be good.
It is, man. Check this out.

53
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:21,058
Somebody has been writing
a horrible screenplay
on your computer, man.

54
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,105
What is wrong
with you, gary?

55
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:27,610
I'm making all
this headway with sasha,

56
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,080
But, you know,
here's the problem:

57
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,550
She thinks that if we date,

58
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm not gonna make her
my top priority.

59
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,292
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Hey, look, let me
give you an antidote.

60
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:36,297
I don't want another one
of your long stories, curtis.

61
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:38,738
Not an anecdote,
an antidote--

62
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:40,241
A corrective
countermeasure

63
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:41,979
That will remedy
your situation.

64
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,683
See, with a girl
that looks
like sasha,

65
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,722
She could basically
have any man
that she wants, ok?

66
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:47,191
I mean,
she's no fool.

67
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:50,098
She has sampled
the wares--
plenty, I am sure.

68
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,072
All right, ok.
Just get to the point.

69
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,110
You need to let
sasha know that she's
the only one for you.

70
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,784
Make a unique gesture.
Make her feel special.

71
00:02:57,785 --> 00:02:59,855
That'll take care of
all that priority stuff.
Trust me.

72
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:01,559
Yeah.
You know, just to start,
why don't you take her

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,829
To your favorite
restaurant?

74
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,771
I can't.
The pig ruined it for me.

75
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:09,343
Allison?
No.

76
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:10,847
An actual pig.
The barbecue place?

77
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:12,885
The pig's wearing
a little top hat and a tuxedo?

78
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:14,354
Oh, come on. You got
to be kidding me, man.

79
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:17,261
A pig in formal wear?
That's class.

80
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:24,106

81
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,943
Allison: Gary, I need
the extra key
for my car.

82
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:31,846
Mom needs the spare key
because she's trading in
her station wagon

83
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:34,949
For a yellow convertible bug
that I'll be driving
in a few years.

84
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,951
No way. That's a girl car.
I'm gonna be driving
before louise.

85
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,987
I say minivan, ok?
Those things got, like,
10 cup holders.

86
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:44,556
The people in the back
control their own
air conditioning.
Allison: Ok.

87
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,591
Look, this is
gonna be my car,
all right?

88
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:48,593
The one that
I pick out alone,

89
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,561
Without someone
embarrassing me

90
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,730
At the dealership
with his stupid
haggling.

91
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,164
But it's not stupid.

92
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:56,232
My negotiations
have saved this family
thousands of dollars.

93
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,234
Ok, gary,
you don't negotiate.

94
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,169
You get mad,
you get obnoxious,

95
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,137
And then you piss
the sales guy off.

96
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:04,639
We are the only people
in the history
of car sales

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,142
Who had complimentary
coffee and doughnuts
taken away.

98
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:12,078
Hey, everybody.
This is michaela.

99
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,080
Hi.
Gary: Hi, michaela.
How are you?

100
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:17,582
Well, we just had
a great time at
pepe's pizza arcade.

101
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,085
Wasn't that great
when we pretended
to be hamsters,

102
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:23,689
Just running around
through those big
plastic tubes?

103
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,324
No.

104
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:30,196
She's shy.

105
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:32,765
Want to go hang out
with me and tom?

106
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:37,804
It has to be better than
watching a grown man play
in the ball pit for an hour.

107
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:39,805
You know what?
5 minutes of playing,

108
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:42,775
55 minutes of looking
for my wallet.

109
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:45,343
You cannot believe
how many lugies were at
the bottom of that thing.

110
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:46,578
Oh!

111
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,647
And what the hell
am I supposed to do
with this kid?

112
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,114
She doesn't like fun.

113
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:51,613
I took her
to ripley's museum

114
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:53,148
And she didn't have
a good time,

115
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,980
Believe it or not.

116
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:58,149
Well, she could hang out
with tom and louise

117
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,351
Tomorrow night
at my house, if you
think that'll help.

118
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:02,953
God bless you, woman.
Sure, sure,
it's not a problem.

119
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,588
I'm going car-shopping
without gary for
the first time.

120
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:07,623
Oh.
Have fun getting screwed.

121
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:09,091
Ah!

122
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,627
As long as you're
not part of it,
I'm sure I will.

123
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,897
Hey, come on.
Let's go get a beer.

124
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,766
All right.
Hey, you have

125
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,834
Any luck coming up
with an idea
to charm sasha?

126
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:21,302
Not yet.

127
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:22,803
Well, you are
in luck, sir,

128
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,605
Because I had
a brainstorm.

129
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,106
At pepe's
pizza arcade,

130
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:27,607
I was watching
that purple dog

131
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,008
Who plays the piano
in the band?

132
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,510
Banjo.
No, no,
the purple dog
plays the piano.

133
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:34,379
No, I know he plays the piano.
That's his name--banjo.

134
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:38,049
Well, then he should
play the banjo.
That's ridiculous.

135
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,818
Is that where the
country critter band loses
credibility for you, curtis?

136
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:45,421
Anyway, I'm talking
about the idea
I had--dogs,

137
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:47,023
Specifically
puppies.

138
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,525
My niece had
her 7th birthday,

139
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:50,526
And we threw her
a puppy party.

140
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:51,962
That sounds like it's
for kids, though.

141
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:53,430
Yeah, but that's
where you're wrong.

142
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:54,964
See, the parents
liked it more
than anybody.

143
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:56,432
See, there was
this one puppy--

144
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,000
He would put
his paws over
his eyes

145
00:05:58,001 --> 00:06:00,101
Like he was hiding,
like this.

146
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:04,071
Silly puppy.

147
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:08,642
We can still
see you.

148
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,977
So you think I should do
the puppy party for sasha?

149
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:13,479
You put puppies
in her office
and she walks in,

150
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,315
She will let you
eat breakfast
off her stomach.

151
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:17,816
[indistinct]

152
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:21,219
That's what me
and charlene did
on Sunday.

153
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,221
Yeah, we had
pancakes,

154
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:25,756
French toast,
sausage,

155
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,692
Fruit salad,

156
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:31,695
Almond...,
and she had
sticky buns.

157
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:36,198
That's 'cause the
sugar had gone down
around the sides,

158
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,201
And the sugar was
around her buns
and all,

159
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:40,236
And it got
all entrapped
down there...

160
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:41,737
Gary:
Hey, you know what?

161
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:43,238
I think this puppy party
is really going

162
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,706
To put me over the top
with sasha.

163
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:46,708
Thanks, man.
You're welcome.
Hey, here she comes.

164
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,577
You don't mind if I stand
here and watch the puppies
work their magic, huh?

165
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,078
No, but, look,
don't crowd me, ok?

166
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,580
'cause I don't want her
bumping into you

167
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,115
When she throws her arms
around me to hug me.

168
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,883
My mom called.

169
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,352
They just put
our family dog to sleep.

170
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,820
[crying]

171
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,723
You know, I feel
like I'm crowding you.
I'll see you later.

172
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,926
Oh, I'm just gonna go
in my office and
be alone for a while.

173
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,395
No, no! No, no, no!
Don't go in your office.

174
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,431
Go home.
You've had a very
traumatic day.

175
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,832
Just go home
and take the day off.

176
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,467
No, gary, really.
I really appreciate

177
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,068
You trying
to cheer me up,

178
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,603
I just--I should
start my day.

179
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,037
Ok, don't,
don't.

180
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,105
Ok, before you
open the door
to your office,

181
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,605
Let me just say
I'm sorry.

182
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,073
Maybe many years
from now,

183
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:26,574
We'll look back
on this day
and we'll laugh,

184
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,076
But I'm sure
that won't happen
for quite some time.

185
00:07:28,077 --> 00:07:32,312
Now, if you'll
excuse me, I'll go
pack up my things.

186
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,414
Oh, my god!

187
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:37,383
And you know what?
Balloons were my first idea,

188
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:41,753
And I second-guessed
myself. Always go with
your first instinct.

189
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,588
Who put
these puppies
in my office?

190
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,955
Curtis.

191
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:48,225
This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen in my life!

192
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,726
Curtis had nothing
to do with it.

193
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,695
I put the puppies
in your office.

194
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,697
It's like I'm sad
about bucky,

195
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:56,665
But then I saw
all those puppies,

196
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,700
And, I mean,
how can you be sad
when you got

197
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,235
A little guy like this
in your ear?

198
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:02,770
Well, he's got
to be back by 4:00.

199
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,405
[giggles]

200
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:05,873
Gary, how did you
know to do this?

201
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:08,108
Did you have a sense
about my family dog
or something?

202
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:10,110
Uh, yeah, actually.
I've always had a bit

203
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:12,745
Of a sixth sense
when it comes to animals.

204
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:14,747
For instance, when I saw
the movie "snow dogs,

205
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:17,249
I just sort of knew
that was the end

206
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,484
Of cuba gooding, jr.'s
career.

207
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,753
Gary...

208
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:27,255
You go through
so much trouble
to make me happy.

209
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,223
We should go out.

210
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:30,790
Let me pick you up
at 7:00.

211
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,191
Ok.
All right?

212
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:35,226
[giggles]
now grab a dust pan
and a plastic bag

213
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:38,429
'cause it's
ankle-deep in here.

214
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:41,498
Curtis: See?

215
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:43,466
All I did was change
this 11 to a 14,

216
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:46,001
And this
once-expired coupon
is now our ticket

217
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:49,372
To a tasty tray
of mongolian beef.

218
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:51,208
But there's no 14th month.

219
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,810
Are you hungry?

220
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,848
Yes.
Then don't
piss me off.

221
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,854
What are you doing,
michaela?

222
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,522
I'm going to a party.
You guys should come.

223
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,189
It's at this
rich kid's house.

224
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,324
Really?

225
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,959
All the cool people
will be there.

226
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,327
Oh.

227
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:14,531
[sighs]
I knew it sounded
too good to be true.

228
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:16,566
Tom and I aren't cool.
Well, hey,

229
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:20,636
If I'm not cool,
then how come I threw away
my spongebob pajamas?

230
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:24,539
Besides, if we went,
we'd get in huge trouble.

231
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,541
You guys are
divorce kids like me,

232
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,609
So if we get in trouble,
just blame it on that.

233
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,078
You just look at them
with sad eyes and say,

234
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,014
"you don't know how hard
it is being a child
of divorce."

235
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,350
My god, that's genius.

236
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,619
How have we not
tried this before?
Ok, I say we go.

237
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,388
Cool. My mom gave me
money for the weekend.
We take the bus.

238
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,822
Ok, let's do it.

239
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:49,059
I'll bring my cello
in case they don't
have music.

240
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,060
They'll have music there.
They'll have everything,

241
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,463
Including a couple
of nerds.

242
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:57,166
Great. We'll have someone
to make fun of.

243
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:03,037
Ok.

244
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:05,039
All right.

245
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,508
Sorry I took so long
with the sodas.

246
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,077
The guy tried
to hand it to me before
the foam went down.

247
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,011
It's not my first rodeo.

248
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,013
I liked how you also
made him mush down
the popcorn

249
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,015
With the scoop
so you could get
more in.

250
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,083
You're damn straight.
If I want air,
I'll breathe.

251
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,018
[giggles]

252
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,554
You know, we could
have gone to a movie
you hadn't seen yet.

253
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,522
No. You know,
I really liked it,

254
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,991
And I know how much
you wanted to--
"d"--ben affleck!

255
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:29,527
Sorry. It's all right.
I love the movie quiz.

256
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,062
Yeah, I don't think
you're supposed to shout
out the answers, though.

257
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,098
And if you do, shout
them out correctly.
It's "c"--linda hunt.

258
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:36,599
No.

259
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,101
[cell phone vibrates]

260
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:41,069
Who's this?

261
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,071
Mm-mmm.
Don't think so.

262
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:45,039
That's my ex-wife allison
trying to call me,

263
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,608
But I'm not answering
because tonight is
all about you

264
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:49,509
And you are my priority.

265
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,512
[cell phone vibrates]
oh, gosh.

266
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:55,914
Leave me alone,
allison.

267
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:58,183
Now, gary, it might
be an emergency.

268
00:10:58,184 --> 00:11:01,319
[cell phone vibrates]

269
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,820
What?

270
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,354
Gary, where are you?

271
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,589
I can't talk right now.
I'm on a date.

272
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,625
Tell your date
he's gonna have to watch
the movie by himself.

273
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:12,660
You have to get down
to the car dealership
to co-sign for my car.

274
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:14,695
Why?
Because my credit
is screwed up

275
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,696
Because you rented a movie
3 years ago on my card

276
00:11:16,697 --> 00:11:19,098
And you never returned it.
Now get down here.

277
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:22,735
This has to happen tonight.
I already turned in my car
and agreed on a price.

278
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:25,305
Why would you agree
on a price if you just
got to the dealership?

279
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:26,773
It doesn't even--

280
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:28,808
You know what, allison?
Sorry.

281
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:31,276
I'm not getting involved.

282
00:11:36,548 --> 00:11:38,049
Heh!
Are you ok?

283
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,551
Yeah. What?
Oh, I'm good.

284
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,085
I'm--I'm fine.
Ok.

285
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:44,020
Yeah. Just...

286
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:46,022
She's only been
at the dealership
for a half-hour and she said

287
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,557
She agreed on a price,
which means she probably
got taken advantage of

288
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:51,026
Which I don't understand,
consider--you know what?

289
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:54,529
Forget it. I'm ok.
I don't even want to talk
about that stuff anymore.

290
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,099
I just want to concentrate
on you and me and the
great time we're gonna have.

291
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,501
[straw squeaking]

292
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:03,469
Ok, gary, why don't
you just go?

293
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,471
I feel like
I'm sitting next
to robin williams.

294
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:07,006
You want me to go?
You know what?
Listen,

295
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,540
It's just gonna take
a little while.

296
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,075
Go quick, come back,
we'll go to dinner.

297
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:12,077
Ok. Then we go to dinner
when I come back.
Absolutely.

298
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,111
You sure?
Yes.

299
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,113
Oh, you're the best.

300
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:17,281
Eric stoltz!

301
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:19,216
Gary, the movie quiz
is over.

302
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:22,952
No, that guy
looks just like
eric stoltz.

303
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,563
Ah! Here is my co-signor.

304
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:30,699
All right.
What's going on?
I'm in a hurry.

305
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,434
Well, we have
a little
problem.

306
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,434
You got a big problem.
A bear escaped from
the zoo, and he's standing

307
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:38,801
Outside your dealership
holding a sign that says
"0% financing."

308
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,802
What's the credit issue
there, handsome?

309
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,404
Ok, look, you rented
the movie "strange brew"

310
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:44,406
On my mastercard
and never returned it.

311
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:46,040
It went to
a collection agency.

312
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,041
How do you know
I rented it?

313
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:49,010
Well, it's a movie
about a guy

314
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:51,045
Who gets locked
in a beer vat
and avoids drowning

315
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:54,015
By drinking the beer
as it gushes in.

316
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,417
That's just one scene.
That's not what
the movie's about.

317
00:12:56,418 --> 00:12:58,419
Ok, gary, thank you.

318
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,088
I was really looking
forward to buying
a car on my own

319
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,257
For the first time,
and you wrecked it.

320
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:05,225
Look, if you just sign
this form,

321
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:07,926
Allison will get her car
and you can be
on your way.

322
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:11,094
Fine. I'm on a date anyway.
I got to get out of here.

323
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,661
Isn't this
a little high?

324
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:14,096
Gary, just sign the form.

325
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:16,098
This is, like, $1,500
over the sticker

326
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,699
And you only got
the standard package.

327
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,467
We're not buying the car
at this price. No.

328
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:20,935
Well, you're right.

329
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:22,936
We are not buying
the car.

330
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:24,937
She is.
Oh, ok.

331
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,905
She is my ex-wife,
who I pay alimony to,

332
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,276
So if she makes a poor
financial decision,
it affects I.

333
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:33,278
Ok, you know what?
Gary, this is my deal,
all right?

334
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,881
I accept
full responsibility,
ok? Just sign it.

335
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,382
I don't know.
Extended warranty?

336
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:39,884
The car already comes
with a warranty.

337
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,318
You don't need that.
Take it off.

338
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:42,786
Well, what if
the engine blows

339
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:45,254
After the factory
warranty expires?
Allison: Yeah.

340
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:47,822
You just told me you're
gonna sell a product where
the engine's gonna blow?

341
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:48,923
No.
All right.

342
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,325
Then take it off.
We don't need it.

343
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:51,359
But it could blow.

344
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,494
But it won't.

345
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,030
You never know.
Sometimes they blow.

346
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,598
All right,
do me a favor.
Take it off...

347
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,499
Wait. Gary? Gary?

348
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Gary, just sign
the paper!

349
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:00,468
Please sign
the paper, gary!

350
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:03,003
Allison was doing
just fine before
you got here.

351
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:04,504
Maybe you should
sign the paper

352
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,472
And get on
with your evening.

353
00:14:06,473 --> 00:14:09,007
That's what the priest
said and I wound up
with this clunker.

354
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:10,975
Let me tell you
something.

355
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:14,045
The air bags broke
the second I took it
off the lot.

356
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:16,647
Maybe the air bags
didn't work

357
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,816
'cause you never hit
anything hard enough.

358
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,820
[dance music playing]

359
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:34,763
This is so great.

360
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:36,131
We should've
started breaking rules

361
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:37,299
A long time ago.

362
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,833
I know.
I'm on my fifth
root beer.

363
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,335
I can't even describe
the feeling.

364
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:42,103
Ha. Ha. Ha.

365
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:44,405
I told you guys
there was nothing
to worry about.

366
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:49,009
I like your crutches.
You wanna dance?

367
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,142
Yeah. Ok.
Oh, right here.

368
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,742
Yeah. Well.
Ha ha.

369
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:53,911
[dance music playing]

370
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:58,381
Uh-oh.

371
00:14:58,382 --> 00:14:59,715
What? Who are
those people?

372
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:01,216
They're friends
of the brother
of the kid

373
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:02,851
Who's having
this party.

374
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,285
I can't believe
they're here.

375
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,553
Because they're
so much older?

376
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:08,288
No. Because
I thought they were
still in juvie.

377
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:11,091
Don't worry. If any
of those kids

378
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,359
Try to mess with
you, I'll cut them.

379
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,527
Oh, wow.
I believe you.
Ha ha.

380
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:22,200
Sir, I have checked
with the manager now
5 times.

381
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:25,035
This is the only
price he is going
to approve.

382
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:26,503
All right,
I want to talk
to the bear.

383
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:27,504
Is the bear around?

384
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:29,405
Gary. Gary!

385
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,440
Gary, for god's sake,
just sign the paper.

386
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:33,475
Look, look, you have
ruined my credit.

387
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:35,077
I can ignore that,
all right?

388
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:37,178
But I don't care if
I'm paying too much

389
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:39,080
And I don't want
power-assisted brakes,

390
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,882
Because after
we're done here,

391
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:42,583
I don't want anything
to keep me

392
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:45,485
From running your ass
over, all right?

393
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,920
Ok, so just
sign the paper

394
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:48,387
Before I lose
my mind completely.

395
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:50,522
Can you do that
for me, please, gary?

396
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:51,823
Fine.
Good.

397
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:53,091
Getting a little
excited over it.

398
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,259
Uhh.

399
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,165
Thank you.
Good-bye.

400
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:03,368
Uh, mr. Hosenballs?

401
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:09,006
You...You forgot
to date this.

402
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:10,407
Gary?

403
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:12,509
Allison, I'm just
trying to get you
the best deal possible.

404
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,810
I left a date
with a beautiful woman
to do that.

405
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,078
Don't you understand that?

406
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,379
You know what I think?

407
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,180
I think you're still
in love with me.

408
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:21,514
Ha ha ha.
Wait, what?
Yeah.

409
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:23,916
Why else would you
leave your date

410
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,417
With a beautiful,
young woman

411
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,585
To spend two hours
haggling to get your
beloved ex-wife

412
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,653
A good deal
on her new car?

413
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:32,690
I've been here
two hours?
Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,360
It's quarter after 10.

415
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,463
I gotta tell you, gary,
it's downright romantic.

416
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:37,731
Thank you, sweetheart.

417
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:41,568
Oh, my gosh.
I gotta get out of here.

418
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,103
All right.
Can I sign next to it

419
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:46,171
Or do I need to
initial the hosenballs?

420
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,706
Ok, roger.
It's your turn
in the bear suit

421
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,675
I'm in the middle
of a deal, carl.

422
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:54,644
[dance music playing]

423
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,216
Chris, chris,
over here.
Over here.

424
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:02,484
All right,
this is not cool.

425
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:04,218
You kids blew it.

426
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:07,156
I'm glad you called.
Where's michaela?

427
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,459
Hey, michaela.

428
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,227
Get your stuff.
You're leaving right now.

429
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:12,795
I'm just trying
to have some fun.

430
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:14,196
You're not my dad.
You don't know
how hard

431
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,964
It is being
a child of divorce.

432
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,232
You know what?
I may not be your dad

433
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,767
But I'm the guy who's
in charge of you tonight,

434
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:20,402
So you can cut
the divorced parents crap.

435
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:22,036
I'm not buying it.

436
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,971
She wants to stay.

437
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,406
Why don't you
cool out, old dude?

438
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:28,041
You know what?
I think you need
to step back, chump,

439
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,042
Unless you want
your homies here

440
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,276
To see you get
your ass kicked

441
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:32,345
By the guy
who played tevye in
the alhambra playhouse

442
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:33,813
Production of
"fiddler on the roof."

443
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,851
Let's go. Now.

444
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,031
I gotta give my friends
a ride home, so...

445
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,267
[kiss]

446
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:01,936
Later.

447
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,443
Later.

448
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:24,888
Sasha. Look,
I know you said
on the phone

449
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:26,122
Not to come over
and apologize,

450
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:27,724
But I have to because
everything I said

451
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:29,859
Wouldn't happen, happened,
and it's all my fault.

452
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Gary, it's
no one's fault.

453
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,895
Look, you are
a great guy.

454
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:36,164
It's just I've always
had this vision

455
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,065
Of what a relationship
should look like,

456
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:41,134
And it doesn't look like
me sharing my popcorn

457
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:43,535
With a large
latina woman.

458
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:44,536
I can't let
this night end

459
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:45,937
Without doing
something right, ok?

460
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:47,005
So, do me a favor.

461
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:48,708
Why don't you just
come with me to my house

462
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,744
And let me
show you something?

463
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,079
Ha. I have fallen
for that before, gary.

464
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,548
So, no. Thank you.

465
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,017
Come on.
How about just
a nice cup of coffee?

466
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,052
We'll get a cup
of coffee.

467
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,420
It's chock full o' gary.
Come on.

468
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:01,487
I don't know.

469
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,189
What could be better
than a hot cup of coffee

470
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,623
On a cold
winter's night?

471
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:07,525
What are you
talking about?
It's 75 degrees outside.

472
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,261
Is it?

473
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:13,062
I know you said
you missed the seasons,

474
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:15,098
So I figured maybe
just for tonight,

475
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,900
I could bring
the seasons to you.

476
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:21,905
Oh, my god.

477
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:26,643
I've had
the air conditioner
cranked all day.

478
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:33,650
I wasn't sure
what your religion was,

479
00:19:33,651 --> 00:19:35,184
So I just hedged my bets.

480
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,353
Gary, I--this is
the sweetest thing

481
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:44,256
Anyone has ever
done for me.

482
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:46,024
Don't forget
your sweater.

483
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:50,795
There you go.
Ha ha.

484
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:54,898
You know when I said
I have a vision

485
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:57,533
Of what I want
a relationship
to look like?

486
00:19:58,368 --> 00:19:59,869
This is it.

487
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,236
Huh.

488
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:02,404
Ha ha.

489
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:07,675
[kiss]

490
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:13,731
Did we rock it out
tonight or what?
You're a rebel.

491
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:14,965
You're a rebel.
You kissed that girl

492
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:16,166
Right in front of
her boyfriend!

493
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,735
Oh, yeah.
More marshmallows?

494
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:23,240
Ok. Would you two
like to tell me

495
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,708
What you guys were
thinking tonight?

496
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,142
It wasn't our fault.
We don't want--

497
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,844
We're children
of divorce.

498
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:32,749
What? No.
You left your bicycles

499
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,117
In the middle
of the driveway

500
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:36,586
And I almost ran them over
and scratched my new car.

501
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:38,989
Could you be a little more
responsible next time, please?

502
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,257
Mwah.
We will.

503
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:42,359
All right? Ok.
Yeah.

504
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,527
What's that smell?
Perfume?

505
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:45,427
Oh, I was just
trying something.

506
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,960
All right, well,
don't stay up
too late, guys.

507
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,660
Ok.
Good night.

508
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:52,995
You're dangerous.

509
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:54,729
You're dangerous.
Ha.
